# Updated transcribe_client.py - Improvements Summary

## ✅ Client File Updated Successfully

The `transcribe_client.py` file has been updated to work seamlessly with the improved server, incorporating all the concurrency and resilience improvements.

## Key Improvements Made:

### 1. **Enhanced Retry Logic**
- Increased max retries from 3 to 5 for better resilience
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter (prevents thundering herd)
- Different backoff strategies for different error types:
  - Client disconnects (499): 2^n seconds (up to 30s)
  - Server overload (503): 5 * 2^n seconds (up to 60s) 
  - Server errors (5xx): 3 * 2^n seconds (up to 45s)
  - Network errors: 3 * 2^n seconds with jitter

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Specific handling for status code 499 (client disconnect)
- Specific handling for status code 503 (server overload/memory pressure)
- Separate handling for server errors (5xx) vs client errors (4xx)
- No retry for 400 Bad Request errors (they won't succeed)

### 3. **Improved Connection Management**
```python
# New robust HTTP client configuration:
transport = httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(
    retries=0,  # We handle retries ourselves
    limits=httpx.Limits(
        max_keepalive_connections=10,
        max_connections=20,
        keepalive_expiry=30.0
    )
)

# Better timeout configuration
timeout=httpx.Timeout(total=1800, connect=30, read=60, write=60)
```

### 4. **Enhanced Timeout Configuration**
- Separate timeouts for connect, read, and write operations
- Prevents hanging connections
- Better handling of slow network conditions

### 5. **Connection Error Handling**
- Separate handling for `ConnectError` and `TimeoutException`
- Longer backoff periods for connection issues
- Better logging of connection problems

## Benefits of These Updates:

1. **Resilience to Server Overload**: When server reports memory pressure (503), client backs off aggressively
2. **Handles Transient Failures**: Exponential backoff ensures temporary issues don't cause permanent failures
3. **Prevents Connection Exhaustion**: Limited connection pool prevents overwhelming the server
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows exact error types and retry attempts
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Different retry strategies based on error type

## Usage Remains the Same:

```bash
# Process files with automatic retry and error handling
python transcribe_client.py /path/to/audio /path/to/output --server http://your-server:8080

# With debug logging to see retry behavior
python transcribe_client.py /path/to/audio /path/to/output --debug

# Limit concurrent workers if needed
python transcribe_client.py /path/to/audio /path/to/output --max-concurrent 4
```

## Expected Behavior:

With these updates, the client will:
- ✅ Automatically retry on server overload (503) with longer backoff
- ✅ Handle client disconnects (499) gracefully
- ✅ Retry server errors with exponential backoff
- ✅ Skip retries for permanent errors (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Maintain stable connections with keepalive
- ✅ Prevent connection pool exhaustion

## Error Scenarios Handled:

1. **Server Memory Pressure**: Client receives 503, backs off 5-60 seconds
2. **Client Disconnect**: Client receives 499, retries with exponential backoff
3. **Server Error**: Client receives 5xx, retries up to 5 times
4. **Network Timeout**: Connection times out, retries with longer delays
5. **Connection Lost**: TCP connection drops, retries with backoff

The client is now fully compatible with the improved server and will handle all the concurrency scenarios gracefully!
