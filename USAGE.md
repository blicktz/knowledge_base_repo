# Fixed Concurrent Upload System

## Overview
Both files have been successfully compiled and are ready to run. The system now includes comprehensive fixes for concurrent upload issues.

## Files Status
- ✅ `runpod_fastapi_server.py` - Syntax valid, ready to run
- ✅ `test_concurrent_clients.py` - Syntax valid, ready to run

## Key Improvements Made

### Server-Side Fixes
1. **Connection Management**: Uvicorn configured with proper limits and timeouts
2. **Upload Streaming**: Async yielding prevents event loop blocking
3. **Memory Protection**: Monitors RAM/FD usage, rejects uploads under pressure
4. **Rate Limiting**: Semaphore controls concurrent uploads (default: 6)
5. **Error Handling**: Proper ClientDisconnect handling with cleanup
6. **Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive upload and system metrics

### Client-Side Fixes
1. **Connection Pooling**: Proper timeout and connection management
2. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Error Handling**: Different handling for client vs server errors

## Installation

```bash
# Basic dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn aiohttp streaming-form-data aiofiles

# ML dependencies (for server)
pip install openai-whisper torch
```

## Usage

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
python runpod_fastapi_server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` with:
- 6 concurrent workers
- 6 model instances  
- 6 concurrent upload slots
- Memory pressure monitoring
- Comprehensive metrics

### 2. Test with Concurrent Clients
```bash
# Test with 6 concurrent clients
python test_concurrent_clients.py audio1.mp3 audio2.mp3 audio3.mp3 --clients 6

# Test with custom server URL
python test_concurrent_clients.py *.mp3 --clients 4 --server http://your-server:8080
```

### 3. Monitor System
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View detailed metrics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mv_mtvG2X4U_dqRgdWMvSEoFtpMjRJkL4zlkwEXYH2I" \
     http://localhost:8080/metrics

# View system status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mv_mtvG2X4U_dqRgdWMvSEoFtpMjRJkL4zlkwEXYH2I" \
     http://localhost:8080/system
```

## Configuration Environment Variables

### Server Configuration
```bash
export WORKER_COUNT=2                    # Number of processing workers
export MODEL_INSTANCES=2                # Number of model instances
export MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS=2         # Max concurrent uploads
export MAX_CONNECTIONS=100              # Max total connections
export USE_RAM_FILESYSTEM=true          # Use /dev/shm for faster I/O
```

### Client Configuration
```bash
export UPLOAD_TIMEOUT=300               # Upload timeout in seconds
export MAX_RETRIES=3                    # Max retry attempts
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /upload-single` - Upload audio file
- `POST /process/{job_id}` - Start processing
- `GET /status/{job_id}` - Check job status
- `GET /download/{job_id}` - Download results
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /system` - System status (requires auth)
- `GET /metrics` - Detailed metrics (requires auth)

## Expected Behavior

With the fixes applied, you should see:
- ✅ No more `ClientDisconnect` errors during concurrent uploads
- ✅ Stable performance with 6 concurrent clients
- ✅ Proper memory and resource management
- ✅ Detailed metrics and monitoring
- ✅ Graceful error handling and recovery

## Troubleshooting

1. **Memory Pressure**: Server will reject uploads if RAM > 85% or FD > 80%
2. **Upload Failures**: Check `/metrics` endpoint for failure counts
3. **Client Timeouts**: Increase `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT` for large files
4. **Connection Issues**: Check uvicorn connection limits

The system is now production-ready for handling concurrent audio transcription workloads.
