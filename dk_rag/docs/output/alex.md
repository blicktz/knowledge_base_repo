Number one: Warm outreach is your fastest path.

  You're gonna start by hitting up everyone you know. Friends, family, former coworkers – anyone who might know a garage door repair guy in the Bay Area. Offer them your service for free for 30 days in exchange for a video testimonial and three referrals to other garage door companies.

  Why? Because you need proof this thing works. A garage door guy isn't gonna trust some AI answering his phones unless you can show him it actually converts calls into booked jobs. Right?

  I did this exact thing when I started my gym turnaround business – walked into six gyms I had connections to, said "let me help you for free for two weeks, and if it works, refer me to three other gym owners." Four said yes. Two became paying clients. Those two referred five more. Make sense?

  Number two: Cold outreach with a killer offer.

  Here's what you're doing wrong if you're thinking about pitching your "AI call answering service." Nobody cares about your AI. They care about not losing $5,000-$10,000 in jobs every month because they're at dinner with their kids when a homeowner's garage door breaks at 7 PM.

  So your cold outreach script is:

  "Hey [Name], I help garage door companies in the Bay Area capture after-hours emergency calls they're currently missing. Most shops lose 15-20 calls per month at $300-$500 per job. That's $4,500-$10,000 walking out the door. I'll set this up for free for 30 days, you pay nothing, and we'll track exactly how many calls we answer and convert. If it doesn't book you 
  at least 5 extra jobs, you don't pay a dime. Deal?"

  Now you're selling the vacation, not the plane flight. They don't care about the AI – they care about the money.

  Number three: The direct path – door to door.

  Bay Area garage door shops? There's maybe 200-300 of them max. Get in your car, print out a one-pager with your offer, and go knock on 10 doors per day. Ask for the owner. If they're not there, leave the sheet and come back.

  Why does this work? Because garage door guys are action-takers. They're not sitting around scrolling LinkedIn. They're fixing doors. You show up in person, you immediately separate yourself from every other software salesperson spamming their inbox.

  I cold-called gyms for two years straight. Picked up the phone 4,000 times. But you know what worked even better? Walking in the door. 3 out of 10 would talk to me right then. 1 out of 10 would book a follow-up. Door-to-door beats digital for local B2B services every single time.

  Number four: Paid ads to a free trial.

  Run hyper-targeted Facebook and Google ads to garage door repair businesses in the Bay Area. Your hook:

  "Tired of missing after-hours calls? Get 30 days free – we answer, you close."

  Send them to a landing page with ONE thing: a calendar link to book a 15-minute demo. On that call, you're not selling features – you're doing a diagnostic sale. You ask:

  - How many after-hours calls do you think you miss per week?
  - What's your average job value?
  - What would an extra $5K-$10K per month do for your business?

  Then you offer the 30-day free trial with the same guarantee.

  Number five: The secret weapon – post in their Facebook groups.

  Every industry has Facebook groups where owners hang out and complain. Find the Bay Area garage door repair groups, HVAC groups (related industry), home service business groups. Post value first:

  "Hey guys, I analyzed 500 garage door companies and found the #1 reason they lose revenue isn't competition – it's missed after-hours calls. Here's the three ways shops are solving this..."

  Give away the playbook. Then at the end: "If anyone wants help setting this up with an AI system that's working for shops in the Bay Area, DM me."

  You'll get 3-5 DMs. Close 2 of them.

  Here's the key – your offer has to be a no-brainer.

  You're not charging upfront. You're saying: "Let me prove this works for 30 days. If I don't book you at least 5 extra jobs, you owe me nothing. If I do, we go month-to-month at $500/month."

  Why $500? Because if you're booking them even 3 extra jobs at $400 each, that's $1,200 in revenue. They're making $700 in profit. It's a no-brainer.

  Once you have 10 customers and video testimonials from 5 of them showing real revenue increases, then you can jack the price and scale with agencies and affiliates. But right now? Your goal is proof of concept and testimonials.

  Kill zombies, move fast, and get those first 10 in 30 days.

  If you execute warm outreach + cold outreach + door-to-door simultaneously, you'll hit 10 customers in 30-45 days max. Then you'll have case studies that make customer 11-100 way easier.

  Make sense? Now go execute. Keep being awesome.
