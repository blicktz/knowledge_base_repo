Okay, last question before we move on to the next startup idea. Biggest thing you learned from Mark Zuckerberg shadowing him for hundreds of hours? This is the key to what makes him so unique. So the fact that he is this extreme humility and amazing self-awareness. So he knows when he doesn't know something and he doesn't just go in to learn it, he gives himself or he used to, and I'm not close to him anymore, but he would really put himself in a position of extreme humility and he had no ego in the fact of, oh, I don't know this thing.

I have to posture like I know it. He'd be like, I don't know this thing and it's vital. And I learned this firsthand because.

Okay, we got Sarah Lacey on the pod. She's an idea machine and I was emailing her before this. I was like, come with ideas.

I'll give you 30 minutes. And she's like, I don't need 30 minutes. I'll see you there in a few.

So thank you, Sarah, for coming on the pod and sharing some of your ideas with us. It is my pleasure. It's really anyone who has built several companies knows like the fun part is coming up with ideas. Like we can all come up with ideas.

Like the shitty part is actually trying to build them. So I am fortunately at a stage in my career where I can just come up with ideas. All right.

Should we get into it? Let's go. So where do you want to start?

Do you want me to just pitch you my ideas? Is that how this works? Yeah, you share your ideas and I will.

Yeah, we can just talk about if we like it. We don't like it. How we'd start it.

I love it. All right. So I was thinking about this.

My last startup that I did, which had a lot of successful startups always have these near death experiences. I think I had near generational wealth, huge success with it and always would just grab the defeat out of the jaws of victory. But it was this company called Chairman Me. It was started as Chairman Mom.

And we went on a lot of sort of pivots and iterations. The part of the company that I loved the most was during the pandemic, when women were really stuck at home and employee resource groups, which had really worked to boost women and give them solidarity and ways to get ahead. Those were kind of gone because everyone was working from home.

We started doing these really functional, really effective online courses for women. And we just nailed how to do online courses. We had 90% completion rates, whereas online courses usually have 5% completion rates.

And we taught really tactical things by the best people in the world. So we had this course on negotiation taught by this coach who used the scientifically proven way to negotiate without a gender backlash and on average got people 30% increases in salaries. They were really like Navy SEALs of courses to get women to the next level.

They worked. They had huge results. Sounds great, right?

Do you know why that company failed? Because every day I had to do battle with women's internalized misogyny. And it was like I was falling into a pit wrestling with Gandalf.

It was I couldn't do it. And that was ultimately why the company failed because women did not. They've been so emotionally beaten up and conditioned by them that they didn't deserve to have more.

It was I mean, we we changed tens of thousands of women's lives, but I couldn't reach millions of women's. I could not convince them their lives could be better. They could have more money.

And it was terrible. But that's the reality. So I give all that as a preamble because I think what someone should do is build an equivalent for tween girls because right when girls go into adolescence is when they start losing their confidence.

And there's all these studies about this. Actually always the the tampon and pad company did a commercial about this for Super Bowl one year. And it was like this run like a girl campaign.

People should Google this if they haven't seen it because it's stunning. They ask like little girls. Well first they asked like older girls post adolescence what it's like to run like a girl.

And they're like everyone's like making fun of girls and stuff. They ask young girls running all out and they're badass. And like it is a drop off in confidence and belief in yourself right when you hit adolescence.

That's when the internalized misogyny starts. I think if we could have a program in school that's like a pre MBA entrepreneurship confidence program not STEM because STEM is great. But that doesn't teach you how to negotiate how to have self-worth how to ideate.

But if you had that in schools before they hit the confidence rock bottom I think in a generation it would transform female leadership. And I think it's one of those things that I guarantee you in 20 or 30 years whenever people would be like interviewing you know the Fortune 500 female CEO and they'd say how did you get there. They'd be like well I did this program when I was in sixth grade.

People say the Girl Scouts you know help teach entrepreneurship but like really like families go through it and they're like it's just it's just a marketing scheme. It's just a pyramid scheme. I think there's really cool ways that you could teach a lot of these fundamentals to kids then you could also even partner with local businesses to have a lot of this stuff in the wild.

Now a lot of schools do entrepreneurship clubs. They're taught by teachers or they're taught by a parent who comes in. They're not curriculum rich.

They're not saying hey here's where you're going to stumble and here's where you're going to work through it. And the reason I'm so confident in this is because in the pandemic when we were building all these courses and I was filming a lot of them in my home editing them doing a lot of office hours with these like world renowned instructors it was during lockdown. So like my kids were home and they were they were a little bit young now they're 11 and 13 but I mean they learned amazing negotiation skills.

They learned amazing executive function just by kind of being in the room and absorbing these things and asking me follow up questions. And now you know we own a bookstore in downtown Palm Springs which we kind of we live here part of the year and there's no bookstore. So our family opened one and both of my girls have a business within the bookstore.

My youngest daughter makes these good luck pom pom monsters. And if you buy $50 in books you get one for free. And then my older daughter makes these pride cranes origami cranes.

And if you spend I think $30 you get one for free. And I'm telling you people come in this store and they will grab an extra book to get one of those two items they sell out in like two days. So I pay them like a dollar a monster or I think a dollar 50 crane.

My kids have like I would be regularly giving them $80 and it is not pity money. The store is 100 percent made money. And so we look at supplies we look at chains.

There's small businesses all over America who would be willing to sell friendship bracelets baked goods cards all kinds of things kids could be making. So that's idea number one. Shh don't tell anyone.

But I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free. These aren't just random guesses they're validated concepts from entrepreneurs who've built 100 million dollars plus businesses. I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast.

But the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor. Some cost nothing to start. I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet.

The idea bank is your startup shortcut. Just click below to get access. Your next cash flowing business is waiting for you.

Essentially what I've failed to build for women for tween girls. So your vision of this is it like an online thing. Is it an in-person thing.

Like how does it how does it look like. Well I think the most scalable way to do it would be to do it as an online thing but something that happens in the schools. Most schools now are actually like using a lot of technical tools whether it's Khan Academy or other curriculums like it's pretty common right now that there's private school curriculums that teachers are basically following a framework pressing play on. There's a lot of STEM curriculums like this.

So I think you would slot into that model. OK cool. So yeah I think the way I think that makes sense.

I think I would do it online like you put out the content online but the challenges happen IRL in schools. So for example my elementary school for you know for boys and girls we were in order to teach entrepreneurship what they did and charity. What they did was they handed us a bag of 20 chocolate bars and and said you need to sell these chocolate bars and each chocolate bar was two dollars each.

The catch was we had to sign a paper that said we owe the school 40 40 dollars. So all of a sudden as a kid I'm like oh my god I'm in debt 40 dollars. It's such a horrible feeling and you know you hated it but you learned a lot around like OK.

Debt is not good. OK now I need to sell this thing. How am I going to sell this.

And then there were some support structures around how to sell certain things and then the money went to charity as well. So that could be an example of like I can imagine like a monthly challenge like that so that people can go out in the world and learn as well. But let me let me tell you the problem with that method in today's world.

And I say this as someone whose kid was just given 20 raffle tickets that she has to sell. So we're in debt 200 dollars if we don't sell these things. And so what's happening.

Well in 20 24 my 13 year old is not going to go door to door selling things. That doesn't work. It doesn't work. Why does it not work.

First of all people don't know their neighbors in the same way they used to. Also we have ring doorbells. People don't answer their doors if they don't know who it is and they don't come.

A lot of people don't have doorbells like we're not built for a world where kids can go door to door selling stuff. And so then what happens. One of two things either the kid has parents like me who.

And by the way by the end of this episode I will sell you a raffle ticket. You could win a rap for. So you have someone like me who pings a bunch of people and is like hey Eli's to sell these raffle tickets or I just had the idea today.

I'm actually going to make her do a sales pitch on video and then I'm going to text it to our neighbors because I think they would love to do this but they're not going to answer their door. And so that's not really teaching her anything is it. That's just me being forced to handhold because otherwise I'm just buying the tickets because where else is she going to sell them.

You always see kids walking into like around malls or something and shopkeepers that they consider loitering they shove them away. So it's like you know what are you supposed to do. And I also think in the best of times all that does is teach kids sales and starting a business is a lot more than sales.

I think some of the most creative parts of starting a business are thinking about the product. I mean obviously you agree because that's the whole point of your podcast but like ideating like what does this look. Did you find product market fit.

What did you do wrong. How do you pitch this to investors. There's so many pieces of this that are not sales. And like I think sales is great because sales is like the number one thing that women sort of get socialized out of.

Like there's there's so much talk about not enough women going into engineering. Women in sales is even more of a desert because there's all kinds of gender dynamics there. Only three percent less than three percent of female founded businesses ever do a million dollars in revenue which I think is due to the socialization against sales.

So like I'm all for sales but I don't think it's the only skill and I don't think a world we grew up in exists anymore. Yeah. So I think that's a really good point around.

On the door to door sales piece like what is the equivalent of door to door sales in 2025. It's probably more like recording a video and posting it online and you know setting up a gum road and learning about how to sell and build a product on the Internet. You know it's it's almost like the startup ideas podcast but for tweens you know.

Totally. Yeah. And ideas that they have are amazing.

I mean we always like the cliche in Silicon Valley is you want to find like the next Mark Zuckerberg who's never held down a job and is this like brilliant young nerd who has a total clean slate. Well like OK let's go even earlier and hear like what tweens want. And I think the sales piece of it is like a of like a typical like growth marketing funnel.

Like these kids are so much better at digital tools than we are. My 13 year old can put any growth marketer to shame with her canvas skills. So like I think do an Instagram campaign do a tick tock campaign do an email marketing funnel like the sales pitch is still coming from you.

But you're learning how to do it. And you know also do that thing where you're like you're you know part of the where I see people who feel awkward about sales and aren't good at sales tend to go wrong. Is like they they send their first email or cold call trying to like close the deal.

And that's not what you're doing. You're trying to close for a conversation. So teaching kids like those fundamentals it that's going to help them in every aspect of life.

Because what are you doing when you're trying to get into college. You're selling. What are you doing when you audition for a role.

You're selling. I mean you're trying to get a summer job. You're selling yourself.

So I think this is something that would like absolutely transform the demographics of the labor market because I'm telling you I spent 30 years as a journalist. And I always ask people you know when they got interested in starting their own business and I can't tell you how many boys told me about their damn paper route or their yard business. Or about you know their side hustle they did or you know stories like Tony Hsieh selling pizza for a dollar.

This is something that male CEOs and male entrepreneurs have always been doing. But we don't the equivalent for the girls is they're selling you know pyramid scheme chocolate bars for the Girl Scouts and setting up a stand with you know a little uniform and a required skirt on. Like I think we can do better for girls.

Yeah. And I think we can do better for everyone is you know I think. I think the boys would be jealous.

Yeah exactly. So and there's no reason it should be gender binary but honestly like I were starting it my go to market would be initially for girls because I think that's the pain point. And I think you know I've just I've learned one thing I've learned the hard way with entrepreneurship is like the riches are in the niches.

We always think by by narrowing something that we're restricting but we're not. Like how many people shop at Forever 21 who are not 21. We you know by being super specific I think you speak really directly to someone and then you know other people will want to be part of it.

Like when we started Chairman Mom from day one 30 percent of our customers were not moms. Like it never precludes people if they want that thing. And I think it's it's in such a clear value of what it is.

So I actually probably would start it aimed at girls but you know like the Girl Scouts or whatever else say like it's open to everyone and you know and not discriminate. But I think there's I bet there is public money you could get from public schools to roll this out and it would be a guaranteed revenue stream. You know that any elite boarding schools or private schools there is a dad who would write a check for that thing if their daughter was getting a heads up on entrepreneurship.

I think you'd make a ton more money than I made trying to sell it to corporate women. Sadly I was just doing some quick googling like Girl Scouts. There's a Billy does.

Wow. They do over a billion dollars a year in revenue. They make more money than Oreo makes.

That's amazing. And this cookies aren't even around all year all year long. It's crazy. That's crazy.

Yeah. But so so I'm in on this idea. I'm in like I think I think it's a great one.

I think it would work. I think it resonates. I think the why now is here.

Also you would get magazine cover stories about it because of the issues with girls because of the things they could be doing. You could do an annual like you know demo day and all of these communities that everyone feel great about sponsoring and coming to. I mean it's just one of those feel good things people want to be a part of.

And it's it's where people could like they people could virtue virtue signal and still actually meaningfully support young women at the same time. So the only thing that challenges me on this idea is the funding piece of it. You know it's like you just said the Girl Scouts does a billion dollars.

I don't think there's any issue with the funding piece of it. I think you have so many comps. You have so many comps in companies like everyone from Black Bod to like all kinds of like private curriculums that sell into schools.

The reality is not even just public schools. One of my daughters goes to Catholic school and like they don't have the budgets for custom curriculum. So what the teachers are doing is buying private curriculum and teaching it in the classes.

I think there is actually I think 20 years ago you'd be right. I think now there is such a pathway of getting things into schools and there's so much money and budget for it. Not on you know a maybe a per unit basis but you know there's a lot of schools in the country.

I think what you need though is you need a CEO who's sold into that before. Right. I think you had a CEO who sold into that before has connections there.

I actually think the funding piece of it is like a no brainer. You'd probably do a seed round build it get a proof of concept do one series a and in five years it would go public like snowflake. I think you would need one funding round.

I wonder I also wonder like I'm not a huge fan of cold emailing but I imagine a lot of these teachers like you probably get their email addresses. And if you did a really really tight cold email campaign with like maybe like a selfie video from one of the girls talking about her experience and. And you know just very tight.

I actually bet these people are not getting hit up that much with with high value like value add content that are actually going to make their jobs easier in a lot of ways. Right. They're looking for this stuff aren't they.

Yeah no they absolutely are. And I think that you could have campaigns where you could say either this is what it costs and you make it like as cheap as possible and just go for volume. And then say here's what it costs if the school can't afford that you know we can do a fundraising thing you could even have you could run programs where.

Local businesses or families sponsored it and then part of the costs were paid for by the proceeds I mean you could get really really creative on how to do this because it's software right. You're not hiring a teacher to do this you know you're you know you have like 80 percent gross margins on those online courses. So it's also something that can be done and can be scaled up and down.

You know you can have more support at high and boarding schools where we're facilitating a demo day or making intros to you know people in the community. But you could also do a bare bones version of it for you know inner city schools where it's you know maybe like maybe Nike wants to support it for a thousand schools. I mean I think you could get really creative on how to pay for it and because it's online courses there's also like amazing recurring revenue because once you're in a school and people are getting value it's not going to be ripped out of that school.

In the past I know you've you know because you've you've been in media and you've probably done a lot of sponsorships like do you have any advice for people on how to sell like a Nike like how do you know because people probably hear that and they're like it's so out of reach I don't even know how to do that. Quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boringmarketing.com. So a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google.

The secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition. So for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google. That's why I like SEO and that's why I use boringmarketing.com and that's why I invested in it.

They're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30 day sprint with a hundred percent money back guarantee. Who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boringmarketing.com. You know I think I mean look there are two reasons that I have done been able to do anything that I've done in my career and it's two superpowers that I have.

And the first is networking I meet people constantly I am never too old or too networked to meet more people or really engage in those networks. And you know I think that there is an art to networking that is not standing around at a cocktail party being awkward but building relationships and building relationships with people without an intended thing you want out of it. And I think that in maintaining those relationships over a long time and being there and showing up and being genuinely interested and you know building relationships and networks when you don't need to frankly.

And then tapping them and making asks of them when you do need to and you know I think every piece of that are things that people tend to fail on. You know they don't make networks when they don't need them and then they if they have them they're squeamish while making asks of them whereas if we all you know we love when people we care about ask us for things. Because it makes us feel good and makes us feel like we can ask them a favor in the future.

So I think that's a huge one and I think if you start especially for people in their early 20s start building your network now and it doesn't have to be with the CEO of a company. It can be with someone who's a peer because you all are all going to come up together and then those people are going to wind up being the people who are decision makers in the future. You just don't know who's going to turn into what job and what you're going to need from someone and like.

Pace and point with this idea maybe like right now I mean you know if I'm in my early 20s. Thinking I want to work at a startup maybe I don't think my friend who is going to school to be a superintendent would necessarily be a great contact but, lo and behold here's my startup idea I need to get into schools like. Anyone can be a great contact for you because you don't know who they know and you don't know what they're going to be and you don't know what you're going to wind up building.

So I think that's number one and I think if you've been doing your job and trying to network then I bet you know someone who knows someone senior at Nike I guarantee you I could find someone senior at Nike or connection to them in my network. Number two the second thing that I. Always was really good at it I don't think I realized to later my career how powerful was and why is story I mean one of the best books about story ever written is Lisa Kranz wired for story and it basically breaks down the neuroscience of story and how.

We have been wired since caveman days to respond to story in a way that we are are biologically. Wired to our heart to race blood to rush for to our thighs because we know we're going to have to run away you know think about how often like the you know the downside of this is. When people have anxiety and they're like oh my God I know that it's not rational and it's like yeah it's not rational it's because like your brain is telling your body a story of what's going to happen to you if you set on stage in front of thousands of eyeballs looking at you and have to give a keynote.

So I think that story is the most powerful tool I think it's the reason that most women who raise large amounts of venture capital do not come from a math background but come from a media background. Because it is like the great leveler so I think those two things right you find the right contact and then you put together the right story how is this going to make how is this going to transform Nike. How what heart string are you pulling what you know you mentioned getting a kid in the video I mean I would absolutely do that there was a brilliant marketing campaign for this nonprofit that.

I think does water it helps provide water and they went to this rather than saying this is a huge number of people who go without water. And isn't you know isn't it staggering there's this many people on the earth who don't have fresh water no one cares we don't care about numbers we just don't we too much shit in our own life right. But they told they showed one boy and as a result in this one village like the bulk of kids would not make it to their sixth birthday because of water so they took this one boy in this village.

And they when he was 5 years old took him around the world completing his bucket list because he was going to die at 6 statistically. And it is the most moving three minutes you will ever watch it even if you've seen it even if you know the ending you will still cry. You can't not because it is so designed to grab you in this evolutionary way that we all that we all do and so it's like you do the equivalent of that and like course like he's going to say yes also like.

You build like a marketing campaign with them where they can talk about what they're doing for girls makes everyone at the company feel good maybe the one you know maybe it's like. Like the equivalent of the Ernst and Young entrepreneur of the year award does Nike do the national gala of all of these amazing tiny little 10 and 12 year old badasses who've built these things. And do they you know hold it in New York and give the number one winner like an internship I mean come on there is so much media they get out of that there's so much feel good.

And like how much would it cost like a couple million dollars how many seats could you get with a couple million dollars they could make a massive massive difference. This conversation is reminding me about like the first time I ever went to New York City as like an 18 year old I'm from Canada and. When I was in some of these meetings as like a kid basically and I heard people talk like you were talking it it it shattered you know it shattered my world like it made me realize that thinking big and mindset is such an important part of.

Making things happen. You know we in our minds were always kind of like. A lot of us are like yeah it would be nice to get it I don't know if I can actually close it I don't know if I can actually get their email I don't know if I can actually but you know you're right when you actually like lay it out and you're like okay it's really just story and people.

And it's. Your interest of that right. I mean it's like you know every day what can you do that will be a favor to the future you who's going to be in this position and need to sell Nike who can you meet what can you learn what can you put in place I cannot tell you.

The numbers with both of my startups I was building the numbers of future favors to the future me that I had no idea I was doing in my 20 or 30 20s or 30s that were company changing moments and you know my 30s or 40s. Before we move on to the next idea because I need to hear your next idea because you're a legend. Can you give one quick story of someone who you met maybe or you know in your early 20s or in your 20s that ended up being like you would have never expected that person would be so valuable in your career.

I mean I have a hilarious one which is Mark Zuckerberg like I when I was at business week I first called Mark Zuckerberg when Facebook had just closed the p.m. and I was like. He had already raised money from Peter he was in the Valley but you can't imagine at that moment.

How much even when David Z did the 500 million dollar Greylock round I'm not going to be able to imagine that. I'm not going to be able to imagine that. From Peter he was in the Valley but you can't imagine at that moment how much even when David Z did the 500 million dollar Greylock round I made a bet with another CEO.

Over a fancy dinner dinner anywhere in the world because he insisted not only the bet wasn't even will Facebook go public and be worth 500 million which seemed. Unbelievable to everyone the bet was will they be out of business by this time last year next year like people were so burned. Because this is the other thing we're hardwired for is pattern recognition and people were so burned from the dot com bubble and they're so burned by things like Friendster no one believed in this company and.

So I started you know building a relationship with Mark and like covering him as a journalist and getting interested when he was 19 and then you know within a couple years I was one of the only two journalists in the world who had access to. Yeah because he trusted you. Yeah because and he also knew it's like I thought there was something interesting about him when no one else did I thought he was a remarkable person when no one else did and again it's like network it's all relationships like.

We don't like it was I just finishing. The former CEO of Pepsi just finishing her autobiography this or her memoir this morning and she says at the end like so many amazing things happen when you were the CEO of a multi billion dollar company. And I knew when I left when I left my friendship circle was going to shrink because those people as nice as they were weren't interested in me they were interested in what I could do for them.

And so people never underestimate when you're someone who believed in them before the entire world wanted a piece of them. So I mean that's an obvious but in my first book which Mark was which is about the rise of web 2.0 and Mark was one of a handful of people that I spent hundreds of hours shadowing. You know I mean I that was my advance in that book was one of the it was like the second biggest advance in business week history at that point and allowed me to buy a house in San Francisco that I still have to this day.

So that one phone call paid a lot of dividends. Okay last last question before we move on to the the next startup idea biggest thing you learned from Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg shadowing him for hundreds of hours. Well I mean this is unfortunately this is kind of something everyone knows about him now but I think if it's every biggest thing that non obvious thing that you will.

So let me give you the twist on it because I do think this is the key to what makes him so unique. So the fact that he is you know he talks a lot about this like every year there's a big thing he wants to learn right. And he like throws himself into it.

And I know a lot of CEOs who like talk a big game about always wanting to be learning or whatever and growth mindsets have become super popular after that. But I think the piece that Mark does that other people don't always see from the outside is this extreme humility and amazing self awareness. So he knows when he doesn't know something and he doesn't just go in to learn it.

He gives himself or he used to when I don't know I'm not close to him anymore but he would really put himself in a position of extreme humility and he had no ego in the fact of oh I don't know this thing I have to posture like I know it. He'd be like I don't know this thing and it's vital. And I learned this firsthand because at one point I was like why is this person giving me so much access because really at the beginning he was like why do we need press.

Like there's no one who's in Facebook's audience who's reading Businessweek. Like he was pretty skeptical of all things and he didn't talk to other journalists. And there came a point where I was just like why am I getting so much access.

This is so bizarre. And he was like I don't know. And there came a point where I was just like why am I getting so much access.

This is so bizarre. And and so I asked him that question and he said he said because I've noticed when I'm talking to you I go in not thinking I'm going to say things and then I suddenly start telling you things and you're so much better at people than I am. And so as you're asking me questions and I'm telling you things you need for your job I'm trying to figure out how you're doing that.

Wow. Isn't that amazing. So amazing.

I love that. Okay. So part of what I'm doing now post chairman me I do not have another venture funded startup in me and I also don't want to become a VC because I'm too opinionated and too controversial and I couldn't back someone who was associate path which is kind of required in that that field.

So like all people in my position who can't do either of those things anymore I've become a consultant and the thing that I have found people want to pay me an absolute absolute fortune to do for them. And this is not a pitch because my time is completely booked is help them figure out what is the book that they should write that only they can write that the world would want. Who's the best agent for them what is the process like how do you build your marketing channels in anticipation of this.

I absolutely love doing this because writing books has been super life changing for me and it is an amazing thing to have this tiny piece of your soul in the Library of Congress forever it's just something that hasn't been disintermediated. And it takes four years and it's like I talked to all of these tech people and they're like can't we shortcut this and it's like you really can't you really can't so every time no matter who you are no matter gender where you live anywhere people walk in a bookstore they see a book they loved meant something to them. I don't care if it's twilight or good to great they all do the same thing which is they pick it up and they hold it to their heart and they tell someone they're with about why it meant so much to them.

There's nothing else that has that impact still but here's the thing you read a good to great. You read a wired for story by Lisa Cron which I meant mentioned earlier you read a Tim Ferriss book. You feel like as you're reading it okay I got it i'm gonna do all this stuff it's gonna unlock every problem in my life. All problems will be solved everything's gonna be great you finish the book and maybe maybe remember remember one or two things from that book or maybe you apply them to your life.

Maybe you do it for a short period and then forget but it's actually really hard to apply a framework whether it's a wellness framework. Something like atomic habits or you know something that is more. Substantive like a business book a career book it's really hard to consistently remember what was in that book that you read.

And keep applying it to your life and no one has the time to reread a book there's always so many books coming out and so. You will just forget and i've talked to so many people where they're like oh my god I totally forgot about the hedgehog strategy and good to great. I need to go back and reread that book.

What do they do? I think there's an amazing opportunity for AI here to build coachable AI bots based on authors. And I am so skeptical about AI and so many things but I think the detail and the rigor and the framework and the word count of a book.

I think if they had lectures speaking gigs online newsletters you know the more things that speak to that worldview the better. I think it's a rare case where you would extend someone's influence and not in any way cannibalize the underlying product. I still don't think it's a shortcut because I know a lot of people who are like instead of a book.

Can I do this? And it's like I still think there's why a book is hard is it's the thought process. It's the interrogation.

It's figuring out what have you not thought for. It's the research of where does this framework fit in the world who else has researched this. I don't think I think that's what you can't shortcut because that's also all filtered through your life experience and your genius as the as the author. I think AI cannot shortcut that but I think what it can do is it can extend you.

So for instance Lisa who I've mentioned four times now if she were Beetlejuice she would have appeared. She is like a story coach to the stars and when my partner Paul Carr was going to write his first novel he had published many non-fiction books but writing a novel is totally different. He read Wired for Story and was like oh my god this is genius.

I'm completely sold but I don't really understand how to apply this to what I'm doing. I don't understand and when am I doing this right? When am I being specific enough?

When am I putting enough blood on the page? All the things that she talks about that make compelling story and so he reached out to her and was like do you do coaching and she's like I do but I have a really long wait list. Now he was someone canceled.

He you know made a compelling case he was able to like skip her wait her wait list. They've spent four years working together on multiple novels. He's now in his third novel but he the book wasn't enough.

He needed that back and forth and I think a lot of people feel that way when they read Adam Grant's book when they read Tim Ferriss's book when they read you know any of you know Brene Brown books. I think the ability for these people to leverage themselves even as like a daily reminder with doing nothing more than everything they've already written being put into a nice UX. So I totally buy the premise by the way like I especially buy the premise.

There's so many people working on this. This is not even a super new thing because so many people have asked me about it but I think the way I'm thinking about it is somewhat different but anyway go ahead. Yeah yeah I think the insight is correct 100 percent.

I think the insight around people are buying books from their favorite authors or new authors and they it's an incredible experience and even the best books you know like the ones you mentioned you kind of lose you know you forget and you and you. There needs to be a better way to get you in the habit now I always think about this is kind of old school of me but I always think about like who's who builds the best community in the world or who or one of them or or who's done a really good job at least of spreading the gospel literally. It's like religion like churches and stuff like that and if you think about like the Bible like literally you know if in Christianity for example every Sunday like you come you listen to you know what what what you're reading or judy is.

Every you know every every week you learn about a section of the Bible and that piece that missing piece is what brings you back to actually reread the book make it a part of your zeitgeist and I so I think that insight is so right and the other insight that you have which I think is really right is. The why now around a I provides an ability to extend now the question I have is like how does what is the extension look like. Yeah so I think what it's not is a newsletter because I think most authors and there are many that do this really well and it's this is definitely like a core strategy I use when I'm helping an author build a multi year strategy right. You send a newsletter and it's like hey remember this thing or like hey here's something you could try today and those are really interesting ways of continuing to like bring back those habits or frameworks or you know Adam Grant might send a thing that's like hey here's a new piece of research that backs up what I wrote about and give and take.

And I think that's great but I think what you need is like a daily prompt like the equivalent of when I wake up in the morning. You know I'm gonna look at my email I am gonna see if anyone has texted me and then the next thing I do is I go do like the basic for daily New York Times puzzles and it's great because it is not a time suck. Like there's really no archive on most of them and if there is I've already like done them so it doesn't matter but it's like I'm gonna spend maybe anywhere between five and 20 minutes I'm gonna feel really great about myself.

I'm because I won't feel like I just doom scrolled off like I did something that made me feel smart and the app is like okay see you tomorrow it kind of kicks you out. So like like Paul my partner has so many issues where he like has a smartphone that gets rid of it and has it and gets rid of it because he's like I get sucked in and it's a tough time waste but the one app he always has is the New York Times game map because you really can't get sucked in. And so I think it's a similar thing I think you have your coach and you know every when you can set the time you know if you're like a nursing mother maybe 2am is the right time for you. You know what is the time you would naturally have that downtime and you get a prompt from your AI coach being like hey have you thought about this today or asks a question like let's see say it was.

Let's say it was something about being more in the moment and being more you know grateful maybe like that's what you want to work on like maybe you get a prompt that's like. You know you need to put down your phone for the next hour or you know right now pick what hours you're going to not be on your phone or. You know you know right now write down like 5 things that you're grateful for or you know let's say it's like a you know whatever something around fitness like.

You know what is your plan that you can commit to for working out this week and by the way 5 minutes a day is totally appropriate because it's still putting you in a habit. You know it there's it can be totally customized like I think if James clear was doing this you know maybe you pick the different atomic habits thing you want to do I remember when I was at. Chairman me one of the things that I took was like you know in making like daily cold sales calls which is like no one thinks is fun I don't even think is fun and i'm like I love sales.

And it's like I had a specific time a specific day I would have like a specific like treat or beverage for that and I would like say out loud every day when I get home after dropping the kids at school. i'm going to go sit in my airstream with cement tea and I am going to do 10 sales calls and it's like so it's like I had that discipline for I don't know 2 weeks. What if James clear was popping up on my phone saying have you done it how's the mint tea.

It's a great idea it's a great idea I think if I were if I was doing it if I was building an MVP here I think the way I would do it is. First I'd be selling to these authors so I'd figure out what you know what is the smallest thing that they pay for so I'd go and reach out to the. Maybe not James clear to start but like these and sees first get their feedback.

Then I would try to create an AI avatar bought basically. And it doesn't need to be personalized from day one I think the way the to make it easier on yourself whoever ends up building this you could. You could have it so that like on day one after you finish the book this happens on day seven this happens and everyone's kind of.

Based on that in the future you could personalize it based on you know your goals and other things like that and then and I think. With the rise of like AI avatars and stuff like that you can make something that looks like James clear that talks like James clear that feels like James clear. Now be really exciting to people imagine having James clear as your coach like that's so cool. yeah and really I mean when James clear is coaching someone I bet he's saying the same things 80% of the time and I bet you would be thrilled to be able to extend himself and say the same things like another great person to do it would be.

Kim Scott it's like if you had a Kim Scott bot which rhymes just nice like what if they came in every day okay you had a great day didn't you yeah okay. What conversation did you need to have that you you know wriggled out of because it felt too uncomfortable like what a good prompt for a CEO it's like oh my God you're so right I let myself off the hook for that I did it, this is a reminder, I need to go do that. And I you know I would I mean you know from the Nike comment earlier, I would start with James clear I think the biggest authors are always looking for ways to leverage themselves.

And they're really likely to roll a dice on something like that, especially, and I mean it has to be business authors, it has to be tech people you know it has to be people who have like that following but like in the people who do multiple books. Like awesome put a QR code in the next book, you know have a special edition that you could sell where the first you know 1000 people get this you know get the beta into the Kim Scott bot and after that you have to you. You know have to be on a waitlist or something you would drive so many bulk sales you would drive so many first day sales, which is like the the best bet of getting on the New York Times bestseller list if you said everyone who pre orders.

gets to be gets the Kim Scott bot for free included in their book price it only takes 10,000 books to get on the New York Times bestseller list that would have a meaningful meaningful difference in what a book does in market. Totally and you can do a rev share like don't even charge James clear or whoever anything just be like oh yeah. No and because here's the it's like I would yeah you could do because you think about like the I mean like a eyes a cost sucks you have to think about that, but I bet the publishers if you were driving sales.

Would give you part of the royalties or would give you some amount of money like right now at the store when we do things like well there's a lot of places where we're. Will do like the only signed copies and so the publishers will like ship books to that author in la they'll sign them and the publisher will pay for them to be shipped to us like publishers have. Discretionary marketing budgets for this kind of thing and so yeah I think probably the money could all come from the publisher. And you wouldn't have to charge the author, but I will say like authors will 100% pay for it, I mean most business book authors, I mean I know because i'm paid to help business book authors do a really good job like.

They invest in publicist they invest in people like me they invest in ghost writers they're giving a cut to their agent. You know most authors will buy copies of their own book that they're giving to you know schools or they have in their office they give someone a copy. So most authors business authors are doing it because they want to give back because they want to leave legacy.

Because they want everything they've worked for in their career to kind of add up to a philosophy or something at the end of the day. Or because they're going to get a lot of other things out of it like you, I mean I am living testament to. Like I don't think I ever earned royalties on any of my books because I am such a good salesperson I got massive advances. But everyone I wrote I got so many monetary career benefits, whether it was speaking gigs.

Whether it was board opportunities, whether it was you know whatever whatever I mean you name it it is there's such a moat to getting a published book out there. That even with self publishing even with everything else that there's all these benefits down the line from having written a book so most of people who. You know who who take the time to write a book who are at that level it's not a monetary game for them and they don't want to leave they want. They want they don't want they want regret minimization and if they've taken four years of their life to get this book into the world that represents what they think and what they know and what they've built in their career.

You think they're going to bulk it's spending a couple extra dollars or pennies per copy on a subsidized chat bot no because they're also going to think it's cool. Totally you gave us the sauce these are two good ideas a Zuckerberg story come on this is this is better than expectations Sarah. Where.

Plus a cat a dog like you know if you're listening to this on audio you missed out because the you know the YouTube animal appearances were or iconic. Sarah where. Where where do you want to plug like what do you want to plug if anything.

I'm so delighted that for the first time in my life I don't actually need anything from anyone nor do I have anything to plug but if you I can always come up with something so if you. If you. want to buy books not from Amazon you can go to best bookstore calm and buy them from us we also have an incredible newsletter I read about.

That reading fiction, especially for people anyone building a consumer product trying to sell to people trying to understand the empathy that you gain from that is absolutely a career advantage so.
