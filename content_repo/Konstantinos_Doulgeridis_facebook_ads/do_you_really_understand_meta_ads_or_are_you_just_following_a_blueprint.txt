Hello Facebook people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to analyze if you are following a blueprint or if you really know what you're doing inside your ad sponsor. So this year a lot of things happened. First of all I completed my course which means that I became better because I put my whole thought in a you know in a straight line and I said first I have to teach someone this this this this this so they have to go through the course and they have to learn first this in order to understand this and then this and then this so I started realizing that maybe on my on some of my videos I was telling you things but I didn't tell you something else before so maybe there were gaps of course it's impossible for someone to just see one of my videos and understand understand the whole philosophy about it because we're not teaching a blueprint here but the whole point and what I want to say is that do you really understand what you're doing inside your ads manager because I'm just seeing again and again people telling things that they are easy to be followed by people but they don't understand what they are talking about.

Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. So this happened with the course I realized some things I tried to become better and explain things better. Second thing comments I'm seeing some of the comments for example when I talk about multiple campaigns and I do understand from the comment that they don't really understand what I'm talking about.

Now is this their problem or my problem? Obviously it is my problem if I want to teach people how I do Facebook ads and how they are profitable for me and how I'm scaling but it's also their problem if they just don't think of what they're doing inside the ads manager. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my Facebook ads course.

It took me six months of video editing everything and three months of video shooting and because of that I have created the best Facebook ad course in the world. Inside you're going to find super advanced information but information also for beginners. It takes you by the hand in order to teach you how to do Facebook ads from the beginner level to super advanced level.

It has inside Loom videos from cost caps, speed caps, Loom videos from CBO, ASC optimization, it has chosen five sessions, inner circle sessions and it has a lot of theory with whiteboard, also strategies that are working all of these years, things that I have developed, things that I know that are working because I have spent millions and millions on the platform. Currently I'm spending between five and ten million every month, sometimes it's even more, across 30 accounts and I have access to many many more so I know what is currently working and all the latest trends and this is what I'm doing inside the course. I'm showing you live ad accounts with real spend and what is working right now and if you want you can click the link below, you can go and you can check some videos that I have open free for you so that you can check if you like the course or not and decide if you want to buy it or not.

I will see you there. All of this came from a discussion that I had today with one of my students on the chosen five. Hi Richard.

And basically we were discussing this. He was in another group, a dropshipping group which is something that happens a lot with the chosen five. Most of the times on chosen five there are people who come broken from stupid strategies and stuff but they were smart enough to understand that something was wrong over there so they did find their own strategies and then they came here for me to explain what they're seeing because if you're smart enough you're going to view the things that I'm telling you, you're going to see the patterns.

The problem is that you haven't explained them and this is not making you better on Facebook ads and it doesn't help you to actually evolve you know and become even better and better and better day by day. So the discussion was like this. So I was in the group and they were saying that if you don't have an ad to cart in the first 10 hours for example you have to close the ad blah blah and basically the breakthrough that he has done is that he realized that he wasn't giving enough time to his creatives and then he went back checked all of the things not because of me because of someone else who told him that what you're doing is wrong and he checked this he ran a lot of other ads from some of his ads that they had the best metrics and boom success he started making money.

So this guy was burned for some months because he was just following the blueprint for from the group that he was there and he wasn't able to actually move forward but he had the mind to think and said why do we have to wait for an ad to cart in 10 hours not all the products are the same first realization why do we have to scale only with three ROAS doesn't matter what kind of break even ROAS we have why do we have to follow this cost per purchase for example don't the ad accounts have completely different metrics between them or base the product or base the offer or whatever and this is where it all starts perfect you start thinking okay you're not just following a blueprint just because you know in this group they were saying yeah we tested this in multiple products and spending millions and this is what is working this is not the answer okay try to answer to the people by just telling them why you're doing this or that in the same way that i'm trying to explain with some of these are really logical like the example that i really love to use and it makes total sense and i use it also inside the course for example if you have cost per purchase of 50 and you are actually having a cbo with 100 okay and your cost per purchase that you're getting there is 50 and you increase it by the 20 percent increase you increase it to 120 then you are not thinking you're just following a blueprint just like a headless chicken and you're just doing this and you're just with doing that you're actually asking for 60 dollars cost per purchase then because you are just having 120 the best case scenario is that you're going to have 60 not 40 for example if you're going to get three sales for example on a daily level or maybe 30 if you get four sales on a daily level as you can understand the whole thing about what you're doing is if you're analyzing it if it makes sense and how are you going to analyze it and making and make sense if you know what each button is doing inside as manager and if you understand all of the concepts then you're going to be able to create a blueprint which is going to be made for your own business and the next business that you're going to have it's going to be another blueprint that you're going to create for this business because you will understand the numbers and you will understand how facebook ads actually work fun fact the 20 is coming from the theory about the learning phase so in the learning phase what do we know that if you scale by 20 you're not exiting the learning phase how do you enter the learning phase you enter the learning phase if you have 50 events on the attribution setting on your asset level which most of the time see seven days click one day view do the math you haven't passed the learning phase you haven't passed the learning phase what do you understand this is what is actually triggering me if you're doing something because you don't understand it 50 dollars cost per purchase 100 that means you get two sales per day on the cbo that you are having and that means that you're getting 14 sales per week you don't have the 50 events okay so why are you scaling with 20 why don't you understand it okay you can see i'm more calm now after my best what are we having here we have people that they don't understand that do you know what is the most sad part of all that someone is lucky or unlucky you will understand what i mean they go they see a video on youtube which happens to have similar kpis and numbers as their product for example they see examples of a cbo campaign having four ads inside with an average cost per purchase of 25 and they have a 100 budget they put it on their ad account it's actually working and then they think that this is the search that works they still don't understand they were just lucky to find an example which is closer to their numbers and they didn't find and they didn't understood facebook ads in a deeper level to create their own numbers their own budgets their own number of facets and all of that this is why i have created my youtube channel back in the day because i was feeling like okay and i'm going to drop names here ben heath perfect channel good beginner guides everything is there perfect what about the next level where are the advanced stuff where can we learn about cost caps speed caps where can we learn about not even the crazy method other things like cb optimization how we distribute the budget how we set our budgets and all of that there wasn't anything and i was just discussing with my friends here and there was nobody outside there that was doing these things or we could then find it on the ad accounts that we were finding from clients when we were onboarding them and it was a silence and then i said okay we have to see if we are crazy or not and the truth is that we were not crazy because several years after there are people that they have started doing these things and it's working for them the course has been created based on all of this knowledge from all of this at account from your remarks from the comments and stuff which helped us become better and better and talking about me and my friend jonathan that we were actually searching more and more and more and more and at the end of the day we have all of this system which we have created but sometimes people say multiple campaigns is too much there's overlap you don't even understand what we're talking about we're talking about multiple campaigns that they have a structure they have crazy method for scaling and cost cap for a little bit of more scaling why because we have seen that there is no overlap and cannibalization between cost cap and crazy method how are we going to scale without cannibalization with different angles what is the daily loop theory what is the crazy method different hot pockets average results how to operate in another account with multiple campaigns and what's the average results and don't care for the individual results of each of the campaign all of these are things that i have posted in videos here but if you just see one of my videos and you see multiple campaigns and you say okay i'm going to work with one campaign because i'm i'm afraid of the overlap what kind of overlap you're targeting so many million people and there are so many campaigns that you can do with different angles that you can target different people if you don't understand all of these concepts at least do the effort to just watch more videos to get more educated and if you want to go deeper go for my course why do you think that we go more and more and more and more to ai inside meta and i'm not crying about it i'm just saying that we're going in we're going and we have more ai inside because meta understands that you don't understand what the you're doing inside the platform and even abo they changed abo they added on the abo to give extra budget to the different ad sets if they have better results do you know why because you don't understand what kind of budgets you should add and you cannot just do calculations based on your average cost per purchase and all of that and you're putting stupid budgets like five dollars cost per purchase for testing abo strategies that are coming from 2015 or i don't know from from when and you're just doing all of that not understanding what you're doing and not explaining to yourself how you're spending your money if you're having the same problem if you're doing things and you don't understand why if it doesn't make sense if your blueprint uh is for you think that it's for crazy people and doesn't make any sense for your kpis then watch more of my videos understand more of my concepts and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book you can check my course where we have a complete system of how you can work by having new pixel train the pixel go to campaigns scale what is the bell curve and how much you can scale one creative the crazy method for scaling more the cost caps for scaling a little bit more the different angles the daily loop theory and cannibalization between campaigns if you don't use different angles average results cbo optimization and all of these together helping you scale more and more and more like so many other people have scaled that they are following either my mentorship programs that you can see all of the comments below over here from people completing them or with the course that you can see all the reviews on the trust pilot from people completing them and while they were stuck on scaling to 5k per day 6k per day they were managed to hit 10k per day days just because they're following all of these different things and not just one thing a blueprint learning facebook ads deeper and fixing blueprints for their own business and their next business and the next business and the next business and dealing with again guys be creative and because you
