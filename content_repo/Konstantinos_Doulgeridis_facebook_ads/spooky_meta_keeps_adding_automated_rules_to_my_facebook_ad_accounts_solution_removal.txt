Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today I'm going to talk about some automated rules that Meta is actually auto-applying to some of my ad accounts and how to remove them because it took me a lot of time to find the solution and now I'm going to show it to everyone. So sometimes while I was optimizing I could see an ad closed and then I said why did I do this mistake and it was more mistakes and more mistakes compiling so I started saying okay maybe the owner closed it you know and I went to check the logs and the logs were showing that it was an automated rule and then I said oh it had automated rules before I come here. No Meta is adding automated rules I'm going to show you exactly how this is being done I'm going to show you also how to remove them and I hope that this video is going to help some of you because this has been something that I was looking for a solution for several months since the point that I found it.

The only thing that was bugging me it was the fact that I couldn't believe that Meta would take a decision like this that you can do nothing about it because it was deleting the rules they were reappearing and all of that but now I found where you can find these settings and how to remove them and all of that so let's go to my pc let me show you of course for the people of the inner circle and the people that there have been listening to the podcast these are things that they know earlier but now there's also a video for all of you out there that you're not doing that so that you can see them. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So I will take you to in all of my other accounts I have removed it but I kept this one to to do the video basically in this account I was optimizing and I could see that ads have been closed so I was checking here on the logs obviously I'm not going to check it I'm not going to open it you can check here from the logs on this right side over here see history and you can see the change by over here if you put the right dates and of course you have to pick the correct campaign and stuff so if you do that you're going to be able on the last seven days there are not any changes okay I'm not going to open it because it will be a nightmare for editing over here you can see by change by it would say automated rule this with a blue thing so that you can check it so I started observing this in order to understand why and who was closing my ads initially I thought it was the owner so I was getting angry about it and then I checked and I went to the manage rules over here as you can see if we come here we can see that we are having of course I'm not going to show the ad account and stuff we can see that we have here some that they are being created by a person which is the owner of the ad account which again I'm hiding the name and then over here we're having some which have been created it says by nobody this is meta ones and basically one of them is 10 of standard enhancements because the thing that they care most about is that you're going to have your standard enhancements on with ai and stuff music and stuff which I'm not using them by all the way because they're really problematic they're just adding stupid music or do things like taking the headline putting it on the top combine ad sets so this is budget automatically turn off ad sets for auction overlap and this stupid but over here we have this stupid automated rules sometimes you turn them off from here but then they are being auto generated again and again and again and I couldn't find how now let me tell you how if you come here to the account overview you're going to see this and this is not actually this is the place that you're going to find them but you have to follow another process in order for you to be able to find them how if you come here and you press this one see automatic adjustments it takes you again to account overview but this time you have a completely different setup over here do you see this one i'm going to close it it's going to show it like this now what is happening is that most of the times people come with meta reps over here and the meta rep says enable this automatic adjustment automatic optimize to eligible ads to this and that and that potentially outcome this one after a meta rep call or maybe the owner did it it doesn't matter we have some automations turned on and the only way to turn them off is by clicking here this one and then apply changes now the changes have been applied now when we click on this one it's not there anymore and if we come here again on the automated rules okay nothing is going to be created anymore over here in some cases the automated rules are also being uh deleted uh not in this case so this is the way for you to actually do it you come here you click uh then let's go on the campaign over here let's click again on the manage rules i don't like to work with automatic rules for these reasons they are just closing ads for no reason no it didn't delete it in some accounts it deletes also the created rules here you can do it manually by just pressing here and delete but i'm not going to i will just leave them there the problem over here was that it was creating again and again and again other automated rules and i had to check every day or every two days just if i was going to be able to find another rule which is going to ruin my ads and stuff which is not efficient and i don't want to do it so that's the thing that i want to show you this is how you're going to manage this problem and meta creating automated rules for you and i hope that's going to help some people that they just cannot understand how this is happening and i will see you guys for the closing of the video so that's all i had for you this is the way for you to be able to remove these automatic rules and be able to monitor it if you have any other settings that are being set automatically by meta or by mistake that you have done don't forget guys that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my mentorship programs you can check also below my mentorship programs all of the reviews from the people that they have completed the mentorship programs and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
