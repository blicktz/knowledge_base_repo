Hi guys, I just want to give you an update about something that happened yesterday. So around 7 p.m. Eastern Time yesterday, we had Facebook having some issues and it started randomly closing ads.

So you might see your campaign active over here, but your ad is turned off. So what you should do is that you should come here. You should see that we can see that it's from active to inactive.

It's because of Facebook. It happened yesterday, 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

In other accounts, it's 7 p.m., 8 p.m. For some reason, this has happened. So you need to come and you need to open.

You need to check all of your accounts. You need to check all of your ads, your active ad sets and see if any of your ads is actually closed. That was a very fast update.

Have a nice day.
