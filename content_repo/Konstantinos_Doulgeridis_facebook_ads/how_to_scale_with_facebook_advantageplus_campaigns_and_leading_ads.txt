Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about Advanced Plus campaigns and dominant ads and how you can scale with more Advanced Plus campaigns. So in theory you can scale more and more and more with more products expanding to other countries and of course with more creatives. You know we have said it several times in this channel that you can approach the sameness from different aspects.

The new example that I like to use is the lunchbox, maybe I have used it in the past but we are not going to use the car so that my video editor has to do now new creatives about it because it's using the same car. So we're going to talk about the lunchbox. So the lunchbox is let's say for example that you have a mom preparing a lunchbox.

Now that I say it I remember that she has creatives for that so most probably she's laughing behind the camera about that but anyway. Very smart, very smart. So let's say the lunchbox because I cannot think of another example that you can do for example the same product but approaching people from another aspect.

So basically you can do an ad which is showing a mom preparing a lunchbox for her children to the school, a wife preparing a lunchbox for someone who works on a construction site or someone going for a picnic so they have a lunchbox or a lunchbox for any other reason that you can imagine so that you can you know approach not only moms for instance in this case. So in theory with creatives and by tapping other sub niches of the niche that you want to target you can get more sales and more sales and more sales but a lot of times we have people that they are limited a little bit in the creatives that they can use and all of that or the production is not so easy it's taking time and you know we have said several times in this channel that a lot of times when you have an advanced plus campaign which is operating with 10 creatives you should not just do another 10 creatives and another 10 creatives maybe you have to see if the creatives that you have inside the advanced plus are taking enough budget. I have one very clear case right now in one ad account that one of the ads has taken all of the budget and the other ads they didn't take any budget so I duplicate the campaign I remove the one ad which was the winning ad and now I'm running two advanced plus campaigns which are having the same creatives except from one the leading and the winning ad in the first campaign.

The whole way of thinking about this is that it's not necessarily the best ad or the only ad that it can have sales maybe the others can also have sales so you created 10 creatives if they're not being tested efficiently and I'm not saying testing all of the 10 okay but I'm saying that there's still juice to the other nine creatives that haven't been tested just because the one is taking all of the budget so let's go to my pc I want to show you this visual example so that you can understand it and you can start applying it into your own campaigns because this is how advanced plus campaigns are working and there is always going to be a dominant ad and the distribution of the budget between the ads is not going to be even. Let's go on my pc. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there.

We are in this account over here that I started working on it one week ago I guess so on 12 yeah 12 it wasn't spending on 16 it wasn't spending when it was spending 23 yeah 23 it was spending and then I'm coming somewhere around here scaling to 580 and I'm scaling more and I'm scaling more so 1.5k so far I'm going to go pretty easy on 2k. Fairly new ad account the things that I need to say about this ad account is that the Breakover Rose is on 1.2 for the physical product it has also subscription model but we're not going to focus on the subscription model let's say 1.2 for the sale Breakover Rose and it's a supplement brand and the third thing that I want to mention here is that most probably it's going to be in 100k spent at account if not this month the next month for sure we try to be on two ROAS above maybe we'll drop to 1.8 ROAS as we scale if it scales a lot because we have also the subscription which is going to help us a lot a lot in the next months we will see but why am I here because I want to show you something over here on the last seven days 1.96 we're doing pretty well and we are starting doing now advanced plus campaigns with some CBOs here we are on this advanced plus which is the main thing that I want to discuss as you can see here in the whole days and maybe I can put even maximum over here you can see that out of the 481 the 443 is being is being taken by one ad now you have two options over here either you're going to increase the budget of this campaign which means two things that first of all maybe we're going to have budget which is going to go towards the other ads or you are going to leave it as it is duplicate it which is this campaign over here which started yesterday duplicate it over here put another 200 dollars and see if you can have more sales on the other ads of course this campaign is fairly new I'm not even going to touch it yet most probably this one if it continues doing bad I'm going to do changes over here but you understand my point here it doesn't mean that the other ads were bad it means that they were not taking any budget so what I'm doing here is that I'm removing the element which is this crazy winning ad with three ROAs that is taking all of the budget instead of risking of losing my three ROAs or whatever because it's helping me on my average because I'm scaling this account I'm not going to touch it and I'm going to do another campaign removing this working ad and actually focusing on the other ads first of all out of respect from the person who made the ads okay somebody took the time the owner paid or the owner made them it's not okay for me to just say okay send me another 10 you know we have an opportunity here of scaling more so instead of spending 200 we spend 400 and maybe if it's going to optimize really well which I don't see anything super dominant here so most probably it's not going to be a duplication of this campaign removing some ads we're going to go for another batch after that but yeah that's the whole way of thinking over here and as you can see it's working flawlessly another thing that I could do is that I could take this one and duplicate it several times in in the same advanced plus campaign I mean in a new advanced plus campaign duplicate this ad several times targeting different hot pockets also guys this is one of the cases that it's a easiest optimization now one last thing before we go many of you you are going to ask maybe on the comments and stuff are you going to close all of this the answer is no let me tell you why first of all I'm monitoring okay this is my job I'm watching daily what is happening but this ad is so dominant that I'm not afraid if I see things changing I'm going to come here and intervene but I also want these random sales for five six seven dollars here which are going to come also this spend over here if we see it in total it's 37 okay the 37 yeah the amount that we're getting as a cost per purchase over here is from the leading ad is 14.31 and if we see in this competition it's 21 okay so in this question what am I going to do over here I'm going to leave those because they have insignificant spent okay it's dragging a little bit this slower but it's fine the only thing that I'm going to close is this one if it doesn't have any checkout it doesn't have any checkout so I'm going to close this one so you are not going immediately and you're closing all of the ads focusing all of the budget there it's not going to influence it it's going to be fine but here for the long term maybe some of these ads are going to be needed giving a little bit of push with average results and small cost per purchase sales whatever is going to go above the mark of 10 15 20 which is then the average cost per purchase that we're getting it has to be closed so it's a process that I'm going to take slowly instead of just cutting everything immediately but that's my opinion and this is how I want to do it if someone comes to me and tells me I want to stop the optimization process I'm going to close all of this what this one has spent yesterday 188 okay 190 it's also acceptable okay I'm not going to say I'm not going to be opposed on that also keep in mind that as days passes by you can see that this is becoming more and more and more dominant so I'm not afraid of those on the other hand you might tell me that maybe something is going to change and some of those are going to start taking budgets ruining my first ad I'm not afraid of that because maybe it means that I will have to relance it or I will end up doing a crazy method with it at the end of the day if it continues like that and also I like to optimize guys so bear with me here I wouldn't like to just stop the optimization process in such an easy campaign to optimize that's all I keep monitoring it I will keep monitoring it and I hope that it's going to inspire you and you're going to check your advanced plus campaigns you're going to see that something is spending all the amount of money but the other ads are not being tested and you are going to also test it and you're going to have another campaign which is going to be profitable so as you can see it is really obvious over here okay and you can do it again and again up to five creators I guess if all of your creatives are powerful and the next campaign is going to be profitable and the next campaign is going to be profitable so in that way with 10 creatives you might end up having three campaigns two campaigns and not only just one it's always better than the one and you are having also diversity because you're not just using the same creative but you are also using other creatives another thing that you could do over here and we have a video about this is to run an advanced plus crazy method so this one ad which was so powerful you take it and you add it in another advanced plus campaign by just duplicating that many times trying to target different hot pockets this time if you're not familiar with the hot pockets term you can go to my crazy method video and you can check over there how it is working that's all i had for you guys i guess if you want to learn more you can check my book my course and my website and until we meet again be creative and be consistent
