Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss how AI revolutionized the way that we do Facebook Ads. So as we discussed several times into my podcast, I'm not the kind of, and in my videos also, I'm not the kind of person that is going to reject AI because I believe that it's super helpful and I have seen the benefits of using it for the good of my own company, my clients and with the ads. The thing that I'm going to show you today, it's not like something that I have invented on my own, it's something that we were doing but the AI is helping much more in the process and it's making it better and I can tell you all my process of how I manage ads like this to my clients with the help of ChatGPT mostly and the AI so that I can have better results.

It's needless to say that this video is not about an AI that is just making better ads with automated rules and stuff because we don't have an AI like this. I still don't believe that there's any good programs out there for Facebook Ads with an AI but what I'm going to show you, it's all about ChatGPT and how we're using it in order to find different copies and in order to find different scenarios for our different videos and everything. Okay, so let me show you the way that I think about my clients and how it's working.

First of all, what you can see here is one of the ad copies that I'm using for one of my clients. The way that we are operating in each of the client is analyzing the niche. Of course we always do an audience research, we always do research on their landing pages on how they work and everything but we also want to understand why somebody should buy this service or product or whatever and what kind of problem is it fixing.

This is something which is fundamental for every business. When you are having a business, what kind of problem is it fixing and if it's relieving you... I don't know, not relieving...

Okay, after a small meeting with my team the verb is relieve. So what kind of problem is going to relieve is going to solve whatever I could have said solved all of this time and skip all of this drama. Anyway, so what do we have here?

We have the pain points okay and in this specific situation the pain points that we have it was cell phone bills are too expensive, general financial strain, stay connected to friends and family, can use popular apps without a phone. As you can understand here we are selling phones with this specific thing and affordable phones. Access to job opportunities, current phone broke, lost or stolen, be able to contact emergency services, be able to access healthcare, be able to access financial tools like specific ones, use your phone to learn and improve education, transportation, navigation, stay in front with your smartphone, access entertainment, giving a smartphone to seniors for communication, enhancing personal safety.

Did we think all of that on our own? Some of them yes, some of them we think of them or it was on the copy of the site already and some of those they came out of ChatGPT with the process that we have of actually asking some questions in order to get more pain points. And after that for the different pain points, we also have our own hooks with our copywriters teams but we also give these hooks to ChatGPT so that it can improve them.

You know how ChatGPT is actually working. You're giving it one sentence and you say make five, six, ten variations out of that or you tell it make a variation that is going to focus this time on this thing or whatever. It's a big process anyway, it's taking us one or two days to complete one of these things but at the end of the day I can tell you that you are having here something that it's complete and it's helping you a lot.

Why? Because over here on the second tab which I'm not going to open, we have the copies. So we have five main copies, five headlines and of course we keep some general rules like we don't want to have a brick of text, we want to have emojis and no emojis so that we can test different things.

But over there we're having just some general copies and then we're having the hooks which is hook one, hook two based on the different paint points and on this one we're just putting every hook that we want to choose on the top of each one of these copies so that creates countless, it's not countless, a lot of different combinations and then we are just putting a bolt here to the ones that we started using so that we can start testing and then by testing, testing we are ending up with this hook is working, this kind of paint point is working so maybe if we see that one of the paint points comes a lot then we do many many many more hooks from this paint point in order to pinpoint this and then we are also using all of that and all of these hooks and paint points and everything to our creatives because we can do images based on that, we can do videos that they are going to have text like that and they talk because you know the whole point is what does a company do when they have a product or a service? They try to find what kind of problem they are solving. What if you have a company and you think that you solve problem A but in reality you're solving problem B and C which is more important for the customers?

Then you don't know that and it means that you cannot actually say anything about it and it means that you can actually convince less people that they don't know that you are solving this kind of problem because you didn't know that you do. This is just a very simplified example to explain why you need to go through the process of doing all of these paint points, hooks and everything and then just focus in one or two paint points that are working. So just to analyze one of the examples here, so let's say that we take the paint point of general financial strain okay.

Then we have hook one that says don't let money worries keep you up at night. Financial strain doesn't have to mean significantly connectivity. Stay connected without the financial strain.

No need to sacrifice staying connected to save money and so on and you can have hooks like this. We put five hooks for each one of the categories for the paint points and the most important thing is that you're having enough to test and if you see that one of the paint points is actually working then you expand and you put more hooks and more hooks. But I think that you understand the point of how this is actually working and what am I proposing here.

Another thing that I have seen a lot coming is that this kind of process is helping a lot in the creatives because basically it's completely different of doing creatives just to test the creative and completely different of doing creatives with something that you know that it already resonates with people that they are going to buy the product. And this is the main point that you are going to define that is going to work after you break down the results in working campaigns. The last thing that I want to mention is that we know from the other accounts that I'm showing you from time to time like this one for example if we see on the maximum period 362k 7.74 2.8 million.

The way that I showed you in previous case studies of how these are working and I'm going to put the link is that yes I have done this process and yes I have done this process with creatives also and yes I have found the pain points that this specific company with their product is having its helping and I was able also to make more creatives and with that way I was able to make also more campaigns with different pain points and so on and so on. So this thing is not only helping you to find just one pain point or one hook that is going to work but it helps you find a lot of different creatives, a lot of different copies, a lot of different things that are going to work together in order for you to have many several campaigns stacked up with different pain points, with different creatives, with creatives that they have other pain points, with creatives that they have other pain points and hooks and of course it's taking some time as you can see in the case study videos that you can see after this video. But let me tell you that it's super efficient and super profitable because you are convincing people from different entry points.

The same way that I have videos that I explain that creatives are helping people to be convinced by the different things that they show, for example, showing a car as we explained in the example based on specs, based on aesthetics, based on lifestyle, somebody can buy because of these reasons and you can give them that through other creatives that are explaining this. You can do the same thing when you're having, for example, you know that a lot of people are buying a car because of the specs but then you also go to the pain points and you do videos with the specs and the pain points and then it's becoming more powerful and not only more powerful, it's becoming just another campaign that you have which is convincing people from two entry points this time instead of one which means that you're going to have more entry points and penetration to the market. So all of this is happening for us to define and this is how I managed to scale also this account that I'm showing you in another case study 2023.

Let's go from May to January just for this year just to see. Let's take all the campaigns that have spent money, filter them by selection and we have 577, 6.05 ROAS, 3.5 million. This is a way that I use to scale all these accounts and several others with this strategy, with several creatives, with several pain points by just understanding what kind of problem we are solving for each one of the businesses that we're working with and how we can convince people that this is a product that they use because the customers need guidance okay.

If they don't know that you're solving this problem because you're not communicating it with them then they will never know and they will never buy your product. So this is our job, this is what we do, this is how we scale accounts. I hope that this is going to help you, it's going to inspire you, it's going to make you also do it and it's going to help your business and let's go for the closing of the video.

So that's all I had for you about this ChatGPT AI method and how it helped my ad accounts do better and better and better and I hope that you liked it, I hope that it's going to inspire you, I think, I hope that it's going to help you and I hope that you will start using it along with all of my other strategies that I'm showing in this channel. Don't forget that if you want to learn more about Facebook ads you can check my book, my free course, my paid course. By the way this is not inside the paid course, I haven't done any course about the ChatGPT and anything inside the paid course, just saying it.

You can also check my website and send me an email if you want something and don't forget that until we meet again, be creative, use the AI and be consistent guys.
