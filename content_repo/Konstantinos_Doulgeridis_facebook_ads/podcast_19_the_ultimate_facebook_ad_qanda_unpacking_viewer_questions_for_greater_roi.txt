Before we go to the questions, I would like to say some things just a little bit fast.

Today we don't have a main topic for the podcast, but we do have a lot of questions which is going to be general topics which are going to help your guests to understand more Facebook ads. Πρώτα, θέλω να μιλήσω πως να μιλήσω πως το πρόβλημα του Φεβρουαρίου. Φεβρουαρίου ήταν ένα πολύ δύσκολο μήθος.

Έχουμε κάποια καλύτερα αποτελείται από τα αγκούνια και αυτό δεν έρχεται μόνο από εμένα, αλλά από πολλές άλλες ανθρώπους που είναι αγκούνιζαν τα αγκούνια. Και, να είμαι πιστεύος με ειδικά, δεν ξέρω αν είναι η εμφασία ή κάτι σχετικά με το Φεβρουαίο. Πρέπει να σας πω τι θέλω.

Το κ orłambo코σκο για να είχαjat chcia憲verage. Έχω έφερει από αυτό ένα συζήτημα με κάποιος από Ιρακ και μου είπε το ίδιο το ίδιο.

Λοιπόν, ξεκινήσαμε ότι Ιρακ δεν θα είναι ενθουλειμένος από το Αμερικανομικό κόσμο. Ώστε πιο πιστεύω ότι αυτό έχει να κάνει με το Facebook. Από ένα από τους φίλους που είχαμε να μιλήσουμε, μου είπε ότι δεν, επειδή οι οικονομίες είναι συνδυασμένοι.

Ώστε αυτό είναι το σημαντικό σημαντικό που φοράς όταν τα πράγματα δεν θα κάνουν καλύτερα με το Facebook. Ώστείω ότι είναι Facebook-δη. Ώστείω ότι είναι όμως το οικονομικό κόσμο.

Η καλή πράγμα είναι ότι αυτό το εύκολο που πέρασαν αυτές τις τρία δύο, Σετραβή, Σετραβή, Σετραβή, ήταν πολύ καλύτερα. Σετραβή, κάτι καλύτερα. Και τότε είχαμε δύο καλύτερα δύο.

Δεν είμαι καλύτερα για να είμαι εμέλος. Δεν έχω δει όλες τις εξωρίες γιατί είμαι κάνει το πόδιο. Αλλά αυτό το πόδιο είναι σωτήρα και θα το αφήσουμε στο Σετραβή.

Ώστε, πιστεύω ότι το Σετραβή ήταν λίγο αρκετό. Δεν ξέρω τι θα συμβαίνει σωτήρα. Αλλά μπορούμε να μιλήσουμε το επόμενο το επόμενο.

Ήταν σωστά, είναι αρκετά. Και να είμαι ειναι σωστός με εσείς, Σε αυτόν τον τρόπο, μπορούσα να δούμε ότι οι μεγάλες εξωρίες δεν θα συμβαίνουν πολύ, Ενώ από αυτές τις τρία δύο, στο εβδομένιο. Και οι μικρές εξωρίες δύο, οι μικρές εξωρίες δύο, το μέλλον.

Οπότε οι τριαντές οι πίξελες χρησιμοποιούν πιο εμπλήσης, για να το βάλω. Και, φυσικά, όταν βλέπεις αυτά σε πολλές εξωρίες, έχω την αρκετή να κάνω αυτό. Ξέρω ότι είναι μόνο ένα γενικό, οπότε δεν πανίξω, δεν ξεκινάζω τα έτσι.

Και μόνο μιλήσω τους. Και είχα πιστεύω, γιατί έχουν μόνο εξωρίσει από κάποια περίοδο. Δεν είναι μόνο που μπορεί να κάνεις, ο Φασβούς δεν θέλεις να σας δώσει ροζ, ή κάνουν αλλαγές για το γνωρίζοντας, ή τίποτα.

Αν άλλο άνθρωπος που θέλω να πω πριν πω, είναι ότι αυτά τα πράγματα είναι συμβαίνουν όλη την πρόκληση με το Φασβούς. Και πρέπει να είναι καλύτερο με αυτό, γιατί αυτό είναι μόνο η πλατφόμος. Και, φυσικά, δεν πρέπει να πανίξει.

Πρέπει να πρέπει να πω κάποιος που θα πω να εξωρίζει και να πω ότι αυτό είναι η σημαντική στιγμή από κάποιες αγκές και τίποτα. Και, άλλο άνθρωπος που θέλω να πω, είναι ότι είχαμε να συζητήσουμε με ένας μου κοινωνία, είναι από τη Γερμανία, και είπε ότι όταν αυτό το πράγμα είναι, είμαι απλά να δωρήνει πολύ αρνητικά αρνητικά. Οι αγκές μου είναι στον δουλειά και τα πράγματα, έτσι, έτσι, έτσι, έτσι, τέτοιες τέσεις τέστας.

Και, όταν έχουμε αυτά τα παιδιά, από το Βασίλιο, δεν δώσουν πραγματικά εξωρίες.

Ωραία, και όπως οι άνθρωποι που κάνουμε Facebook Ads, αγαπητοί αγαπητοί, όπως όλοι, αυτό είναι η τρόπο που δείχνει ή πραγματικά, όταν κάτι είναι καλύτερο με το Βασίλιο και δεν κάνει το πράγμα.

Τώρα, αυτό είναι με τα πληροφορά. Στον τα Βασίλιο, σχετικά τα Βασίλιο, εμπίζω ότι σας αρέσει την εμπλήση, εμπίζω ότι θα δείξει λίγο πώς αυτά τα πρόγραμματα συνεχίζουν.

I guess the messages are not in your facebook page or maybe the messages that you are getting it would say comments. Okay, so if you are getting messages from that.

Anyway, what I am trying to say is that you should try to put next, to click the next button and accept it because the more data the better. One thing here, if you see that the messages that you are getting they are negative because they are confused from your copy, they are saying something whatever, that means that you should do another ad. Because this means based on that, that facebook is going to use this data to find similar people and if the similar people don't like the product like the initial people, then you're going to have many issues.

So it's not only about the data that you get but the quality of the data that you get and if these people they really like your product or not. So be careful also on that. It's the same thing that we say about the comments on the posts that guys, you need to monitor the comments on the post.

And if you have negative engagement, you should either stop the ad, change it, whatever, or you should try to manage them answer or you should try to hide them, whatever, in order for you not to spread the negativity, because more and more and more negative comments will come. and the ad is going to have a very good engagement phase, Facebook is going to think that it's a good ad, but it's going to be a negative ad and it's going to have popularity because of the negativity. Now, another thing that I have here is that I have one big news here, which is that I'm doing a new, there's a new Meta program.

This is running in Germany right now. I have it in a German account that Meta gave 15k on credit for one month so that we can use pictures that they're going to be made through an AI. and by that what do I mean?

So this is the first image that we have, it's the white background and then we have another one which is with a velvet background, a purple velvet background and then another one with a black background and then another one which is with some crystal type background. This is just an example of some. Of course we have, I believe, 15 samples and then we have another 15 velvet and another 15 rock diamond style background.

This has been created with DALE2. DALE2 is an AI which is creating backgrounds and it's from OpenAI. Just some reading here.

What did they said about product overview? As our advertisers adopt new products like Advantage Plus shopping campaigns, we will see a need for increased amounts of assets to support these campaigns and creative production may become a challenge, particularly for DR Catalog focused clients. Meta is developing an internal AI creative tool that will generate backgrounds and give situational context to catalog images.

So this is just a test that Meta is running so that it can put it on all the catalogs. For example, what am I saying here? The structure is going to be very simple.

We're going to have three Advanced Plus campaigns. One is going to be the white background. Another one is going to be the developed background.

And another one, Advanced Plus, is going to be the crystal style background. So what Facebook is going to do with that is that it's going to test if it's working or not so that it can eventually go and say, okay, you have a catalog with 50 items. We will let you use it in Advantage Plus as a catalog, but we can make this catalog having 1000 items with different backgrounds that are going to be generated with DALE2, which is an AI tool for background and stuff.

I think it looks interesting. Of course, I'm going to create a video after I'm done with it and explain to you. I just gave you also these pictures just so that you can understand how it looks.

And sure, we're going to see in the future how that goes and I will keep you informed about that. Now, some things before we go to your questions. first of all, one of my friends was looking about a TikTok advertiser and we realized something.

After two months, there is a huge gap in the market for actual working TikTok accounts. And what I'm trying to say is that, for example, there is one account that I'm getting six ROAS with Facebook with high spend 100 to 200K. And in TikTok, it barely does 1.8 in a very difficult rate.

So, whoever is talking about TikTok being a revolutionary platform and all of these kiddos coming out and they have agencies about TikTok and stuff, I have to say one thing. TikTok is not ready yet. And don't compare it with Facebook yet.

I'm going to be one of the first people that is going to say that TikTok is working when I see it working. But in these two months, we're looking for a person to have an actual case study with some decent ROAS. and the best ROAS that we found it was 2.5 or 3.

And to be honest with you, I don't think that we can compare pairs with apples because Facebook is far more powerful. Maybe TikTok is going to become more powerful, but right now it's not. And I could see it because I was looking for someone who has decent case studies with that, with actual spends and everything.

And even with agencies and stuff, we didn't find something solid. And a lot of people told us that 2 is very good for TikTok. So this is one of the reasons that I don't like to focus on CPMs and everything because at the end of the day, the companies are paying us through the return on investment that they get.

So I believe there is a huge gap still on TikTok. And this is my experience after two months. There is a meta advertisement right now, which is running and it's calling people to go to the meta group for experts doing Facebook ads.

I'm not going to join that because I'm sure that it's going to be full of idiots that they have no idea of what they're doing. And I believe that decent people and decent advertisers are not going to go there just because it's a waste of time. And secondly, I would have to buy a lot of drops for my eyes just to recover from the stupid things that I'm going to see there.

and another thing is I got a mail which is called about... I will give you just the title of the mail, the subject of the mail. It says, maximize your ad performance through automation and account consolidation.

Live meta education. So the two things that they have a problem with. So meta wants to do live lives, educating people on how to do automations and account consolidation.

I really understand the concept of meta trying to explain the platform as an easy way of somebody doing ads. But the sad truth is that after iOS 14.5 changes, meta became super complex and you cannot just do simple things. Therefore, immediately I can see that it's trying to push the concept that this is a lazy job while it's not.

And it needs a lot of effort and a lot of strategies and problems with that. And I got a message from one or two people watching a podcast. There was a guy that he was saying that most agencies are making three campaigns, which I have seen it also.

It's going to be one retargeting, one ABO testing where they spent an enormous amount of money and another one which is going to be a cold traffic. and they don't do anything else. And this guy said that I'm doing 100 campaigns with 60, 70 dollars on each one of them and I'm spending all of my money like that.

I'm guessing that he's spending 6k per day or something like that and he's having good draws. Well, I'm saying this for the past three years. Of course, I don't have this famous podcast that this guy told it.

But yeah, I'm doing it for the past three years and he's right. It's not something that we didn't know. And I don't know if I'm sure about the 100 campaigns, but spending 6k, you can easily have 20 campaigns, 25.

Now, if he wants to do it with less, okay. The only thing that I want to mention here is that the ad accounts, they also have behaviors. Maybe his ad account is now trained on 50, 60 dollar campaigns and he's always doing that, which is totally fine.

I, even if I would go to his account, I wouldn't change it. I would do it. Whatever it works.

But I totally agree and I see more and more people coming out and talking about the fact that consolidation doesn't work while Facebook wants to push it. And what I really cannot understand is this. Why Facebook wants to push consolidation?

I can understand agencies pushing consolidation because they want to do less work and have more clients. Fine. but I don't understand why Facebook is pushing consolidation.

Is it trying to make the platform super easy for everybody to do ads so that it can be easy and take out the cost of hiring an expert so that they can do it and they can spend this money on the platform? I don't really understand it. I will never understand it.

And based on the fact that they talk also about automations and stuff on how to do it, I truly believe that it's all about trying to make the platform super easy for everybody to use. But guess what? It's not easy because somebody has to take also somebody to put their API if they're not using Shopify and so on.

So there are more things that happened after the iOS 14.5 and I didn't work with consolidation before. I'm not working now, of course, but you get my point. and be careful to what you see on other channels because there are people that they say this is what Meta said.

F*** off. If Meta said something like that, it doesn't mean that it's always true. Have you tested it?

I really hate it. This is the reason that I'm never going to join a meta group because it's always going to be somebody saying that this is what Meta says in the rules or whatever. F*** the rules.

If you're saying something different into your ad account and if it's working in a different way, if you are observing something different, don't follow what Meta says. Anyway, I think I lost a lot of time already on these. Let's go to your questions straight away.

Before we start, I have two questions here that I have seen. First guy says, Kostantinos Vriesis, can you make a video about Advantage Plus shopping? And he's laughing.

I hope that you are joking because I have already made six or seven videos and I'm making more and I'm going to make a new one. If you are mocking me for creating several Advantage Plus videos, fine. If you haven't seen them, you have to go and watch them.

I was talking in another video about personal accounts and how I believe that because now we have personal Facebook accounts and Meta is pushing the concept of having also professional accounts which I believe that it's a very clever idea for Meta to have more new accounts which means increase on the stock. There's a guy on the comments. Okay, bro.

You said good time to buy so I bought some options for November. So, guys, don't watch the things that they say and go buy stocks of Facebook because you just expect if it was like that then I have to put a disclaimer that whatever I say here it's not... I'm not a financial advisor and so on.

All the things that you have seen the disclaimers. Let's go to the next question. Hello, dear Konstantinos.

Jordan again with some questions about the training. Jordan is a very nice guy. I really like him and he's having some good questions.

What I really like is that Jordan is on the course, on the paid course and the way that he's thinking now and his answering stuff is completely different. He says, I see that one product I make a lot of sales, especially on weekends with a budget of 1,000. I generate between 4,000 and 5,500 and that's pretty good.

But during the week with the same budget only 1,500 to 3,000 depending on the day, sometimes I just break even. I could see that sometimes you manage accounts where you drastically increase the budget when companies have special offers, for example. How do you manage the campaigns at that time?

Do you create a lot of new ones just for the promotion and then cut them when the promotion is over? The answer is yes. You're having your established base with campaigns.

When they do a promotion, these are extra. When the promotion is over, you cut them and you continue with those. And always, when somebody is doing a promotion, you're putting also some new evergreen campaigns.

Evergreen means that you're putting campaigns that they can stay forever. basically. They have a general copy, general images and stuff that you can use forever.

And so that you can take also the data from the offer. But we're talking about massive accounts, okay? But even in an account with your spend, 1,000 to 1,000, I would do that.

I would put in every offer that I have as a promotion, I would put also some evergreen campaigns so that I can use them after the offer because they are going to be flooded with data. And then he says, if so, is it possible to apply this to weekends? Also, I'd like to know if I should do something special like lower the budget for the week, raise it again on the weekends, but I'm afraid that it would completely disrupt the campaigns and be hard.

Thanks for the clarification. So, about that, let me tell you that what I believe is that you need to have a base. You need to have a base, something that you find that it's very easy for you to maintain.

Okay? And maybe later, Facebook is going to let you increase this limit, but for now, let's say that this base is 800, 700. This base is going to stay like this no matter what.

You're going to keep it for the whole seven days. Even if you have a bad day, you're just going to absorb the damage and you're going to evaluate your results in the seven days. It's not a faucet that you open and close.

You need to fuel a link with data. and you cannot just go and lower the budget, increase the budget, lower the budget, increase the budget. Eventually, you're going to break the campaign.

So, you need to have some campaigns that they're working and establish them as a base. After that, if you want to spend more on weekend, you can do not a new campaign, but you can have some campaigns that you increase and you lower. Whenever they die because of this behavior, you're just going to relance them.

But you're going to have your base of 700, 800 and you're going to play with something else. Maybe one campaign that has very good results and you know that if you relance it, it's going to work again. This is how I would approach it and no, I wouldn't close or lower the budget on the weekdays.

Especially in your case, most of the people, they want to lower the budget on weekends which is two days. Maybe we can work with that. But in your case, lowering the budget for five days and increasing it again on weekend and stuff, I think it's going to be problematic.

Two days only on weekend just to launch a campaign for two days it doesn't make any sense. So I think that what I proposed earlier makes sense and you should use that. It's another way of looking at it actually.

I think I answered to him that. My view of media buying has changed a lot with your course and I feel that my view of e-commerce will also change. Thank you for that.

I have hardly ever had a loss-making day in the last year and for me it was always about being profitable. But I guess sometimes you have to accept that from one day per week to the next you have to go from ROAS 5 to ROAS 1. Also the situation in France is not great at the moment of strikes.

I guess that's also why the results during the week are not so good. But I guess sometimes you have to accept that from one day or week to the next you have to go from ROAS 5. No, you should not go from 5 ROAS to 1.

you can maintain it. If you see that you're dropping to one ROAS in these days you lower the budget. You go back to your normal ROAS you increase the budget after that.

Another interesting question I think. Let's say I have 10 outperforming interest in the last 7 days. 5 of which are the same.

For example fishing following the crazy method. All 10 have ROAS of 5 to 15 with quite a few sales. Say between 5 and 10 each.

Can I duplicate each of these ad sets in 10 new campaigns with a crazy method and relance for the next day 10 campaigns of 100 example or is this maybe too rust and horizontal scaling too aggressive? Yes, I think it's too aggressive. What I would do is this.

I would launch with my normal budget because also most probably right now you have into your mind how many assets you need with what kind of CBO budget so you have something like this into your head. So what I would do is I will take my best one. What does the best mean?

Not best ROAS ROAS and volume. Something that brings you the ROAS that you want but also volume. I would take the best one.

I would do crazy method. I would see if I could optimize it if it's working. Then the second best again and again and I will move like that building it up because doing so many campaigns at the same time it doesn't make any sense because you might push too much the threshold of the account and maybe you're not going to test properly.

So this is what I would do. I would do it one by one optimize then if it's working the other one the other one and I will always try to keep another campaign which is doing which I'm having interest there so that I can start testing for more candidates for my crazy method. Another one.

Hey Kostantinos I hope you're well. First of all I wanted to talk to you because I was able to really increase my ROAS since I started doing the crazy method. Thank you.

I've been able to go from a free failing ROAS to an average of 5 ROAS on a budget of 700-800 a day. In campaign optimization there are a few things I don't understand. I see that you always base your campaigns on 7 days but what do you do when you see a free-falling ROAS on all campaigns at the same time for 3-4 days.

I watched the video several times and I don't think that you're talking about that. If you could enlighten me it would be great because that's what happens and I feel like I'm losing too much on the profits maybe. It's not a tracking problem.

All my campaigns track sales well. It is really necessary to always use the last 7 days. Yes, it is.

Also, I optimize my campaigns with commonly based on UTMs. This is your mistake. You should not optimize with a third party.

You should optimize with what you see on the Facebook ads. this is what data Facebook is using to optimize. And sometimes Facebook will give sales to ad sets that actually didn't make any and vice versa.

How would you optimize the campaigns UTM or Facebook? Facebook. Example, commonly ROAS 2 interest on commonly with 2 sales on Facebook the same interest with 0 sales.

Should I leave it because I know it still makes sales? In my opinion no. If you see that it has checkouts you can leave it maybe in case that it's going to give late reporting.

But if it has 0 sales no. Don't leave it because it has 0 data for Facebook. We had the previous interview with Wicked Reports.

I told all that in the previous interview. The same interest with I don't know if I could cut it because I know in the end it didn't make any sales but since Facebook it did send the wrong signals to Facebook. I think that when I later on scan more I will take a coaching with you.

Thanks for your time. All the best to you Jordan. So these were the questions from Jordan and I think that I answered everything.

To be honest with you I think that if you watched the whole interview with Scott on the previous podcast I think that you will understand more. Let's go on some more. Basically these are this is a message that I got.

It says he's talking about shop ads. To be honest with you I hate shop ads. They don't work well.

Facebook wants to push them again. I don't know why. same.

I dropped 40k in shop ads. Huge issues with force creatives. They think they've stumbled upon something better.

It's awful. Average cost of purchase for 9 was 222 LOL. Normal ads.

5 to 45 worst case. So you're not the only one Donovan. There are a lot of people that they have a lot of issues with shop ads.

This is why nobody is doing them. I have 1 million spend and another one with 300k spend. They didn't work.

Now maybe in the future we will use them but it looks like they don't. The whole idea is that you keep all the data within Facebook so that you can have them and not lose any data. But to be honest with you the Facebook shops and Instagram shops are not converting very well.

It was a good idea but I think that it needs optimization in terms of the algorithm in order to make it work. Right now it doesn't work. Don't toss your money to shop campaigns.

Not even the website and shop. Just website. There's another message.

Hello finally I got Advantage Plus shopping yesterday. Really looking forward to scaling with your advice. Thanks again for sending all the consent.

Also let me know if you are I'm seeing more and more accounts getting the Advantage Plus which is very good. The thing here is this the Advantage Plus just just so you know all of you it's not something that you can contact the customer support and give you access to give you the Advantage Plus into your account it's something that is going to come slowly to accounts a lot of times I'm discussing with people and we try two weeks ago I believe that I did that into one of my accounts and it just came out of the blue without doing nothing so I haven't found any crazy recipe of doing it the only thing that I can say is that to be honest with you by spending by being a good boy and paying your bills and stuff most probably eventually you're going to have Advantage Plus and I right now let's go to the question of Simon Turko hello everyone quick question related to facebook ad account does the ad account learn or it is only the pixel and the ad set example I have two business managers let's call them business managers one business manager two in business manager one I have one other account in which I spent of a couple of K euros and one campaign is performing business manager two by the way this is something that a lot of people do as a backup plan because as soon as a business manager is going to be banned you can do nothing so sharing the pixel already there maybe it's going to help and you can still operate not all of the times still and another thing if you see that your rating is dropping on the page create many pages and start running from other pages instead of using the same one if I create a campaign in one ad account in business manager two using the third pixel of business manager one will I as soon as the asset will get data obtain similar results to the campaign that was performing in business manager one or should I create a new pixel and start from zero thanks a lot first of all they were having limits of 20 30 40 50 k spent and because I wanted to spend more daily on these accounts I was doing other ad accounts on the same business manager and on different business manager the results are this the ad account which is the main ad account spending all of this money it's always having the best results okay so the other ones have exactly the same months and stuff you spend 10k there and the other one which spends 50k has better results from the one that spends 10k period on that so that means that the ad accounts also get trained it's not only about the pixels this is how I came up to the conclusion that they get trained and then I had some experience with ad accounts that they were working only with lifetime budget just because this person was doing only campaigns with lifetime budget and so on so I wouldn't expect it to work as well as in the first business manager or ad account I would try it before doing a new pixel to be honest with you I wouldn't do a new pixel I would just expect to have lower results on the second business manager account and the best results on my main business manager account now if you want to go with the option of second pixel and stuff you need to think also that you're putting two pixels into your funnel which I think that Facebook penalizes it as a behavior you don't have two or three or four pixels in the same site and also then you have the aggregated events where your domain is going to be linked in one is going to be linked in one domain so all the aggregated events will be in one business manager and you cannot do it in another so maybe you can put two pixels there if you just keep four spots and four spots without the value optimization and anyway it's too technical let's continue Hi I have some campaigns running that was selling with nice CPA ROAS Advantage Plus but suddenly it almost stopped selling my CPA was about 70 and now it's 200 oh it's normal to advance plus stop selling yes of course it's normal to stop selling you just have to re-launch it you just have to optimize it how should I analyze and know when to stop this campaign and create a new based on the last 7 days if you're experienced you can watch metrics based on last 3 days I rarely mention the last 3 days because most of you are not experienced to do it and you're going to make bad decisions but I also look the last 3 days 2 days I look the tendency especially in this period in this weekend of 3 days I was watching the 3 days ratio and what I could do lowering the budget a little bit to control the situation because obviously I didn't know if it's going to hold 3 days or 5 days so yeah this is what I would do and in a new account can I use the same ads or should I use new ads you can use the same ads you can see and you have to test what is working in my opinion in whatever I do for example I don't do a new pixel because I want to see if the is working I don't do new ads because I want to see if the olds are working whatever I have seen working I want to use it again and again then we have below an answer yes them to normal advantage plus requires a wide range of creatives and budget as of now that's what they have observed so far it give results initially but they dropped massively after some period stop the but don't speak in a way that that you are saying that this is happening with all accounts okay say in my account when I'm doing this and that when I'm doing this and that blah blah so it says don't rely on advantage plus until you have good pixel data and a big budget if you have both you can scale your campaigns to increase ROAS if not I suggest you to I can tell you that there are new ad accounts that do advantage plus if it's working and it's dying relance it relance it relance it what he's trying to say is that we have broad targeting in advantage plus for example he's not covering even but but he's just one of my viewers okay he never learned how to talk in general because for example somebody from Switzerland is watching this and he can do advantage plus immediately because the potential reach over there with broad targeting is small he's talking most probably for United States that the broad advantage plus targeting needs a trend pixel so it's better to go with CBO campaigns interests and so on use them then lookalikes and then go to advantage plus let's check all of the different cases if your if your targeting is small in a country you can go immediately to advantage plus there are also accounts that they work immediately with advantage plus because they have organic sales already and they have some data in the pixel or even accounts that they kickstarted they worked immediately with advantage plus because they had lower CPMs and they it helped them work with the competition if advantage plus is not working at all yes you you should go to CBO you should go to Interests you should go to lookalikes after that and so on but always ultimate call it would be to reach to broad targeting even if this is CBO even even if this is advantage plus let me tell you that there are accounts that advantage plus it is not working so we do only CBO there so there are many different cases and and it's not an issue you just you're just going to relance it then having such a different bump it means that yes it lost optimization it is very typical with new pixels for this to happen because the new pixels might lose optimization super fast so you can relance them it's fine and then if you have a new pixel it doesn't mean that advantage plus cannot work you can go forget that your biggest tool over here with new pixels and advanced plus is the relance of the campaigns because it's going to help you a lot then we'll go to the next comment great content thank you with success of advanced plus shopping how are you locating budgets between advanced plus and dynamic creative campaigns it really depends if I see that my CBO campaigns my crazy method and everything is working properly I keep pushing the concept maybe on 50-50 maybe if I want to scale it also depends on the scaling if I want to scale more and more I use something like 70-30 on advanced plus that means that I will use almost zero retargeting because advanced plus is stealing all the retargeting but if you go to big budgets maybe you can go only with advanced plus after some point and move up with advanced plus only because it's easier okay can you do it with CBOs yes but it needs more knowledge more optimization better knowledge of big budgets and CBO crazy method and so on with advanced plus I think it's going to be easier for anyone to scale to 5K 6K 10K per day with CBOs it's much more difficult it needs much more experience so it really depends on the results that you get but I think that I replied hi if I want to do a campaign in broad but I have several creatives who have a different marketing what do you mean by different marketing different interests it is a good idea to make a first campaign with a marketing angle and let's say 3 creatives and to make another campaign always in broad with the other marketing angle 2 creatives or is useless is it better to put all the creatives inside the same campaign I would put all of them in the same campaign don't forget that we have the tool of advantage plus crazy method that you can take one of them that is working very well and put it as a crazy method you can see my video yeah this is what I don't think that you should separate them let them compete with each other let the best win and of course if you see my videos and you know how to optimize the advantage plus you can direct the spend to the best one next one thanks for the information sounds very interesting about the duplicating campaign for the purpose of scaling with a new budget higher from the first one do I switch interests or keep the same interest um thanks again for the next sounds very interesting about the duplicating campaign for the purpose of scaling with a new budget higher from the first campaign do I switch interest or keep the same interest and I reply same and optimize all over again so what's the point of changing interest when you duplicate something that is working so that you can put a bigger budget to it it doesn't make the original campaign it looks like to me it looks to me like it will be a competition against myself if everything is the same but the budget and the same please google and watch my crazy method video now whoever is talking about competition with myself is just a very stupid thing that Facebook is pushing that you are competing with your own ads this is bull guys you are targeting 100 million people 50 million people whatever in your different interests and we cannot talk about competition with ourselves because at the end of the day I'm using the crazy method and everything else and you can target different hot pockets even with the same ad set several times if you see the crazy method video you will understand that all of this is a myth and the crazy method is working flawlessly and you can see the comments below and understand that it is working for a lot of people the thing is that saying that you're competing with yourself it means that you don't understand how big are the numbers on Facebook in order for you to compete with yourself you need to spend millions in a very short period in order to compete with yourself and I have videos that I spend 1 million and I show that over there it really makes sense and even when you target cold with broad targeting the frequency is rising and everything you need to spend a lot of money in order to do that and it's not happening and at so don't worry about competing with yourself because there's a huge market there so that you won't compete with yourself and a lot of people to target maybe you will target some 2 or 3 times but it doesn't matter do you know why because all that matters is the ROAS if the ROAS is good then it doesn't matter can you edit placements inside a dynamic ad for example can use 16x9 image for stories and another file for feed so he's referring to the normal ads that you can put different creative for the stories different creative for the feed and stuff no you cannot do that with dynamic creative ads what you should do though is that when you use one by one you should look on the image to so this is the image let's say on the top and bottom it has these gaps over here that you need to not put any information because in stories mode maybe it's going to be cut or not so be careful with that I think that Facebook in their page they have the safe zones that you need to keep when you are using one placement that is going to be adjusted to for just search it you will find it just put save zones for Facebook creatives for feed and stories then we have Tim over here great idea quick question with regards to CRO in your experience does Facebook allow exit intent or time delayed popups that have proven to significantly increase conversion rates I'm wondering though if this will put your ad account at risk many things so Tim first of all it's not proven that they help conversion rates it's how you use them because I can see them in several accounts being super annoying and of course you're talking about the landing page no they're not helping a lot of times and they're making situation even worse but I can tell you that this has nothing to do with Facebook Facebook is not penalizing any behavior like that this has to do with the funnel and the optimization that you will do there so do whatever you want as long as it's helping the conversion and it's not limiting your possibilities of converting because Facebook is all about sending the traffic to the store after that it's about you and your funnel so we have Thomas the sniper hey Kostantinos I started a testing product on a with open targeting and I'm getting sales but not very consistent super typical with new pixels and everything starting especially with broad targeting you will get some sales lost it get some sales lost it's all about being consistent it's not by luck that they close all of my videos by saying be consistent would you recommend testing interest as well the product of course I would recommend as I said earlier in is not working at all test your interest if it's working a little bit continue with relaunching relaunching relaunching but yes in most accounts if you have interest to use because several niches don't use interests then try to go to lookalikes and then try to go eventually to broad The product is pretty generic so there is no specific niche I can target other than specific demographics so I thought it's best to run keep targeting open as long as it's working and it has sales do it try to focus on creatives and try to do advantage plus or targeting crazy method however you're doing trying to lower the demographics if you're targeting only women and that based on the analysis that you do breakdown see what kind of ages are working and break it down so that you can lower a little bit because the new pixels need smaller potential interest and then the more you get the consistent results start opening more of course the ultimate call here is to go to lookalikes so that you can keep having consistent sales and then train your pixels so that you can go to broad targeting again if you don't have interests for a specific niche I wouldn't target interests immediately because it's like targeting broad I'm guessing that you're going to use super broad terms other than that yeah I think that I answered another guy Zan I got my personal Facebook account restricted with posts going to bottom of feeds for 30 days would this restriction apply to the 4 pages I managed and linked Instagram I have contacted meta agents to ask this but for some reason they can never give a clear answer you will never find a specific topic on YouTube because nobody knows maybe they're going to restrict all of them maybe one of them it really depends so Facebook used to ban people people not accounts but people so if they ban you personally you're going to lose all of that if they just going to ban one page and not you personally as a personal account most probably the other ones are going to be fine I have seen business managers that they have bad rating in one page so they create others and they run the ads from the other pages the page got banned the other one still exists so I think that you will be fine unless if they're going to ban you personally where they're going to hand you whatever you're going to do even a new business manager and then talking about the bad results on March hi everyone just a quick question someone I know sets our ads for our business and they haven't made any changes to the campaign recently yet our cost per lead has doubled this week results have been poor over the last few weeks and suggestions will be greatly appreciated so this is a normal thing that I see when things are going bad with Facebook I I see a lot of messages coming to me telling me that I have a problem and so on so to be honest with you there's nothing that you can do about it but the sad truth is that you don't have the luxury of knowing it having a lot of accounts and understanding that this is happening globally or having a friend or two that they tell you I have the same problem or me having you guys coming and tell me I have this problem I understand that the problem is general but in your case you don't have this luxury and I know that there are a lot of people that are going to make a lot of mistakes in this period because they're not going to be patient or they're going to be afraid but it is what it is and this is how Facebook works at the end of the day all of these things that people do people advertise and so on so it makes total sense that when Facebook has a very good period everybody tells to everybody they come they advertise the results are becoming worse because of competition and then when the results are bad people are stopping ads and we are having good results again it's all about being consistent as I said and having nerves of still watching the situation and try to maintain the best possible on based on this balance so these things are happening all the time what I would do is that I would wait as soon as you gather information for friends for my podcast and stuff that things are getting better relance it optimize it all over again then we have Tim you are the best and most ethical Facebook ads channel on YouTube at the moment thank you well done Konstantinos I'm sure you and I think that he's making three after that when optimizing a CBO oh no it's just the title CBO crazy method campaign how do you determine the optimal starting budget if you have no spending limit first of all by experience to be honest with you I'm watching a little bit I'm watching a little bit the cost acquisition that I'm having in the account what is possible for example can I get $20 cost per purchase in a campaign consistently okay then I will try to put as many assets so that they can get that and a little bit more so that I can try to have some options to optimize and after that point I will start seeing is it spending too fast is it spending too low does it take too much time to give me results do I need to make the process faster if I need to make the process faster and the spending I will remove one or two assets in my next relaunch of the campaign if it's going too fast I will add some assets so that I can distribute more of the budget between assets and try to find in a more smooth way the assets that I want to keep and optimize this is how I would define the budget first you think the budget then you think the assets that you have then you test it and then eventually you see the numbers of this account each account has different numbers of budgets and assets also I will try to see does a CBO campaign of 200 works maybe it needs a smaller campaign of 100 and then optimize it and leave I never said that CBO optimization is easy I have time and spending money to master it. From some of my students it takes more than a year to reach to my level.

And then of course it's the talent which comes also because it's not about only learning from Konstantinos it's your personal talent and how you perceive things and your creativity. then let's say you are highly profitable on average from the start and you want to scale how do you determine the new budget when duplicating the campaign? It's very simple since we're talking about CBO over here by the way in Advantage Plus if you want to scale you want to scale by duplicating or by increasing the budget because it's just one ad set and you can do so.

In CBO it's different you cannot increase the budgets I would keep them as they are but what I would try to do is I would try to go with most of the times double the budget so if I'm spending 100 I will go with 200 then I will go with if the 200 is working with 500 eventually Facebook is not going to let you do well in some of these campaigns so you're also seeing the limits of the CBO that you can spend. there are other accounts not because they are trained but because they are spending for a lot period that you can do CBO campaigns with $2000 and there are other accounts that you are doing CBO campaigns with $200 and they are not working well because they want just a lot with $100 so it really depends you need to check and see if one of these new budgets and bigger budgets is going to work if you can optimize how many assets you need in the new situation with 200 assets if they go fast or slow and so on and slow and so on and so on it's a process theme and if you watch the video of the crazy method they have the CBO optimization there I have examples that I explain how it's working obviously the main thing here is to keep campaigns as a base and move to the next one to the next one without touching the one that's already working let's go to Steve here are you stacking top 4 countries in one ad set for Advantage Plus or separate campaigns for each country no I don't the reasons are two first of all they don't have the same potential reach if you put United States with whatever else most probably it's going to spend all the money on the United States because it's bigger the countries are also working like the interests the bigger they are Facebook it's easier to spend there so it's going to spend more money there unless if you put United States with Pakistan and India which have lower CPM so Facebook is going to go there but if we talk about the top 4 countries which of course we are referring to Australia, United States, United Kingdom and Canada that means that you should not group them together another thing that I don't like is the day of the hour that they set their prime hours are different so what I would do is I would group if I want United States with Canada which is not correct because of the first thing that I said so I would do differently Canada and United States at the end of the day these are things that they help you scale okay and you should not approach these campaigns as they are as they are the same thing or you should approach them as a different budget the reset of the hour is different for example in another if you reset your ads at 12 o'clock United States and you are running ads also for Australia they are going to reset in a bad time for the daily spend another thing is that the prime hours over there they are not going to be the same as the prime hours on United States which we know that after 5, 6, 7 o'clock up to 12 o'clock it's the best hour of the day because people go back from work to home and so on so these are the reasons that I wouldn't stack them together I know that back in the day some years ago we were stacking them but I wouldn't do it anymore for these reasons that I mentioned especially for the situation that we have right now with United Kingdom easily alone Canada easily alone United States alone and Australia alone at the end of the day it's going to be different campaigns that you are going to optimize differently and as I said in my other videos if your spends are high I would even go with different pixels and different ad accounts for these countries for the reasons that I mentioned about the time zone and the time that the ads are going to reset if you don't have the luxury of doing it at least use them on different campaigns so that you can optimize them differently then we have Moreno Music Hi bro it's my first time in your channel thanks for the tips thank you man I have a few questions if you don't mind what countries will you recommend me to target to get out of the learning phase on Facebook ads faster I'm promoting a Latin song Urban Urban Urban is the Prime Minister of Hungary not Urban on Spotify how many adsets should I do and how much money per day should I spend the the learning phase has nothing to do with the country that you target but since you talk about Latin I would propose you to you know a very fast way of targeting minorities in United States for example is to put abroad targeting with Spanish for example as the language the only thing that you will do so we use the language as an interest or you can put Greek for example as a language if you target the Greek community in United States I think that this is a very fast way for you to go into your target audience while you are not targeting a very huge audience so this is my suggestion to you the learning phase has nothing to do with the country that you target you should and we already touched on the things about the countries in the different question next one hello Konstantinos quick question for you you said in a video that some of your clients with very big accounts can get CPMs in the US as low as 5 yes I'm showing these accounts on several videos is it due to their ad account history or their page both maybe my website would be a customer scene with such cost I understand it's not because of that the specific account that I have in my mind right now it's in the niche of Christianity in the previous March March or April I don't remember we had the removal of all the Christian of all the LGBTQ interest Christian interest everything so at that point it became a cartel so whoever had a lot of data in this niche Christianity or whatever and they had a trained pixel right now they don't have new entries new competition and even if they have this new competition is going to spend a lot of money and it's going to do it with with spending spending or having other ways of getting organic traffic training the pixel and then targeting again so it's better from the people that they're going to be dropshippers or whatever and they're going to work and the Christianity is a very popular niche that right now is being underserved because of that so they have very low CPMs because the pixel is trained there are no interest for new players to come and target into this market and basically they're controlling the market and there are how many companies there are with trained pixels and it's only them no new people coming because even if one dropshipper two dropshippers three dropshippers with ten, twenty, fifty, thirty dollars per day come all of this together the new people they are still competition it's not the same to have a trained pixel in the Christian niche and a trained pixel in the dog niche it's not the same at all and in the dog niche you're having the new competition the new people that are coming and it's one of the or travel niche or whatever it's one of the niches that is being heavily advertised so this is the reason that we are seeing lower CPMs and it has nothing to do with the page it has nothing to do with anything else but it's due to the fact that we have a niche which cannot be targeted by new players in the game but only for from trained pixels and they have let's say a sort of monopoly we have Thomas the Sniper again Hey Konstantinos I have an issue with daily spending limits so maybe you could give me some advice Facebook keeps channing my daily limit from day to day so for example three days ago I was able to spend 130 the next day 50, next day 85 and today 50 again support won't help me either so is there nothing that can be done here best wishes Thomas So Thomas first of all I would like to know if you're running ads with cost caps or whatever because if you do you are not going to spend all the money you're going to spend as much as Facebook wants so if you run with cost caps or value optimization or whatever then of course you're not going to spend and the way that you say it here maybe it means that secondly I would like to say that and the only reason that I think that maybe you also have problem with the limit but not in such pattern most probably you have cost caps I have seen in 100 accounts starting with an open limit and then some days later coming and saying 50 per day and to be honest with you you can do nothing about the limit because it's not in your hand even if you contact the customer support and staff they just going to increase your limit whenever they feel that you are not a threat for the community which means that you have to be a good boy do normal ads not rejected ads and pay your bills in time so based on that if you have problems with your spending limit there's nothing to do nobody can do anything to you it's going to be increased and you cannot increase it through customer support back in the days there are times that I was contacting customer support I was telling them that they want to increase it they were watching some data and they were increasing it now they don't even do that then we go to I would say just Trivedi Purvance Trivedi I don't know do I have to create a new Advantage Plus campaign every time I want to test a new creative or can I add them into the existing campaign will that screw the algorithm not the algorithm but your campaign you cannot add new creatives inside an Advantage Plus campaign because the Advantage Plus has already been focusing all the budget to one or two or three ads and it's not fair for the others so if you have a budget of $500 and it's spending $450 $460 $480 on the main leading ads you cannot put other ads there because it's not going to spend them you have to do a new campaign with your new creatives or relunch this one with a new creatives whatever but it's not fair and you're not going to test them properly another thing unless if you go and you close all of them and you put some new ones but I don't see the reason of doing that for example I create one Advantage Plus campaign this campaign and they keep adding ads into that for testing purchase no this is something that people were doing in ABO campaign stuff and I'm still against that after a couple of days I take the winners and duplicate them into the other campaign and just keep adding and why you should not keep this campaign that has winners and do another campaign with the new ones I don't understand the other campaign and why you should not keep this campaign that has winners and do another campaign with the new ones I don't understand your way of thinking or should I create a whole new campaign every time for testing a new campaign for scaling yeah the second one so I think that I replied we go to Felipe Caceres hey this is an awesome video man thank you I set up the first Advantage Plus campaign as you suggested how would you scale the budget of the first campaign before duplicating it for example I set my Advantage Plus campaign on 60 per day it has now been 7 full days and it's above my break-even ROAS would you suggest the budget 20% in 7 days or double it etc thank you so several ways of doing it first of all the 20% that he is referring to is the ABO optimization Facebook says that if you pass a learning phase and you have and you increase the budget every 7 days or every 2-3 days on 20% and this is not going to mess up your learning phase so the thing is that you spend only 6 per day what I would do is that I think that you still have possibility of increasing it I wouldn't do 20% per day to be honest with you I don't believe that with 60 per day you are passing the learning phase but anyway I would do 100 in order to see if it can support it don't forget that you can always launch it if it's going to break another thing is that the Advantage Plus is a campaign that because it's focusing on 1 or 2 ads you can increase the budget just like that so it's not a problem like a CBO campaign and I wouldn't like to run an Advanced Plus with 60 I think it's very slow so I would increase it now I wouldn't care so much about the 20% I would care more about understanding and learning the ad account and knowing how much I can do and then the other thing that you can see is this what kind of ROAS do I get if I want 2 ROAS and I'm getting 3 ROAS that means that I can increase if I'm getting 2.1 ROAS I wouldn't increase at all I would leave it just like this I would duplicate the campaign and run it all over again so it really depends also on the ROAS that you're getting and if they're good or bad and if you can increase or not it really depends on the ROAS to be honest with you but even in duplication campaign I would try with 100 this time just so that I can establish a higher starting budget then another one I spent hours watching your videos your YouTube videos and I have to say you're the best I have watched all thank you I'm trying the crazy method for the first time today I would like to ask a question I have a fantastic campaign advantage plus campaign running with 10.9 ROAS good for you I would like that means that you can scale basically it's not good for you it means that you're losing potential but okay I would like to duplicate the ad set but I'm unable to as advantage plus does not allow me to do this you cannot duplicate an ad set advantage plus is running with only one ad set of course what is the best way to scale up a successful advantage plus for info the successful campaign only has one ad running which is doing very well thanks so much and keep up the good work everything else that they say about scaling advantage plus cannot work here but I have a video which we do advantage plus crazy method you duplicate your ad several times inside 10 15 you keep the same budget you keep the same structure everything in your advantage plus and this time you go deep inside how to learn to optimize with advantage plus by watching all of my videos I think you should watch them and learn how to optimize because it's a little bit you just need to understand it okay so try to see my video about the crazy method of advantage plus and in general all my advantage plus videos because you have 10.9 ROAS you don't use the full potential of your account you can scale more it's better to have it's better to spend 100,000 with 3 ROAS instead of spending 10.9 ROAS instead of having 10.9 ROAS with only spending 5k next question next question are these accounts are these accounts where advantage plus isn't working is advantage plus so to start there are other accounts that advantage plus is not working yes in most accounts it is working it has lower CPMs the problem is on new ad accounts on new ad accounts maybe you have problems because it's broad targeting and maybe you have to go to CBO and interest in my opinion you should have a balance between CBO and advantage plus unless if advantage plus has crazy results and then it doesn't matter you just do advantage plus campaigns but yes in some new accounts it can be slow because of the fact that it's broad targeting you should go through the traditional way of interest look-alikes and broad targeting crazy method and even advantage plus but even when the look-alikes are going to work I would start using advantage plus even if it's dying fast and I had to relance it all the time because it has lower CPMs and of course then you have to look on not doing retargeting and so on because advance plus is still solid retargeting I think we covered a lot of advantage plus today last question Hey Konstantinos, thank you so much for your wisdom my mind is blown Thank you man We're an artisanal jewelry company and have been loving advance plus campaigns since we first jumped on board in December you're not the only one what we realized though is that after making the first campaign we never set an existing customer budget cap we have a very strong remarketing funnel through email and SMS we primarily want to use Facebook ads for acquisition with a bit of content marketing to continue warming up audiences do you recommend using the feature and if so what is the minimum percentage you'd recommend I'm worried Facebook might be allocating way too much budget to existing customers thank you so much in advance Thank you Logosky So the truth is that advance plus is stealing a lot of sales from retargeting this is a fact we know it we have seen it with direct links that we have with other ways and everything we have seen it that when we have a lot of advance plus and we do retargeting retargeting is not working properly and so on what I want to say to this is that you should not care about that because even if it's stealing sales from retargeting and these sales are being used so that you can acquire more cold traffic customers and purchases then it is fine this is something that I can easily live with the same way that I can live with doing automatic placements if the results are better even if Facebook is stealing some money in the process I'm fine with it so let it take all the sales if it wants don't do retargeting if you still want to do retargeting be okay with the fact that advance plus is going to steal some sales here and there and it's going to use it as data in order to find more cold traffic audience now I'm just saying that so that you should not be worried about that okay also yesterday I answered to your comment that I told you to watch the podcast so most probably you had to watch all of this to find your answer sorry but you were the last question at that point the other thing that I have to say is that he is referring to there is a feature it's not in all accounts yet by the way there is a feature for advantage plus that you can say because they have listened to all of this whining about advance plus stealing sales from retargeting we want only cold traffic which I'm against but Facebook said okay we're going to put a feature that we're going to say that you are not going to retarget x amount of or maybe I think it says you're going to target only this percentage of existing customers something like that most of the settings that they have seen is 50-50 so they put 50% they say I want to target only the 50% of my existing customers then we have the rules that we always have of 80% new customers 20% retargeting or 70-30% retargeting so these are also percentages that you can use in my opinion I'm not using it if you want to use it because you have a very sophisticated way of retargeting I would even do 100% but don't be amazed that your results are going to drop maybe you should try playing a little bit with this percentage in order to see what is the good balance I would start with 30% and then try to move my way up to 50% to see if it's working yeah this is what I would do but at the end of the day in my accounts I'm not even touching it when I see it because I'm okay with Facebook stealing some sales in order to get me more cold traffic sales let it steal it's fine let's go to Freelancer Diaries I have three things here first of all we have Facebook advertising genius needed when you see genius wizard how is the other one super saiyah or whatever there is a problem it says hi there I need someone good at optimizing Facebook ads to improve performance if you are not a genius at Facebook marketing I need you to at least be a smart pants all jokes aside here is my problem what used to cost me 22 for a message ad on Facebook he doesn't say when maybe this is on 2015 okay it's now costing us 43 per message maybe it's because of February and February March and what happened I own a personal training fitness company so I need local leads for people with money to spend on personal training everybody wants to target people with money okay I can't seem to figure out why costs are up so I need someone help with fixing the issue and improve quality leads now the reason that I'm putting this on Freelancer Diaries is because of the way that he's writing it and because of the smarty pants of course but most probably you know asking someone that hey I have one ROAS and I want two ROAS it's difficult asking somebody taking your cost per message from 43 to 22 it's kind of difficult and even if it's a genius or Einstein or whatever most probably it's not going to happen unless if it is seasonal because there are a lot of times that somebody comes to your account it's not working because he's unlucky he's in a bad period and then somebody else comes he's doing exactly the same things it's working because he was fortunate enough to work in a period that Facebook was doing well then we go to the next one optimize the Facebook ads for higher conversion local moving company looking for an experience and I put all of this in Freelancer Diaries just to show also that in Upwork we have this trend of very expensive ads which means that everybody almost struggled in the period of March to be honest with you there was only 5-6 days for the good pixels local moving company looking for an experienced Facebook ad specialist to help us optimize our campaign for higher conversions we're currently at $10 per conversion Facebook message and would like to get closer to one too this is even worse he wants to get from $10 to $12 which most probably is not going to happen and he says the job will include researching and setting optimal target audiences for ads setting Facebook ad settings and doing any other work necessary to make ads run more efficiently to be honest with you I think that these people are always getting scammed because it's like you are asking for somebody so let's go also to the next one it says Facebook ad expert need to help get CPA under $1 for middle gravel novel so it's like you're asking I'm posting this job and I'm looking for the best scammer in the world that is going to convince me that what am I asking is possible to happen and I'm looking for the best liar who is going to serve it very well to me so that I can believe him pay him, scam me along the way and not telling me the truth that this is not possible and I guess with this crazy job post that they are asking Earth and Water we're going to close the podcast I feel... how much time do we do?

79 79 okay I tried to go as fast as I could so I think I did well based on how many questions we had I think I did well I'm exhausted my throat is hurting I will see you guys in the next podcast most probably we're going to talk about pixels there and because they're going to be removed in the API but we will see be creative, be consistent let me know if you have any questions on the comments and I will see you in the next one and see you in the next one This was the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast Like it or not, it is what it is! your book is coming up that's always goodups colouring that amount of time it goes over to decade
