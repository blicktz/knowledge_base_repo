Αυτά Blessed Deερ Tracknemurp είναι γεία. So, I think that you need to start seeing also conversion rate into your ads and start deciding in which side you are. And if you're not happy with that, start working and start making either your funnel better or your creatives better.

And start having a better understanding of your whole funnel and not just throwing ads here and there without understanding in which side you are. Okay, now you know and you don't have an excuse about your funnel and how well it's converting. I think that you will find the video about conversion rates super interesting.

I'm not going to go into more details because over there I'm showing actually an actual account. Also, if you're watching this video in YouTube, we're going to put a link on the description about it. Yeah, that's it.

So, let's go to another topic. I have a very good account right now that I'm working with in Germany. I made a video, I believe, about it recently about manual bidding and how it's working there.

I want to make three remarks about it. First of all, that this is the video about the spending limit that I had on 20k and it stopped me. right now after the lift and of course after the Christmas period and right now I'm spending 35k per day over there alone.

And of course manual bidding is helping a lot to that. But I was wondering what would have happened if I wasn't stopped with the spending limit on 20k during Black Friday. Most probably I would explore the account.

Anyway, still now the spending limit is on 50k which I'm trying to see if I can get there. But there are two things that I want to point out based on that. First of all, sorry, a lot of times we talk about the markets for example and stuff and we say Germany for example.

It's a smaller market, it's not like United States. Because we are always thinking about United States as a big whale, we're just neglecting how much other accounts can be scaled. And in my book I also mention a lot of times that our brain is calibrated to understand smaller numbers.

So when we say that I saw in a room $1 million, if you haven't seen it, you are never able to actually understand how it looks, how big it is. The same it goes with the e-commerce. A lot of times we are hearing that the supplement market which is the niche that this account is working, it's a market of $3.5 trillion for example.

Just a number. This is such a huge number that we just understand that it's a big number. We don't understand how huge it is.

So a lot of times we hear about, yeah, but there's a saturation on the market. Bullshit! Okay?

This account spending $35k per day in Germany is just crazy. There are other accounts that they're spending $2k, $3k, $5k, $10k per day on the United States. And we talk about saturation and stuff like that and about frequency and stupid things like that.

All of these are excuses. It means that your product is not trending enough. It means that your funnel is not working as it should.

Your creatives are not so good. It means all of this. So there are endless opportunities for companies that they're working all the time on improving on products, packaging, customer support, cooperation with influencers, working in several platforms, doing their posts every day, having brand ambassador programs, affiliations, having also different platforms that they're working with, doing ads.

And of course, working on Facebook ads and everything. And the possibilities of working with several different products. The possibilities here are endless.

And there are such big markets that we're not even scratching the surface with a lot of products that we are having. The situation is this. In order to understand if you are asking too much, the best thing to do is this.

Go and Google, for example, how much is the supplement market on the Germany, on e-commerce. You will get a number, let's say, of 200 billion every year. And then see with your spend rate now what kind of percentage you are getting out of this market.

And then you will understand how small this is compared to where you can get. Let me tell you that there are companies that they are taking 20% of the market, 30% of the market. And in order for you to understand that is just an excuse that you put to yourself about the saturation and everything.

I think that the most important is to go and do the comparison with percentages. What am I asking? What is the percentage of the market that I'm asking in the current product that I have?

And if you are seeing that this is just a very small fraction, then try to become better in order to get a better percentage out of it. Of course, with this account, I will keep scaling and manual bidding is helping a lot. And the results are very good because the break-even is on 2.3.

We are on 3.5 consistently and we are scaling more. Of course, for the ones that they know from my channel how manual bidding is working, it's not like you just increase the budget just like this. It has a procedure and a lot of work which is involved daily.

But yeah, who would have thought that? When I took the account, by the way, it was spending one key per day. Okay.

And the owner couldn't understand that these numbers are achievable. And you will never be able to understand them until you do it. I wasn't able to understand it also at the start when I was starting doing Facebook ads that these numbers do exist.

Because our minds are calibrated to smaller numbers. We cannot understand how much we can scale. And yes, scaling an account to 100K, it's something that most of the people that are listening to the podcast, maybe at some point in their life, I hope for your own businesses or for other owners working as freelancers you're going to do.

But scaling an account to 1 million per month. Let me tell you that I have done it two times. Not consistently.

Not for, let's say, five, six months consistently. Okay, the next month I was having 800K, but the 1 million thing and stuff, it's different. But it is achievable.

It's not a crazy thing to think of. And you need to see it in order to unblock your mind and think that this is not possible, for example. Okay, because in theory, everybody says that this can be a 100 million dollar company, for example, but they don't understand what is the percentage that is going to come from Facebook ads or from other ads from that.

So, in my opinion, I think that you need to understand that these numbers are achievable. I have case studies inside my YouTube channel that I show you that these numbers are achievable. And you should not be afraid to scale whenever you're having good results because whenever Facebook is giving you the space, you should take the space.

One last note to that. If you have seen my manual bidding videos, of course, we cannot go into details into this podcast about technical, about how the manual bidding is working. You can watch the videos.

But I have realized another way. So, basically, the manual bidding is working with a one-day click. I have found a way with a seven-day click.

So, you go, you put value optimization. Again, you're putting, you're taking one of your best ads that are actually working. The structure here is, guys, that you're doing normal campaigns with a crazy method, whatever you want, stack lookalikes in CBO campaigns.

Then you take those, you put them in manual bidding with the videos that I have in my channel and in my course, and I show you how to do them and stuff. And then you start playing with manual bidding, which needs much more experience. And then you can take the one consistent ad with the placement that it has and the targeting that it has.

And you take it and you put it in a new campaign where you're playing this time with a value. So, what you're doing is you're putting it in a new campaign, the one ad that you have. You're duplicating four times.

And then you're putting different value options to each one of the ad sets. I know that for most of you, this is super technical to understand, but at least for the three, four people that they will understand it, I think it's going to be super informative, let's say. So, you're putting in a CBO campaign with a big budget like 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

It doesn't matter because it's not going to spend all of it. You're putting four ad sets with your best ad sets that you have. And this time in the value optimization, if your target, for example, that you see that is working in the accounts, in the account and you're getting good results is three ROAS.

You're putting the first ad set three ROAS. The other has a value optimization. Instead of conversion value optimization of 2.9, the next one 2.8, the next one 2.7.

So, you have four ad sets with three, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7. You're having those. and those actually are the ones that they're going to run in a CBO campaign with seven days click this time.

Let me tell you that it's not spending all of that. And let me tell you what happened with one of the many tests that I have done. I put a 5,000 budget on one of them.

This time I put three ad sets with different values on it. One of them actually started working very well and it spent 4,500 after two days in just one day. I increase the budget to 10K.

I go the next day and I see that it spent 10,800. So, even more than the 10K that I put. The next day I put it on 20K to see if it's going to spend.

It didn't spend 20K, sadly. It spent 8K, 800 and yesterday it actually spent 11K. So, I'm going to try to see if it's going to go now to 20K.

I don't know. But I can tell you that since that point when I saw this kind of scaling, I'm testing this strategy with four ad sets, four different value options and seven day click. With a CBO optimization this time, not ABO based on what we were doing back with the manual bidding.

And I'm testing it in other accounts and it seems to be working. Because one of those with a different value option is going to work. It's also very good for accounts that you don't know what is the actual correct value to put on your manual bidding.

to actually go and with that way try to test and see which is the sweet spot. Do you need 2.9 in order to get your goal that you want? Do you need 2.5, 2.6 ROAS as value optimization to do it?

Then this is what you should put. Just a quick note to that. In order for you to be able to do this kind of things with manual bidding and everything and value optimization, in your aggregated events, you need to have the value button as toggled on.

So that you will be able to see this kind of options into your conversion ads. Aggregated events into the events manager. and over there in the aggregate events, the purchase event, it has a switch and you have to put it on in order for you to...

And of course for the new accounts, manual bidding is not for new accounts, it's for experienced people and for bigger accounts. And let me tell you that in the manual bidding, in order for you to do manual bidding, you need to have some data into your ad account. and in the new ad accounts with new pixels, you will not be able to have this option on.

It will need some data until some point you will be able to turn it on. Now, I think that I feel that this was super technical, but I don't care. Even if it helps some people that they are super technical, that's good.

And I know based on the comments and based on the people who send me messages, that there are some people that they are watching the podcast that they are super technical. So this is for you. Sorry for all the others that they didn't understand anything of what I said for the past 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

Now, let's go to some lighter subjects. One thing that I wanted to point out, it was one experience that I had with a past client. And so when the year changed, I sent some messages to my clients and some past clients saying, Happy New Year, I wish you the best and everything.

So one of them replied and they told me that they are furious with Facebook and stuff. I asked, they stopped working with me. I asked, why are you furious and everything?

They told me that Facebook is so inconsistent and stuff. Not anything new. We knew about that anyway.

And they told me also that they have some ads, but they are not doing well and stuff. And I asked him who is doing them now, because apparently I wasn't doing them because we stopped the corporation. And she told me that I found a person who is doing them for free.

And when we will have some good results, then I'm going to start paying him or her. Blah, blah, blah. So I told him that I wished them the best and that was it.

By the way, with me, her ads were profitable, but she didn't want to pay my fee. So that was the issue. So she went with someone else and the ads are not profitable now.

and it's not about that. It's about the mentality and it's not about the fact that she didn't want to pay me the fee and everything. That's totally fine.

But the mentality that I'm taking someone who doesn't get paid, it means that this person is actually getting paid with another way. What is this way? That he's getting the experience from your account.

He's spending your money in order to learn. That means that he doesn't know enough. Do you think that the person like me who has the experience that he has, it's going to work for someone for free?

There's no way. Because I know who I am. I know what kind of results I have.

I'm not going to work with someone for free. Who is going to work with someone for free? Someone who doesn't know and wants to learn.

Of course, if I was starting right now, I would start, I would work for someone for free so that I can learn because I don't have $10,000 to spend or my own business to spend the money so that I can learn. I learned, for example, in my own account, in my own e-commerce business. Later, I learned also more by spending other people's money.

But my initiation was this. If someone doesn't know how is he going to be initiated? Okay, you look at course and everything.

How is he going to be initiated? Of course, he's going to offer his services for free. Makes total sense.

But this for a company that is actually profitable and they're having results, let's say that you're a startup, okay? And you don't have any results. Totally fine.

Take someone, maybe they're going to crack the code or whatever, maybe it's going to be for free. When you feel ready, go to someone who is paid. Fine.

But you have a company which is working. You have a freelancer, which was me, that was having results, profitable and stuff, but you're not happy with his fee. Totally fine.

Move with someone with a smaller fee or someone that you think that you can find an alternative of doing it in a cheaper way. Okay, but not taking someone who maybe has zero experience, he's lying to you, telling you that he's having experience and he's working for free. I think that this is a wrong mentality and I think that if someone doesn't understand it from a business perspective, then most probably he's never going to have a successful business after all, anyway.

So, next thing. Post IDs. Post IDs.

I have a print screen over here. I would love to show you the amount that I have spent in this period. No, actually this print screen, it's all about the ads and how they are spending in order to prove that they're not spending more from what they should, or not.

I'm lost a little bit here, just let me see my notes. Yeah, yeah. So, no, the print screen is for this one.

So basically this is about the post IDs. This is the amount of money that I have spent during Christmas and it was a business that I was running only ads for post IDs. So, the way that this is working is that, let's say that you're having a very good successful campaign and you're running it with dynamic ads.

Whenever you're breaking down the results and, by the way, the breakdown of results is a bug, you can go, you can break down the results not only on the dynamic, but you can also go and you can see not only which ads are working on the dynamic, but which kind of pages are having the sales and everything. and just a little bit of context. The breakdown of results is next to your column and you can go there and you can check, for example, which ages had the most sales.

What's the difference? After the iOS, before the iOS we had the same situation, but after the iOS they removed that and you were not able to see, for example, that you had five sales on the age between 18 to 25. 25 sales between the ages of this and that.

The only thing that you could see, it was the spend, and if your campaign was profitable, you were just following the money wherever it was spending more. It means that this is the one that it was the most successful. But right now, you can go and you can see the actual amount of sales between all of the ages and all of the different demographics, placements and everything and it's going to prove again my theory that there are no other placements that are working and Facebook is just stealing some money here and there on the other placements and this is why they're pushing the automatic placement option so that they're going to just take some sense in all of the other placements and then they just optimize for the ones that are actually working.

One funny thing that they have seen is that, and I'm going to make also a bit about it, about the breakdown of results and how to see different things, is that on Instagram I could see that they were, they have improved a little bit the instant Instagram experience and Instagram Reels. They have more sales. Back in the day before the iOS, when you were breaking down the results, you were having only sales on Facebook feed, Instagram feed and Instagram stories.

Now I can see, for example, in the 190 sales, I see five sales in Instagram Explorer, 12 sales in Instagram Reels. There are some sales that are coming also from there, but of course, right column, article and stuff, they still have no sales in stream. They have no sales at all.

So these are not good placements at all, but of course Facebook is pushing so much the concept of automatic placements because they're making money out of it for the extra placements that you're putting. They're just getting some cents out of it, which again, if you multiply with all the ad accounts, with all the campaigns that are being created and everything, it's a lot of money for them and this is why they put, they push so much this situation. Now back to our topic.

After you have a CBO campaign and you break down the results and you see which creatives are working, which copies is working, you can go and you can make a post out of it and then you can start advertising by using existing posts. So what are you having now? You're having two different branches.

One branch is going to be your dynamic ads, which you are starting with, okay? You're starting with your dynamic ads and you are keeping them as your base. This is your your spend, your minimum spend that you're going to have.

If they are working very well, scale them a little bit, it's fine. But after that, after some period when you have results, you go and you create a second branch, which is actually the post IDs. So this one is working with a creative and this one is going to work with a social proof.

Because you know that you're having here a good creative that it was tested extensively. This is why we say about dynamic ads that we are testing it, we're having sales at the same time. And you're having also a post ID over here, which it was created from the best creative and the best copy as a post.

So this post stays there and all of the comment and everything that people are going to put, it's staying there. And the more it's getting, the more it's getting data, the more it's becoming bigger and bigger. And that means that then you're having the social proof to scale.

So this is your base with your normal dynamic ads. And then this is your scaling. This is how you start scaling.

The more your post is becoming better, the more you scale it with more campaigns or by scaling the budget of the campaign or whatever, you scale, scale, scale. And this is how I structured my campaigns on this one. and I spent just on December 450k in this account while it was spending only 200k in the previous month.

I'm not saying that this was an account of 5k spending. Okay, it was spending 200k. Of course, it's my account for the past two years.

Okay, I have reached to this point. But this is the way that I managed to scale it by just not inflating, by just building posts. And actually, I realized by that that the post IDs are very important because they're helping you a lot.

And a lot of things on Facebook is about credibility. So you have the good creative, which is one thing. You have the different products that you can have, which is another thing that can help you scale, but also another thing that can help you scale, which is the third thing.

It's not only the creatives and the different aspects that you have for penetration on the market. It's not the different placements and the settings that you do with different campaigns, but it's also the credibility. So this is the third pylon, which is actually the credibility that you have and the post IDs.

After you have good results with your creatives, you integrate them to post IDs and then you start scaling with those. This is your base and this is your sum of your scaling, but this is your ultimate scaling, which is the post IDs. And this is the proof here.

Of course, we're going to make a video also about it explaining a little bit more. Now, let's go to your comments. Okay, and let's start explaining.

So first comment, it's coming from YouTube. Thanks for sharing your great method. He's talking about the crazy method.

Guys, thank you so much for the love that you saw for crazy method. I also love it. It's such a good method.

It goes with everything. It's like ketchup. It goes with everything.

I'm curious with experience leads you to... Ah, sorry. I'm curious which experience leads you to the decision to duplicate a CBO to scale instead of increasing the budget like 20% every day if ROAS is healthy.

I would keep the ad set in the landing in the learning phase, but if you duplicate you always start the learning phase. I'd appreciate your insights to show your insight. So, let me tell you how the crazy method was actually created.

What is the crazy method, first of all? I have videos you can see. We are going to put links on the description, but the crazy method is all about...

I'm having one ad set with specific settings, interests, whatever, with specific creatives and everything and I'm seeing that it's working. Instead of me scaling this ad set, I'm duplicating it several times. I'm putting it in a CBO campaign and then I'm trying to make them compete with each other so that I can do...

so that I can be able to spend in this specific thing that is working faster. So, how was the crazy method created? First of all, I was watching...

just so you know, the crazy method is a two or three years old method and it's like the Einstein's theory, the relativity, not that it's that clever. You will understand what I mean. Einstein, when he was making his theory, he couldn't prove them with actual experiments, but in theory, in mathematics, they were working.

The same thing happened with the crazy method. For some reason, I thought that it was logical to do it like this, but I couldn't prove everything until the next years I started to be able to, for example, spend one million dollars in just one ad set with broad targeting and understand a lot of things that we're going to analyze soon. So, the idea was this.

I'm having one ad set, for example, which is targeting 80 million people and on this 80 million people, I'm having very good results. So, instead of doing 20% and moving slowly, how can I do it? How can I do it faster?

Okay, because even if you have one ad set and you spend, let's say, 10,000 dollars, 20,000 dollars to it, when you go and you see the reach that you had out of the 50 million, this is nothing. So, you say, I'm just scratching the surface over here. I'm not targeting enough out of it and this has very good potential.

So, what I have done is that I thought, what if I duplicate it? It's a very simple thought, but at the end of the day, after thinking of it more and just tried to make more changes to it, the CBO campaign came later to it as an introduction because at the start, the CBO campaign started like, okay, I have an IBO, this is working, I'm going to duplicate the ad set and I'm going to do this time instead of 100, 200 and then I'm going to duplicate this ad set if it's working again with 200 and I'm going to start it with 500 and so on and so on. But the situation was that a lot of times when you were having this, you were not able to scale those that aggressively, okay, you were scaling like that but Facebook was stopping you.

Then the CBO came. The CBO was not good at the start but later the CBO was always winning the ABO campaign. So, I said, okay, let's put them all in CBO because we were doing CBOs anyway at that point and we were having good results and this is how the crazy method started.

Because it wasn't super fast with the other way, I took the integration of all of the ads that are working and then I started realizing things. What was the things that I was realizing? First of all, I started seeing that by doing that the ads compete with each other.

You're having the CBOs competing with each other and then you have the luxury of closing the ones that are not working and keeping the ones that they are working. By the way, my argument always with Facebook was this. Why did you invented CBO if you are all about consolidation?

You could still have the ABO. So, the CBO, I hope that they are not going to to stop CBO out of that remark but the CBO is all about having a budget for a lot of adsets. So, if you're all about consolidation, why did you invent CBO?

And CBO is always winning. So, for me it was a no go to have a consolidated method with one ad set. The other thing with the one ad set it was that even when you scale it a lot of times, we have explained the concept of the bell of adsets having just a breaking point when you scale them a lot and then they are starting losing ROAS.

So, you need to find the soft spot that they are going to be able, that they are going to be actually able to spend as much as you can so that you are not going to start losing ROAS. Another thing which is problematic is that when you start an ad set with $20 and you scale by 20% you are just scaling with $4 which is problematic. If you want to scale from $20 to $40 it's 100%.

For our minds it's not a lot but for Facebook is 100% raise. So, what are you going to do? You can take all of them and if you are getting a cost per purchase of $20 you are just putting a $200 campaign and you are putting 10 adsets to it.

It's much better. It's moving faster and then it was the realization of Hot Pockets. What is Hot Pockets?

And of course the randomness of the initial results. What did I see? I see that when I was starting one ad set on Monday and then I was starting another the same ad set on Friday or the same ad sets on Saturday, the results were completely different.

So, I started realizing that there's a randomness of the initial results because if the initial customer is Konstantinos and it's an actually good lead then it's going to find good people like Konstantinos. But if randomly it didn't find the sale because it was a bad day for Facebook, it found the sale but it wasn't such a such a good lead as a customer it was just a random thing, then your results are not going to continue being good. Another thing that I realized is the Hot Pockets that you can have Hot Pockets that are being created within very big interest and these Hot Pockets based on the randomness of the initial results also, they're helping you to have good results or bad results.

Some Hot Pockets are stronger, some Hot Pockets are not so strong. So, what you're doing is that when you're having an ABO campaign and you're forming a Hot Pocket by just having your budget and playing with it, increasing it or not, it really depends on how strong the Hot Pocket is going to be. and how are you going to be able, what if you're unlucky for example and your one ABO adset is going to be a bad adset, what are you going to do about it?

With the CBO campaign and the Crazy Method you're actually having substitutes. If something is not working you close it and you have the others that are going to continue and so on and so on. And the last thing that actually made me think about the Crazy Method and I said okay this is why it's working.

It happened in the previous year when I had when I had a credit from Facebook, there is also a video about it on Facebook, on YouTube, that I spent 1 million in just one ad set and in this one ad set I could see that out of the 100 million that we were targeting, we targeted only 10 million which is nothing okay. So I realized that in order for you to be able to target very fast in a very small period a lot of people you need to do it with a crazy method because the other one apparently even after spending 1 million it just targeted 10 million people which is crazy, which is crazy it's just the 10% of it which leads to other to other thoughts like that Facebook is lying about the potential each of the audiences that they actually exist and stuff but let's not go into that again. So this is how the Crazy Method was born and and since that I have learned to understand it more, to optimize more in a CBO campaign, I have a philosophy about how many ads you should have, how you can optimize them, how you can drop the budget after you close a lot and you don't want to disturb the balance and so on.

These are all my videos on YouTube and of course on the course we have much, much, much more on manual bidding which is more advanced and on optimization on the Crazy Method. But yes, the Crazy Method is also something that is working for everyone because it's all about finding something that is working well and then try to scale it. The scaling method and based on your comments I can see that it's working very well for a lot of people that they don't even have a lot of experience.

So if you haven't seen the video go check it but this is how the Crazy Method was born and this is how and why it's working. Now we have a lot of questions about Advantage Plus campaigns and of course it makes sense because Advantage Plus is here and it's working very well. It says, Layton here says, thanks for the video will this work for new pixels?

This will be my first ad campaign and I'm not sure whether I should do Advantage Plus or the manual conversion campaign. Okay, good question. I had some new accounts after the Advantage Plus was created, I tested it.

I can tell you that it's working even on new accounts and on new pixels. The only problem is the budget. I don't like the Advantage Plus campaigns that they run with 20 or 30 dollars per day.

My minimum that I would go with that it would be 100 per day. So if you have this budget, yes, start with Advantage Plus and see if it's going to work or not. I think it's very good because you will have also very low CPMs.

I have seen it working also with new pixels so for me it's something that you should try. Second question. Is it better to include one product category in one campaign or use several categories like one ad set for watches, another for books?

It doesn't mean ads, it means ads most probably, all in one campaign. So I have done it a lot of times. First of all, I do Advantage Plus with different products in the ad level.

I do Advantage Plus with different post IDs. I do Advantage Plus with the same product. For me, it's a very good way of actually using Advantage Plus with different products and stuff.

Two remarks to that. I wouldn't use a catalog and something else than some normal ad or post ID or whatever. The catalog tends to take all the budget on the Advantage Plus.

So if you want to use catalogs, I would use catalogs with different product sets in Advantage Plus. But anything else that you're going to do, Facebook is going to spend all the money on the catalog. Second thing is that in Advantage Plus, the thing that you need to focus and see, and I have told this many times, is that it's focusing on three ads and mostly on one.

So this one ad is going to take most of the budget and if it's working, it's totally fine. But it doesn't mean that this is the best ad that you're having in your Advantage Plus. So what I want you to do, and this is what I'm doing also and I'm scaling accounts like this, is that you have one campaign which is working.

Perfect. Leave it with this one. Don't touch it.

Even if you want, you can scale it. Advantage Plus, by the way, it's working very well with scaling. So you can go from 500 to 700, 700 to 1000.

It doesn't influence it as much as it's influencing when you do it in a CBO campaign. And the reason for that is because it's focusing on one ad. So it's not changing the balance of the campaign in the way that we know to optimize our CBO campaigns for crazy methods and for the other methods.

The thing here is this. You might have also other good creatives or other post IDs that are working very well. What you need to do in this case is you need to duplicate your Advantage Plus which is working.

And this time, don't include the ad that it's actually working in the one that you have before. So what do you have now? You have two Advantage Plus campaigns and you're testing the other creatives also to see if they're working well.

If another one is working also there, duplicate it again and go for the third one by also excluding the creative that has actually worked on the second. I can tell you that I have seen campaigns that they are focusing on just one, but when I was duplicating, I was finding also other winner post IDs or creatives that they were working. And this helped me a lot to scale.

Okay. So whenever you do a new Advantage Plus, it doesn't mean that you have to reinvent the wheel or find all of the new creatives and stuff. Test also if the other ones that they're not spending because this is how Advantage Plus is working, they are also good creatives.

We will make also a video about that. Now, it says, Hi, can you get results with this campaign at a lower budget $10 to $20 a day? With a small budget, should still have a bunch of ads?

Thanks in advance. If you do $20 to $30, which I suggest you not to do, I would do Advantage Plus with Catalog. Okay.

And try to see if it's going to work like this. If you don't have a Catalog and you want to do normal ads and stuff, I think it's going to be extremely problematic. Do Advantage Plus, but put one or two ads, don't put more than that.

And the other thing is that from my experience, most of the time, if you don't use a Catalog in small budgets, you should do it with 100 plus or more if you're using normal ads. Now, we have more questions. Here, you have a question.

I think it's a series of questions answering here and there. And let's go. It says, Hey, Kostadios, great content as always.

Thank you. I'm curious. If you have a low budget like 100 per day, can we try the crazy method or the data would be too little?

Again, thank you and have a happy new year. My answer. Hi, of course, you can try 100 per day.

It's enough for crazy method campaign. I'm doing it also all the time in new accounts. I have a video for a new Pixel case study.

It is a video with a new Pixel and how I scaled it with a crazy method and everything since day one. Okay. It was a completely new Pixel.

And I have also another video that I'm talking about crazy method and having $50 per day with four or five adsets. Of course, this really depends also on what you're selling. If you're selling t-shirts, whatever and stuff, it's completely different from selling a refrigerator unit.

But I say here that I need to point out that the crazy method is mostly a scaling method and this is true. It doesn't mean that I'm not starting accounts with the crazy method, but most of the times in order for you to use the crazy method, you need to have a stimulation of understanding which ad set really works to go on the crazy method. So yes, it's a scaling method.

And then he says, I see the problem is that especially in Advantage Plus, my catalog ad spends all the budget, true, as we said earlier, and when it's like 100 per day and it brings great results, but I can test the other creatives or the crazy method on the catalog. I hope I can have the budget to scale and check it on next month. Thank you very much.

And then I told him, well, if it has great results, do another one with 100 without the catalog, the thing that we were discussing earlier. And he says, that seems to be a great decision. Too bad the client doesn't want to spend.

Anyway, thank you very much. So if you're a freelancer and your client doesn't want to spend more money, you just have to accept it, you know. And even if you see that you can go higher and higher, it doesn't mean that your client has the same goals as you.

So just do whatever you can with this Advantage Plus campaign. And don't, you know, don't try, in my opinion, if something is working well, if you have 2.5 ROAS, don't try to make it 3. Try to see if you can scale with it.

Because Facebook is all about scaling. It's not about how can I get from 2.5 ROAS with the same budget. This is not the philosophy of the platform.

Okay. And if your client doesn't want to spend, it's too bad. But don't always go and blame the client and say, hey, he doesn't understand and stuff.

Maybe he doesn't have the money. Maybe PayPal is holding him the money for 30 days. You don't know what kind of needs the other person had.

So, sadly, most of the times we're thinking that, is he crazy? Is he having that good results and he doesn't want to scale? What's the problem?

Well, there are other things that you might not know about his business. Next question. It is difficult to tell to MAC store owners, this is coming from a podcast that I was discussing, that when you're going to have a store with t-shirts or MACs is not going to be profitable.

And yes, it's difficult. I need to rephrase something here so that we're not going to have any misconceptions. I need to tell that there are companies that are selling t-shirts and MACs and they are profitable.

I'm just talking about the average guy who's going to start tomorrow by watching a video and stuff and they don't understand anything about it. And this is my duty to do in order to to protect some people that they are naive enough to believe one video that they see and they see someone telling them that they make a lot of money and they believe them. So, the way that I see it is that with MACs you have a very small profit margin and by giving this example, I'm trying to explain that it's not only about the idea that you have, the numbers also need to make sense in order to have sales.

The average value, the profits that you are having and the Facebook advertising is becoming more expensive. This is why I'm talking about t-shirts and t-shirts I'm talking also about print on demand mostly because on print on demand you will have to pay also the company that is printing and stuff. It's not like you're printing them in-house.

Most probably there are people that are printing in-house and they are profitable but you need to have the equipment and everything else. in the easy models of print on demand and stuff you need to have higher average value items in order for you to be profitable. But this is what I want to say.

I want to say that there are stores with t-shirts and MACs that are profitable but most probably it's not going to be you that you are listening to this podcast and you're going to start a store tomorrow. It needs more than that. Okay, so next thing.

Hello, we made a new webshop to sell in Europe therefore the pixel is new. What do you suggest to do as a next step? I was thinking to run a broad campaign with sales objective in each EU country starting from North European countries one by one.

Budget is like 10 to 15 a day. I hope per country because it's if it's 10-15 per day you will have to test them one by one. But if it's per country what I would suggest you to do is this.

I would suggest you to do groups of countries that you want to target. Similar countries for example one group of similar countries is Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. I never had good results with Poland to be honest with you.

But let's say those three. Okay, this is one group. Okay, in this one group you can go and you can run a CBO campaign, put your interest and everything and then break down the results which is again as we said the drop down menu next to the columns and see in which country it's working and then try to focus on this country for example.

Okay, so start making groups or even group a lot of them together and then start breaking down the results and see where you are having the results. I don't think that you should go and... So when we start with new pixels and everything you should not break down you should put all of them together and then decide if you want to focus more in one country with different languages and so on.

So that you can be more efficient. But at the start I think that you should group them together and then break down the results and see what is happening there instead of just having small campaigns with 10 dollars on each country and see which one is going to work. Because don't forget about the randomness of results and everything that we discussed.

I think that this is the last comment. It says, great as always Konstantinos, love your videos. Thank you very much bro.

A quick question. Let's say I make one purchase a week. It's an expensive product but many initiate accounts.

Would you recommend going back one step to initiate checkout to bring more data and from there there will be more purchases? Or for example, if my goal is lead but I have one page before before the lead that receives more data. If there is not enough data in the leads would you go one step back in the funnel or remain in the final goal which is the purchase slash lead?

Thanks in advance. So let's break down the question over here because it's actually a good question but is the purchase slash lead. So let's break down the question.

No offense. There are some stupid remarks inside it. So let me tell you what.

First of all, if you go from purchases to just this, in some countries which are smaller countries we discussed also in the podcast and in videos that I have observed that in big countries like United States for example you're having very big problems if you're optimizing any other event from the one that you want because the data is so, so many that Facebook is going to flood your funnel with all of these bad leads from people that they are never going to convert and become a purchase. On the other hand there are smaller countries like Greece or whatever or Switzerland was the other example that we had that even when you optimize for Add to Cart there are not so many bad leads inside the Add to Cart in order for Facebook to give you only people who do Add to Cart. It's going to give you a mix of people who only do Add to Cart but people who also Add to Cart and buy.

That means that in that case you can optimize for Add to Cart and have good results. In very big countries I would strongly suggest you not to do it because Facebook is having enough data to give you only people who Add to Cart and for the people who put optimization on purchase it's going to give them better results because they are asking for this. Now that being said, if you're in a smaller account you could try to go one step back.

I'm never doing it to be honest with you unless if I go in an account and I try everything that is not working and then I have to set my ego on the side and just say that if it's working with Add to Cards, f*** it! I'm going to use Add to Cards also. The same way that it was in one account that nothing was working other than lifetime budgets.

The daily budgets were not working, it was working only with lifetime budgets for some reason. So I was working with lifetime budgets, I adapted it. And then you're talking about something else which is which I found the stupid part and it says, I'm quoting by the way on the stupid, it says, if my goal is lead but I have one page before the lead that receives more data.

So here you're making one mistake, you're comparing the purchase with the lead. The lead is someone I'm guessing that you're going to call in order to close the deal. You cannot compare the purchase which is something that someone has went there and he's buying by putting his money, he's buying already.

You're comparing one free event with one event that needs much more effort. So if you're having as your final step, for example, I have a company which is a SaaS company and it has the event of start the free trial for 30 days. And it has also a purchase event with which we're not optimizing for, we're optimizing for the 30 days trial.

In this situation, if this is not working, something is wrong in the funnel or in the creatives. Because our event over here is for free. You cannot compare a free event with an event that someone is spending money to, like the purchase event.

So for the purchase event, yes. If you want, you can go one step back. I wouldn't go to steps like view content or even Add2Cart, but I think that maybe in Easy Checkout, if you are struggling so much and you want to test it, test it.

If you're in a smaller country, I have seen Add2Cart working also as an optimization event better than the purchase event. Fine, I'm also convinced about that. But when you have a lead event which is for free or a start trial or download the PDF event or something and you're not having good results, you should not blame the event and try to go one event back.

Because the whole process of this is that because purchase is very difficult to happen, we're going one step back in order to optimize there. Lead event is not hard to happen because it's for free. So if it's not happening, either your creatives are wrong or your funnel is wrong.

This is what I wanted to point out about this comment, just so that we can clarify that just because you can do this with a purchase event, it doesn't mean that you have to do it with all the other events. So, guys, think, okay? It's all about simple way of thinking and understanding how the platform is working.

It's not like this is working here, I'm going to apply it also here and here and here. It has to make sense based on the technical knowledge that you have or you're acquiring from channels like this. Now, I was watching this post and how much time do we have?

One hour, eleven minutes. Wow, okay. I told you it's going to be a big one.

So, just some funny posts and we're going to wrap it up because it's already too much. So, there is one post that I have found here, it says Facebook Ads Agency. Dear all, please read carefully.

I want a physical identity or an agency who is able to run ads on his own. I don't provide my Facebook account, I provide a Facebook page and a link to App.iOS and everything. I need to run ads to extend my business.

So, my note to this is this. You cannot have a legitimate business which is running without owning everything on the business. Do you understand how difficult this is?

It's like you are not owning all the data and you're having another account which is not yours. This is an extremely problematic situation and whoever is not having full control of all of the assets of their advertising, like the account, the pixel and everything, then that means that they are going to be a hostage of this company and this is not a very good practice and this is something that I wanted to point out just because I have seen it. Now, Freelancer Diaries.

There are two because as I told you I was looking on my folders and I found some older ones which we are going to refresh a little bit. So, first one. I'm looking for someone to help me find the real identity of a cyberbullying TikTok user.

So, I'm looking for someone to help me find the real data, message me and I'll share the user's TikTok ID. and the big question is this. If you find him, what are you going to do?

Are you going to go for example and have a fight with him? Crazy post. I'm actually curious.

I was watching recently, it's coming from India by the way, I was watching recently I couldn't find that someone was actually answered to him but I would be very interesting to see, to know for example just for the context if anyone actually was able to locate the cyberbullying and what happened. and the next one is one of my favorites as always. It says, I need someone to manage my Shopify business all on their own.

I'm looking for someone that is an expert on Facebook ads, TikTok ads and can find all products and create stores on their own and what the are you going to do there? If someone else is going to do all of that, what are you going to do? You're just going to be the owner.

Why? Are you having so much money? Are you Mark Cuban?

Who are you in order to ask for something like this? Very funny and I think that there are a lot of people that they just want to have businesses without doing not even the minimal effort by just finding someone and maybe give them some money to do it. But do you know what?

This person is going to take all your money and you're not going to have a store or a successful business. You're just going to lose money in the process even if that is $5 or $20 or $50 or in the case of my previous client even if someone is working for free for you in order to learn by spending your money how to have, how he's going to build his own business and he's going to learn with your money. That's all I had for you guys.

Super big podcast again but we had so much to discuss and I have some topics that I gave for the other time because I knew that it was going to take us a lot of time. I feel like this podcast was super technical in some cases but it's fine guys okay. We need to have also super technical content.

I hope that some of you are going to remember something and go and look at it later to remember all the things that we're discussing but we have to cover everything okay. The super beginners and the super advanced they also need to have their content here on that podcast and also these are things that I really care about and I need to talk about so the podcast is the only place that I can discuss about because apparently except for my friend Jonathan nobody else understands me and the truth is that I cannot discuss all of these things with anyone else. If I could I wouldn't be sitting here talking alone in front of a camera for one hour and 15 minutes.

Such a story but it is what it is. Be creative, be consistent guys and I will see you next week. This was the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast.

Like it or not, it is what it is.
