Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk again about hot pockets and all my theory about them and stuff so that we can discuss it and we can agree and disagree. So first of all I want to clarify something that anything that you're going to hear on this video is my personal opinion and I have never been able to verify it with someone from Meta or something okay so the situation is this it's coming from my personal observations I'm open to discussing with anyone else having to say anything else but I'm backing it up with numbers so whoever comes and says something they need to back it up with numbers. That being said let me tell you on how I believe that Facebook is working some of these things are proven some of those are not but I had to make the whole puzzle into my head in order to understand and this has helped me to find methods like the crazy method or other things that they are provenly working so let's go.

When you're having an ad set or an ad which is optimizing because still I was believing that the whole optimization is happening on the ad set level I do believe now that it's happening on the ad level after the advanced plus because over there I can see that you can create different hot pockets because I have tested advanced plus crazy method which is having one ad working duplicating it a lot of times and then I could see that it was having different results and this is very easy to see it on other accounts that they have completely different average order values between the orders so that you can see that when of the ads were optimizing for high average order value then it was continuing like that and when it wasn't it was continuing with a smaller average order value this is also another thing which led me to think that there are hot pockets and they are being formed based on who is actually buying at the start but let's take it from the beginning initially we have an ad which is starting and the first thing that is getting is engagement people who engage with it and so on and for that reason when people are engaging with an ad if they engage more and more and more than then Facebook thinks that this ad is good so it's giving it more spend so that people might convert also in the first 24 48 hours we have Facebook actually giving us some low hanging fruit sales which is again something that I cannot prove but if you go there are a lot of people or you that you are watching this video that you have the perception that your ads are working very well for 24 48 hours and then they die the reason is because we are optimizing for conversion events Facebook is actually giving us some sales at the beginning in order for us to continue optimizing based on the sales now given the fact that which I cannot prove it again I'm saying but given the fact that we're getting some early sales on the beginning there is the randomness of the initial result which is this first of all it's going to engage if the people who engage with an ad they are the wrong people and then Facebook thinks that this ad is good and is giving us sales to this ad this ad is not going to continue doing well in the next days don't think that Facebook doesn't know who is going to convert or not it knows exactly because it knows if someone is spending all their money up to the 15th of the month it knows everything about us if we want to buy something or something it's about you know humans are creatures of routine okay so we have a routine and we buy certain things or certain days but we don't realize it okay if we analyze our which I think it's going to happen in the next years with the help of AI maybe the AI is going to analyze our behavior and stuff but this AI on Facebook is already analyzing that maybe later we're going to have tools in order to understand how we are actually operating in our daily life but this is something that Facebook is doing for us for years based on all the information that we are feeding it okay if we saw on Facebook that we bought something or if we buy something through a Facebook ad it knows what it doesn't only know when we're going to buy it also knows what we like to buy and it also knows if we have the money to buy because it sees the behavior of when we're spending or not if we have a graph of what we do in our daily life you will see that we are really really boring okay and there's only a small percentage of the population that is doing crazy stuff all the time without following a routine I like my routine I have a routine I always follow my routine so most probably that's the case and the AI understands who are the low hanging fruits and it's giving us the low hanging fruits at the beginning because we're optimizing for a purchase event to continue going down that path because Facebook is working like this it's getting one sale from Konstantinos then it finds a similar person like Konstantinos and so on and so on the example that I like to use here in order to analyze the randomness of the initial results is this when I believe it was some months ago my sister has two children my niece actually I was having a birthday I wanted to buy her some clothes but I'm not a parent myself so when I bought from an ad I'm not the ideal customer because I'm just going to buy once most probably and not again and I'm not something I'm not someone who has demographics or points of interest that if you use me as a data point you can find more and more people like me so that you can expand it to the right people so that they can also buy so I'm just like what I like to call a force a false sale over here and based on the randomness of the initial result if someone was unlucky for me to be the first sale or second sale on the ads that they start now because there was a low hanging fruit for Facebook then that means that the hot pocket that it was created around me it was wrong and it was actually optimized to a wrong hot pocket you know that it's going to target people like me but most probably they're not going to buy because okay maybe they have a niece but they are not going to buy her clothes so that being said I truly believe in the randomness of initial result and this is why I created the crazy method so that you can avoid that you can do several ads that they're going to optimize for different hot pockets that they're going to be created from the randomness of the initial results so what did we learn so far that we have an ad or an ad set or many ads or whatever and initially they're optimizing based on the engagement so whoever engages so if you're unlucky and someone is a bad engagement this is bad for your ad secondly we have the results that Facebook is giving us initially and they're going to be better or worse based on how good your pixel is or your ad account because it's going to have some direction also from the pixel for the ideal avatar of yours so the example that I gave before for example it doesn't work so well with very big trained ad accounts that are going to find good low hanging fruits initially and maybe they don't even need the low hanging fruits but it's working better for smaller ad accounts that they don't have so good trained pixels so after that a sale is coming and it's being boosted a little bit from Facebook especially in the new ad accounts and you're having another sale and maybe your results are going to die or not based on the hot pocket that is going to be formed how does the hot pocket is being formed all of us we have some unique characteristics and we have some data points okay I like cigars I like food I like facebook ads I'm married this and that and that and I like to travel and all of that okay all of that compares in an avatar that we have millions of data points of different individual data points and the based on where I'm converting then it's going to find another person who has maybe 50 of these data points I don't know the numbers exactly because Facebook doesn't share that with us so it's optimizing based on that if I'm a good lead for this specific ad I'm going to form a hot pocket over there of people that they are coming in they are being pickpocketed from the full potential reach but I'm forming a hot pocket within the this reach which is going to be small and it's going to be filled with people that they are similar to me if I'm a good lead initially and I'm a good purchase initially and the hot pocket that I'm forming is super aligned with all the other people that they are going to buy this is good because people are going to come and they are going to buy also and it's going to work flawlessly but if I'm not or if my pixel is not strong enough to indicate who is a good low-hungry fruit or not then the hot pocket which is going to be formed is not going to work this is why I really liked a crazy method and this is how I started moving with crazy method ad accounts to profitability because a lot of times people were running just one ad and this one ad maybe it wasn't going to work don't forget that there are not a lot of people that they can spend an enormous amount of money so that we can talk about volume because if you talk about volume you can say that okay I'm going to run it and I'm going to give so much money that even if some bad leads are coming or sales they're going to be some good ones and they're going to help optimize overall what are you doing when you are working with smaller budgets you need to be flexible and you need to have strategies like that and of course relance what is relance relance is working because something that used to work it stopped working you duplicate it you run it the next day at 6am which means that it forms a new hot pocket and it optimizes all over again some more observations two actually one observation that I have done is that in ad accounts that they are having high average order value and it doesn't mean that all of the orders they are higher over a high average order value I have seen that in an ad set when you are doing um when you're having some sales in low average order value then this asset continues to optimize with low average order value and this never changes but when it starts with high average order value then it continues with high average order value this is another thing that I have seen because of the hot pockets which I believe it's why it's happening the other thing is the randomness of the results between the days so when I could see one asset working having let's say that I'm launching the same ad on Monday the same ad on Wednesday the same ad on Friday it was having completely different results based on the sales that it was getting on the first or second day so you can have one campaign which has optimized pretty well because it formed a hot pocket and you can have exactly the same campaign and don't talk to me about um let's say how do we say that competing with each other because at this point I can tell you that there is no competition when you are targeting 150 million people these observations along with the fact that I spent I have showed you this 1.7 million in one ad set with the full potential reach and I have seen that in this ad set I was having a frequency of five six I don't remember and just reached by just spending all of this amount of money just 10 million people which is not okay because I was targeting 170 million people that being said I believe that the hot pocket has been from there it was working for that hot pocket and it wasn't it was trying to expand the hot pocket instead of trying to go outside of the hot pocket and target the other million people or we will have to think and believe that Facebook is lying about the potential reach of the audiences that exist there so all of that combined it's my personal experience and how I have seen ads and ad sets optimize and behave and this is what I believe that is happening it's the hot pocket thing a lot of people they think that this is a bullshit and they don't like it and stuff but the way that I explain it today to you with this data which I can prove by the way with actual numbers and I have proven already with my different videos it's something that takes me to this not method but to this philosophy about the hot pockets and how they're being formed in this theory which I cannot prove but based on my observation it's 100% true just before we close the video I would like to give you a small example because I really like to simplify things so that everybody can understand them let's say that I am in a square in a public square and over there there are walking daily which is our budget daily 50 million people I am sitting in a square and I am selling bottles of water I am going to have some sales here and there and okay then I am learning that one club which is on the corner it's out of water so I am going outside of the club and I am starting selling waters there and I am getting more sales it's not that I am going to have some sales it's not that I am going to have some sales it's not that I left from the area of the 50 million people which is the square it's just that I moved into a position into a hot pocket that over there and was having more sales because there was more need there so everybody is talking inside the club and saying oh my god I need water there's one guy outside which is selling water they are out of water here so everybody is coming and buying so this host pocket it's optimizing and it's working there but it's still within the uh hot pocket area but it's still within the full potential reach of the square this is what the hot pocket is it's just um after having some sales or maybe just to keep it in in the example to keep it better let's say that someone from the club came to the middle and he bought and then I understood it and I moved with him he told me hey I want to buy because on the club there is no water so me and him we went on the corner and we created the hot pocket there from more people coming from the club and the other thing that we need to analyze here is that I never left the 50 million I created the hot pocket outside of the club because there was no water and someone might say that maybe if you use the interest of club you still can go there and you can do but over there you don't know if your information is good or bad because in the case that I was in the middle of the square somebody come and told me it's a low hanging fruit that came to me from metal let's say and he took me and we created a hot pocket there outside of the club on the other case with the interest you go there outside of the club but you don't know maybe maybe it was a false information that the club is out of water for example maybe you're not going to have sales or maybe not it's going to go to come outside of the club to buy so that it can go inside and say to the others I hope that this stupid example helps you to understand it more a little bit of how I believe that it works don't forget guys that if you want to learn more you can check my book you can check my course you can check my website you can check my other videos to find more stupid examples that I have and until we meet again be creative and be consistent
