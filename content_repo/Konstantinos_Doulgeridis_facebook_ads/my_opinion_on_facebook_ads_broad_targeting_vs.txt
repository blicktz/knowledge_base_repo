Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about the targeting in 2025. So year by year I have the feeling that I'm doing less targeting and less and less targeting and the reason is that this is what I see on the ad accounts. I do have the feeling that my campaigns, my cold traffic campaigns especially ASC campaigns are doing more and more and more retargeting and now we have also the tools of seeing that because you can break down the results and segment audiences and you can actually see that they're doing 20 to 30% retargeting.

Calculate all of that with the way that I'm working with multiple campaigns then you don't need the retargeting. Basically I'm not doing retargeting even on ad accounts that I'm spending 10k 20k per day. I might have a retargeting for 20 dollars or 50 dollars just for psychological reasons and I'm not going to do any other retargeting.

On the other hand there are some accounts that I'm going to do more retargeting for example ad accounts that they are having maybe high AOV which means that people are not deciding if they are going to buy within the seven days attribution period and maybe we need to retarget them in order to get the sales inside the platform. This is one case. Another case is funnels for example if you are selling an ebook and then you want to upsell to something else and then you want to upsell to something else you put these audiences to specific funnels and then you're retargeting these people to sell them something else and so on and there's a whole journey that you're following in order to sell a product but in general in e-commerce I'm not doing a lot of retargeting almost none of retargeting because my cold traffic ads are already doing retargeting.

Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that they have you can find the one that's going to feed better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So I was actually making the thumbnail and then I realized that it's not 30% it's more than that in some cases and this is one of the account that's having a very strong fan base so follow me here. So we have existing customers you know this is by the way when you're going to put these things on to your dashboard let me show you over here advertisement settings if you come and you click you're going to see that we have audience segments okay this is a gates audience and existing customers okay now over here it says a gate the audience is not defined and the existing customers is defined okay so I'm using only existing customers here I have done a video which I'm explaining which kind of audience segments you have to use over here okay now the reason that I'm not putting also the other audiences is because I want to have only the existing customers which I want to check here and even if I want it I have the feeling that if I add it it's going to reset my campaigns like the same thing that happened on March I believe when they added this and all of my campaigns reset it because like everyone else I went and I added audiences so over here what do we see we see that from existing customers it's actually spending more as a percentage from on the last seven days from this okay in this campaign we're getting 3.76 okay and this is a big number for this other account we normally get 2.5 to 2.6 okay in another one we get over here existing customers with bad draws more okay from the new audience existing customers here we're taking less comparing to the to the new audience okay existing customers here 50 but what I'm seeing here is a tendency of not being 30 percent it's 50 or more for example okay so over here though it's not from the budget let me do the calculation so out of the so if we take 1500 plus 758 a few minutes later okay I'm back so if we do 1526 over here which is the new audience plus 758 equals 2284 multiplied with 0.3 it's 685 it's 685 so it's almost close to the number that we see of existing customers so 32 33 percent I guess uh it's uh the audience that um the retargeting audience okay the percentage that we do retargeting is 33 in this campaign other campaigns is 50 but there are more of a new campaigns in the older ones I'm seeing that the existing customers for example as we go in the older ones maybe this is the trend that we need to see over here uh is that on the older ones because as we go down we see older and older we're going to see that here we're targeting 500 1500 so from 2k only so it's around 30 percent again over here we're seeing a correlation with just 50 50 so it goes up to 50 50 50 but in some cases it's 30 percent and as we go back we see either it's going to be 50 50 or 50 50 here it's 50 50 here so it's doing more retargeting I guess I'm a little bit outdated to that because I believe that it was doing less retargeting like 30 percent but I'm seeing here and this is the account uh that is uh doing this for sure something that I'm going to research more but at the end of the day what I want you to understand is what I told you earlier this is not bad why if we break down the results here and we do this okay and let's go on the last 14 days for example on the last 14 days we have 2.44 85k spent here breaking errors 1.5 1.8 is actually the minimum that we want to be 2 plus we are very happy so over here we are happy on this on the account but on the other hand I want you to understand that for this on the cards we're not only looking the ads manager we're looking also numbers outside for example we look what is the percentage of the total sales what what is the percentage that we see for example do we spend so the spend has to be less than 30 percent or 25 percent uh of uh the total uh revenue okay so this is a number if it goes to 30 40 percent then it means we have a problem so if these numbers didn't help the other account to have these numbers that we have as safety features like the percentages that we need to see the efficiency ratio mayor and all of the other metrics we wouldn't we wouldn't still be doing this kind of spend and we wouldn't be scaling the other thing that I want you to understand is that the more data it gets the more new client it's going to give us if we see that we have problem with the numbers we're going to lower the spend but this is something that we cannot control I know that on the advanced shopping campaigns there are beat the budget cap system for the existing customers but I have used it it doesn't work really well sometimes it just ignores the cap and it's just spending 30 percent so over here we might see that it's 50 percent in some cases and stuff and this is why I wanted to do the loom video in order to actually correct that and tell you that I'm seeing also this in some other accounts but at the end of the day what we need to understand is that it's still data that it's going to be used for optimization if our other numbers in reality okay because we are checking here and we have some numbers but the numbers that really matter are the matters of the reality we're trying to find a correlation what kind of ROAS do I need to see here in order for me to be taking four ROAS in reality for example okay this is what we're trying to see and as long as we're hitting certain KPIs here everything else is what Meta is trying to do anyway they're doing already inflation of results because of their statistical modeling what does it say here these results may not include all conversion data statistical modeling may be used to provide more complete measurement when conversion data may be missing or partial so they are already inflating the results because they want more data and they want more data in order to find more sales okay so even if you don't like it or not you're doing retargeting already you just don't know it okay so don't don't say things like I don't want to do retargeting whoever's doing retargeting is stupid we are we are all doing retargeting at the end of the day the point is if you do different campaigns I would do different campaigns only in specific ad accounts for specific reasons or in really high AOV that maybe I need to gather sales from retargeting because I'm not gathering them on my cold traffic ads because of the conversion window not being 28 days anymore and just being seven we live in an era that after iOS we need more data more data more data so Facebook thought what if I have data from retargeting within my cold traffic ads because it's not only the problem that after iOS we're not targeting all of these people it's because it's also the problem that all of these people that we're not targeting they're not data that are coming within the platform and Meta is trying to keep the information within the platform because it needs this information I have made a video about statistical modeling and in this video I was explaining that Meta is actually trying to inflate the results in order to make the algorithm work better because the more data that it has the better it works that's why we are not excluding past customers for example okay and we're just letting it be inside our cold traffic ads just because even if it's going to steal some sales it's still data that's going to use for better optimization all the new campaigns are doing retargeting anyway because this was the way for Meta to get more data within the campaigns in order to optimize better and have better results so that more people are going to advertise and they are going to be able to be profitable and for that reason in 2025 I'm not going to do almost zero retargeting but in reality I'm doing a lot of retargeting with my campaigns now someone might come and say but you can use the budget cap or you can exclude past customers no because this is what Meta wants they want to use on cold traffic retargeting audience which is going to help you find more cold traffic sales so what's your best avatar client a client which is already buying from you so what if you use the data of this client and then find a similar person like him you're finding another loyal client who is going to come and buy again and again and again and when this is happening you are having campaigns that are going to lower your cost purposes that you have but also your cpm I hope that this makes sense I hope that you understand that while I'm not doing retargeting at all we all do retargeting I hope that you're not going to let your ego exclude past customers on cold traffic ads or use budget caps inside your advanced plus campaigns or have this mentality that I only want new clients with my facebook ads yes we do want that but in order for you to get clients new ones with better cost per purchase you need to also put retargeting people and data within your ad I hope that makes sense and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website you can check my mentorship programs and below you can check all the testimonials from people that they have completed and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
