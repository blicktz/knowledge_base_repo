Hello Facebook Ads people I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk again about Advantage Plus this time how to scale Advantage Plus is in our lives now and it's working so let's go so I have done several videos about Advantage Plus about how to scale how to do it how to do crazy method with Advantage Plus case studies whatever one other thing that I want to show you and now I decided on 2023 and further I'm going to show more ad accounts because this is what you want this is what you like after analyzing the results on the views so I'm going to show more and more and more ad accounts I'm having a case study right now that I have used Advantage Plus for scaling an account which was doing 100k per month in the last months when I took it it was doing far less and now I'm going to scale to 200k just with this basically the principle is this you have an Advantage Plus and you have a lot of creatives like 20 plus 28 like I have 25 30 whatever when you see one Advantage Plus working then you go and you stay with these four three two ads that are working and then you are duplicating the campaign and you're running it without this three four because basically with the other one you didn't test it you didn't test all of the creatives that is going to help you first of all to have an Advantage Plus which is going to have a lot of substitutes aside which you are going to remove whenever they're not doing well and optimize it like the ways that we explained that you optimize an Advantage Plus campaign and the other thing and I'm also going to explain it a little bit in the video how to actually optimize it a little bit but you need to see also the other videos that I have as case studies and the other thing is that first of all you respect the work of the creators or the owner that is giving you a lot of creatives and you're testing all of them which is our job secondly you have options to actually being able to scale with that way because you're having a lot of substitutes and you're also piling up different Advantage Plus campaigns with different creatives inside while you're testing them all at the same time I hope it makes sense I'm going to explain it further now on my PC so that you can understand how it's working it's not any rocket science but the whole approach about Advantage Plus how you optimize it how it's working the way that you need to structure the account and stuff I think the the whole thing as a whole it's something that I figured out after the Advantage Plus coming to our lives because the optimization of Advantage Plus is completely different from the CBO optimization and I think that it's working flawlessly in several accounts and it's helping a lot so without any further ado let's go on my PC to show you everything so in the last seven days this other count 36k spent 7.72 ROAS let's see a little bit the last month to see the tendency 136k 6.44 so I'm doing better on the last seven days here and the fun fact is that if we watch yesterday it was still a good day 5.5k so if we do 5500 why am I doing it like this let me do it here uh here so if we do 5500 multiplied by 30 it's going to take me to 165 I and if I scale 1k more which is easy with the way that I'm going to show you you will understand it a little bit multiply it with 30 it's on 200k so this is my goal for this month to go on this number at least 150 165k plus at least now the way that this is working and let me go on uh last seven days here again is that we're going to focus in just to these two campaigns because you know that in this channel we are all about doing several uh several different methods several uh campaigns uh different structure and whatever is working we're keeping it and then we do another campaign another campaign instead of scaling like idiots whoever is doing only one campaign and scaling this campaign is a total idiot and uh is just somebody who is lazy and he doesn't know how to do facebook ads and you should not uh follow them or listen to them uh because they are just random people that they just do ads and they have no understanding about the facebook algorithm and by the way this is something that you can also do and there is no point of hiring them here we are going to see that in this campaign which is an advantage plus we have 28 ads after optimization we reach to the point that we have done one two three four five of them working giving us an average which is super acceptable for this account and we have 1k spent on that so what do we have here we have a company which is having resources a lot of creatives we discussed several times that creatives are very important and if you have a lot of creatives and decent creatives not just give some stupid creatives to you the guys that they're doing your ads then that means that you can penetrate the market from different entry points because you're convincing people with other creatives about the use of your product from different perspectives and so on so when you're doing that you are having more sales because you're having more penetration to the market as i said earlier now in this specific situation we are in the interior design niche and we can have a lot of creatives because of that and i'm using all of these creatives on advantage plus because it's the most efficient way but the advantage plus campaign is optimizing in a completely different way from a cpo campaign it's just focusing in one or two or three ads because it's a consolidation method it's not working like the cpo so what i have done here is that i came to them and i have other videos explaining how to optimize advantage plus campaigns today we're going to focus mostly on scaling with them so i came here to the conclusion that look i have optimized this already but i have another uh one two three four five another 23 ads that i haven't used extensively okay and all of my spend is going on those okay i close those because as i as i said earlier i'm optimizing in order to get to good results but over here we can see that look it's one case pen perfect what am i going to do ask another 28 creatives no i'm going to duplicate this campaign which is this new campaign and this time i'm going to run it with 24 i'm removing the four best of the previous one maybe in your case it's going to be three or two that facebook to expend all the money so i'm running another 1k if i didn't do that then i wasn't going to be able to scale with advantage plus and it's working flawlessly by the way i'm in the process of optimizing this campaign this is where you see such a big mess on the top because and yes i said i'm not going to say a lot of things about optimization optimization of advantage plus you can watch the videos but basically here whenever something is going to take a lot of budget you need to just decapitate it and just focus in the next one the next one until you find one leader like the one that i found here which i'm starting slowly to moving the campaign to the health level because if you see for example the last month most probably yeah it had 1.43 and it had some ads here that they were so this was my leading ad which didn't do well others this is happening in e-commerce stores that have different average or value and people can buy something small or something big and here on the last seven days you can see that i managed to cut the big spenders i'm leaving the good one here so now i'm having a very good leading ad which i'm very happy because it means that now if i optimize this campaign to have two or three good ads then i can go duplicate it again and run it with 20 this time removing the for good so this is helping me a lot to scale and i'm sure that i'm going to hit 200k unless facebook is going to stop me but this is the way that you should treat it so number one know how to optimize advantage plus campaigns advantage plus campaign came to our life in september so it's too early but you have costantinos here which figured it out and i'm showing you in all of my videos how to optimize them and here you can see that it's working second thing start using advantage plus is a very good way instead of cbo to use very big budgets you can do with cbo if you do one thousand dollars with our crazy method everything you need to put a lot of budgets and you need to have more experience advantage plus optimization is easier to master but it's a little bit more difficult in terms of uh you not being experienced and afraid of closing or leaving assets and of course advantage plus needs more time it's not it's not like the cbo that you're touching it faster it needs more time to produce some results and see what you have to do there so do advantage plus uh go and do learn from my videos uh or my course or whatever learn optimization on advantage plus very important number three go and do a lot of creatives so spend money on creatives and have a lot of creates because these are uh you you have a very efficient way of testing them with the advantage plus and this is very good and then when you find success with one just do this one leave it do another one with the other credits and so on and pile up campaigns don't just do one advantage plus with a huge budget and expect it to work just try to build a lot because at the end of the day if one of these here it's going to die one of these campaigns and also i'm using a lot of different strategies but this video is all about the advantage plus here we don't have only advantage plus we have also different strategies if you have something working and then it dies at least you have all the others so you're not starting from zero all over again in your scaling and this is what is going to help you this account guys over here with that way if we go back in august and we see the spend it started with the spend of 31k and look what where we are now okay so in the last month which is february we spent 136 and the next month i'm going to spend 200. so you cannot scale like this because facebook is volatile if you don't have several campaigns so guys that's all i had about scaling with advantage plus i hope that you liked it i'm going to try to show more live accounts with what am i doing with the different methods here and there don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my free course my paid course and of course my website and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
