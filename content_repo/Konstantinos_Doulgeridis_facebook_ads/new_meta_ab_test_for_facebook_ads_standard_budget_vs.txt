Hello Facebook people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about another Meta test that I have done with a coupon from Meta and we're going to discuss together the results and of course what was the experiment. So before we go into my PC a little bit of context basically in Q4 there are a lot of coupon codes and what I mean by coupon code basically it's funding for Meta to run some tests okay so if you have a Meta rep you ask them hey do you have any tests any eb tests that Meta wants to run for example and they give you most of the times one to four match ratio for example if you spend 10k most of the times they have a minimum spend that you can have over here if you spend 10k they will give you another 2.5k extra applied to your account so that you can spend it of course they're not going to give you cash or whatever you spend 10k they give you another 2.5k this is how it goes so basically what you can do is that you can run these tests and I always pick the tests that they make sense not some stupid test for example I have another video which we posted which was about doing normal ASC campaign and for maximum conversion and one for maximum value so to see if we can optimize which was a very good interesting test I ran it also during Black Friday period which ruined a little bit the results it was a cheap move on my site to take a little bit of their budget and utilize it on Black Friday but I guess it is what it is and I have learned things before Black Friday because after that it actually skewed the results you can see the video and now I have another test which is basically meta wanted to test if you have a budget of let's say 250 which is the case over here and then you run the same campaign with double the budget 500 which one is going to have the best results the other count is b2b lead generation and the cost per lead is high I will explain to you in the video more about how it works and what I think that I have learned from this a b test and I will see you on my pc so that we can analyze it more hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to feed better your needs and I will hope to see you there so this is the test basically what do we have here a very simple concept from meta so meta is giving all of these codes and stuff but we said that earlier you have budget a so they tell you run something with budget a and exactly the same thing with budget b which is going to be two times budget a so what do we have here it's running on an account which we have lead generation it's for high tickets so don't bother with the cost it's not something cheap and basically what do we have here is a spending of 250 in one campaign and we have another 500 another campaign I want to clarify that this is a structure that we have used in the past we know that it's working this is acceptable results and because it's b2b lead actually and the tests if we go here to the results we can see that the confidence level of the results 73 we said several times that 73 is not actually ideal they say that in order for you to be sure about the results it has to be 90 i have never seen 90 percent and if we come here we can see that it run from november 9 to december 9 there's no black friday it's b2b we don't know black friday in b2b campaigns i would like to show you the final results so that if you're lazy you can leave the video and don't see the other things basically the one that won surprisingly enough is the one that is having the bigger spend because in theory most of the times we would think that okay the one that's actually spending less it should actually maybe win because it is you know we know from the accounts that if we're spending less amount of money we're having better results but here we have a unique thing which i think that we need to see we do have the same identical campaigns and one of them is getting more volume so it's easier for the other one to still lead from the smaller one but let me see let me show you what was happening so that in total the results were this but it didn't start like this the results started pretty strange over here you will see that initially what we all thought that was going to happen here is that the biggest budget one is going to have worse results okay by the time though because of the volume it started optimizing better and you see this now let me explain you this because i think that sometimes people neglect it of course it's an a b test of course i cannot trust trust 100 because it's in favor of meta to believe that if we spend more money we're going to get better results as you can understand so there's a thin line over here but let me tell you also that if we have here lead generation for b2b that's very important to understand in a high cost which means that we are having um high cost individuals to do the b2b leads to be the b2b leads if we're getting more volume especially if the cost per purchase is high because over here we're getting 250 daily and the cost per lead went to 250 that means that maybe it's not enough so maybe from this test we can understand also that the budget that we're using here 250 and 500 maybe it's not enough and maybe we should have done 500 to 1000 of course that would skyrocket the test budget for this campaign over here but i think that you're getting my point because of the cost per lead the other thing is that in such a high intent leads we need to also calculate the volume because the more volume it gets the more people it actually can find what's the biggest issue that we have after ios it's that we are not getting enough data within the platform in order to optimize towards those so by having a campaign which is spending more getting more leads on a daily level eventually it's going to start you know doing better from the first campaign over here that you know initially it was getting 65 over here 134 these were the first days i guess nothing nothing here nothing here what okay so on the 13 we do get over here again better results you see it's getting uh it's getting less spent and stuff but this one eventually is going to catch up because it's going to uh be doing more volume okay so in the more volume eventually we see that this one is getting more volume same cost per lead but the more data is going to win eventually and we're going to have this result over here but after some point i have seen also that this campaign started also uh it's doing very well for these two weeks okay these two weeks are very crucial for the final results because it was doing 122 comparing to 230. so this second campaign was actually struggling i believe that because of the volume that the first one was getting it was actually stealing leads from the other but let's see what happened here on the last nine days on the last nine days something strange happened over here and maybe it has to do with the black friday period or i don't know what but in this period over here from the start of december which is not a very good month for b2b to be honest with you um we have seen that this result over here actually became worse uh which means that it actually lost optimization so the biggest spend is not actually is not actually always the answer but uh over here we do have of course um but the test was ending so there was no point to intervene over here but we can see that the biggest volume here was not used in the best possible way anyway just because of these two weeks uh over here that uh it did pretty well we can see that uh the final winner over here it was um basically the one that was spending more not only for the volume of course which was going to be more from the smaller spending one but also for the cost per lead and my explanation was the thing that i told you earlier which i believe that the volume actually helped it but on the last nine days we have seen also the bad side of it okay so what do we learn from this we can learn from this that maybe on this account we should not have 250 per day daily budget maybe we should go to 300 400 initially starting immediately secondly i still don't believe that by spending more you're going to get better results but it was an interesting test that i wanted to make a video about and maybe you can make your own conclusions out of it and you can let me know but at the end of the day meta is giving now a lot of these of coupons if you have a meta rep and you can ask them and you can run your own tests for sure i'm letting for those but on the other hand i do believe more the results that they see on normal campaigns and not on ab test so much because i don't trust the ab test process so much and as they say this is not 90 so they are covered and they we can say that this is not so accurate but for sure interesting you know for geeks like me that they like facebook ads it's interesting to discuss i think that most people watching this channel there are also like facebook ads so this is why i brought it here so ask for this test from your meta reps if you have any and i think that if you find the one that you like it or makes sense for your account you have nothing to lose because you would spend this money anyway if you have another account which is 2 3 4 5k spent per month i don't suggest it but if you have other accounts 30k 40k 50k you can have inside budgets which are going to be extra for this test while it's also favorable for you because this is how your account is for example this ap test that you have seen it made a lot of sense to be running this account but not maybe in an e-commerce um that i didn't care about it but the value optimization asc made sense on the e-commerce that i used it because we have a fluctuation on aov and i wanted to see if i would benefit from that of course we have this uh score from meta that the ap test doesn't help you a lot but uh you can learn things and at the same time you can take a little bit of extra budget from meta to use and if it's successful you know and it's not spending money with you losing money then everything is fine because you will make some extra money from the credit so ask them pick the correct ones that they make sense for you and that you are kind of sure that they are going to be successful not any test that for example they tell you to run traffic ads and then retarget i wouldn't do any test like this unless if they fund it 100 okay uh we have a video on this channel that they have funded us with a million or something 1.3 million for uh testing shop ads when they were starting so that they can train the algorithm but there's a different coupon code they're not like these ones that they get a partial funding that's all i had for you if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website you can check of course my mentorship programs and below you can check all the people that they have completed them don't send me messages asking me to give you a coupon code or whatever this is something that you will have to do with meta and with meta reps and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent you
