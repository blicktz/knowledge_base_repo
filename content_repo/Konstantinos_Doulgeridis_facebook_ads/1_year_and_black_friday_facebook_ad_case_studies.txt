Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Konstantinos and today we're going to discuss a little bit about the results from Black Friday for all the one-year case studies videos that I have published in the previous months. First of all I must say that whatever I told you it happened even with numbers I scaled the one business to 540k with six rows the other business to 340k and the other business to 400k so everything that I told you is actually went according to the plan all of my scaling the previous months and everything all worked pretty well the only thing that I can say about myself I said it also on the podcast if I want to do a criticism here constructive criticism I think I could have spent a little bit more on Cyber Monday maybe I got afraid of how much I spent in the previous days but when it comes to the whole with exception of Cyber Monday I think that I have spent as much as I could you know by having also good drawers at the same time so it's very hard for me to actually go and predict numbers of course if all the things that I have predicted wouldn't happen I don't know what I would tell you now everybody want to know what I would do if I didn't win I guess we'll never know but actually everything went pretty well so it's all good and I can show you if some of you doubted about it let's go to my pc so that I can show you what happened and the previous day scaling I'm not going to go one year back as we used to do with the previous case studies because you can see that video of the case study I will just go through the point that I started scaling and later so that I can show you how I prepared the ad account of course it's a it's a work of one year preparing the ad account for such the scaling but for sure this is what happened and I will show you three ad accounts which is the three case studies that we had and how all went because everything went according to the plan let's go to my pc first I would like to start with the united states account again the spend over here at the end was 540k 6 rows and I would like to take you from the previous April that I started to scale sadly we will have to do it like this I guess guys we will have to take the campaigns and go inside like this so on April the spend was 133 with 6.04 imagine that on April we were spending 133k and now on the Black Friday we scaled to 540 with 6.04 now let's go on the next month let's go on May on May it was the month that I told you that I was struggling a little bit but I didn't want to stop scaling so the results here was 100 no I think it was June 151k 6.34 so still we're on a low pace over here and then we go on June 167 let's see the rows here again 4.29 this is the point that I didn't scale down and I kept scaling while the results were not the best possible results that we have because 4 hours here is a break even so we don't want to be on 4 hours now on on the next month on July I scaled even more because now we're going through the point that we are actually starting scaling more and more preparing for the Black Friday so I scaled to 180 5.26 as you can see I'm a little bit more conservative here I'm doing a bigger bump here on August gradually scaling okay gradually scaling month by month so on August I'm having 226k 5.59 then on September I'm increasing a little bit more going to 283k 5.33 October was a little bit of challenging month 292k 5.24 and at this point I knew that I was going to go for another 200k now if I kept my budget to 150k 160k 200k most probably I was going to be able to scale on the Black Friday only to 400k which we have one of the case studies that we spent that much that we were able to scale only to 400k believe now on this case over here I scaled to 300k because I wanted to go more aggressively during the Black Friday so I had to prepare the ad account with a spend you cannot go just immediately from you can in theory but it's not the best case scenario here here establishing a position of 300k means that the next month after Black Friday I can work with 300k 300k and go to 400k and at some point maybe reach 500k during the normal months before the Black Friday which my biggest goal right now is to have 500k spent and go for 1 million spent in the next Black Friday this is my goal as you can see here 292k 5.24 and then the next month on November we are on 6 ROAS 540k so mission accomplished over here the only thing I told you that I would do a little bit different is maybe I would have scaled a little bit more during the Cyber Monday if we want to see a little bit the months here because the Black Friday had started earlier I started around Monday or Tuesday here but if we want to see this week 22k 24k on Thursday I'm spending 25k I'm doing a very big bump on this day with 42k then I'm dropping a little bit on Saturday to 36k Sunday I'm doing 33k 30k and on Monday I'm doing again 30k this is where I was wrong 8.93 on Monday with 30k I think I could have scaled more maybe go again to 40k or even 50k because it worked pretty well for Cyber Monday and this is this has happened across accounts most of the times Cyber Monday is a little bit slower from Black Friday so I didn't expect that let's go and let's see another ad account which is the UK account the one year case study and let's see what happened there so this is the UK one year case study that we have for the previous year we had in total three case studies of course I cannot just upload videos with case studies these are some of the best accounts that I have found in order to show you things so we're having three cases only there are other businesses also that I can show you with from 50k going to 100k spent from 100k spent going to 200k spent but I cannot just float the channel with with case studies alone over here what we can see is that we have spent 340k over here and the previous month October was 229k I remind you that this is pounds so you have to do the conversion to see it in Euros or USD now if we take on this account this account is on United Kingdom I cannot be as aggressive as I want let's go on June to see what was happening here again we will have to do the same sorry guys but facebook is bugging not to be 82k six rows here remember that this is one of the account that I told you that they didn't let me to spend more than 100k because of stock issues by the way after black friday here and what the scaling again they have stock issues so I don't know if all of my progress is going to be beneficial because I don't know how many campaigns are going to survive from what is happening now with low stock on the company after the scaling of course it's the scaling that they have done on my own I told them about all of that if we go here on July from 82k we go to 160k and let's see how much is the ROAS 6.36 so this account wanted to scale but we couldn't scale because of issues with stock then we continue on August this is much more aggressive scaling in my opinion because we were below 100k on the other account we were consistently and close to 150k to 180k okay and we scaled so here we went to 169k on August then if we see September we went to 164k which is kind of the same budget October we went to 230k a little bit lower ROAS preparing for the Black Friday I must say that this account it wasn't scaling as smooth as the United States account on the other ad account in business so here if we watch on November we can see that we have 340k five ROAS these are numbers that I believe if I remember correctly I have predicted the numbers if you want on the video find what I told in the last case studies that was my intention of spending and how much I wanted to scale I think that for the United States I said between 500 and 600k that I want to spend find what I said on this one and for the next and just put them here to to know what I said for each of the account as a prediction flashback I want to spend on my next Black Friday period 400k or 500k we are positioning ourselves strong for the Black Friday period I want to go between 250 and 300k for this account as pounds spent end of flashback I don't like to predict numbers I'm against it because Facebook is unpredictable but you always have a plan in your head it doesn't mean that it's going to work I just don't announce that hey we're going to spend this amount of money it really depends 340k then on five ROAS and now we'll have to see what we will do with this account because we have stock issues the point here that I want to make is that this was also successful scaling now what I would try to do with this account is most probably I won't try to go again to 300k soon because we have found that it's not ideal it causes problems the company is not ready yet for this kind of scaling in UK so what am I going to do is I'm going to try to be between 200 and 250k in the next period let's go and let's see also the last case study and what happened there in this account as I showed you before in the United States we have spent 540k generating 3.2 million almost and if we go in this account we can see that we have spent 448 with lower ROAS this time because this company operates with 1.8 break even so we want to be above 2.2 always they did a massive a massive promo on the site for 40% off site-wide which is what they do during Black Friday every year and the truth is that we had even better ROAS because of the volume while we were having this big promotion so the revenue here was 1.4 million for the Black Friday period I must say that for the all of these three companies we have hit record numbers within Facebook record numbers on their on the biggest days that they have ever done and record months the biggest revenue months that they have ever done for this one and the scaling started also during summer the spend over here was 86k yeah 86k 2.45 if we go on the next month on July the spend over here is 170k I started scaling on that period of course July was also a very good month so it makes sense that I scaled so 170k 2.74 on the scaling very good scaling with even increasing ROAS August we go to 196k with 2.11k which is totally fine because we are maintaining also spend over here preparing for the Black Friday you have seen that in the long term we have won the total numbers if we go on September 181k spent 2.12 I'm trying to maintain at least a 2.1 plus this is why you see dropping a little bit but still I'm close to the point that I want to be close to the 200k because I want to scale on the double during the Black Friday period and on October if I'm on 100k on October how much did I spend 200 some yeah 200 so I'm trying to be close to 200 do you see how close I am to always the same number so on August 2.11k with this on September 2.12k and on October with different budgets 2.12k now when you're operating with smaller ROAS like 2 ROAS 1.5 1.6 it's easier to just try to play with numbers and go but when you have 5 6 7 8 ROAS the differences can be 0.5 ROAS in one month 0.3 0.7 depending because they have bigger fluctuations because the ROAS number is higher but when you play on two ROAS three ROAS it's easier to just maintain a number because it's easier to have averages that are close the bigger the number the bigger the averages fluctuation can be so 2.12 here with 200k and then boom on November I do my scaling on 450k 3.16 I think that this one continues also pretty well this month yeah 87k so far on the 13 days so my goal for this one is to try and I think I can easily do it it's to try to maintain of course we have stock issues again here after Black Friday and everything because even if you prepare a lot for Black Friday you cannot you cannot just be 100 ready you're going to have stock issues especially in a clothing brand like this 2.64 87k my goal for this one is to go immediately as fast as I can in the next months to 300k spent and stay on 300k spent next year we will try to go and do something like the United States half a million spent between half a million and 600k but maybe even more who knows depends on how it's actually going to scale something that I forgot to tell you and it's it's a little bit of a mix to all of our accounts is that one major decision that I took in all of the accounts brought all of these results and it's this if you see on this other account is not so obvious but there was a three-day period before the Black Friday that everybody was launching ads that the results were not so good this period was 16 to 18. This is something that experienced advertisers like me we do expect and we have zero issues with it because we know that we're going to recuperate these lost draws in the next days but I believe that a lot of people during this weekend they panicked and they closed their ads and this caused them not to scale a lot maybe I have done this mistake also in the past I don't remember but I mean I remember panicking but I don't remember something like this and closing ads and everything but I remember me being afraid this time I wasn't afraid at all and I knew that I was going to recover in the next days so situation is that between 16 and 18 we see that here we have lower ROAS comparing to what we have for example on the Black Friday period okay and if we want to go here on these other accounts let's go to United States first 16 to 18 4.22 which is very bad so you have from 12 to 15 7.5 okay 16 to 18 you have very bad ROAS this is across accounts okay and then you go 19 to 24 you have good ROAS again for me this period 16 to 18 was the period that most people maybe inexperienced people they have done mistakes or people that they just do the ads on their own and so on everybody was latching ads on the weekend so that they can start ads for the Monday Tuesday Wednesday some people they even do ads just on Friday but if you think of it on this period everybody is starting ads and people panicking stop some ads that they had is what is going to define how everybody else is going to do so everybody who panicked here and they closed ads because they're inexperienced because they didn't know because they were losing a lot of money and they couldn't afford it it doesn't matter they are the ones that they lost and we are the ones that we stayed in our position and we won because over here you can see 4.49 also 6 to 18 12 to 15 6.9 to 1 and in this period good ROAS again so you can see that it's not only okay it's Black Friday working scale your decisions do matter and things that you do these three days i believe that there are a lot of people that they got destroyed because of mistakes that they have done and people that they are more experienced and they know that okay or for example after Black Friday for one week you're going to have bad results it doesn't mean that you have to close all of your ads and lose all of the progress that you have made with your evergreen campaigns during the Black Friday anyway this is something that we have discussed discussed also extensively during the previous videos about the bad periods and all of that and not to panic after two or three or four days with bad results and everything because it's going to recover and watch the average results and i hope that this example also is going to help you understand especially after a period that you know that Black Friday is coming because do you remember back when i created one video that it was all about how to overcome bad periods well here we don't have the whole way of thinking was that okay we have a bad period on facebook we go and we do a promo to inflate results with that within the platform so that it can work well and i showed you in this case study that it actually worked pretty well here we don't have to do a promo we're waiting already a promo which is coming and we have planned anyway it's the Black Friday so the previous weekend if you have three or four days to me it says nothing because you know that in the next days you're going to have very good results and these three four days are going to be significant at the end of the month for the average results of the month i hope that this is also going to help you understand because during that period i was actually really busy so i wouldn't be able to create a video and i thought that it would be nice for me telling you that this happened also i think i mentioned it on the podcast but whoever is bored to watch it a podcast of one hour they have to watch a 30 minute video now to see it anyway let's continue before we close i would like to tell you that these ad accounts are ad accounts that they have been prepared for a whole year i'm working with these companies for a long period and i know they are accounts i have been preparing them i showed you how i scaled them i saw how we overcame difficult periods maintaining our position to the market without losing our spend i showed you how experience can overcome difficult situations when you are scaling and also how you can benefit from attack periods that you can get better spent and more spent during that period to be honest with you i think that it's the end of a very very very big circle until we open the next one which maybe it's going to be that in one year from now we're going to discuss on how these other accounts are doing and how we scaled since the last time that we left them in this place i hope that you learn things from that i hope that you can see the bigger picture of beginner accounts and how they work we like big numbers everybody wants to work with big numbers so that's all i had for you i hope that you liked the video i have to clarify that i'm not uploading this for flexing i just believe that there's a lot of value on seeing how i scale because this is one year of doing actions over here which i think that it's helpful and the second thing that i want to clarify is that it doesn't mean that it's happening over one month so don't expect this to happen for you in one month this is something that i have prepared for for a whole year and i i put all my philosophy in action about the attack periods which is the black friday stuff the people that they are on the channel for a long period they understand what i mean and one more thing i guess that i want to say is that a lot of times i like to post these things because i like to have them on my personal archive also as references so that i can remember what happened because in the previous years guys i had so many success with many companies and stuff and i was never keeping print screens or anything but now i really like to make videos like this also for me to remember what i have achieved the progress and all of that and i believe that through this progress you are also learning so don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course or my website and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
