Hello Facebook Ads People, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to answer one of the questions that I see always into your comments and into your messages. One of the questions is actually this and this is just an example. There are people that they're asking this again and again and again throughout the months and the years and basically the question is should I close my ads on weekend and then open them again on Monday?

Should I do that? And of course I'm going to throw a little bit about the lifetime budget which is also part of it and we're going to analyze it. So the way of thinking is this, people say okay I'm seeing consistently on my weekends that they have very bad results and then on Monday Tuesday Wednesday it's actually recuperating and then on weekends again bad and so on.

Should I close my ads for two days and then open them again? The answer it's different. So if you're spending $100 per day you have the luxury of doing that and you can do it if you want.

I wouldn't suggest it because I believe in data okay but still your attribution model is going to be on seven days one day click so even if you close them for two days and then you open them you still have the data to continue and so on. So if you spend 50 100 and you find it very difficult for your weekends to actually maintain your profitability you can do it and it's something that I wouldn't suggest you normally to do or for example if I was managing your account I was going to do I was going to try to find another way and I was going to suggest you to soak the damage of the weekend in order to continue running the ads. But if you're an owner and if you're on your own and if you're afraid and if you don't have the experience of actually overcoming these kind of situations okay go for it.

Now the other thing should I have a lifetime budget for example lifetime budget is when you don't have a daily budget but you have a lifetime budget which is going to be for example $10,000 for one month for example okay and then you put specific hours of the days that the ads are going to run and most of the times what people do is they let them run on the prime hours which is 5 to 11 o'clock at the night and then nothing on weekends. I have rarely seen lifetime budget accounts working and to be honest with you I don't use them either only Meta is using them when they want to run a specific credit that they're going to give you they want to run for a specific period you can use it with lifetime budget but still the only advantage that they have is that you can run on different hours and you can avoid days that you don't like but I don't use it I have seen only one account in my life working very well with lifetime budget and not working with daily budget this is when I was using it also because there is no room for ego when something is working and the other thing is not working. So small spend well the answer is easy you can do whatever you want because it doesn't matter it's not influencing a lot but let's say that you are spending 50k per month 100k per month and you want to actually close your ads for the weekend you are going to have losses I have seen it consistently from people doing it not while I was there but I have seen the results when they were doing it after I joined their accounts and let me tell you that when you are having a spend of 50k 60k 80k 200k whatever you not just close the ads and then open them again the answer is not a faucet of water they need data they need to populate they need to have some results and then when you close them you make them start all over again it's not it has nothing to do with the learning phase it has nothing to do with the learning phase what I'm saying here because you can see videos that I have that they are proving that the learning phase is just there so as theory but it doesn't mean that if one of your ads doesn't go out of the learning phase it's not going to work it has to do with all of the data that you're going to lose throughout this period which is not going to help you and maybe you will tell me okay but Kostantinos this is bad data because it's giving me bad ROAS yes but it's still data that they are going to continue helping you to continue having sales consistent sales because these sales are very important for the bigger budgets if you want to close them close them okay here we're making just a discussion of what we observe on accounts and what is my opinion if you want to close them go for it and close them but you know you're not the only smart person in the world okay everybody's thinking about it and this is why this is the most common question that I get everybody's thinking okay I will close them for two days open them again when you are having higher spends you are losing more from what you're winning from this action because of the data that you are losing when you are having small budgets you can still do it I hope that this is going to explain it once and forever and I hope that you're going to take the right decision for your ad account it's not black and white it's a different thing in a different case anytime that's all I had for you don't forget that if you want to learn more about Facebook ads you can check my book my free course and my paid course and my website of course and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
