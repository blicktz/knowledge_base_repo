Hello Facebook ads people, I'm Konstantinos and this is the part 3 of the daily loop theory. I want to conclude this case study and just show you how the account recovered after all of this thing with two or three campaigns and stuff and at the end of the video after showing you on my pc the ad account having a clear discussion on why sometimes you cannot scale even if you want to. If you haven't seen my other daily loop theory videos I think you should go and watch them before this video because this is the part 3 which is actually proving my point again and again and this is also a video for all of you that you're having a business which is not working or you cannot scale.

Facebook is going to give you the results that it's going to give you. There's not any secret magic sauce that if you're getting one ROAS is going to give you five ROAS okay. You have to understand that there are other things that are going to influence that like your landing page, your creatives, all of these other things but at the end of the day what I want you to understand is that sometimes there are people that they send me messages and they say I just have one creative which is working at one product and I want to scale.

Maybe you cannot scale because maybe Facebook is going to stop you and this video is going to clear any doubt on that because it's proven now and you're going to be able to see it with your own eyes and then you can understand that if you don't do more things and you don't go outside of your comfort zone and you don't stop being lazy and you are going to create more videos more products and all of that then you're going to be able to scale but if you do the same thing again and again Facebook is going to give you the same amount of sales no matter how much you're going to spend. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to feed better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So let's go into my pc let's let me show you how it ended up with this ad account after these other months I think it's pretty interesting and I will see you there.

So let's see again this ad account let me give you a small brief of what was happening if you are lazy enough and you haven't seen the other videos which I think that you should in order to see the whole journey over here. So in this ad account we started this campaign the bottom one basically it started on May 28th okay so from May 28th if we come here so from May 28th we're having okay this was the first day let's say let's see the other days we're having some pretty good results okay so very good rows the rows that the company actually wants and all of that and we go up to that point from one to the sixth we do have sales over here okay so let's see a little bit how the sales go though okay so we have in this day we have nothing in this day we do have two sales then on the fifth we have nothing then on the sixth it's a high ticket item we have four sales then we come here we do have three sales then we come here we do have three sales then we do come here on the ninth we do have two sales so what we can understand is that we do get two to four sales every day some days less some days more so let's say an average of three sales okay most of the people what do they do I thought that my rows was really strong so I said okay let me just duplicate the campaign and run it like this so in this case we can see that when meta proposes the consolidation maybe this is what they mean because by just maintaining it like this and not spending more you're getting better ROAS but I didn't expect that if I spend double the amount of money with the same creative same product and everything the sales are going to be splitted in between and what happened is that after that we can see that if we come here on these days we can see I'm two and one we are having we're not having three sales anymore to one we have one here if we go here we do have four sales if we come here we do have one sale but it's always split it in between the campaigns as you can see okay two one one three it's very obvious right you can understand that yeah here I did another campaign but you can understand here that yeah I just did another campaign I just tried to scale and basically what is happening is that it's actually giving me the sales split it now some people would say okay let's let's just increase by increasing the spend I have tried that also and it was limiting my ROAS so basically here we are in a loop that meta is actually giving you the same sales again and again no matter how much you spend and I want I wanted to show you this based on seven days also just so that you can understand it so if we come one two three four five six seven so if we come here we do get 21 sales let's see the next in the next seven days 18 sales you can see that they're splitted in between but still we're getting kind of the same amount of sales 19 so between 18 and 19 18 again you see we're getting the same amount of sales okay which is pretty good for a new account and stability you know 17 and we come here with that so 19. Now let me tell you what has happened after the point that I started getting pissed with this situation because here how many sales do we get and of course the ROAS dropped a lot okay so let me show you ROAS over here um we did drop to four ROAS so instead of getting eight nine or ten ROAS we did drop to that because basically we were just spending double the amount of money just for meta to give us the same sales this is proving to some people that they just say I just want to scale with one creative or one product or whatever some not maybe with this small expense but sometimes you might have to understand that meta is not going to let you do so so let's go here on July and let's see again in between the days I'm having here so one to one again the same situation okay the one that I described to you earlier now let's go and let's see what happened because on July for example we had lower ROAS on average 3.29 okay so this is the point that I realized that in this month this ad account is not going to scale it's going to scale either with other products or other creatives it's a very specific product you cannot do many angles of this creative and the owner actually admitted that okay we cannot scale let's stay on the same span so perfect so let's go on August and let's see the difference on August we go back to healthy numbers but how did we do it basically I have this campaign over here that I actually started spending only on one campaign and this campaign started on the 7th of August and we can see that from the 7th up to the 31st we are having these results of course we do spend less I get it but what's the point for you to spend more and get lower ROAS if Facebook doesn't let you okay this is what I'm trying to prove here that I get it yes I'm going to get higher ROAS because I'm spending less the problem over here is to understand why I'm getting lower ROAS when I'm actually spending more and just to be proven with data so we do have these sales over here and let's see now what kind of sales it's giving us uh one two three four five six seven uh when we do uh spend like this with one campaign you see again we have 20 sales okay it's not changing the amount of sales that it's giving us but we're just spending it with less money again 20 sales pretty stable huh so 16 19 1 again you see it split it it gave us again 20 sales but the one was coming from the other campaign okay so let's see these last seven days over here 18 sales a little bit uh slower and then we go to September so far which we're doing pretty far which we're doing pretty well 7.65 74 sales with the amount of sales that it's the amount of ROAS that we actually wanted we're happy with so this is the conclusion now okay so you have seen me starting the ad account and saying okay this is doing really well with good ROAS let me try to increase it then it failed because i tried to increase with the same creatives and by just increasing the budget also and it failed completely so then i went back to doing one campaign and i'm getting the ROAS that i want just because facebook wants to give me every seven days 18 to 21 sales or every day two to four sales okay that's the whole thing that i have realized with this ad account and it helped me a lot also in other bigger ad accounts in order to be able to scale and just break the daily loop and the whole theory that we have for all of that so that's all i had for you if you are in a scaling process and you are seeing this then reevaluate everything your numbers creatives landing pages offer everything different products different counters and all of that in order for you to be able to break the daily loop of the sales that meta is actually giving you i hope that this is a visual video that is going to explain this one same for all that you cannot just scale even if you want to as much as you want to don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website and of course my mentorship programs you can see below the testimonials from the people that they have completed the mentorship programs and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent you
