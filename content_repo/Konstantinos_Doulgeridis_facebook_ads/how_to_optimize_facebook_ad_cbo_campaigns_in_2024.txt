Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about CBO optimization in 2024. Basically nothing has changed since 2023 but we're going to go into my PC. I'm going to show you some different optimizations that I will do live for you depending on what case studies I have right now.

So for all of you that you're not using CBO optimization, CBO campaigns in general, I think that you should use them and I think that they are doing really well. So in 2024 CBO is going to be the king of the normal campaigns. Of course the king of the kings is going to be Advance Plus because more and more and more people use them and we have done a video which is extensively explaining Advance Plus and how to optimize it and all of that.

But CBO optimization is also going to be one of the things that we need to know because if you're scaling a lot, right now we have a limitation of 8 Advance Plus campaigns for ad accounts. This thing is changing maybe, we will see, but in some of the accounts I can create more than 8 Advance Plus. I don't know if it's a change which is going to start happening across the accounts and eventually to all other accounts or if it's something that I'm seeing in some of my ad accounts, we will see.

I haven't figured out that yet but I know that in some I can do more than 8 Advance Plus which is fine because I can do more campaigns. What is it happening though on the account that you cannot do more than 8 Advance Plus? You have to do a CBO and most of the time if you have a trend pixel this is going to be a CBO crazy method with broad targeting or a CBO with stacked lookalikes 10% crazy method.

The most crucial thing here is not the method as a method but how are we going to optimize CBO campaigns? It's not easy, it's difficult. This is why a lot of people don't prefer them and they just do ABO or whatever but in ABO you're not having the same results as the results that you're having on CBO.

Anyway, I have other videos that I'm explaining why CBO is better than ABO so there's no point of discussing it more here you can see these videos but let's go into my PC and let me show you some case, some cases of CBO optimization that I'm going to find and we will take it from there. Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have. You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there.

Okay guys, so I'm going to take you through some of my other accounts. I haven't prepared anything so bear with me we will go to different cases. Now this is another account over here.

This one is operating on the Middle East. I'm not doing ADVANTAGE PLUS campaigns over here because there's a huge problem in the Middle East. Either you have to do a different ADVANTAGE PLUS for Saudi Arabia which is a huge market and you have to do different one for Qatar.

Now the period that I'm shooting this video is one month before the Ramadan. So there are a lot of people that they are running ads and it's like let's call it their Black Friday. I hope it's not offensive to them and so on.

So it is a period that people buy a lot. Over here we have a business which is actually selling Kaftans and on this case we are running CBO campaigns because we want to... it wasn't working very well with ADVANTAGE PLUS first of all but secondly you have to segment them differently because Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain they are small countries from United Arab Emirates.

We are running only Abu Dhabi because of shipping issues and then we have Saudi Arabia which has to go alone because it's huge compared to the other. So either you will do a segmentation like this in your ADVANTAGE PLUS campaigns or you're going to do CBO campaigns with different things. My strategy over here after seeing that ADVANTAGE PLUS wasn't working was to do CBO campaigns.

A crazy method of broad targeting with the right demographics based on the previous sales for Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Abu Dhabi just on a mile radius which is just small small small small small all together in a crazy method of broad targeting and the crazy method 10% look-alikes for Saudi Arabia because I didn't want to do it just broad. I just wanted to be based on some data and it's working flawlessly as you can see. Of course I will have to...

you know something in this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 over here I'm not going to hide the names, okay, because I want you to see what I'm doing. So this is a 10% look-alikes for Kuwait. This is a 10% look-alikes for Saudi Arabia.

This is a crazy method with the different countries that I mentioned. This is a crazy method with the different countries and some new creators that I have and this is a new crazy method with stacked look-alikes. We can see that the stacked look-alikes are working less comparing to the crazy method broad which means that maybe the pixel wants to do it but let's start optimizing a little bit the campaigns and see what we have here.

So here let's say Ford it's totally fine on ROAS over here but let's say that we're not happy with that, okay. We can see that I have optimized but I had some results over here. How can we improve this campaign, okay?

The first thing that we see in a CBO campaign is our leading ad. Our leading ad over here is getting three ROAS. So most probably during the time this campaign is going to go towards three ROAS unless if it gets some sales and it's going to improve.

Another thing is that we had some decline payment issues here so I don't know if Facebook is penalizing us in this period because in the last 14 days I believe that the results are higher. So now we are in the downtrend over here but we will see. We will see how it's going to actually behave.

Now let's say that in this case for example we want to see... First of all we should not expect it in the long term to go higher than three because when the majority of the spend is on 2.99 and 2.9, our two, this sale is going to go away which is a high average order value sale. So eventually this is going to be a three ROAS.

Are we happy with that or whatever? I guess we're still happy with three ROAS but let's say that we want to improve it. One thing that we can do over here in order to improve this campaign is just say okay this one is getting 1.57 okay.

I will just try to give you different options over here. So let's say that we get this one 1.57 which is bothering us okay. So if we come here and we filter those by selection what we get without it is 4.61.

So the question here is this. Are we willing to risk this campaign in order to get from 4.23 to 4.61? This totally depends to you not on your greediness but on your results, on the results that you want to see.

If for example you have a campaign that is giving you 2.9 ROAS and you are profitable after having 3 ROAS and you can do a change like the way that I showed you that it can bring you to 3.2 ROAS then it's worth it. Here, does it worth it for me to go from 4.2 to 4.6? The answer to me it's no because in the average results that I'm getting are good.

So I'm saying okay this is a budget that has already been distributed. I don't want to change it and I don't want to I want to actually work with average results. The biggest mistake that most people do in CBO campaigns and they don't understand it is either they are increasing the budget which is disturbing the balance and it's a question which I get a lot but we will discuss this in a video about account structure and scaling and the other is that they come here and they say okay I like this one this one I like this one but I don't like this one so I'm going to close it.

Closing an ad set means that all of the budget that you're closing that it's going to be liberated it's going to go towards other assets which might disturb them or try to scale them or cause other issues. The way that I like to optimize CBO campaign is to work with average results. If in average I'm getting the results that I want I can consider this one an ad which is giving me volume and this one an ad which is giving me quality okay the ROAS that I want.

Now the big question here is this if I wasn't happy with the three ROAS okay because here at the end it's going to go to three ROAS right now I'm on four let's say that three ROAS is my break even and I'm not happy with that right now I'm on four what should I do over here as the situation is you should wait a little bit to see if it's going to do better without touching it okay. The second thing is that you're going to see if it's going to end up going close to three ROAS or it's going to improve. The last thing is that if you want three ROAS and you're getting three ROAS and your first and second leading ads are three ROAS ad sets you can do nothing about it and maybe you should consider closing it because it's not going to magically improve.

That's one case over here. The cases of CBO optimization are thousands if not hundreds of thousands okay and I know from my students or people that I did or from the ad accounts that I see that there are different cases and sometimes I might say this and it sounds like it's completely different from what I said yesterday but I do analyze them in a much let's say it's a much bigger plan you know of different things that I'm checking. So let's go to another one let's go to this one for example this one it has 7.8 let's see inside here now again over here if we come here we're fortunate enough to have CBO campaigns that they're having a lot of results so they're having all of the ads over here they're having sales so my question to you is this most people will come here they are going to check this one and they're going to just try to close it for example okay what's the point of touching it and doing that because again ask yourself what you're going to win out of it let's group them out filter by selection 8.58 okay and without that you're going to have 7.8 okay it's a lot I get it do you want to go down that path it's up to you what I do here is that I'm not that greedy to want to go from 7.8 to 8.5 because I'm already profitable so I'm just saying okay I'm leaving it it has a balance it has this bad hot pocket ad over here it has an it has another which is doing very well I'm not afraid also here because this campaign is very strong because it's having very good draws on the leading ad while the second ad is not so powerful but the leading ad it's super powerful these two are actually spending kind of the same and what I'm seeing here is one ad which is not doing so well now if I had only two ads ads over here most probably I would tell you not even think about touching it but now you have here one two three four if we see what this ad spent yesterday the ad spent yesterday just 10 dollars okay okay let's not over exaggerate over here okay and let's not think that this is going to influence our campaign so much let me see something yesterday yeah yesterday it spent only uh 10 dollars so here even if I disagree and I'm telling you that you should work with average results you have the option because you have one two three four other ad sets that they're just having results and spend you can even go and you can even close it trying to improve a little bit the hours of this campaign if you had only two ads over here I would tell you not to do it also you need to check what this ad is spending and how it's going to impact your campaign so if this ad was spending 50 per day this is a significant amount to actually go and ruin my whole campaign by the budget which is going to be distributed here and there because you don't control where the budget is going to be distributed this is how cbo is working so in that case over here you can see that by closing it and only 10 dollars that it's spending it's not going to affect me a lot because this is going to be scattered among four ads let's see another campaign over here let's go to this one for example in this one we can see that the two leading ads are doing really well we have another two which are not doing so well but again we're watching with we're working with an average result so we're not going to touch that I have closed already this while I was optimizing let's look at this one for example in this one okay let's talk about this one this one is new okay and it started right now and it actually have hasn't spent yet a lot of money but let's see what we're doing over here what am I going to see is also the checkouts in the first 24 48 hours what I'm checking also is the checkouts and I'm trying to see if it's getting any sales or not and just to be able to understand it more I will just put also that here you see how different it is because a lot of times people go in the first 24 hours they take decisions which are not correct but today this ad is killing it don't get me wrong these sales didn't came today these are sales that are not reported in time for example we know that we have a delayed reporting up to 24 48 hours in the united states even up to 72 hours so it's very important when you are watching your ads to watch also your initiate checkout now the initiate checkout is being reported immediately immediately when you have a checkout it's being reported immediately what is taking more time for facebook to be reported it's actually the sale why because this in the sale it's trying to actually locate the person so it's trying to say it's Kostantinos okay on the other one is just a checkout it doesn't care about the person that check out that that did the check out to find who it is because you're not optimizing for checkouts if you're optimizing for checkouts then it's going to try to find the person that it is doing the checkout it's taking more time a lot of times because this is the event that you're optimizing for and it's trying to find the person so that you can find the next one the next one and the next one so when you're having a purchase over here campaign optimization then maybe the purchase is going to be delayed up to 48 hours or 72 hours for united states and we know that meta also admits that so when you are optimizing this is why i'm telling a lot of times to people that you need to wait up to 48 hours without doing any changes initially on your ads of course this applies when you see that these over here are normal for example if we see in these campaigns we can see that we are getting in these lookalikes on kuwait 1.88 and in this one 0.89 1.22 so these are numbers and cost per click that we are seeing across in and they are normal so if you don't see anything abnormal or any cpm which is not okay you're just going to to say okay i'm just going to leave it for 24 48 hours and i'm trying to put this rule so that people are not going to do mistakes because they are impatient or because they are afraid because when you are spending 100 per day for example and you have 1000 and you want to do something for 10 days it is completely different from from having a lot of money for example and being able to test and not not being afraid because some people they just have 1000 and they just go to test and they are more you know inclined to make a mistake because they're afraid of what they are spending so let's say that yesterday when i watched it i said okay i'm not going to close anything here because the only thing that i wanted to close is this one but i still said i'm going to leave it and by the way when i said 24 48 hours if you have items that they are having higher ticket value then you should leave them even more because it's taking more time for the people to decide if they are going to buy or not so one thing that we are taking the first 24 48 hours two things actually is the spend and the checkouts if something is spending an enormous amount of money just right away and it has nothing here not even a check out or anything then you can close it another thing that you're watching is the average cost per purchase that you're getting in the ad account what is the average cost per purchase that we're getting here here it's more expensive oh no this is yesterday here for example it's more expensive for this one but here we get 74 so let's say we can leave one ad profitably spend up to 70 80 90.

okay in that case we have sales with 38 which is perfect in that case we have with 65 which is still within our numbers and in that case we had zero sales in the in the first day does this mean that i'm going to close it first thing that i'm checking is my cost per click everything looks fine is my cpm it's a little bit higher than normal but we're going to check in a little bit and we have also to check out so we're going to see what control we will do but let's continue the cbo optimization with this one because these are the early steps of a cbo so in this one the only thing which i'm which i'm thinking that it's a little bit not normal first of all i'm sorting them out like this is this one which is spending 36 and it's having zero checkouts this one that has zero checkouts with 17 i consider it normal it's a very small spend so what am i going to do if i want to take a decision is that i'm going to look also today and today it's also spending 27 without any checkouts so i immediately spot that this is an ad which has already spent in the maximum 63 it's the only one that doesn't have a sale and zero checkouts so this one guys has to go okay even without this is only 24 hours by the way okay but i'm watching the 24 hours and today what i'm doing i'm a little bit faster if you want you can wait a little bit more but i didn't touch anything on the first 24 hours because i was getting most probably i was going to close that yesterday but still i wasn't sure because it just spent 36 and not something close to the 60 70 which is my average cost per purchase that i'm seeing not the average average but it's something that i see across the ad account so this campaign looks fine if we see on the maximum period we just closed the one bad we can see that this one even got a sale without checkout this one has 5 4. another thing that you need to consider right now that you're getting your first sales is that you need to check the ratio between checkout and purchases so when you're seeing that for example over here in a campaign that is running for a long period okay we can see that we have let's say this one okay 91 38 so that means that we get one to three let's say okay this one is going to be 66 this one is four four times but so in the lookalikes the conversion rate is worse but in the broad targeting it looks better here is one one to two but it's too early to say and here it's actually uh one every three so every three checkouts we get one purchase close to that or close to 2.5 i guess uh so in the crazy method broad targeting we're getting better results in conversion rate compared to the lookalikes okay so the broad targeting is actually having better conversion rate but still those are acceptable numbers on the uh conversion rate over here now what i need to tell you is that by watching these numbers and understanding in another account after you optimize again and again and again you just see the conversion rate then you're checking the checkouts also and this is a bad campaign it started really bad so in the maximum period it has four checkouts and zero purchases and now i'm starting to think that i need to optimize this campaign and i need to start cutting budgets because even this number the cost per checkout is not doing well so obviously there is something wrong here so this one started pretty well but this one which started also in the same period you can see that they spent the same amount of money it has started really bad so we do trust the algorithm in terms of the optimization but we need to intervene when the algorithm is doing mistakes let's see where's this miss where's this mistake over here okay so over here we're seeing one campaign that has normal numbers okay we can see that this one has better cost per click and this one let's see also the cpm's cpm on the first one it's actually higher and on this one it's actually higher on this one and these are the two ones that are getting all the checkouts by the way okay this one is already on 45 so i don't consider it uh bad right now oh so this is not this is a lookalikes okay this is why it's doing worse so you see how we how we see the pattern that okay stacked lookalikes are not working as well as broad targeting is working in this ad account so maybe we're going to stop them and we're just going to do broad targeting in this ad account maybe i will do a broad targeting with saudi arabia alone and see because these creatives on this campaign and this campaign they are exactly the same creatives so we know that and that's the whole point okay we're doing different campaigns in order to test which one is working better to be honest with you when i started on this ad account the stacked lookalikes did really well but then they start dropping so i'm starting using now more crazy method broad targeting and most probably i will do the same on saudi arabia if we come here though we have to take some decisions okay because this is a difficult optimization so far what i showed you these are easy decisions on cb optimization most of the times people don't know what to do in these cases in these cases what they would do what they would do for sure and to be honest with you it's difficult and it's a little bit of a gamble because there's no clear answers to that there are two paths that i see either give it more time and close this one which has zero checkouts so i'm leaving this one and this one risking and the other one it's risking even more and closing the first and the second okay now the problem here is this i don't know if these checkouts are sales okay so maybe in the next days i'm going to see some of the sales coming with delayed reporting coming sale because i'm not going to be trading so i'm leaning towards this one and the reason is that in the holland account i'm super healthy right now in terms of rush i have eight rows so i have the luxury of giving it more time to see how it's going to optimize while i have one and one in the previous day and today one to one so i'm leaving it a little bit more to see if there's any delayed reporting coming sale because if the sale comes maybe it's going to change the situation maybe not it doesn't matter but you get my point this is how i'm going to do that if i had problems with my ROAS over here what i would do is that i would go and i would be even more aggressive or even close it completely and just do another one for example in some other accounts that they're problematic and they you don't have the luxury of leaving it more i would go and close it and run it a crazy method with broad targeting for saudi arabia instead of stuck lookalikes anyway that's some cases of cpu optimization let me see if i can find anything more interesting but i think that we covered a lot just to this ad account but let's go in another one maybe i will find a more problematic one so i'm in another ad account over here it's a smaller ad account no no this is not the smaller it's it's a good size ad account here i'm going to to hide the names sadly but here you can see that this is stacked lookalikes campaign okay it's doing pretty well the break of ROAS is 1.8 over here so another mistake that i see a lot and this is why i'm focusing so much to it is this this one over here it's taking some budget we can see that our leading ad is already on two so we know that we are closer to two but our set con leading ad is getting better results now the most mistakes that people do with cpu optimization it's coming from greediness okay and when you're greedy you're doing mistakes because you can say okay i'm going to close this one i'm going to leave this one but this one is going to liberate a lot of budget and maybe it's going to take this one to have lesser results or you're coming here and you're closing this one which it's not spending a lot of money anyway but what's the point of touching all of that this one is now one whole package which is working well and there's no point to touch it you know or mess with it or whatever another problem is that i see and i get a lot of times the question that i have a cbo campaign which is working this cbo for example is working with 500 per day okay and they say i want to scale don't scale this campaign do another one there is no point of touching it the same way that i'm telling you that you should not touch this 0.28 okay some people don't accept it they just they just go crazy about it you know why leave it because it's working with average results the same way that this add account over here it's operating with 2.10 having some campaigns which are having uh below break even rows over here for example okay the point is that whoever doesn't understand that they are not going to scale their other accounts because the same way that i'm treating my cbo campaigns with average results without touching them and working with an average which is giving me the results that i want okay without saying okay this campaign is not doing well let's close into that the moment you start touching all of your campaigns like this you are not able to scale because you are touching too much the other account and you are changing all the time the balances so the same way that we are treating our cbo optimization and our advanced plus optimization and everything with average results the same way you're treating your whole add account and imagine that your whole add account is just a big cbo and all of your campaigns are your different assets and you don't care if one of them is having low results or high results just to give you another example of that let me take you to this one okay so in this one for example you can see that in the last seven days we are having 2.17 look how many campaigns i have here okay and we're going to do another video with this one because i'm going to show you um manual bidding over here but you can see that over here i'm having this one which is doing better this one which is doing worse and stuff now in this account i'm spending actually uh six day per day okay and some days are worse some days are better but here we are having a lot account which is spending this amount of money because you because i'm working in that way if you start touching here this campaign that's not doing well or bad or whatever for example this campaign as we see maybe in the last 30 days you see it has complete different results so a lot of times people do the mistake of watching the reason that i'm saying this in this video is because it's the same philosophy on how you treat all of your campaigns when you are having a big spend ad account and the same philosophy goes also to cpu optimization working with average results and not caring if one of them is doing bad or not of course you can try individually in a campaign to see if you can improve it that's why we teach cpu optimization to see if you can improve it but that's it i guess that's all i had about cpu optimization and how we do it and this video is already long i will try to make i'm laughing because my video editor is behind the camera and i will try to post more case studies with cpu optimization when i see something interesting but i think that based on my previous videos that i post it with the crazy method and over there cpu optimization and this video over here you're getting the point of how we optimize i'm always telling that whoever wants to go deeper deeper deeper to the cpu optimization the only way after that is is the course which is having many more cases inside now don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course or my website guys and until you meet again be creative and be consistent
