Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, another podcast. So I feel like this week was a little bit calmer so there's not so much to discuss on this week but still it's okay you know we will have some weeks that are going to have a lot of topics, some weeks that they will have less.

Anyway first of all I would like to start a little bit with something that happened to me four days ago. So apparently guys in my country there are not a lot of people that they do the work that I do and most of them they have their regular jobs like I believe it's happening in several countries with some exceptions like Philippines or whatever where you can see a lot of freelancers for several jobs or India but India is super vast so you can still see people having regular jobs. So the situation is that I have met two people, two individuals that they were let's say 18 and 20 years old they were super young and they were after some point when you're doing this job you can understand in a cafeteria who is kind of doing a similar job as you do from several things that we're not going to analyze now but we start talking and I told them that this is what they do, they told me that they do affiliate marketing then they said that they do personal marketing and then they said that they are doing social media then they said something else they tell them guys do you do OnlyFans and they told me yes we do OnlyFans.

So basically they're just like you know the new trend is to be an agency to have three or four girls and be the one that you're doing their social media and everything which are things that they're totally against me and the reason that I'm saying this is not so that we can say how bad are these people that are doing this and stuff they can do whatever they want if they believe that it's correct according to them these women most probably they wouldn't make any money without them so I guess the situation is that you know we were talking about that and they were telling me that they make x amount of money every month and everything so why am I saying all that just to just to criticize a little bit their way of thinking so into my generation into my way of thinking when I started making money out of all of this I started I never changed my house to a very big mansion for example this guy after one year of working he's going into a villa with two thousand dollars rent and the pool okay imagine that I'm doing this for several years I'm already making money and I'm just investing my money to real estate to energy plants and everything and other things that they do I like traveling I do one big trip every year I'm not obsessed with cars of taking a ferrari or lamba I just have a small jeep stuff like that simple stuff and I could see from the other side somebody getting money and I'm not against that because when you start getting some money as a new person you you will feel dazzled a little bit and you will start spending in several things okay it makes sense but they started doing all of these expenses of taking Rolexes just in one year okay it took me five years to decide to buy my first Rolex or whatever so if you're young if you're watching this podcast the only thing that I want to say is this imagine that I didn't have the time that you have if you're starting now and you're on 20 you have plenty of time to do everything and you can make money and you can live the life that you want and you don't have to go into a villa or whatever you can just rent a very nice apartment inside the city which is going to be beautiful furnished and stuff we live in Greece after all or in your country I don't know how it is but you don't have to just go into a battle of chasing people that they are just trying to show their how rich they are because we're not rich the people that they are super rich they're super rich okay and when they have three or four or five cars okay they have several but if you have for example two or three millions uh into your bank account and you own a Lambo or a Ferrari I don't see the point of that to be honest with you this is my philosophy to have two or three million and own a house of a 500k I can I can see I can see it as a good thing but owning two or three cars if you just have two or three millions into your bank I just don't understand it and this is what I wanted to tell you that you okay whoever is making money fast you're going to just pass a phase like I did that you will want to do things that you were not able to do before fine go for this phase but in my opinion just relax a little bit try to enjoy it try to be humble with it and don't try to just take Rolexes and then put diamonds to it because also you are ruining the Rolexes the Rolexes are not for diamonds these are things that trappers or whoever is doing them and just try to enjoy the elegance of things and why you are doing this or that a nice restaurant a nice hotel and stuff you will have enough money to do it if you reach to that point and you don't have to go into a great extent and a very big race of you taking this and that and that and that so that you can feel that you are accepted okay you have nothing to prove to nobody if you made money doing something you have nothing to prove and now it's up to you to just enjoy it okay don't make your life miserable into a race of trying to get all of these kind of things anyway this is my message to young people that they are starting now because they see all of these people on social media which are toxic of flexing of doing this and that and that you don't need that you can you can have so much fun um i'm not saying that you're not going to go into an expensive restaurant and you should go to a Greek taverna for example for a small amount of money but i'm saying that it's not necessary for you to go to salt by for example and eat a rebuy of 500 dollars when you can go to a miscellin star restaurant a three mission star restaurant and eat with 200 dollars okay so i just believe that all of this lavish life of pretend to be affluent people or trappers or these coaches that they pretend that they are super rich and most of them are not all of this kind of stuff i think that it's making they have huge impact to the new generation that is thinking that they have to live like this or they are just that's just a disgrace or a failure so that's all i'm having the best time of my life with what i do for me the most important thing in my life is that i would like to work as much as i will be able to say okay whatever i want in my life i can just grab it with my hand because i can okay and this is the point that i reached that is the point that whatever i want with my life of course i don't want the spaceship okay but whatever i want with my life i can actually grab it or take it and this is what is good for me also another thing you have to understand why you're doing all of this so if you're an in-commerce store owner if you're somebody that you're doing uh yeah that you're selling a service why are you doing this are you doing this for the money then most probably this is wrong but if you're doing it because you are happy with what you're creating you like the fact that you took a company and you built it and you like the success people who are money driven are success driven first and then money driven okay so first you need to care about the success in the businesses that you have and then the money are going to come no matter what and then when you have money money come to money now that's all that i wanted to say about this i hope that it's going to help at least one of you let's go to the news so i had facebook talk with facebook representatives after what happened on the 23rd of april and they told me some things that i want to share with you first of all the speculation that i had it's not a speculation for me it's a certain thing but let's say that speculation about pausing a campaign as they proposed by the way they said on their end that the automated rules that some companies hardly worked i know from several people and accounts that the automated rules didn't work uh but they say that they were proposing for that day to post the ads as they say just one reminder is that after you post the ads the ads are going to go out of the learning phase that means that the next day that everybody opened their ads they started with some old data but they were still on the learning phase that they didn't pass they didn't go on and they were past the learning phase so the situation is that whoever posed their ads in my opinion they did a serious mistake for two reasons first of all you cannot ask for a refund because you paused your ads so basically the all the damage was done by that point and most of these people are not going to get a refund i believe maybe they will because it was a global thing secondly um the the people who started the next day their ads they started their ads with uh uh ads being outside uh of the being on the learning phase while the others that they didn't post they had the ads already outside of the learning phase and this is why they had better results overall another thing uh facebook says that uh all of this um all of the situation with cpms is going to stabilize and it's going to take seven to 14 uh days which is one to two weeks and most probably by the end of this week we will see if the cpms are going to stabilize uh another thing is that basically we have two completely different ideas over here and we can say that both of the things are correct so some people said okay limit the damage and pause your ads and some people said okay leave them so that the next day you're not going to um you're not going to start your ads again from the learning phase now both situations are correct somebody can say and i have analyzed this extensively in the video that i made uh if you have a small amount of money it doesn't matter if you do one or the other so we're talking here about bigger budgets that in this specific situation i can tell you that basically what happened is that when they pause their ads uh they started then the next day with a disadvantage the other people didn't start with additional others on the other hand they didn't lose the money that the others lost the other day and they um and maybe this has helped them a lot my way of thinking was that if people pause their ads and then they just start other ads or they start those they're going to have a disadvantage because everybody after this they are going to start launching new ads and they're going to compete with each other uh in a situation where the the campaigns that they have been outside of the learning phase they are going to have better results from the ones that they are still on the learning phase that was my way of thinking and from several discussions with facebook reps they also agree with that but still both situations are correct okay either turn them on either turn them off or keeping them as they are now let's discuss a little bit about the learning phase since um since i had this discussion with them uh so pausing a campaign is going to get you out of the learning phase but you're going to still keep the data of the last seven days uh over there uh another thing that a lot of times people confuse is the events that we need a lot of times there are people that they are discussing about 50 events it's not necessary to have 50 events sometimes when you go and you see for example learning or learning limited it means that it's never going to get out of the learning phase if you're on learning it means that it's still on the learning phase if you are on active it means that it went out of the learning phase a lot of times i see uh adsets go out of the learning phase without the 50 events so 50 events are not necessary maybe sometimes it's going to be less um the learning phase is bound to the assets not on the campaign so when you're having learning phase you need to see each one of your assets individually and i explained what it means um limited learning and everything okay now you know that in this channel we have analyzed a lot of times the learning and we said that in my opinion it doesn't matter so much because i have seen ads in limited learning ads in learning and that's in active which means that they pass the learning phase and they don't have very big differences between each other of course facebook pushes a lot the concept of consolidation so that you can take them out of the learning phase but this really depends also on the results that you are getting in terms of ROAS now we have some news about Advantage Plus which they're going to start on May 4th Advantage Plus is super successful for Meta and they want to do some changes one of the changes that they're proposing of course is to have all of the campaigns having website and shop as an option so that you can get data within Meta and on your on your site i have seen that from the promo that they were running and the free credit that they were giving i made a video about it and that the results that we were having with this it was they were better than the others and it makes sense because it was gathering also data from Meta but still i think it's successful and if you have a shop it really wants to try to try this option you can watch my video to understand what i'm talking about it's the video which is called the 10k funding opportunity now let's talk about two more features that are coming on the Advantage Plus and they are coming on May 4th at the start it's going to be rolled only on 10% of the ad accounts and eventually by the end of the year on December it's going to be rolled in 100% of the accounts the first feature is that you will be able to exclude specific ages now don't get me wrong you're not going to pick the range of the ages it's going to always work with exclusions so you're going to be put a broad age and then you're going to exclude the ages of 40 to 65 very important there are several companies that they had to advertise to older ages and it didn't make any sense because they were just relying on their pixel so if you're a new company and you're starting and you know for example that you're selling a Fortnite game accessory nobody on 65 plus years old is going to buy maybe a grandfather who understands that his grandchildren want something from Fortnite but still i think it's a long reach so now you will be able to exclude specific ages in order to work with the ages that you actually want and i think that this is a very good feature another thing that you can do is that you can exclude areas so a lot of times we were thinking about advantage plus in local area for businesses but you couldn't use it because you didn't have the option of excluding areas now if you are able to exclude areas and run just in a specific area that means that you can run also for local businesses that means that you can exclude areas maybe if you're a business that you have specifications and you're not working for example you're not shipping for example in Texas for a reason of which is logistic reason boom you just exclude Texas and so on and so on so these are the two features you will be able to exclude specific ages and specific areas or even zip codes postcode zip codes how we call them and this is super super super important so that's all with the news let's go with one more thing that i want to discuss and then we will go to your discussion into your questions as i said most probably this podcast is going to be small today so we have new ai developments and you know we hear always new things about ai about this thing doing this this thing doing that is that i'm going to prepare a video most probably today we're going to do a video shooting about the dalet 2 background i made a video that i was talking about this test this funding from meta that they put an ai to put different backgrounds to images i'm tempted to tell you the results but you will have to wait the video i guess i said the results in another video i don't know if you are if you are a very good viewer of this channel most probably you know the results but you will have to wait the video which one actually won the ai background or the white background let's see on the video so i had a mail over here a mail message i don't remember i hope you had a great weekend i'm not sure if you have covered this with where i'm going to blur the name beforehand have you ever heard of ad proposals if not i'd like to give you heads up on our recently launched ai solution ad proposal which would be much help for you to improve your performance on an automated basis so all the things that i don't like automated and all of that you know i don't like when people try to talk about something super technical like facebook ads and they propose that you have to do nothing for example you just put automated rules and you just watch it add proposal tool identifies which of your campaigns need some amendments to increase performance the system automatically detects the campaign's ad sets that can be amended optimized towards a better result with quick actions and without changing the budget so you're resetting them by doing changes uh you can see the proposals blah blah and stuff so the reason that i'm showing you this is that because from now on most probably and if we think of it guys the chat gpt came in the previous year on september and now we have seen crazy things with ai ai is moving so fast and we're going to see most probably programs coming ai programs coming for facebook ads i'm sure that is going to happen what i'm sure also is that a lot of people are going to lose their jobs what i'm sure about also is that i'm not going to lose my job i'm going to be the person that's going to regulate the ai i'm not against ai i believe that we will need ai i i'm going to check it and see if it's having better results or not but i'm not the kind of person that thinks that we can just combat a machine and the way that it thinks is and the calculations that it does maybe we can be more creatives but eventually with this way that the ai is working is going to catch up to this creativity so in my opinion the ai is here the ai is going to continue and maybe it's going to be the end of human race but who knows maybe this is the reason that we cannot find other intelligent form of lives because everybody's being growing by ai eventually so the situation is this i believe that ai is going to come to facebook ads i believe that before that there are going to be several bad programs that people are going to trust and they're going to believe because it's ai and they have seen good things with mid journey or with chat gpt or whatever but still i believe that eventually that eventually we will have a good ai or several good ai's for facebook ads um the problem here is that i believe that they will always need a human touch but it's going to be the same thing that happened with uh the factories so what did we have back in the days in the factory we had a guy that was just doing this okay he was assembling doing this okay next one next one and they were just doing a repeated action these were called the this was the labor that they didn't have any specific training they were just doing a simple job okay this and that this thing has been replaced with machines so then there was a machine that was doing this job more efficiently without having someone there so a lot of people got sucked and they lost their jobs because they didn't have any important rule let's say it was just something that through all of the ages human race is doing they're using human labor as a very valuable asset asset in order to do things like the pyramids so the situation is that when you're having this kind of big technology development some people are losing their jobs like what happened in the industrial revolution and a lot of people lost their jobs because of the machines but the people that they didn't lose their jobs they were people that they were actually having some better skills they were the people that they were just going and they're winding the machines or they're keeping them running they were the people that they were organizing how the machines are going to be laid on the factory how to create a product line they were the people that they were deciding other things the people who lost their jobs were the people that they didn't do anything important just one action that it was going to be done easily by a machine and don't get me wrong i think that these people are also necessary okay but i'm just saying that in some in in a capitalist world everybody who is not doing a job that makes sense and get paid for that they're going to be replaced eventually and with freelancers we have a lot of people that they just do a job that another one million people can do and this is what i think is the big difference over here there are experts like me and others several others that um or thousands whatever that they're doing this and they have deep knowledge and there are people that they just do facebook ads without any knowledge just doing them so the people that they are not in the process of actually having this kind of knowledge they're going to be lost and people like me or others they're going to be the ones that are going to be setting the ai regulating it seeing if it's working properly if it needs any specific you know settings maybe talking with a client on how it's going to work better the same way that somebody goes and distals a machine into a factory in order to work in a good way that's my opinion so my suggestion is that if you are watching this most probably you like to learn facebook ads in a deeper level and you don't just want to be the person that is just doing facebook ads if you if you go and if you train yourself you don't have a lot of time okay so if you go and if you train yourself maybe you're going to be the one that you're not going to lose your job but if you're just doing facebook ads just to do them and it's another side hassle for you you're going to lose your job because eventually there's going to be a machine that is going to do it and that means that there's going to so it's completely different of having people doing facebook ads in several accounts because of the workload and completely different of having an ai doing all the workload which can do it with several computers and then you have much less people just going and setting it up okay i hope it makes sense now let's go to the questions that we have here we have vitas why we should use two different facebook ad campaigns for retargeting and prospecting what will be wrong if i place the targeting audience and called audience in the same campaign using asset budget optimization for each asset so he's suggesting of using abo and having a retargeting campaign and having a call traffic campaign there is nothing wrong with that because you are having different budgets my problem is when you do it in a cbo campaign and because i'm obsessed with that initially when he asked me this question i replied with a very big long answer why you should not do it if it's a cbo um so the reason of not doing it if it's a cbo it's because guys um first of all a cbo means competition with the ads you don't want to make your cold traffic ads compete with your warm traffic ads it doesn't make any sense also it's always going to be a smaller audience the cold traffic ad it's having a bigger audience and there's the other audience is much smaller your targeting audience so there's no point of putting them in a cbo because facebook is going to spend most of the money on the bigger audience last thing they have completely different kpis let me explain you might go and you might see uh retargeting campaigns uh having a click-through rate of um two percent and cost per unique click on five dollars and have very good draws and then you go to cold traffic ads and you see one dollar cost per click and have the same results because the audience of the retargeting gets smaller uh but it's warm you know it's an audience that knows you and buys from you and everything it's uh it's smaller so the cost per click is uh more expensive but it's converting in a better way so they have different metrics and you should not put them together these are my reasons that you should not put them here and of course in my opinion there are two different funnels okay we just separate the funnels because there's no point of putting two adsets to fight with each other for who is going to take the biggest budget when we're talking about different number of people and different quality of leads inside them then we have costatinos thank you for your insight it's not necessary to analyze for i get the point unless you believe that this topic is worth more uh about it uh by the way one meta arts guru tried to sell an idea that if you put if you will put retargeting audience in the same cbo campaign with cold audiences the warm audience will help to train your pixel to find potential buyers easier in the cold audiences what's your opinion on this so i don't think that you are putting it in the right perspective so let me tell you i don't think that he said it like this maybe he said that inside the ad sets of a cbo campaign you can include also warm audiences let me tell you that facebook is already doing that we can see it um being done already with uh advantage plus that it's stealing a lot of sales from uh warm audiences this is why a lot of people they just said that this is not acceptable and then meta has a new setting that you can exclude people from your warm audience as a percentage um for example you can choose to exclude 100 of your warm audience from your advantage plus okay or 90 or 80 so different one um so what i like to use in this case is just so you know it's 70 percent 60 70 sometimes 50 depending on the results um this idea is not bad because i also agree with that and the thing is this you um when when facebook is getting one sale from your warm audience even if it's stealing it from google ads let's say or email marketing if this sale is going to be used uh in order for facebook to find more sales out of it then it makes total sense to me so for instance you're having one campaign uh which is stealing one sale from a warm audience it makes total sense because facebook is going to target initially all of these people that it thinks that it's going to convert so it's targeting people also from your warm audience because there are pixel data and facebook knows that so if they convert then and this helps you get another sale from a person that didn't know about your brand for me this is a win-win and it's fine i don't believe in the idea of some people having that i want only new sales coming from my facebook ads no because this is not how e-commerce is working you cannot have everything that you want in your life and i want to eat uh 5 000 calories per day and not getting any weight is it possible no because this is not how the metabolism is working so the same thing is happening with e-commerce e-commerce is all about um repeated sales and after some point what you're getting as a new customers is the customers that they don't know about your brand but also customers that they are new for example let's say that you have a brand for five years when you started um somebody was 14 years old okay and then after five years he's becoming 90 years old so he's now in the productive area and into the people that they can convert so this is the ratio of new people coming inside the market fueling for newcomers but if you're spending a lot of money maybe this is the most crucial metric to hit and i know it's a little bit advanced of a topic to discuss it but a lot of times people neglect that and they say i want to scale to 250k 500k 800k 1 million per month well you need to see also the ratio of new people coming inside these funnels and find the number that makes sense and if you cannot scale past on that go with other products or with other ways of selling it from different angles convincing people from different angles so in my opinion um yes it's correct it can help your results if you're having some sales being stolen or if you put your own warm audiences into your cold traffic ads because eventually it's going to optimize for them i don't like to do it like this because uh i want facebook to steal it on its own i don't want to give it my warm audience inside maybe it's going to continue using it a lot um but still we know that facebook is doing it anyway and if this sale is going to be there to help you get a cold traffic sale i'm totally fine with that and this is what is happening um don't forget that in this channel we also propose let's say for example that you have a period that you're having very bad results and it's working flawlessly i think i have a video also about that but with so many videos that i created i don't remember i don't remember the title i remember that i created it actually so basically the video was that i was having a bad period with uh with a brand um for no reason and i told them that look let's do a promo so they did a promo and the results were boosted for three four days but not only that after the promo ended the results continue working for uh for that period also very well what does this mean that they were boosted the same thing that we're doing for black friday we do our ads before and we have also evergreen campaigns not only black friday campaigns because during the period black friday they are going to get so much data that is going to help us keep them for a very long time after that because they're going to be fueled by data and on the black friday period so a lot of times when we are having a promotion i really like to have also an evergreen campaign at that point because it's getting boosted by the results or that the site is going to have anyway so in this situation what did we do we just flooded our ads with legit sales that they came through from a promotion they didn't gain from the facebook ads but we were fine with that because all of these sales they have helped us after the end of the promo to continue getting sales because they fueled um with a lot of data our pixel our api and our ads i hope it makes sense i think we over analyzed it uh now we go to jm um i stopped using advanced plus for now okay just wondering if you know the best objective to use to bring back organic reach to food page for a restaurant chain the number of followers tanked at 200k since this year and organic reach has dropped uh to an all-time low from average 1 million views to 10k use now always use engagement plus views objective for a few years but recently its effectiveness is awful average spent daily 500 so you are spending 500 daily on user engagement and views the number of new followers seem to uh correlate to the organic reach of your next post uh the more new followers again the better there is for my uh next new post of course you will get better results so the more subscribers i get the best the better views i'm going to get on my next video makes total sense but i just put this comment here because i don't think that you're spending your mind your your money wisely with engagement and views and stuff um i think you should put a budget for that if you want but you need to find another event that is going to be more to the point something that's going to bring you more quality people like booking like acquiring a coupon for the restaurant like calling to the restaurant something like that a more direct event that is going to help you get more quality people from people from people that are interested because now you're just flooding your system with all of these no point engagement and views for no reason and i think you're spending too much for that not uh you're not a blog you're a restaurant at the end of the day you want customers to come anyway um maybe i'm missing some key elements over here of what you're doing exactly uh let's go to eva ewa uh i don't know if it's eva or ewa okay hi costadinos first of all thank you for your videos thank you for watching them i have watched a lot of them in the last few weeks i have a niche digital product with 25 sales so far and broad targeting of advantage plus uh campaigns are working best for me perfect i tried to tail targeting but roas was 0.2 anyway i have questions my uk campaign is working great but australia campaign is a disaster is that because i'm using the same pixel and that account with the time zone gmt plus 2 should i make a separate pixel and data account for australia and usa thank you it really depends on your spend so this week i uploaded a video about uh okay study in the united states and the same company not the same it's another company for united kingdom i can tell you that they have different uh no no it's the same company on united kingdom and i can tell you that they are having um we are having separate ad accounts because i believe that the pixels and the behaviors are different uh but also i believe that in big spends you need to separate it for logistic reasons and for several other reasons from domain names to making it more clear to the api training and the different demographics to having different targets for different countries based on the expenses and everything so we separate it but we were not operating like this from the beginning so i can see here that you have 25 sales so far so it's too early for you to think about separations also keep into your mind okay you have a digital product this is goes to people that they have physical products for physical products it's not so easy to open new markets it needs a lot of money a lot of times people take funding in order to open new markets and stuff because it's going to need stock logistics to specific areas and stuff so it's taking time it's not so easy easy uh on the other hand over here uh we are having a digital product uh with 25 sales i wouldn't just say that um australia needs a different pixel or whatever what i would say though is this don't be so obsessed at the start of uh having different multiple markets maybe this is something that is going to come later focus in the market that it's making you money keep producing results scale there and when you see that you cannot scale more then try to expand to other markets there is no point for you now to be all over the place you you're a startup you have a new product just try to have sales there and then move to other countries when you are ready and when you're going to have established one channel successfully and then if you see that you're spending a lot of money yes go to different ad accounts and do uh different for example if you reach the point that you're spending 100k per month on united states and you want to try australia do it with another account now if you want to just test it test it like this don't go into great extent of doing australia or whatever but since you have a specific amount of money now you're a startup or whatever just focus on united states now scale it as much as you can profitably and then worry about expanding let's go i believe this is the last question we have johnny here thank you for a great video as always i have one question on this topic i have been selling in sweden for a year with thousands of sales and only going broad only going broad targeting i'm happy for you the way that you say it it's super exciting with thousands sales and stuff i'm happy for you how should we think when approaching a new market like for example not way should we treat a new market as a new pixel or we can go broad instantly it really depends on the market so norway it's very similar to sweden so you can even go with the same pixel and have zero issues also another thing it's completely different of talking for united states and talking about sweden for instance because if we are talking about sweden um i believe the potential reach should be i cannot think it off the top of my head right now but maybe it's between uh five and ten million let's say uh the potential reach so doing broad targeting it's like one big one small to medium interest in united states so it makes total sense to go immediately to broad targeting because it's a small audience if you target in greece you're targeting to seven million people 6.5 something like that and then you can go with broad targeting immediately so it really depends if you expand to denmark yes go broad targeting if you expand to germany maybe you should start with uh interest look-alikes then go to broad targeting if you expand to united states for sure you should go to uh interest and stuff this doesn't mean that you're not going to test broad targeting maybe you're lucky and your product is working and whatever but uh just also think the numbers why do we go broad targeting in sweden because it makes sense it's like a it's like an interest on its own as a country uh also about the pixel the pixel uh so if you go to norway or denmark they are similar counters with similar way of thinking it's europe whatever if you go to united states uh an example which i like to use is a vegan mom a vegan mom in sweden or norway it's not it doesn't maybe it doesn't have the same demographics as a vegan mom in united states so maybe you should go with a new pixel train it it's also a bigger market maybe uh the data that you have from sweden are not going to be the ones that are going to give you sales in united states uh having a trained pixel or api in sweden so that's my input about that um and um yeah you can go broad instantly or you you should try broad decently wherever you go doesn't matter but in some countries it's a necessity because they are already a small potential reach uh if it doesn't work still go back to interest and everything okay and just analyze about different pixels and stuff if the demographics make uh sense and of course test it first because if you have a pixel and it's working also in united states uh use it but if it doesn't work start thinking of using a new pixel for that reason let's go to the freelancer diaries for today uh i have chosen this uh i was thinking of using this for a long period of time um so i'm just going to focus just in one in one section of the job and it says uh and social duties and responsibilities the many the main areas of focus for this position are 35 percent digital marketing media buying 35 social media advertising media buying 25 strategy analytics administration and delivery five percent email marketing automations and where applicable so uh the fun part with this uh is that um and what is this person going to do for example he's going to go to his job he's going to separate his day into different hours and minutes and stuff and he's going to work five percent on email marketing 25 on strategy and analytics 35 and on social media and stuff so i think that you know it's it really reminds me of something uh let me tell you a story and then i will close the podcast um before i leave my my job at some point for you that you have read the book you know the story and how all of this started by my boss insulting me and stuff and that motivated me to start something on my own and i thank thank him a lot for that um so the day that i i had already started making enough money with my side hustle at that point uh let's say that i was making 10 times more so i didn't i was working still normally i i was i was a good employee i didn't want to cause any issues and stuff okay i was doing some things like if you put me to do some things on the excel maybe i will hire someone from upwork and then on this hour that i was doing this thing i was doing something else for my job and so on but one day he came to me and he said we have to we have 3 000 names to put in this excel um blah blah and i told him okay i will do it and he tells me can you do one just so that i can see i just do one and he says okay it took you um five seconds so let me see we have the 3 000 names multiplied by five seconds you need 15 000 seconds divide that by 60. uh okay so you need x amount of time in order to do it so uh so i was i was just watching him and said this is mother is crazy because you cannot just go and say okay you do one thing uh in five seconds that multiply that with that and you can do it in this hour um first of all we don't live in the middle ages secondly i didn't came uh from from africa in a ship in the and being a slave uh third thing um i'm going to maybe need five minutes uh to relax my brain and continue doing the job and several other things so i told him um can you please close the door he closed the door and i told him look i can i cannot keep doing it anymore you're you're a f***ing idiot and you don't understand how it is you're very good at you're very bad at um managing personnel and stuff and you don't know what the f*** you're doing so i will have to stop because i think that we are going into a toxic relationship uh and maybe this is a reason that i'm showing goals of freelancer diaries because i have been through so much in my life to my normal jobs that i cannot just see things like that of separating your um your responsibilities to percentages this is total and it means that uh this person has never had a personal working with him and he doesn't understand how it is uh that's all i had for you uh i hope that this makes sense i feel like the podcast today it was like 30 other topics and 70 about facebook ads but it's uh it's good maybe we can talk about other things i hope we can talk about other things and we don't have crisis all the time like the crisis that we had on uh sunday uh not this sunday the previous sunday that's all i had for you i will see you next week uh have a nice uh weekend and uh if you need anything let me know uh in the comments not if you need anything if you want to ask anything maybe you need 500 dollars for example to borrow you 500 is not going to happen so if you need to ask any question let me know guys and i will see you in the next one bye this was the facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is is you
