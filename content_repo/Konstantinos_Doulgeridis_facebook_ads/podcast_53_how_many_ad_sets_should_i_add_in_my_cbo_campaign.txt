Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, another podcast. So just so you know I'm in the middle of creating several videos about 2024.

It's going to have advanced plus my philosophy, optimization and all of that but we will keep doing the podcasts where we have more information. So I would like to start first of all telling you that thank you very much for all the wishes that you gave me for the new house which is going to have also a new studio by the way I don't know if you mention it and you will see different things and stuff and for the baby coming and everything thank you very much. I really like my community or the community that we have here.

It's not toxic at all, it's all about Facebook Ads, you know. I love it. Today we're going to discuss a little bit about I'm going to create a video also about it, how many adsets you should put in a CBO campaign because it's the most frequent question asked and I have seen one story with something that I completely disagree.

So we'll talk about that and before we go to that I had a discussion with my friend Jonathan. Jonathan really... So the idea that I had about the podcast was that I wanted to do one podcast which was going to be named Two Friends Talk About Facebook Ads because the discussions that I do with Jonathan I believe that if they go in public they will help a lot of people.

So some of you might think that Jonathan is my imaginary friend but no I'm not crazy. He exists and I hope that in the new studio maybe I'm going to convince him because I think that I can exchange it with the fact that he wants to take me to the gym. So if I go to the gym and he comes to the podcast maybe we can do an exchange but we will see.

Jonathan tries to fix my life. He tells me you have done everything in your life, this is the last thing that you need to do, you need to check a little bit your health. So I'm guessing that maybe I'm going to do it earlier so they can convince him to come later but he doesn't know about this master plan.

Also because he's very busy he doesn't watch all of this podcast so I can say whatever I want. I hope that he's not going to see it. Anyway, so he called me...

No, he sent me a text and he told me that look dude Facebook ads are so stupid. They have this... They have the text for...

They have different texts while I put different primary texts for example and I immediately realized it's something that I have seen several times. So when you create campaigns and you do on the ad level a single ad, except from the primary text and the headline that you have there, you can go and you can edit the different creative that you can put in the different placements. So there are three edits there.

One for the feeds, one for the stories and reels and one for the other wide placements. So you can go there and you can change the creative but over there you can see that on the left side it has also primary text, headline, destination and tags. I have created one video recently because I was getting some messages from some clients that the ads were sending people to the shop while we were not using website and shop into the ads at level.

And the truth is that when I checked, I have seen that Facebook was auto-tagging products. So despite the fact that I wasn't using website and shop, it was auto-tagging products inside there when you edit inside these placements. If you go now and you open one campaign and you go into the ad level, you will see that when you use a single creative for example, you can edit the different placements there so that you can use different creatives.

Over there it's also the tag product and because on Shopify you're just going, you're listing your products and you're connecting them with Shopify, Facebook can find them and actually auto-tags them so that it can send people to the shops. The reason that it's doing that is because they want to have more people going to the shops actually so that they can get more data first of all because they want the shops to work. Because the more people go to shops, the more the algorithm is at the standing.

And the other thing is that they also want to get the commission from the sale. So all of this is the reason this happening and I couldn't find it. Then I found out that it was auto-tagging and I found out that it was finding these products through the connection that the products have with Shopify that is connected also with your shop.

I hope it makes sense. So right now on the ad level, we have to be extremely careful of what we do because there are several things that Facebook does. So the auto-tags.

Secondly, you can go and you can see that it does some AI optimization and stuff. It can add music, it can take your headline and put it as main copy. It does this kind of thing so you can go there and check them and actually turn off from the toggle button on the top of these optimizations all of these things.

And the last thing is this. The primary text and the headline that you have on your ad level is not the one that Facebook is going to use if you have different primary text and headline inside the edit of each placements as we said. So when we create ads we go and we say okay we want 1080x1080 which is 1x1 or 4x5 for the feed placements and 9x16 for our stories and reels.

So we go and we edit over there the stories when we have automatic placements and we go and we change the creative but over there there is also as I said destination description and headline description headline and primary text. So if you go and you create for example one ad and you have copy one and copy two okay on your normal ad in the ad area and then you duplicate this one and you don't press the X button so that you can remove the creative immediately but you just go and you change the creative by the edit button by just replacing it then it's going to keep the copies from the previous ad. I hope that it makes sense.

Let me explain it a little bit more. So I'm on the ad level and I'm creating one ad over here which is going to have I'm uploading a picture okay 1080x1080 and then I'm putting copy one and copy two headline one headline two okay. Then I'm going to my stories and reels I edit and I change this one one to 9 by 16 okay.

So I have my different things and I have my copies and everything is okay. So then I just don't want to create a campaign all over again so I duplicate the campaign and I go and I say okay I'm going to use exactly the same structure but I want to do another copy and another product and another image. So I create another one and this time I'm using creative two.

This is creative one then I'm writing like you can see them but anyway it helps me think. So I'm using creative two and then I'm going instead of pressing the X button on the creative level on the ad level I'm pressing the X button and I'm uploading again all over again. I'm just keeping it as it is and I'm just editing the feed placement.

I'm changing the creative. I'm editing the stories placement. I'm editing the creative and I'm going below that and I'm changing the primary text and the headline.

Wrong! What is going to happen is that it kept on the edit level of the feed and of the stories all of the copies and the headlines of creative one. So when you are doing ads either you are going to remove the creative so that you can upload it all over again and it's going to take the primary and the headline that you have put it on the ad level below and not inside the edit level or you are going to go and check always within, this is something that you have to do anyway, within each of the placements you have to go every time and check the primary text and the headline and the destination because maybe you duplicate it from another and kept those.

A lot of times people see their ads and they say but I have on the primary text on the headline this and something else appears. It's because it has something else written within the different placements for the feeds and the stories and stuff where you can actually edit them. I hope that it's going to hear some of you that you understand what I'm talking about.

It's really valuable information because imagine that Jonathan is doing ads every day and this is something that he was struggling with. This is what I'm talking about when I'm saying super advanced information. It's not anything crazy but it's something that needs a lot of research to find it that it's actually causing this issue because a lot of times I'm using ads that they have a primary headline and then eventually when you go to the ad you see that they have a different headline and you just think that it's a glitch.

It's not a glitch. It's the things that it has inside the different placements on the ad level. Now I was thinking with Jonathan before I close this subject that okay and is it right or wrong?

If you think of it the same way that you want Facebook to actually respect the fact that you want to have a different creative on your stories, the same way when you put inside a primary text and the headline it has to respect that instead of the primary text and the headline that you put in the general area of the ad. So it makes sense that it has to override and everything else. What I want you to keep is that when you do ads you need to check also inside edit your ads inside the placements to see if you have different copies and creatives and if you're okay with them, even destination, even the URL so that you can make sure that this is correct.

I always do it even if I create a campaign from scratch I always do it in order to check if everything is okay there because these are the ones that it's going to actually use. Now that being said let's go to let's go to the subject for today which is how many ads you should have inside a CBO campaign. One of the most famous questions, the reason that I'm creating that I'm mentioning it is because I have seen one story from one person and that's actually a little bit unfair but guys I'm going to start some English lessons because I feel like the reason that the channel is not having more and more and more exposure is because of my stupid English and I'm going to try to improve them okay 100% because I cannot see people talking perfect English and saying so many nonsense.

So basically he was saying that you should not worry about that and you should do only one so that Facebook can focus in one. Zero understanding on hot pockets, zero understanding on CBO optimization. Why then CBO optimization was created if you have to do one ad?

It doesn't make any sense why we didn't stick to the ABO then? What's the point of having CBO and having one ad? Guys seriously I don't know if people are thinking the things that are saying they talk in such good English and in such a professional way that you think that they're professionals but for someone like me who has more experience it looks like they don't know what they're talking about.

What's the point? What's your job if you do one CBO campaign with one ad set inside? What's your job?

Are you optimizing at all? Are you doing anything differently from someone who can do it? What's the difference that you bring and what's the value that you bring to the table?

In this channel we teach CBO optimization, we teach hot pockets, we teach all of that so that we can differentiate and we can do something better. okay the game is rigged with Facebook ads and I can understand that the more the time passes by we will have less options for us to do things within the ads manager but still we can still influence things. At Vanos Plus for example we found a way of optimizing it on the ad level seeing the dominant ads and stuff.

Why don't you go deeper on technical? Also another thing which I'm very happy is that guys I'm seeing you all of you the comments that you were putting before on you were posting before on my group and everywhere are completely different from the comments that you're posting now. I can see people with really serious questions in a deeper level.

I can see in the previous podcast for example we have some very good questions that they were super nice and okay they were wrong in a sense of what they were thinking but at least they were having a philosophy behind them and trying to explain things. So I'm pretty happy with the level of the community right now and how we move on. Also I'm seeing on Reddit there are some people that they write things and stuff you know.

Some of my students they're also there and they're posting their opinion about ads and stuff. I'm doing some mentoring also with people. One of them is Michael and Michael posted something.

He talked about Hot Pockets and stuff. When you see Hot Pockets the bell is ringing. So somebody wrote below his name was LM103 something.

I'm not going to say all the other names. He posted Dulyedis Konstantinos and basically saying that the things that you're saying is coming from Konstantinos. It's totally fine you know.

Michael has been trained by me. That's the good thing. If you really believe that you're good at something you don't care if others, if you train others and they're going to say the same things and stuff because by the way Michael totally deserves it okay.

He's a very good guy. He's also listening to the podcast so I have to say good words about him. It's not like Jonathan for example that I can say whatever I want because he doesn't watch it.

Because Jonathan the first thing that he asked is have you made a video about the things that you're telling me right now on the phone and I don't know and I told him yeah I have two videos about this but they are very small and he said okay obviously I'm not watching your videos. I say okay I know that you don't but Michael Michael is watching my videos. He's the one that he told me that I have to get better in English so I will try.

I'm looking for teachers. So yeah it's okay guys if you see someone saying things that I'm saying about... I'm also saying for Facebook ads it's one more guy that we persuaded that this is what is the right and not stupid things like doing CBO campaigns and call traffic with one ad set.

So how many adsets we should put? Guys this question cannot be answered if we don't have all the data. What is the data?

First of all we need to know did you run any ads? Do you know your numbers? Because knowing your numbers is what is going to define how many adsets we're going to use.

For example let's say that we have a CBO campaign with $100 and let's say that you have never done any ads okay. So what are we going to do here is we're going to think okay how much am I thinking that I should spend in order to get a sale? So if my product sells for 25.30 from my experience I should expect the sales between 25.30 so with the 100 as a new pixel I'm saying okay.

So with the 100 I'm going to do for five adsets and then based on what sales I'm getting I'm going to adjust it. For example if I'm getting a sale for $10 cost per purchase with the 100 then I'm going to go with five so that I can get two sales per ad set and not with 10 because it's a little bit too much. If I'm getting 60 cost per purchase in my initial ads and my pixel is untrained and all of that I will go to three adsets trying to limit it a little bit because two adsets is too small but three assets is normal.

If I'm having an average cost per purchase of 25 and I'm having a budget of 200 let's say what I can do is that I can say okay I can go with eight ad sets or I can go with four ad sets which means that with four adsets I'm trying to get two sales per ad set and basically what I can do is I can put another one there so instead of four go with five so basically slow down the process. Now this is how you pick how many adsets you are going to put in your CPO campaign based your average cost per purchase and base the budget that you're also going to have because the budget is going to dictate and you can do the math and you can put either one less or one more. Of course don't go more than 10 okay because it's going to make the CPO optimization much more difficult and maybe you're not experienced but if you are running for example $500 just to give you an example and your average cost of your purchase is 25 you're not going to go with 20 adsets you can if you want you can but most probably it's going to start spending on some of those more and stuff and you will have to know better CPO optimization instead of a basic three or four or five asset CPO.

Instead of that you can do that divided so you need 20 adsets okay but you can do for example with 500 10 adsets and try to get double the amount of sales inside that. Now if you want to be a little bit more aggressive with your 10 adsets you can put 12 no you can put 8 adsets in order for you to be a little bit more aggressive or you can put 12 for example in order for you to go and do a slower optimization. What does this mean?

Let's say that the next day that you have done your CPO optimization you go and you see in your ad sets that you are having five ad sets and all of them they have spent $30 for example okay. That means that you have if your average cost per purchase is 25 that you are getting that means on the ad account in average and in average to be honest with you in the call traffic not in the don't put in inside the average numbers the retargeting the retargeting is a different discussion. What kind of cost per purchase you are getting in your call traffic I mean.

So when you do that you go and you see that okay my average cost per purchase is 25 I'm spending 30 on each so it's going super fast so my next campaign that I'm going to do I'm not going to do it with four I'm going to do it with six ad sets in order for me to slow down the process because what we want to see in a CBO campaign is one campaign for example getting 40 50 60 spent and having one or two sales ideally if it doesn't we have to close it but this falls under the category of CPO optimization which we discussed or we will discuss another time here we discuss about the level the number of ad sets so you might go and you will see 50 60 and some others spending only 10 some others spending only 20 some will get lucky with a small with a sale which is coming in small cost per purchase like 10 or 20 and so on but if you go and all of them have spent something which is above or close to the break even then it's a problematic situation because if all of them don't have a sale then this campaign was probably it's not optimizable or you have to pick the one or two that they have a sale and immediately drop the budget so you're not you're not taking the optimization to a two three four days process you're just you're just doing it in one or two day on the other hand we might have the other thing which is that I go and I see that my campaigns for example I have so many assets that my campaigns are spending five six seven ten dollars per day while my average cost per purchase is 25. That means that you have to decrease the number of assets so that you can give fair chances in a daily level the budgets are daily as we said here and they reset in a daily level that means that when you are going and you're putting several assets you are asking too much from Facebook in a daily level it doesn't matter if you spend one thousand in one year in one month but it matters how much you are spending per day is it enough or not so in the cbo optimization if you put and you if you go the next days and you see that it's going very slow you know and you're having some assets spending one or two dollars or three dollars one of them ten dollars another so you have to lower the amount of assets so that it can go more aggressively this is what I mean going more aggressively or less and by doing this process and adding one asset removing one asset and all of that eventually you're going to have the recipe for your ad account there is no such thing as I'm going immediately and okay one thing that I'm that I'm doing a lot of times is 100 with three four ads it's in order to test initially in another account what is working but even in another account that I'm going later and there are ads that they have been working there I'm checking the past history and I'm seeing the average cost per purchase and then I'm seeing what am I going to do now this completely changes with higher ticket items or with big average order value orders and all of that so you have to be a little bit more flexible in these other accounts and you have to give it more space in the optimization that you will do later but what I'm trying to say here is that by all of the things that I told you earlier and the observation that you are going to do on your own in the ad account eventually you're going to find what is the correct combination how much how many assets for that budget how many assets for that budget and not only that based on my experience teaching people and mentoring people I have seen that people have different styles which is very interesting because I thought that for example I'm very aggressive I'm super aggressive with my ads I might go and close things and I don't care if the next day I guess this is coming with experience because I see also people as the time passes by they become more experienced they are more aggressive also because it's also fascinating guys if you do it in a very slow pace it's boring for me and for everyone else who is doing optimization in a daily level also in bigger budgets like spending 1000 2000 3000 per cbo or per advanced plus you have to be more aggressive because you can create more problems when you spend more money so that being said I think that another thing that that we need to discuss here is that everyone has his own style maybe you are the kind of person that you are more aggressive and you want to see your assets spending more during the day so that you can take decisions faster maybe you are a more conservative guy and you like to do a much slower process optimization there is no right or wrong here the whole point is to be profitable and have good ROAS so that being said I think that you also need to find the recipe for your ad account and based on your budget for the cbo and the average cost per purchase but also find the style that you like okay it's like a basketball I guess you can have different style of shooting but the goal is one to get the ball inside the hoop okay so that's all about this I hope that it makes sense I like the topic I don't like to discuss it all the time it's boring it's the same question again and again but fine but the other thing that I want to say about it is that I'm going to create also a video about it because I need to just give the video to people to watch and understand how it works I guess so the first question for today it comes from a person that is posting a lot and it says if you have five ads what do you recommend as a budget for the ads and things that's why I put it first so that I will I will not forget that I meant so dude I said all of these things I think you understand now okay but let's answer if you have five ads what do you recommend as a budget for the ads yeah it depends on your average average cost per purchase next one hello firstly thank you very much for your content it significantly stands out in terms of quality compared to other channels I've watched ads thank you very much secondly I have a question about my facebook advertising strategy I run ads on four advertising accounts okay I remember that it's for a different product in the same niche typically three ads are active simultaneously on three different advertising accounts I advertise in Poland with a 25 dollars budget per campaign and as a result one campaign may break even while two yield a small profit would you advise focusing on one campaign with a larger budget or continue shooting testing with multiple products hoping that one performs well and then scaling it a small profit so yeah so this is if the items have the same average or value I guess first of all the fact that you're doing this question means that you understand that what you do is problematic the way that you say it I also understand that it's problematic and that it's not nice as a structure so you do understand that there is a problem here which is good it means that you have a feeling about ads now if we think of it the only factor here that matters in order for you to put all of this in one campaign is the average or value that you get from each of the items if these items are kind of on the same niche if these items are kind of having the same price and you get the same average or value 100 you can put them in the in the same campaign and let them compete with each other there's nothing wrong with letting the creatives or products compete with each other as long as they are kind of same okay if they are different suddenly you need to have different budgets for each one of them because you might have to do different targeting for different niches for the products you might have to do you might have different rules for the optimization if a product sells for 50 or if a product sells for 100 and then it says because I don't show I want to clarify further with a limited budget is it better to launch one campaign with a larger budget having assets for different products or focus on one product with various creatives I think it's I think I replied already if it's for one product could the campaign structure be for instance one campaign three assets three different creatives for different asset yes it could be this if it's one product with the 25 I think it's too much to put three assets you say three here one three nine and then you say one campaign three assets three different creatives for each asset oh three three different creatives ah yeah so nine so three yeah it's fine because the problem here is if you have 25 for a CBO with three assets I think it's too much unless if you're getting five or ten dollars cost per purchase which is fine but for grouping them together I think the most important is to know the things that I analyzed earlier about if they are on the same niche or if they have the same price and all of that about the structure of 139 I think that you need a little bit more budget but also this depends on the cost per purchase that you're getting if it's 10 it's totally fine for example if it's five it's totally fine if it's 20 it's a little bit too much I would go with one asset over here if it's 20 and you have only 25 now having three ads within an asset is totally fine I do three between five or I do dynamic creative ads and next one hi Constance I'm currently running your crazy method in a CBO campaign good for you and I'm getting good results using broad targeting with no interests okay that's good that means that your pixel is good would you recommend me to test new creatives in an ABO campaign with broad targeting no interest or with interest my pixel already has 600 700 pairs from this pro why why why why why you take the Ferrari and you have to and you want to go back to LADA you know it doesn't it doesn't make any sense you have the crazy method you understand that there are more advanced ways of running ads and we don't live in 2018 okay so why go back to ABO you have the crazy method you have something that is working the structure is crazy method broad targeting go and test your creatives there with one new campaign you don't care if it's an ABO you don't care if it's something works in an ABO because it's going to be small budget so do you know what you care about if something is going to work in a very stressed situation like a CBO campaign where ads compete with each other and you form your preferred projects and one asset can spend much more money from the other instead of having stable budgets and all of that so for me ABO testing is dead and we should not do it we should go straight away to having sales it's a waste of money it's a waste of time and we should go straight away of having sales in real conditions okay it's like it's like testing it's it's like it's like testing a weapon for a war in a Luna park okay it it okay if it goes in a Luna park it doesn't mean that's going to work in the field for example with f-16s flying above you okay just that let's continue should we do crazy method with interest targeting only or we can do it with broad targeting only that's the whole point crazy method goes with everything but guys again as i said crazy method is something that you use when you have something working if you have something working you take it and you duplicate it so that you can exploit it the whole point of you doing one campaign with a crazy method and having interest broad target or whatever is because we want to create different hot pockets facebook doesn't necessarily going to target the same people if you have an audience of 100 million people and you put this it's not going to target the same people it's going to target different people based on the initial interaction of the ads and based on the initial sales it's going to continue finding more people based on that so it forms hot pockets if you think of it it wouldn't make any sense for facebook to target the same people all over again in this audience because then you would compete for exactly the same people for everyone using the same combination okay so yes it's targeting different different people based on the period based on your creatives it doesn't matter but it does so it creates different hot pockets eventually over there so yes the crazy method can work with everything with a lookalike that's working yes with an interest that's working yes with a broad targeting yes everything so let's say that you you are observing for example that you are doing broad targeting ads you are having for example you you want to make it a little bit better so you're saying okay i can see that i'm having sales from 25 plus age and only on women you can run a crazy method bro targeting 25 plus to 65 plus and women only do it with crazy method the problem with crazy method is that you should not abuse it or use it just just so you think just so that you will think that it's going to have good results for example you have no indication that one interest is working and you run it with crazy method why there is no point to that the point is that i have something working in an audience of 50 million i know that i have targeted just a small fraction of it i want to exploit it i want to have more hot pockets within this audience or test at least if i can get more hot pockets in this audience so that's the point of the crazy method to just take take something that's working and just taking more out of it okay because if you have a campaign with interest for example then you put 10 interests one per ad set 10 adsets with one interest on each then you see one or two of them they're having sales then you have immediately two more campaigns okay but you doing crazy method just immediately without sometimes i do it for example i go in another account that has a lot of sales okay i will do a crazy method with stack lookalikes for example okay but a lot of times i have seen from people using the crazy method thinking that it's a blueprint that's going to work anyway it's not about that the crazy method is about exploiting something that has worked so and also you cannot abuse it because you do it once it doesn't mean that you can do another five campaigns with the same audience maybe it's going to work okay but still you don't have to abuse it don't get disappointed if you do another one another one it doesn't work for example okay it doesn't always going to work but for sure it's going to help you exploit more and scale when you found something that's working next one do you still consider that it's a good idea to try using one day click on an untrained pixel i never thought that it was a good idea to use one day click on an untrained pixel i was only using it with manual bidding with big budgets and in trained pixels never used it in an untrained pixel i was thinking that maybe the algorithm would optimize faster how come since maybe it would consider that if a person didn't buy the first impression then that kind of person is not useful to target anymore while the seven days click would wait seven days to consider that it's just a theory of mine it's a wrong theory i believe because in order for you to optimize faster don't forget that you need to have higher budgets okay so if you're having 100 dollars per day and you're doing one click optim that's that's difficult but if you're having five thousand dollars per day and you want to use it fine it's it's okay but you will just have this problem of different days being good or bad okay but over there i can understand it okay that you are targeting different people and so on but i would rather follow your opinion though since i don't have enough budget to waste testing thanks if you don't have enough budget don't do it then that's my only thing uh one day optimization has worked in several accounts but it was always big budgets okay not in small budgets in small budgets sadly and not for the learning phase okay forget that but in small budgets sadly you need um more data data data is the key here and you need more data next one do multiple advanced plus campaigns is in same ad account not compete with each other even if all creatives are different especially for creatives are different they are not competing with each other because the creatives are also going to help you form the hot pockets that we explained earlier as we said earlier we're not targeting the same people always the same module so advanced is a broad targeting but it's not going to target the same people again and again if it was that if that was the case everyone who's creating ads as a broad audience they would target the same people it wouldn't make any sense think of it guys it doesn't make any sense so it's forming different hot pockets based on the initial people that's going to target and based on the initial people that they are going to buy and the especially when you have different creatives okay i can hear that you might have some overlap and stuff on bigger abouts again on bigger budgets again not on small budgets but on bigger budgets again you might have some overlap when you use the same creatives but when you use other creatives you are also approaching people from different aspects so a person that might convert with creative a maybe it's not maybe it's not going to convert with creative d because they have different theme they have different hooks they show different examples of usage of the product and all of that so different creatives also help you have more sales at the whole point because they are differentiating the product and they show other users of the products that they're going to resonate with other people targeting more sub-neases of the niche that you want to actually target that being said hot pockets are important over here to understood and i think that the more the people understand the hot pockets and how they're being formed um they are going to be fine i have videos about hot pockets i think you should go and you should watch them costantinos thank you for your place sir uh thank you i mean uh would you name a third party that i could use any recommendation i'm not familiar of these apps thank you for your time replying by the way about your master class here thank you man i hope you enjoyed it i can see your progress also there now about these apps after the fiasco with blowed out there's no way that i'm going to be um involved in any of these again and i think it would be extremely difficult for me to be involved in any other things maybe i'm going to keep the channel for a long time without anything uh secondly i it's not my job to recommend you anything because i'm not using them for optimization which is the most important part part for me i'm not using them for reporting because i have to watch facebook and what facebook reports because this is what facebook is going to use to optimize now as a business owner of course i think that these tools are valuable so that you can know lifetime value you can know where sales are coming from real ROAS and all of that to check but i cannot suggest something guys because all of them they do the same job they're kind of good i cannot say triple whale wiki reports or something else or hyros so it's up to you to choose i guess you need to watch videos from other people that they are proposing them but most of them they are also affiliates with that so i don't know if you will hear honest opinions about which one is the best but my opinion doesn't matter here because i'm not using them in the way that i want you to use them i want you to use them in order to know your data better for example if you have a subscription subscription model company it's very important to know your retention rate because if we are getting clients right now as a cost per purchase of 100 and the subscription is 100 that means that we can scale because if we see that the retention rate of of the the retention rate of people let's start with the 80 percent the 80 of the people stay there for six months that means that we are getting 600 dollars from these people and we can see this data from these programs that means that we can go and we can spend for example 400 dollars as a cost per acquisition while scaling because when you scale the cost per acquisition is going to increase so instead of spending 100k maybe spend 500k and then make this money in the in the long term so it's very important to know your this these tools are helping you to understand your growth okay because facebook is not only about the sale that you're going to have in a month okay it's how much more this person is going to spend is it going to come again every when and am i growing my email list when i'm doing emails now instead of having 10k profits i'm having 20k after five months and doing facebook ads and having growth all of that these are the things that you are going to win from these programs apps if you're if you're going to use them but i cannot propose you any i guess sorry guys but the challenge is about facebook ads it's not about how you run an e-commerce store i'm just a part of this of this business of running a store also what's the best time to push campaigns live most advertisers around 12 in the midnight that campaign can spend the whole day is it really so the truth it's okay i don't like it because i like 6am i like 6am because if you go in all of the shopify stores even in yours you will see that you have this graph goes up in the evening and then it drops really really low on this later on the night okay so what i like to do is i like to start them at 6am because from so from 12 to 2 it's fine but then it drops a lot so i like to start them at 6am so that the first day which is the best day because facebook is giving you all the low hanging fruit so that you can get some sales and you can continue optimize after that for the purchase event the way that facebook works i like at 6am it's not wrong to put it at midnight i get it but i like 6am to be a little bit more efficient with my budget and push it during the good hours of the day but for sure i don't like when people are starting ads at 6 7 8 o'clock because they think that's the prime hour because that's going to spend all the budget in just a few hours or even you're not going to give it the first chance in your best day which is the first 24 hours and you have the best chances of getting the best results next one is hi Konstantinos i didn't know that if i optimize for a country then if i target another country that means that the new country would not be optimized i didn't say that i said that the demographics of a country are different for example the people who are married in greece age uh the profiles of the people are completely different from the people who are married in india for example okay because people are getting married there earlier a pregnant woman in europe has different demographics from a pregnant woman in united states okay so there are different demographics from country to country and you need to understand that if your pixel is trained to a european women profile it's much more difficult to go in a in an american woman profile that's what i'm trying to say i currently target about 20 countries after i began using the fundamentals of crazy method my untrained account is getting sales faster thank you i'm really glad guys that crazy method is working for you you know when uh when i was doing it and i wasn't listening to anyone talking about it i was feeling like i will end up in a hut in the mountains with the walls running crazy method i told you it's working you know like the movies that we see with a guy that became crazy and he isolated himself in the mountains uh of course it was easier because i had jonathan which was telling me that it was also working uh for him uh when we started talking and we met uh but uh right now i'm getting much more um joy out of this because uh basically all of the things that i'm saying and nobody is talking about uh now they they they start to make more sense because more people are uh validating them and thank you for that my question is given that i need to get a few uh profit as fast as i can this is not always the best case okay when you are being pushed to make a lot of profits fast you make mistakes um i can then should i focus spending more um money only in one country first of all the rule that we always have is that if something is working we don't touch it apart from that what you can do is that you can break down and you can see the spends per country and if you see that you're spending more money in two or three or five countries you can focus on them more but yeah that being said i think that you taking decisions based on the fact that you have to make money fast is never good and most of the time this is catastrophic but maybe it's a lesson that you have to take in this process in order for you to learn because everything that we do with facebook ads or e-commerce is just a lesson that we take so that we can be better in our next project or in our business the next day so mistakes are fine i'm just telling you maybe you're not going to listen to me it's fine you're going to learn on your own but when you try to we push facebook ads to spend more or to have better results when they are working not because we have to pay the bills okay it's it's different so we push things when facebook shows us that we can do it if we cannot with facebook is not going to be there to pay our bills it's like you have problems and you go to the casino to play on the roulette in order for you to find money to buy a car because you don't have a car okay most probably you're going to lose all the money that you also have and you won't have and you won't have the money to take the bus okay just to give an example hi constantinos a few days ago i asked the question should i target specific gender if it performs the best with interest audiences and you said yes of course i mostly use video ads and today i want to launch some image campaigns if women were performing the best with videos should i start by targeting women as well with images 100% uh you should check it and do it like this or maybe different creative format could be appealing to men as well so should i start with both genders uh i i i would do women so after some point of course it really matters so uh if you're selling makeup you will target women i don't know if your item is um is not gender specific but i i think that especially in smaller budgets you can be more specific okay and you can spend more in order to have better chances of having better results later on uh even if you will do broad targeting it's going to target on its own women so you can focus right now on whatever it's working it's totally fine and yes most probably if i had videos working with women i would do only women with images also just to be safe hi thanks for the video do you have an article from meta where this is officially communicated please thanks a lot he's talking about the the pixel being removed uh i made a video about it uh first of all there were posts that they were coming i i didn't keep them but there were posts that they were coming from people working on meta that they were saying that the pixel was going to be removed but when i went to the meta headquarters uh on island the previous year uh when was it was it on october i think it was october uh october september uh when i went there i asked them what is happening with the pixel and they told me that you guys that you do e-commerce you think that you are the tip you think that you are um uh that the top uh of the marketeers inside but there are so many people that they do ads also on facebook and they are not e-commerce stores they are just simple stores that they just have a pixel what they have what they have realized in meta and this is why they didn't remove the pixel is that the problem is that still 80 of the people which was shocking to me shocking to me uh 80 or 85 of the people just use pixel and they told me it's just a hair salon is this and that and that e-commerce stores are just as just a small percentage of the advertisers not not for the money that they spent but for the number of the ad accounts there are many other accounts out there in a very amateur level that they don't spend a lot of they just boost posts and stuff all of these people they just have a pixel and 85 of these people has a pixel so meta realized that it's almost impossible to make them to change to api only so they never removed the pixel this is the formal uh answer that i got from facebook about it um and also something else that i want to point out is is that i might post a video what's the dates guys okay i cannot just go in each one of the videos and just pin comments about things i also forget all the things as we said the the changes with meta are cataclysmic so check also the dates also check the dates for other people when you watch about abo strategies about targeting if they created them on 2018 well you have to think about it next one how i consider i'm currently running a few crazy method campaigns and planning on duplicating them to a bigger budget don't get greedy okay don't over exploit it i have five creatives in total yeah i have i have five credits in total and i'm noticing one creative has generated some negative angry reactions i was thinking when duplicating maybe create a brand new similar creative and replace it with the one with the negative reactions okay if it doesn't have a lot of engagement maybe 10 reactions in total so i won't be losing a lot of social proof is this something you would consider doing or you don't pay much attention to that things i wouldn't pay much attention to that with only 10 reactions i think you are overreacting to it i would pay attention to it if it's getting budget if it's getting budget it's going to be problematic if it has negative if it has negative first of all i would remove it secondly you say that you want to scale with crazy method and all of that but you have only five creatives you have to work on creatives okay crazy method is just a way of you getting from 100 to 200 getting to 500 needs more creatives need more campaigns and all of that and not necessarily crazy method so don't abuse it because you're going to start seeing your ass dropping maybe it's going to work though okay sometimes i was able to scale to 1k per day just with crazy methods one after the other now about the thing with the creative i need to tell you that that it's very important over here to to think the fact that facebook doesn't recognize good from bad engagement so facebook is going to think that people are engaging with this post so this is a good post so let's give it more budget so if this is the case and people are engaging negatively you should not continue with this creative because it's getting negative engagement but facebook doesn't understand it it's going to spend money to it so it's ruining your whole campaign optimization over here so remove it and don't try to manage it with hiding comments and all of that it doesn't worth it if it does that on the other hand if it doesn't get budgeted and just took some bad reactions and stuff just post it again if it happens again then remove it and never try it again but what i want you to learn from this is that you should be a little bit careful with the negative engagement because facebook cannot recognize it and a lot of times you might think that this is getting a lot of engagement but you have to check also if it's negative engagement so that you know if you have to shut it down or not last question high cost at yours we have one big problem our product price is about 150 euros and our audience the whole audience is about 1 million people and nothing can be changed that's the limit the ad account is about 40 years old and we spent enough money for this reason so the problem is that we cannot leave the learning phase or to get to 50 sales a week we try different methods to increase the budget and so on same in the end learning limited yes we try to proceed with the learning limited but in a few days the sale drops even more to start conversion campaigns with the objective add to cart niche account you know there is no point what do you suggest how to leave the learning limited phase because sometimes it seems impossible to leave the face this face because of the audience small and limited and the price of the product high so not even and so not every person can buy things so what i'm trying to what i want you to understand here is that how can i say this in a very polite way you have one million audience and you have a limited area and uh you have the budget that you have well you cannot have everything um that you want in life if you put all of these um specific if you put this product in this specific situation because you're putting a limiting audience and then you're just putting um uh also uh over here first of all don't care about the learning phase okay learning phase is something that we should not care about and uh you should not watch and all that okay fine learning phase let's leave it on the side even on other accounts that they don't have one million audience we don't care about the learning phase secondly over here you are having one million audience and you're saying that you are limited and all of that yes you're going to be limited and one other thing is that this campaign is going to die from time to time because it's a very small audience so embrace it that's what i'm trying to say it's going to happen again and again and don't try to find a solution the big problem here is the limitation that you have for the reach and all of that but it's not a problem it's not a problem that's going to be solved with any strategy okay that's what i'm trying to actually say here so be okay with that understand that you will not get past the learning phase you will get learning limited your campaign is going to die and you have to relance it from time to time there's nothing to do when you when you do that um because you are limited in uh in your budget and in your um one million people not in your budget in the one million people that's the main issue over here and uh you can do nothing about it just uh just do it just do it like this so this is not a problem this is reality okay uh it is a problem in a sense but it's it's not the problems have solutions this doesn't have a solution because it's one million i hope that i make sense uh guys freelancer diaries uh really fast uh facebook ads media buyer i need someone to manage my facebook ad campaign daily monitoring and cutting based on cpa target perfect testing new creatives every day testing new campaign structures and audiences so guys uh the reason that i'm posting this is because if you're testing new creatives every day that means that you're spending so much money on the ad account and eventually even the campaigns that are working they are going to start deteriorating so testing is okay but testing doesn't have to be your money because when you're doing testing you do it so that you can improve the results of your ad account not so that you can spend so much money that you're not going to be able to recover them from your profitable campaigns so testing also needs some uh some limits okay you cannot just keep testing testing testing testing testing and having just one campaign it doesn't make any sense i see people obsessed with testing all the time and they don't realize that this is a game about profits and it's not about testing we are not scientists over here that we're getting funded by the government to run tests in order to improve the humanity or find another element or find the boson higgs or whatever we're not that we are we we are businesses and we need to make money we are going to test but the test is going to be just a small fraction of our budget which is going to be which we are investing okay i get it but there has to be another bigger budget which is being spent it is making profit so that we can keep investing to the rnd that companies are doing this is our testing okay so testing every day in campaigns unless if you do it in a stupid way of an abo which doesn't make any sense because it's just a waste of money that means that you will you will keep testing testing testing and eventually at the end of the day when you draw the line and you just do the calculations you will see that because of your testing you were not profitable that's all i had for you today guys i hope that you liked it i enjoyed this podcast actually because it had some good questions and we covered some really nice topics and i was able also to say some bad things about jonathan which is always enjoyable to talk a little bit about about jonathan the good part is that he's never going to see that that's that's that's the best part especially saying these things at the end of the podcast it's it's it's almost certain that he's not going to see it unless if he's persuaded now because he didn't know that and he says i must watch most i must watch more of his content in order to be a little bit more updated but he's already updated so it's it's okay it's all that i'm going to close saying you Jonathan and guys i will see you on the next podcast bye this was the facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is what the is you you you you you you you you
