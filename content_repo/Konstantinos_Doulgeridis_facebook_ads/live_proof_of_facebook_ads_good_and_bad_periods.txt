Hello Facebook ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today I'm coming to you with a proof live ad account that I haven't touched for many months so that you can see the fluctuations of the results without me doing anything. So in most ad accounts what we do is that we go and we do another campaign and another campaign and we optimize and all of that but what if I told you that I have a client which he told me dude we have to fix other things just keep the spend as it is for eight months one year I want to keep it like this and then we're going to start running ads all over again and this is good for me from my side because I'm not doing extra campaigns I guess I'm getting paid less of course but this is not your issue anyway let's move on. On this specific case for eight months I can see how an ad is behaving with ups and downs without me touching it at all and then I'm saying this is how Facebook works it's going to have ups and downs and this is why I like to work with average results with multiple campaigns because some campaigns are going to do better some campaigns are going to do worse and this is Facebook it's not about consistency it's about you seeing an average result of 30 days seven days an average result on another account with many campaigns that some of those are going to do well some of those are going to do bad and this is why I like to work like this because I'm seeing this kind of behaviors let me take you to my pc let me show you month by month the fluctuations of this advantage shopping campaign without being touched at all and how it's working better or worse sometimes some people might think that if you leave it for a long period of time it's going to work better but sometimes it's getting worse sometimes it's getting better so I'm going to take you through the journey and we're going to see it together so that you can understand because obviously in your account accounts you don't have the luxury of leaving a campaign there forever just to see how it behaves so that in one year from now you are going to become more wise in the way that you're going to treat your facebook ads but I have this luxury so I'm going to show you so that you will also know hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that they have you can find the one that is going to feed better your needs and I will hope to see you there so remember it's another account with just one campaign we used to do several campaigns over here but we're just doing one until the company fixes numbers production one contract that they have with the American government and all of these things and working scale next year maybe you're going to see this other account more in the next year that is coming but this is life and this is entrepreneurship sometimes you have to step down from marketing and fix other things before you go back to marketing because what do we know facebook is just making the small picture bigger okay so if you're having sales anyway facebook is going to amplify that okay it's an amplifier so what do we see here we see here I'm going to start here from the start of this one just for clarity it started on 60 of july there are other campaigns also here I want us to focus here okay on cost per purchase and what we're getting so let's see how it behaves again right now we don't care about results because the company numbers are not friendly they're fixing them and then we're going to care more about but we can learn from this because again this is what facebook gives we have to respect it and we have to see how we can improve it so in this period we're getting 100 158 cost per purchase we're not seeing gross because it has crazy fluctuations in between from 5 to 12 on this period 163 so it has uh it has gone up from 12 to 19 it has 171 so it's increasing remember i'm not touching okay on this period he just told me just leave it as it is okay 158 it's getting better 26 the second 185 it's increasing again 2 to 9 on september 152 it's dropping on its own 9 to 16 184 so some people at this point would say that i'm not saying that you should keep it again i'm not saying that you should keep it i would have closed it also if these are not the numbers that we want to see and so on but still it's good for you to behave to see how they behave on their own okay so 16 to 23 we have this huge increase again uh 23 to 30 this is still of september have one 164 so what do we know so far that it's going between 160 180 sometimes it goes to 200 let's see an october here which is by the way uh election period okay so we we can go from 30 to 7 we'll go to 147 from 7 to 14 112 we just start seeing a drop over here 14 to 21 no black friday of course here okay there's no black friday 111 21 to 28 91 we're getting even better results 28 to 4 i'm not touching it still 84 we're getting better results on november 4 to 11 80 okay 80 to 18 we're getting 132 again 18 to 25 we're getting 102 again so out of nowhere this one is actually behaving much better in this period 112 uh 2 to 9 we're getting 97 and from 9 to 16 we're getting 129 again so we do see this fluctuation up and down and we do see a very good month with very good results without us touching it at all just with facebook having good and bad periods for this specific uh business now this uh period over here on october it was just a period of elections so in this period what kind of results we had 108 it was the first month that it did better so it makes no sense i could understand this on of them on november maybe because there is this thing of people want to buy but i do believe that the results are so good because of uh october over here it's a united states at account so the cpms uh should have been higher let's check a little bit the cpms just to check what was happening so if we go on september cpm is 21.53 october it went to 22 so it didn't increase that much and on november 20 to 25 it's increasing let's see this month so far since on 26 so it keeps increasing all the time but we don't see this uh sudden drop of results we are still on on our best numbers that we ever had so just so that you can understand the super big fluctuations that we have on this other account over here we can see for example in the last days okay let's go on the 10th we go to 140 um 114 okay 109 uh we come here 400 uh then here 127 here we're having 145 here we do have 196 and here we do have 68 so you can understand all of these fluctuations are causing also this and then it's being you know um it's happening also on the seven days on the month and so on uh but this is the lower lowest that i have ever seen it so 16 purchases in just one day uh giving two rows which is something that i have never seen it's a it's a very expensive item uh i to be honest with you i contacted the owner to know if there's something wrong with tracking but it was true so out of nowhere this came now some of you might say that yes they are improving at the same time their systems and stuff and maybe they are more effective maybe but still this campaign is actually showing that um any way that we want to take it is either showing that okay they're improving things so the ads can work if you improve your numbers which is one lesson which they haven't proved a lot of things but anyway boom roasted by the way this is a trained pixel okay this is a pixel that we have for more than one year so it's not like the pixel got trained or anything the other thing that we can see is that it has fluctuations up and down and the more they data it gets the more then it understands and the more it optimizes and maybe you're going to have a good period until you have again a bad period and so on i think that this is very interesting for people like me to see how it behaves even without touching it and stuff of course it's a gamble if you're just leaving your ads like this and you wait for them to actually work have i seen it in some other accounts yes but there's not a lot of company you know sometimes some people say okay it i'm not going to do any more facebook ads just leave this campaign and you see this campaign doing better and better and better in this account in the long term but i'm not suggesting this i do suggest that we need to keep testing things and trying to make things better but it's also good that we have this one for july august september october november december for six months we have this and we can see how it actually behaved i do believe for example that the next month maybe it's going to go again to 150.

what do we learn by that that there are fluctuations in the facebook ads if we had several campaigns and some of our other campaigns were doing better this one was doing worse and so on we could actually have an average result that was going to be acceptable for us just because some of those were going to do better some of those were going to do worse that's why i like to work with multiple campaigns that's all i had with this small observation of this campaign that was running on its own without me touching it i don't know if it's interesting for you but for me it's interesting so this is what it matters because i control the content of this channel sadly for you if you didn't like it if you didn't like it it's okay but i find this interesting okay i find it that without touching it it's doing this ups and downs it helps me it helps me understand a lot and keeps me sane from believing that i have touched something and i ruined everything and stuff because the biggest problem is that and i have been there believe me when you are alone in a dark room and you're managing one account or two accounts you don't know if it's something that you have done or if it's the general picture do you know when i realized it when i started managing a lot of accounts and i started having friends who do the same job and they were saying hey dude how was yesterday yesterday was bad for me okay yesterday was bad for me also so we could understand the patterns and i didn't have the luxury of having an account which i could keep like this so now you know don't get paranoid or don't believe i know that you don't have the luxury and when you're alone you're getting paranoid and you think that you're going to fix it or you read reddit to find the next thing that's going to fix it but sometimes it's about leaving it to recover if it was producing some decent results before and i know that it's difficult to do so but for people who are experienced and they see it every day across accounts that there are patterns or they see in other accounts like this that it's going to have ups and downs this is the way that you should treat it in a more relaxed way instead of you just going like crazy and touch it again and again and again to fix it which is going to make it worse eventually in other words what i'm trying to say is that when things are not doing really well and you know that they're not doing really well across accounts it's a time for you to step back and wait for them to get fixed on their own because you touching it it's going to make it even worse and i know that nine percent of you is not going to do it because you don't have the information that i have with many accounts and many friends but it's okay that's why we have the inner circle and all of that and the podcast also we are saying every week how the ads are doing and we have also the slack community that we're discussing these things day by day to see if the results are good or bad don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website you can check also my mentorship programs and you can check also below my mentorship programs all the people that they have completed or being part of it and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
