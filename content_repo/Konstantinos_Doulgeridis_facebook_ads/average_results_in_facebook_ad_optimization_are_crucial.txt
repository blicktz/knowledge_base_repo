Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to analyze with a live ad account example why the average results are so important when we're optimizing advanced class campaigns. First of all, this applies also to advanced class campaigns, also to CBO campaigns, also to a whole ad account structure. We do like to scale with more campaigns and we do like to treat them all together with an average result.

Some of those are going to do better, some of those are going to do worse. I have a very nice example over here of an optimization that I did in an advanced class campaign and I believe that most people would fail because they were going to watch each ad set as an individual ad set with ROAS instead of watching it as a whole that is giving them the ROAS that they actually want. Now, I think it's in the human nature guys.

Always there are people that say okay I want to touch this in order to make it better. In our philosophy as Tzannel and as Kostantinos, we always intervene when we have to. We don't intervene to make things better, we intervene so that we don't make things worse.

Okay or because we see that the things are becoming worse and worse. So we intervene because we expect things to get better but we don't intervene so that we can make things better. It's two completely different things if you think of it okay.

Pause the video and think of it if you want. Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website. You're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have.

You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. If you go and you analyze each ad set or each ad within an advanced plus campaign and you just go there and you just criticize them based on the ROAS that they have and then you just close this. Then you create the domino effect of changes because you are liberating budget but we have also mechanism for that which is lowering the budget so that we are not going to disturb the balance but we do that mostly on CBO campaigns but also on advanced plus campaigns.

I would like to take you to my pc to show you how this advanced plus campaign has actually improved by the time just because I didn't touch it and I just let it operate with average results which actually lead it to having better ROAS at the end of the day. So I came to this ad account. It's not any big ad account but I started an advanced plus on the 27th of March and the ad account before and this is the problem you know people optimizing because we think that advanced plus campaigns on their own they can work.

Okay it's easier, I get it but they also need optimization in several cases. So February, two ROAS. Okay going here from 1 to 23, three ROAS on this other account.

Okay with on March on 23, let's go from 26. Yeah this is not good but let's see how much they were. So 2.82 okay since the day that I came, 27, 17, 3.79 okay just by optimizing properly okay improving results.

Now I want to show you this campaign from the journey from the beginning okay 27 we're going to take some you know some times here. I want you to see how it started okay. So I have optimized it okay.

We can see videos about optimizing but I want you to understand what was done after that point. So over here I'm not happy with the results that I'm getting with this one the 91 spend which is taking all of the budget. This is a $200 campaign.

I'm closing it. I'm taking the risk of closing it. Most people wouldn't take the risk given the fact that this ad account was having 2 to 2.5 ROAS they wouldn't close that but I thought that I would get better results.

30 to 31 after closing it I'm having a new leading ad which is going closer to 3 so my decision is correct on closing it. Another thing which I want you to notice here guys is from 27 to 31 I'm having $52 CPM okay. While in this advanced plus they were getting 27 and based on my optimization here then it drops to 28.

So a lot of times when you have higher CPMs on the first days and stuff it doesn't mean that it cannot drop just so you know. Let's see a little bit what happened on the first days of April after deciding to go with another ad. Over here we're having also some decent results across.

This is where most people would make the mistake okay. We can see that from the 1st of April to 4 we are getting 1.66 and this is our leading ad. As long as I'm getting good results over here I'm not going to touch it because touching it means that it's going to liberate all of the budget to all of these ads and then the 8 ROAS or the 10 ROAS or the 26 ROAS is not going to be any more this.

It's going to be something else. It's going to give it so much budget that it's going to ruin the ROAS and it's not going to have that. It's the biggest mistake that I see people do you know.

They cannot hold themselves. They say I'm getting 2.88. These are having good ROAS.

If I close this one it's going to get better. They haven't optimized obviously a lot in order to understand that this is going to make things worse but on the second hand they don't understand the balance of an ad account spending and if I'm getting an average what I want it's going to get better. The owner actually came to me and he told me that why don't you close the the 1.66 it's causing us to have lower ROAS.

I'm telling him you're happy with the ROAS that we're getting in average so why are we talking about it? Are we done? Most people would close that or do something I don't know and then all of this budget because this one on the 4th it's actually spending 135.

So if this 135 is going to go to this most probably they're going to start having bad ROAS but we can see also that the others are producing good results over here. Let's go on the 5th. We can see that now it's taking a little bit more going to 3 ROAS.

Let's see from 6 to 9. 2.41 still here you can see even with this now I'm having a situation that some other ads are taking also budget. Okay let's see what's happening on the 9th.

On the 9th we can see that we took 5.58 ROAS. So okay it was getting 1.66 for 3-4 days why would we go and close it or change it? We just let the campaign continue optimizing.

10 to 13 we are having these results over here again it's on 3. We're even happy with 3 ROAS okay and now we can see from this to this 6.4 it's going even better on the last 7 days we're on 6.23 super healthy campaign fully optimized right now and you can see that at the end of the day after taking the right decision and watching the average results in order to not ruin this campaign because by closing this ad set on the start of the month it was going to be catastrophic for the whole campaign. Maybe it was going to absorb it okay but it would be a total risk that we shouldn't take.

So you can see here that by just leaving it and working with the average results this campaign has actually improved. I found this live example really interesting and I wanted to show it with you because sometimes patience when you're having good results especially when you're having good results you can be patient and it's going to get better and better because it's going to get more data. I hope guys that this is another example of optimization which is going to help you understand more and more and more for the things and be part of my world and all the things that I'm thinking and I'm trying to share with you but you know it's impossible to do it with one video so this is why we are posting so many.

If you want to learn more guys don't forget that you can check my book, my course, my website or my mentorship programs and until we meet again be creative, keep optimizing and be consistent. ALEXANDAN
