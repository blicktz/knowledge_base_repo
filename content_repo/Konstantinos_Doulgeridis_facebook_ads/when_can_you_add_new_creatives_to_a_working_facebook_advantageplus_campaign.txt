Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss when you can add new creatives in a working advantage shopping campaign or even in a CBO campaign. The rules of the channel are very simple and yes still they apply. The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.

And the rule is very simple if something is working don't touch it. Now let's go to the rest of the video. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have.

You can find the one that's going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. Let's say that you do ignore me and you do want to touch it because this is who you are and you want to do it anyway because you cannot hold yourself of doing that. So let's leave this to the side and let's say that you are one of these people.

So what is the only case that does make sense to do so? So we do create all these creatives and we do toss them inside the campaign. Our creatives are going to be our targeting because based on what we are saying inside or the people that we are targeting we are targeting niches emotions and all of that in order to trigger people or to make them resonate with us and buy and then create a hot pocket so that we can find similar people to them and so on.

If you are having let's say a creative which actually appeals to moms and then you just do another creative which actually appeals to men, if you go and you toss it inside a campaign that already has formed a hot pocket which is working and then you're tossing a creative inside which is for men, as you can understand it has already decided to optimize in the ASC okay we have in the ASC inside we do have a hot pocket which has been formed on the ad set level okay so um no the hot pocket is being formed on the ad level it optimized on the ad set level so on the ad set level it's trying to find more people that are similar to the sales that has because this is where we have the optimization event the purchase event so it will try to find more moms to buy. As you can understand if you go inside this campaign and you add creatives for men with content that written resonates to men then you're going to have a problem and your creative is not going to be as effective or you have to retrain again your whole optimization process for men and as you can understand this is problematic so in a situation that you're having a campaign which was working very well for a long period and you are having inside content for moms and then you're just taking creatives which are again content for moms you can toss it inside there and see if you can save the campaign if you can revitalize it if you if your new creatives are working better from the others and there it makes sense so what's the most important thing to decide if we can toss creatives inside a working ASC except from the fact that if it's working or not if it's working in my opinion don't touch it but if it doesn't work if it starts getting slow if it's bad all of that then try to save it if it's a long lasting campaign in you to your ad account try to save it by just tossing creatives but with content which is actually the same so that you're not going to have problem with the optimization process that is already happening and try to find similar people again and again and again that they're going to buy based on the creatives that you have tossed inside from the beginning this is something that i have done i'm not going to lie because i wanted to test it not most of the time in my philosophy i would either try to save the campaign with a promo or i will try to see if i'm going to give it time you know but maybe this is a more aggressive way of trying to fix a campaign i have tried it it has worked in some cases in some other it hasn't worked i don't have a definite answer about it if it's working or not but in some cases it worked so i guess it's working but when we talk about technical to toss creatives that they are from a different niche or from a different emotion or whatever that may be maybe this is not ideal and maybe this is why when you're just putting new creatives inside a working ase campaign even if it's doing bad it's not doing better because it's like you are actually taking the decision to actually doom this campaign to not be able to find more and more sales but when you do the same content maybe you have some chances as i have seen in some ad accounts that you can save this campaign anyway that's all i had for you for today this is what i wanted to this is what i wanted to stress out in order for you to think about a technical side on how you can actually add new creatives in a working campaign now you know also this angle and i hope that's going to explain how and when we can add creatives there maybe another way for example it would be to try to fix also your ROAS let's say that you're getting two ROAS and you want 2.5 no matter what so trying to toss creatives inside that they're going to be on the same niche same angle and everything and you will try to find a better one which is going to have better ROAS maybe this is also something that you can do but if you just those different creatives there maybe it's better to test them in another campaign anyway that's all the things that i wanted to point out in this video for today and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website you can check also on my on my website on the link of the description all the mentorship programs and below the mentorship programs you can check all the people that they have completed my mentorship programs and if they think that they are good or bad and maybe you can be the next one and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
