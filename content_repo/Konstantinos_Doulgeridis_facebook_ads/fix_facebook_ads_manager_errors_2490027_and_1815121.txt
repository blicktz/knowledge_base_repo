Hello guys! So this is a very quick video for another error that a lot of people ask me about. When you are within a campaign and we know how much we love as a channel the duplications and relaunching campaigns and everything.

So if you want to use one of the ad sets and you duplicate it and then you do a new campaign. Let's name this one test one. Come on!

Okay! So when you do that you are getting two errors. Okay!

One of them is this under bit control or switch the lowest bit strategy and the other one is this. So the first one is being solved if you do this. If you come and you open your campaign budget optimization boom!

It's gone! And then even if you want to close it and you want to go to your ABO campaign, working like an ABO campaign, it's totally fine. There it's gone!

The second one is something that you should not care about. Okay! The second one is it's on the ad level and I can tell you that as soon as you're going to publish your campaign you will have zero issues with it.

Your ads are going to publish no matter what. Keep in your mind that a lot of times when you are watching errors you should hit the publish button and if it's going to be published you will have zero problems. Sometimes you get errors but with the publish with the publication with the publication correct of the ads you are not having actually an issue and your ads are going to work.

So sometimes ignore them but if you click on the publish button and it's not going to be published and the error persists then it means that you have a problem and you need to find a solution or you have a bad setting. So from this video understand that when you're duplicating campaigns and assets to new campaigns this is, these are the errors that they appear and this is how you can solve them and also keeping your mind that even if you have an error you have to hit the publish button and maybe it's going to be solved without you doing nothing else. I will see you in a future video.
