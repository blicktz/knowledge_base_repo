Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss something which is not related to Facebook Ads but I really wanted to make this video even if it's going to be small just because it's a very good idea so that we are not going to always be positive no so that we are not always going to be negative against Meta and sometimes it's in our hands to overcome issues that Meta is going to have. So during March 2024 we had two major problems with Meta servers and stuff with one which was very big we have Elon Musk tweeting and mocking Meta about it and all of that one of my clients did something which I found really genius and while the Meta servers were down she sent this sms over here saying that hey maybe Meta and Instagram and everything is down but you can come into our website because it's working better than ever and it's really fast and if you're bored you know come. So she made a lot of money out of this move because people had nothing to do basically on social media of course in order for you to do that you need Meta and all of that I'm not saying that without Meta you could have that because all of the sms email list was being built with emails and all of that but I'm just making this video because we all learned to be negative against Meta and always blame Meta and stuff while we have to always be as businessmen or whatever as entrepreneurs whatever e-commerce store owners we have to be creative and we have to be consistent on what we are doing and with that way we have a proof over here which is showing that okay instead of panicking Say f***ing car!

Where are you f***ing car? Where are you f***ing car? Going to twitter writing that oh my god it's close going to reddit saying bad things about Mark and all of that she said okay that's an opportunity for me to make some money.

Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. I really wanted to make this video to inspire you just to tell you that you know when things are happening with Meta we should not just be negative we just need to try to think outside of the box and find ways of making it work because guys Meta is not going to change it's going to have its issues it's going to have bad customer support it's going to have this and that and that but it's working the algorithm is working and the platform is working this is why everybody wants to advertise there and whoever is crying just so you know they are crying because it's too expensive for them to advertise here and they're just crying blaming Facebook about that like you know if you're not competitive with your prices and all of that like Facebook has to respect that it doesn't go like this anyway that's all I want to say very short video which I wanted to make with that because in March at least we had so much negativity against Facebook and I don't think that it's fair because everybody hates Meta but everybody wants to advertise in Meta and I don't think that it is just fair. Don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course and my website and until we meet again be creative be consistent
