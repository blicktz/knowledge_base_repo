Hello Facebook Ads People, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about Advantage Plus campaigns. Why am I so excited about them? What is Advantage Plus campaigns?

Advantage Plus campaigns is a new feature which is coming from Facebook. Basically, Facebook has done this. They said to everybody through Facebook representatives that they want you to run ads with a consolidated method and everybody including me when we were trying it it wasn't working and I also have a lot of videos that I'm blaming that this thing is not working and they should not actually suggest it.

So what they have done they said guys you're not doing it correct okay so we're going to do it for you and they have created one campaign which is called Advantage Plus and what you're doing is this they are taking the campaign and the ad set they make it one and they let you actually influence all of the creatives that you're going to use. The way that this is working and of course we're going to go to MyPC to show you live data and create one together to show you how it's working but the way it's working is that we're going to decide for you what we're going to target the only thing that you can influence is the country not even placements anything not even gender it's going to be a broad targeting and you're going to be able to focus on budget when it's going to start country basic stuff just basic questions if they knew that most probably they wouldn't let you also change that and what are you going to do is that you're going to play your game into the ad level which is all the creatives in this campaign you can do up to 150 creatives of course I have done extensive testing before doing these videos instead of you know just doing one video the moment that it launched I have data now to show you everything and explain to you how it's working but I can tell you that it's super effective for some reason I think that Facebook is pushing a lot the concept because it's a consolidated concept and they don't want you to create a lot of campaigns it doesn't mean anything about our crazy method and stuff it's just another campaign that we are going to use and I think that also crazy method can apply to it I have also some notes about that the other thing is that I want to mention is that I'm seeing much lower CPMs with this method comparing to the other campaigns that we are doing with this method you are having much lower CPMs to my defense the way that they're proposing it to do it is that you do one ad set but you do a lot of ads which is what I'm teaching by the way all this period with the crazy method and stuff having different hot pockets so they're doing exactly the same thing that but they're only focusing in one ad set we're doing the same thing with dynamic creative ads but we're doing several hot pockets by doing a lot of ad sets so I'm not against the concept also I want to tell you that even when I'm saying that I'm against consolidation or whatever if I can see something that is working I have no problem coming here and telling you that this thing is working even though I disagree with consolidation although this is not consolidation Facebook you're doing one ad set but you are doing up to 150 ads which is not consolidation because it's all about having different hot pockets it's consolidation in the ad set level not consolidation in general okay and you might call it consolidation whatever but it's not I have seen only positive results by it I think that Facebook is pushing a lot the concept of Advantage Plus campaign and I think that maybe maybe it's giving very good results they also have a funding you should talk with your Facebook representatives they're doing something like you're going to spend 3k in an AB Plus testing with your best campaign and Advantage Plus 3k and we're going to give you the one third of it as an extra so you're going to spend in total 4k okay so 33% of 3k it's 1k so we're giving you this as an extra to spend on this test I have done it I can tell you that Advantage Plus has won with this AB test but not in a huge difference okay also but it won again in terms of CPMs and everything does it mean that everybody should run Advantage Plus I think that Advantage Plus should be part of your ads in an account and I'm going to show you now bigger accounts and smaller accounts that are using Advantage Plus how it's working plus there are some cases that there are some things that you need to control over there if things are not going well which is also something that I'm going to show you we have a lot of work we have a lot of things to show you so let's go straight away to my PC so guys I'm super excited now it's the time to show you the ad accounts we're going to start from one good account which is having high spend and then we're going to move to slower ones because I don't want to always show big accounts and stuff I want you to show also smaller ones and show you how it's working also I'm going to show you one problematic account right now which is not working yet but I think that I will fix it I will keep you posted about that so in this account we can see that this is a big account obviously we're spending a lot of money this is the first Advantage Plus campaign we have done let me show you some key metrics which I think that they're a little bit interesting and also we're going to create one Advantage Plus together to show you how it's working the thing that I'm seeing here immediately is the CPMs so the CPMs as you can see they're much lower compared to other ads so we have 6.527 of course I understand that you consider these lower the CPMs anyway but still here for example we have $12 CPM on some dynamic ads and everything but here we can see that the CPMs on this Advantage Plus is low low low okay so we are seeing that the CPMs are being influenced a lot by the creatives and the different creatives are dictating what the CPMs are going to be the break-even rows on this account is two you can see that we are having very good rows and also good spend on the on these campaigns are not small campaigns most of the times Facebook is actually proposing to run 200 300 with 10 20 30 creatives and let it run so we're also solving the problem of learning phase and stuff with this way it's actually a very good thing but the only thing the thing that I wanted to mention immediately is the CPMs I can see that the CPMs with Advantage Plus campaigns are much much much lower now let's create one together to show you how it's working when you're going now to your create button here and you're pressing sales which is a conversion then you're pressing continue and boom it's going to appear here very important no this is for e-commerce businesses if you are not an e-commerce you cannot use Advantage Plus if Facebook thinks that you are not e-commerce you cannot use Advantage Plus and if you cannot see it here you cannot use Advantage Plus so if you do this and you cannot see the Advantage Plus option sorry this video is not for you and you cannot use Advantage Plus campaign but I know that there are a lot of businesses that they can use it so you click on it Advantage Plus and you press continue now as we said this is a consolidated method okay and it's working let's go for the website on this one just to fix it perfect so this is a consolidated method and they have consolidated together the campaign and the ad set it has a preset of settings you cannot touch things here so let's go and you can just change the name if you are in a special ad category which you are not most probably if you are an e-commerce website the pixel is is doing and they go immediately for purchase you cannot change the optimization event over here then you are targeting the country and then we are having the budgeting and when the ads are going to start until when the optimization delivery which is going to be anyway seven days one day click and nothing else you cannot touch them beating you cannot touch targeting gender and stuff you can touch nothing and if you go here on the top you can see all the presets okay so it says here the different presets that they are using in order to target they don't have dynamic creative and the way that is working is so seven days click here and now we go to the magic which is all about creating the different ads so if you go here and you go to the ads the way to do it is you press create ad continue so now what you're having here is first of all I need to tell you that it's full of bugs okay it has a lot of bugs so you have to be patient when you're creating it for example here it wasn't showing me before that I have an ad now it shows me that I have an ad but it's okay because we can use both of them the way that you're doing it is that you are going to have now inside here several ads okay my suggestion to you to start with is 200 as a budget and 10 ads 10 different ads now the way that you do it is first of all two ways that I found very effective first of all you come here you create an ad you put manual upload you put carcel whatever you want to do singly match whatever okay you are putting your ad here different text options and whatever you're putting your call to action button your thing the domain here you're selecting the correct one utm tags and you are set it's a very easy set of creating one ad the same way that you're creating all of your ads in the other campaigns if you don't know how to create ads or watch a video that I'm using with dynamic creative ads or with any other campaign and you can see how to do it the point here is to explain how the advantage plus campaign is working the advantage plus campaign is working with several ads different creatives so you can come here and you can have one set of 10 ads one some can be casual some single images all of them single images it doesn't matter another setting that I like to use a lot it's actually when you're using post IDs so instead of using here just different ads with creatives I like to use also different post IDs you can go to existing post select post and you can go to Instagram select the post that you want and put also a URL that you want to target with this post so for me advantage plus is two things you can use it in two ways first of all by just using normal ads that you can create single images carosals and stuff videos images different things put them all together different ads for each creative that you want to use and let them compete with each other or you can do an advantage plus campaign which is going to use only post IDs why I'm saying that there are a lot of companies that they're having a lot of creatives because they're having a very big and high strong presence in the social media that means that you can use all these post IDs with this way because you can use up to 150 should you use 150 no can you use 20 30 40 yes I'm going to show you one campaign later but this is the way that you're creating one after you do your ad then you just press quick duplicate over here it's going to open another one and you can start building up all of your ads of course it's full of bugs when you close it it doesn't you have to go again back to ads to see it and stuff okay they're fixing stuff I think but don't be afraid of this budget over here because the budget is going to be it's going to say for example 200 for all of them but it's not going to spend that now that we know how to create advantage plus campaigns let me show you the way that it has worked here in this and how they look inside so this is the oldest one that we are having here as you can see only one ad set pro targeting nothing else to do and here we have used 12 ads 12 ads with a budget of 200 as you can see here we're having 200 in all of them it doesn't mean that each one of them is going to spend 200 you know that because the the budget is being decided on the ad set level so this is what the ad set is going to spend so here we're having a small cbo and the small competition between the ad sets the thing that I'm noticing immediately is that when you see the amount spends over here you can see that some of those they didn't spend a lot of money but I can guarantee you that it's different from dynamic creative ads all of them have spent something in order for facebook to decide where to spend more or less what I'm noticing also is that in 90% of the cases it's always going to be one bad ad set when you're starting the campaign that's going to spend a lot of money with very bad droids and when you're closing this one the campaign is actually behaving better I can show you this in another ad account also let's see the other campaign over here which is all about using post IDs okay so these over here are all of them post IDs you can see also again here the thing that I'm saying that facebook has spent some money in each one of the ad sets if it didn't find good results it didn't move forward with it and it's actually spending on the others this is one of the rare cases in this campaign that I haven't seen one problematic ad set that I had to close but with one ad set and with a lot of creatives I spent 200 in one campaign and 300 in another campaign so in total 500 dollars per day just with two campaigns with this way and I can tell you that the results are remarkable so the only thing that you should worry about when you're using advantage plus campaigns it's actually how you can use more and more and more creatives and of course I'm going to do one video explaining how you can scale with different creatives instead of just scaling with methods and this is the philosophy over here that different creatives can help you scale instead of just trying to use different methods I know it's a lot of work to go through the creatives but let me tell you that the companies that are doing it they have a very big advantage if if they are going to use advantage plus campaigns it's going to help them a lot and of course here I'm having another advantage plus crazy method edition which I'm going to show you in another video but let's go now and let's watch it in another account just so that we can understand how it worked there much smaller account not a lot of spend uh 200 dollars per day the way that we have done this is 200 dollars and we have seen over here to go with 40 ads again facebook has spent something in all of them if this was a dynamic ad campaign with 200 and 40 ad sets I can tell you that some of these ad sets would have zero spending so I know that in advantage plus even if you put 150 most probably facebook is going to spend a small amount in order to decide if this creative is good or bad and as you can see here we're having some good results and here is our problem maker which we have which we closed uh early because it was getting a lot of volume but not the return on ads that we wanted I think that this is one thing that most people that are going to teach you about advantage plus but they are not going to play in the ad level with the ads and that's the difference if I may say that a lot of people might say that okay it's the end of making multiple ads and stuff and no it's not because here we are having another small cbo happening inside the ad level and if we don't intervene it's going to be problematic as I said we have a lot of trust in the algorithm but sometimes the algorithm may be tricked for example one ad is having very good results and engagement here because people are just saying that how ugly this item actually looks for example it's also an engagement but facebook cannot understand that it's bad engagement and it's spending money on some bad ad so these things are always going to happen and this is our job to come here and say I don't like this result I'm going to close it and allocate the budget to the others the same thing that we are doing in our cbo optimization in a much simpler way over here so over here you can see that the results are good let's see a little bit about the cpms so the cpms over here we can see that we are on 12.92 comparing to other uh ads that we were doing in cold traffic which is 21 and 19. this is a very big improvement okay and we can see that it's spending a good amount of money it's spending with profitable ROAS I know with the person that is having the store that these are actual ROAS and we're getting very good results some people might disagree and they say that hey but also because you cannot exclude people you are also targeting people who are on retargeting but why do we care guys about that if the results are there and we're getting good results so be it okay here we're talking about an account that was having problems with 0.39 sometimes we were managing to get two ROAS and stuff but in the total we were not able to get this kind of results and now with one campaign and a lot of creatives that we had we managed to go to profitability and every day it's it's a better day in terms of the revenue that they have in the store and the profitability so why not now let's discuss a little bit about this account over here which is a problematic account right now and i'm trying to solve it um we can see for example that in the past uh if we've watched the maximum uh we can have for example 18 23 27 cpm here the cpm is 6.75 it's much slower and i can tell you that uh with the other we have very good creatives over here because we're having 0.9 0.89 cost per unique link click but we're having also very good ctrs but here we can see that with the advantage plus we are having much lower but much lower cost per unique link click which i consider more important and lower click-through rate so look how different this campaign is immediately and of course it's a conversion campaign it's not traffic ad campaign so that i consider it bad in this situation i truly believe that what we are seeing here is if we filter by selection we can see here that we are having very good results in our targeting most probably because we are getting a lot of traffic over here but the results still on the cold traffic is not there and from in my opinion this is happening because of this bad boy over here that's spending all this money without any sale so i think that by closing this one now the things are going to start improving here but this is something that we are going to discover in the next days so yes advantage plus can actually work but maybe sometimes it's going to need some optimization okay from your side and some uh things that you need to do closing uh or um you know managing a little bit the situation we will see it looks promising in terms of cpm and stuff uh it just needs some more sales here for this campaign to make also sense but even like this in the average numbers we can see that uh most probably even if we go on the last seven days we are above two ROAS which is actually the goal for this account and that means that with this way maybe it's fueling our retargeting and still we are having good results because here in the average the results are still acceptable for the KPIs that the company wants to have so that's all my remarks about the advantage plus campaigns and what i wanted to show you i think you should all try them and start using them i think it's very important uh to admit when facebook is having a new good uh thing to uh to use it um because a lot of times we disagree with them but when they are right they are right and in this case they are right try to see if you can get any funding with your facebook reps by the way i forgot to show you that let me show you so here we are having an a b test that was conducted uh with the advantage plus campaign and stuff it was a it was this bad two weeks of september with facebook having issues this is why we stopped the experiment because also the other advantage plus campaigns were not doing good at that period but still you can see that comparing to other methods and stuff uh even when we are using some of the same post ids that we are using in the advantage plus i can tell you that the advantage plus has worked better so far to conclude i think you should use advantage plus not use only advantage plus if you don't have the budget just use advantage plus i guess but if you're having a big account use all of my different methods and see which ones are working at which ones are not don't just put your all of your eggs in just one basket but most definitely try it because it's super super super effective i will see you for the closing of the video also guys after the shooting of the video i think that i forgot to show you one more account just so that you can see an account with higher ROAS you know and stuff selling more expensive items uh over here you can see an advantage plus campaign which is running and you can see that it's having the higher ROAS from all the other this is on the last seven days and as you can see here we are having 14 ROAS and the CPMs are not lower from some other cases they're in the same place my crazy method for example here is having smaller CPM but still you can see that we are having a very good return on ad spend over here this is another account i'm using also the advantage plus campaign and i have more accounts i guess but i wanted to show you also that in several cases even with crazy method having lower CPMs here it's winning again on the ROAS i think that the next days most probably my crazy method is going to if the CPMs don't go down here they're going to have higher ROAS but still as as i said already it's a very good campaign and it's working very well you should definitely use it so as you can see only positive things about the advantage plus campaign you should use it you should try it and i'm using it more extensively and of course there are going to be more videos coming in the future like if you can do advantage plus with crazy method way of thinking and i will keep you updated but i think that whoever is not using it is doing a mistake you should use it let me know in the comments if you use it if you liked it and stuff and don't forget that if you want to learn more guys you can check my book or my free course and until we meet again be creative and be consistent
