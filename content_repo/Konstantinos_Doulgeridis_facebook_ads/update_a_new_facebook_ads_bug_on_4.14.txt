Hello guys, another quick update. So yesterday a lot of people launched campaigns and as we can see over here, they didn't spend anything. So go check all of your campaigns, the ones, especially the ones that you started yesterday and see if they have spent something yesterday.

If they haven't, duplicate them and relance them. As you can see here, we have no events over here. And I have also observed in this account, you can see that the purchase event has a problem over here.

We can see also here that we didn't receive any events. Another thing that I want to point out is that it has been reported to me. I haven't seen it in any of my accounts that some of the APIs have been removed.

So check also if your API integration is working properly. I will see you in a future update if something else happens.
