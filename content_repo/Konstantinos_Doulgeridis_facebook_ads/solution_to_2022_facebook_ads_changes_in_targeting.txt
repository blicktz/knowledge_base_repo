Hello guys! Remember the video that I have created about the Facebook changes on the audiences? The changes are actually here and to be honest with you it's even worse from what everyone was anticipating.

I cannot even use the word blonde for instance to target blonde women. So it's a serious change actually. I didn't expect it to be that serious but I have a small fix at least for the next two months you will be able to use some of the audiences that you were using in the past.

So let's go to my computer and show you this easy solution or this easy fix. Maybe two months more with this valuable audiences is going to be good for your business and don't forget that with this thing you are going to be able to use this interest but some people are not going to be using them so you will have less competition in these keywords okay and in these interests. So let's go to my computer let me show you this easy fix.

It's a very easy fix but I can tell you by talking with people that most people don't know it. So this is a normal campaign that I had and basically this is the blonde interest that I actually mentioned as an example before. We can see that here we can see the blonde interest and I know that this interest now has been removed but what you can do here is when you're going to create a new campaign if you create it from here you will not be able to see the blonde interest but if you take this ad set here that already has it and you duplicate it in a new campaign let's name this campaign test okay now you're going to have the interest that you want to use okay and you can still add to this campaign new stuff not by creating new ad sets but by duplicating the ad sets that you want with the interest that you actually want to use and then duplicating this interest within the new campaign that you want to create.

So as you can see here when I duplicate it in a new campaign well it's here it's actually here but if I'm going to remove it you will see that I'm not able to actually use it anymore. Load please. Okay we can see that I cannot use it anymore okay you see that the blonde interest is not there.

So a very easy fix okay you are having the interest in another campaign from the past you're just duplicating it into your new campaign you go to your ad level you're changing the creatives that you want and boom there you have it. One last note if you remember from the previous video that we have done for the audiences the changes were active from January 19 and they are going to roll out up to March 17th. So I'm guessing that this small fix you're going to be able to use it up to the March 17th.

So it's two months that you will be able to use it and then most probably these interests were not going to be there even with the duplication. If they are going to be there with a duplicate option that would be very good because we will have an alternative and we will be able to use them. Now to be honest with you I don't know if this is going to be good or bad.

In theory this audiences still exist and you will be able to use them but maybe Facebook is going to flag them and they are not going to have good results. Thank you very much guys for watching the video. I hope that it helped you.
