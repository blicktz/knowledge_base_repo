Hello Facebook Ads people! I'm Kostantinos and today we are going to talk about CPMs. How do they influence our ads?

So what are the CPMs? It's cost per 1000 impressions. Why is it important?

Because Facebook is working with impressions, it's not working with cost per click like Google is working. So when we have cost per 1000 impressions, we understand if the ads that we are running right now we are paying a lot, if it's expensive, if the marketing cost has risen all of these years and so on. If you are running ads to different countries, you can see that the CPMs vary from country to country.

It's cheaper to advertise in certain countries, it's more expensive to advertise in other countries like United States. Why? Because of the competition.

The more people advertise in a specific country or in a specific interest or in a specific niche, we have higher or lower CPMs. It really depends on how many people they are targeting, what you are targeting in a certain period of time. That being said, we know that the CPMs has risen all of these years.

The average CPMs most of the times in the United States, let's say that it's between 18 and 30 around this, depending on the niche, product, how expensive your item is and so on. And we are seeing this that it's consistently rising. Even if we have less people advertising now on Facebook because of the ice changes, we can see that the CPMs are higher.

This is because it's more difficult for people to get sales because of the competition and everything. Also, keep in your mind that the CPMs were much lower before. So it was $10 or $15 in average.

And we know that this is the reason that a lot of people are crying about Facebook and they say that it's not effective anymore and they don't want to advertise. It's because they are spoiled from what they used to have in 2015. But now the situation is different.

This is why we're talking about advertisement costs in this channel because it's not only about what Costantinos is going to say about the crazy method or something else. If the CPMs, the average CPMs are standard, okay? So I know before I even start an account if it's sustainable or not.

You need to understand the CPMs. You need to understand how much money you're going to spend in order to get a sale. And if your numbers don't add up, it means that you cannot advertise on Facebook because guess what?

The average CPMs are going to stay like this. They are not going to change unless if a lot of people are going to stop advertising on Facebook. So what you need to do and why I'm doing this video is because I'm mentioning several times that if your numbers don't work for Facebook, you need to make it work, okay?

And you need to make it work because nobody invited you on Facebook and we have also my video with the letter from Zuckerberg. Flashback! Flashback!

Dear Costantinos, please come to advertise on our platform and we will give you exactly the CPMs that you want and the return on ads that you want so that you can be happy and profitable. We promise. Yours sincerely, Mark Zuckerberg.

I'm not sure if you want to make it work. I'm not sure if you want to make it work. I'm not sure if you want to make it work.

But other than that, I need to say that the reason behind that is the CPMs. The CPMs are dictating that Facebook advertisement is expensive. We know that Facebook advertisement is expensive.

We know that we are not saying anything based on just theory or just talking about inflation and general economy. We are talking about actual numbers and data. We know from CPMs and the numbers of a company if it's sustainable or not to have sales there.

Because if you want to have a business model that you need $5 CPM in order for you to be profitable, it is not going to happen. This is why you see sometimes that I'm super straightforward and I'm saying that this is not okay, this is not okay. If you want to advertise like this, you cannot do it.

You have to adapt and you need to have a business which is going to be able to be competitive enough to compete with the others that they have fixed their numbers in order to advertise with this marketing cost. And I know that the marketing cost has increased a lot in the last years, but there are several companies that they have adapted and they are making money out of it. At the end of the day, what's your CPMs?

CPMs are very important. You can see also in a period if the CPMs are increasing, how this is impacting your ads and that you're having less ROAS in that period. You can have a sense by just monitoring the CPMs, which period is better for you, which period is worse.

If there is a period which is very bad for Facebook in general and how you're going to combat this. If you start to see less ROAS, for example, start seeing also your CPMs. Have they increased?

If they have increased, it means that this is not your fault. Can you do something about that? Not really.

If the CPMs are rising and you used to have certain CPMs and stuff, you can try with other creators and stuff to lower it down. But if this is a general thing, you can do nothing about it. Never think that you can just drop the CPMs magically just because Konstantinos will show you a strategy or someone else is going to show you a strategy.

It is not going to happen like this. You need to do ads. You need to do ads, decent ads, good ads, follow me, other people, test strategies and see what is your average CPM.

This is the number that you have and then try to adapt to it and make the actual numbers of your business to work for this CPM. That's the magic deal. Okay?

So I was actually watching the video before it got published and I think that I have some extra remarks just so that it can be more clear the situation about the CPMs. The thing is that here we're having one account which is extremely successful in the United States. Uh, very high spends daily.

Uh, just today for example spending 5k, super profitable and uh, you can see that the CPMs here is 28, 52, you know, different numbers over here. So I gave you a number of 18 to 30 something. I don't remember what, but there are a lot of cases that when the pixel is actually trained and we have an account that is, uh, working very well.

And of course, if you adapt your numbers, the CPMs then are going to drop because it's working better and you have a better deal. So the numbers that I'm mentioning are just the average numbers. And most of the times the numbers that people are going to see if they are starting now on the platform.

Of course, there are other accounts like this one, for example, that are having much lower CPMs, but this just for your information is an established company, which is advertising for the past eight years and it has a crazy powerful pixel. It's also a company that's having crazy organic traffic. It's advertising on every other platform.

So it's not necessary that you're not going to have the CPMs. If you're having a business, which is doing marketing in several platforms, it has very good deals, a very passionate audience that is buying again and again, but I'm talking a little bit more in the video about the average CPMs for most of the people and not for the super trade account. Because if in this channel, we're talking only about the super crazy good accounts, then there is no point for everyone else who is struggling and they're trying to find help with the video.

So yes, you can have $3 CPM. You can have $8, $5. Okay.

It's not like it will never happen. But if you're a beginner, if you have a new pixel, if you're struggling, having good results and consistency and spending good spends with your ad account because it's working and it's profitable, then you're most probably going to be in the range of the average CPMs. I'm just making this video just to explain that yes, there are accounts that are working very well and they can be extremely profitable even with higher CPMs or there are other accounts that are having lower CPMs.

Okay. I hope that this is going to help you understand more everything that I'm explaining in the actual video. If you want to learn more about Facebook ads, don't forget that you can check my free course and you can check my book.
