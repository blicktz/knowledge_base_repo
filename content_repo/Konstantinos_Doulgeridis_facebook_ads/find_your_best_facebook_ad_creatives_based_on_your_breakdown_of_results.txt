Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about the breakdown of results which is finally back which means that we can break even down our sales and see where they are coming from. For those of you that you don't know it, I have a very old video that I'm saying that the breakdown of results is gone. Now it's coming back.

I guess this is part of the changes that we have with Facebook which I'm going to make a completely different video with the 28 days attribution coming back and now we already have the 20 days attribution if you want to compare actually but it's coming also back we will be able to use it in an ad set level and now we're having the breakdown of results that we can actually use again. What's the breakdown of results? We're going to go on my pc to show you in an actual account what informations you can get out of it but let me tell you that it's a very useful tool.

So what we had until now, not until now, the previous year because before that we still had the breakdown of results, is that we would able only with dynamic creative ads to see which creatives have worked the best but we were not able to analyze country, gender, different age groups, placements, what is working and what doesn't work. So this is back again. Before that we only had the actual spend that could indicate if something was working but if our campaign wasn't doing well we were not able to see which of these things was actually working with good ROAS.

Without further ado let's go to my pc to show you how you can actually sort out which creatives are good because we're going to recap also that but also which kind of placement, gender, age is working for your ads so that maybe you can duplicate your campaign and focus more to that. So I have prepared to show you one of my campaigns over here. As we can see it has a lot of data.

I'm just watching the last 30 days. We are on the range of spending 7.5k with this campaign alone, 11.3 ROAS, 85k revenue. Now we have some over here.

This one has 133 sales, 141 so they're the ideal candidates. They have enough data in order to break down the results and let me show you how we're going to do it. Until now what we had it was actually that we can come here as you can see and we can break down the results when this is a dynamic campaign of course we can break down the results and we can have an image over here and see which one is the one that is actually working better.

Here it says that it's a video. This one is actually our leading ad and we can see that you cannot see it because I'm going to hide it but here it's the same, here's the same, it's always the same video that is actually winning. The other thing that we could do is that we could come and because it's dynamic ad we could break down the text to see what is working.

From my experience on the text I can tell you that the results are a little bit mixed. Over here we can see that for example this one which is the second one okay it's very close to the first one it's actually here first and this one it's actually here. So with the copies it's actually a mix okay it's never a clear winner especially the targeting it's completely divided it's the copies do nothing which actually makes me think a lot of how okay we can have two conclusions here either we can say that the copies were very good so all of them worked or we can say that they are not influencing so much as the creative is influencing but there are a lot of people that are super focused on the copies which they are going to disagree with that.

I'm not super focused on the copy I'm super focused on the strategies on the creative. I think that the creative on facebook and instagram is the king. And then we can break down even more the results and see what is happening on the headline.

See which headline it's actually doing better. Again here I can tell you that they're different. You know something?

I'm not going to hide the headlines so that you can see the difference it's it's going to be okay. You will understand that it's going to be different results and you can take an idea. And then uh we can I can show you for example the call to action.

In this case uh we can see that the shop now it's winning heavily. I think that in several cases you have to test also the learn more because I can tell you that for some reason it's working better from uh the shop now. In other words you're losing nothing of putting both of them and see what is going to work but this is also something that you can break down.

Now this is something that we had in 2022 and it wasn't removed. What it was removed it was actually and I can prove it to you by going for example instead of this period let's go to August okay. So if we come here and we clear the breakdowns and we come here and we do by delivery this time and we put the age we can see that what we had before over here we had only an indication of the spend.

So we could understand by the spend if our campaign was successful what was working and what wasn't working. So we can see here that most probably if we have positive ROAS and most of the spend is on the 35 to 34 age range then we can assume that this is the age that it's working uh the best. But for me this wasn't enough okay and I was really missing the breakdown of results because you can take some very good understanding and also this is our job we are here to analyze more and more the ad accounts.

So I'm going to go to the last 30 days because of course it's not going to show you the results of the previous because it's it's now being introduced again. So let's see the last 30 days. We can see that now in the last 30 days we can actually see how many sales we actually have and look at this look at the spends.

So look this spend with this spend in our eyes it can actually be something that it can look similar but look how different it is it's 14 to 33 and this one is 61 to 33. We can see this one and we can say okay this is not a big difference it's 800 to 1,100 uh 100 it's not a lot but look it's actually much more many sales and actually we can see also the cost per purchase over here. The cost per purchase on the 35 to 44 is actually on 18.5 and the one below which is also having some good ROAS it's having 10.49 it's actually which is all of them are acceptable except from this one okay but all of these are acceptable and we can see that in this one it's having actually higher cost per purchase.

Now why wouldn't now that we have this kind of results we can take this exact campaign as it is and run it only for 35 to 44 and see what kind of results we're going to have. Is it a hot pocket that is strong enough to hold another campaign? This is one thing that we can actually see from here.

So this is the way that you're going to analyze it having the purchases over here seeing the cost per purchase seeing what is working of course i need to point out that you should do this with enough data because if we come here we can see a campaign with 17 sales for example i don't consider this enough data in order for you to take any serious decisions but if you have campaigns like this that they have enough data like 50 sales 60 sales in an asset and you can actually breaking break it down you can actually take some very good guidance on what you can do as a next campaign so that you can scale and in this channel we are all about having a stable campaign which is working then doing another campaign on top of that another campaign on top of that but trying to actually exploit what is working and actually scale by using it either with a crazy method or with whatever. So another thing here that i want to mention is that instead of except from the age we can see the gender let's see what kind of results we are having here we are having most of the sales coming from male but for me this is not enough results to just exclude the one or the other i think we should use both if we break down by the way if we go here on the age what i would do is that i would go and i would use only these two so i would go from 25 to 44. Do you understand how big this is because you can come here you can break down the results and you can understand where you should spend more or if you can do another campaign that you can scale so that you can address to this audience faster because it's working so another thing that we can test is of course the country if you have several countries but here it's only united kingdom in this specific case and then we can see which platform has actually worked let's analyze this we can see that the platform that worked very well it's 110.

that's actually shocking to me you see these are things that you couldn't understand if you don't see them the ages that they have worked their ages that most of the times they're on instagram also i know that this brand has very good creatives creatives that they are very nice and they go very well with instagram it's a company in the interior design it's actually shocking me that facebook is actually working better than instagram i would explain that i would expect that instagram would be the leader over here here and the other thing that we can do is i don't know if i have to do this because most probably i will have to start saying things about the automatic placements again anyway i will do it so we have the placements here you know my problem with placements if you're watching this channel and guess what the facebook feed is the best the instagram feed is the best instagram stories is the next instagram reels is having some sales uh only two and then we are having some scattered sales this is also facebook feed this is feed in marketplace one sale in facebook stories one sale search results two sales explore in stream marketplace you see that all of those are not having any sales do you see they're not having any sales and over here when we come we can see which is again the thing that i'm saying and back in the days i could prove it because i was showing this for example 46 cents actually do you want to do this okay let's do it uh let's analyze so let's take the one so we have instagram explorer it spent 15.04 plus we have 9.42 9.42 on in stream we have 4.64 plus 1.39 plus 1.21 plus 0.98 plus 0.46 plus 0.32 plus so i'm not going to even mention the other ones that they don't have good results because at least they have a sale for example here in marketplace spent 30 but i'm not going because it has a sale so here we have 33 dollars that they were spent for no reason okay this is the reason that i'm telling you that we should not actually do automatic placements especially in the dynamic ads in advantage plus something that we cannot avoid but it's fine at the end of the day i'm fine with this because i'm still getting results i'm getting the results that i want and if at the end of the day they want to spend a little bit more it's fine i'm against facebook pushing the concept of automatic placements because they are doing it purely for money they know that the other categories are working and this is the way for me that i was able to prove it all the time to facebook representatives when i was talking and then the breakdown of results was actually removed but now it's actually back and i can see that i'm right the only thing that i can see which has changed a little bit is that in some accounts i see some sales on facebook reels okay i could see some facebook reels sales which is also good because it means that now that i can see the sales i can understand that facebook reels are not spending for no reason they're just having also some sales but this is only going to change my perspective to say that you're going to use facebook feed instagram feed instagram stories facebook stories and instagram reels nothing else is actually working even if you see one sale or marketplace or the other places it's it's nothing and now let me break you down the full conspiracy theory just because i love doing it every time so if we do 33.46 which is one ad set and then we multiply this with 10 ad sets that we have in this campaign it's 334 dollars this is for 30 days in this campaign alone we spent an extra of 334 okay and if we multiply this with 10 campaigns we spent an extra of 3 346 usd in this account with the spend that we have which is some something like in this account we have we have something like i believe a 60k per month so the 3k out of the 3.3k out of the 60k was spent for no reason in stupid automatic placements okay and if we multiply this with the million ad accounts that they exist okay you can understand how much money facebook is making out of this automatic placement thing and why they still continue pushing it just so that they can keep benefiting out of that now again it's not something that i'm being bothered as long as i make uh as long as i'm having good results and stuff it's just the fact that it's always this stupid discussion about automatic placements when now we also have again the breakdown of results and we can see that it's actually not working with all the placement there are specific placements that it's working and i don't understand why facebook is pushing so much for it so this is everything that you can do over here you can break down by platform and device for example you can see if you have to run it on facebook or desktop and stuff i can tell you that 99.9 of the cases all the sales are coming from mobile devices they're just not desktop sales most of the time android android ipad desktop you see desktop is having some sales but it's not a lot let's see how many it has desktop it has only six sales most of the sales came from iphone and android by the way after the ios changes seeing so many sales with iphone devices it's very good i'm pretty happy with that because we know that a lot of people have opted out which means that facebook is working much better in the optimization level and just so you know the pixel is going to be removed on 2024 i'm going to make another video about that and the api only is going to stay which means that facebook has actually calibrated and made the reporting much much better and this is why we're able now to have the breakdown of results and actually being able to analyze it further now if you want to do it this to your ad accounts you have to understand that you can do it for the last 30 days because this is the period that they have actually released it so that you can break down the results if you want to go back you won't be able to do it for the previous months before that and you can do it from now on the other thing that i want to tell you is that you can do the same thing with the post ids with normal ads you can do it with dynamic ads you can do with all the ads that you have and you can break down the results over here so that you can see devices age gender country different placements and of course if you're using dynamic ads something that hasn't changed is that you can break down and you can see which creative was the best which text which headline and which call to action was the best that's all i had for you i think it's very good news very informative from the part of facebook to give us all of this data because just right now the way that i see it over here i can take this campaign as it is run it with a crazy method and just use the specific ages only the placements that i have seen that they had some results and use also both of the genders because i have seen that it's working very well even i can go and i can focus on facebook only because i have seen that it had the most sales or if i think that something is wrong like we do with advantage plus that we remove one of the ads that they have been working and we are doing another campaign with all of the others because we think that maybe something is going to work i can do another campaign that i'm going to focus only on instagram for example this time because i truly believe and this is actually something that came to my mind right now and i'm going to actually do it and see what kind of results i can get only on instagram this time because i think that i'm actually spending maybe too much on facebook alone this is also another thing which is going to help you scale and break down your funnel further this is something that i used to do a lot in 2021 i was watching if something was working very well on one platform i was doing it also on the other platform and i was trying to see what kind of results i would get from there and let me tell you that it's also very good because scaling and having massive settings on all of your ads it's something but also when you are able to break down those results and scale with more laser focused targeting to whatever it has worked it will help you scale even more and i'm so happy that the breakdown of results are bad you can understand from the from the thumbnail and the previous angry video that i made about the removal of breakdown of results that i wasn't happy with it and now they're back again and i'm super happy with that that's all i had now you can take whatever you can see that is working put it in a new campaign and focus more with bigger budget with crazy method with whatever you actually want you have the tools in this channel we explain everything you have the tools you have the crazy method we analyze everything in a technical level and i hope that it's going to help you i hope that you are going to have better ads now that you can actually focus in what is really really really working don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book or my free course and until we meet again guys be creative and because you stand
