I have done is I have done an extensive test on 10 ad accounts and I was doing with the same creative same structure a CBO Advantage Plus with one ad set again but a CBO and then I was doing an ABO Advantage Plus like the old one and I have seen that in 7 out of 10 campaigns the results were much, much better.

I'm talking about one ROAS and in the other one having two ROAS. Now, given the fact that these are different periods and stuff you can never be sure that this is the truth but since then I'm telling you and I'm proposing to you and I have started doing it. I'm not doing any more CBO Advantage Plus campaigns.

I'm doing ABO Advantage Plus campaigns. The reason that I believe that this is happening is because the mechanism of CBO and ABO is different. We have seen that from the day that we were doing CBO campaigns and ABO Advantage Plus campaigns when they came.

We could see that we were working on the ad level on the ABO with dominant ads. On the CBO we were working on the ad set level and always we had the same ads winning over there. And the difference is very simple.

Basically when you have a CBO it's distributing the budget to the ad sets and from the ad sets to the ads. And when you're having an ABO it's distributing the budget to the ads. So you don't have the intermediate of the ad sets.

So in the first case you have to optimize and focus on the ad set level and on the second case you have to optimize on the ad level. Maybe I haven't found yet a way of optimizing a CBO Advantage Plus. Maybe I need to find a way.

But right now my comfort zone and I'm having better results by observing and by just testing the same campaigns and the same creatives and the same everything with ABO Advantage Plus. So if you're having worse results just try of course relances and all of that but try to see and split test CBO with ABO Advantage Plus and see which one is working better than you. Now, based on the previous discussion that we had about the gurus and all of that and because I'm tired of all of this situation, today on the podcast and most probably I will make a video about it, I will start playing a much bigger game then since I'm not recognized as a good channel.

So here I have two print screens of right now. You can see that the month is May 1st to May 20, one of my really, really bigger accounts. You can see that the spend is on 2.2, 1.88 rows and having 3.8 million.

and there is a picture of the previous month on April just so that you can understand that we're spending here between 3.5 and 3.8 million every month. 1.87 and 6.4 came on revenue for the month of April. I need to say this.

There are a lot of people that they say that they spend millions and all of that including me and the point is are they proving it? are they going to show you a live ad account? Here are two print screens.

I'm going to make a live video showing this thing because all of this bullshit of people talking and not proving anything without real ad accounts and just talking about theory, it has to stop. Okay? So, I'm going to do a video about this ad account.

I'm going to show it to you because the reason that I want to show you this is because a lot of times people talk about consolidation, watching the frequency. If you have two frequency or more, this means that you're retargeting people and all of that. And I want to show you that in big ad accounts and in ad accounts when you're scaling and all of that, these things are not there.

These are very nice stories to say about small ad accounts and consolidations going to hurt you and all of that. But I would like to show you a bigger picture of a bigger ad account over here and actually prove to you that all the things that they say, they are coming from a deep knowledge from ad accounts that they're spending a lot. For example, over here in these campaigns, we're having a frequency of four, five, six, because it's a high spend.

Do we care about it? No. Do we care about the individual ROAS over here?

For example, on the first picture, we can see we have one with 1.57 ROAS. Do we care about the individual ROAS over here of one campaign that is not doing well? No, because we work with average results as I'm teaching in my videos.

Do we have one or two campaigns spending all of this money? No. A lot of people will come, of course, it's 3.8 million.

How can you spend it in one campaign? This is what they are teaching. And when you are telling them all of that, they will tell you, yes, if you have another country, you can run more campaigns and all of that.

The whole theory here and the methods that I'm teaching is do a lot of campaigns with different creatives. Use different Instagram accounts. Use different sponsorships.

Use different creatives all the time presenting a product from different perspectives. This is how you are going to be able to scale. this is a bigger account of mine.

This is actually my biggest one. In order for you to... But you know, I don't like to show this account because then you're going to think that these things are working on the bigger.

I'm showing you all of this also on the smaller accounts that they are working. But if you see it on the bigger picture, you understand also that it's getting credibility. And if I was going to show immediately this account, then you're going to believe that, okay, this is something that is working on bigger spends.

I'm not spending 3.5 or 3.8 million. So I cannot relate to that. So I'm not going to follow it.

That's why. I decided to show it so that, you know, whoever doesn't believe it, they can be convinced from something that is working on bigger scale and on a smaller scale. I know that some of you, you are not going to relate with that and you will think that this is an exceptional account which is different and all of that.

But over here, we can see that all of the things that I'm teaching are working. And I'm showing you all of these things also on smaller accounts. So I think that there is no doubt that at least for me, for my students and for many other people, these things are working and you just have to find a proper way of actually implementing it into your ad account.

One thing that I'm sure that is going to work in any ad account is that if your product and your offer is working, you are going to scale much faster and much more efficient by just doing different campaigns with different creatives. is talking about one campaign and just throwing again inside other creatives, other creatives, this is for maintain. You are going to scale by just doing campaigns with different creatives.

Now, I see a lot of comments on my YouTube channel that they talk about, okay, how can I scale though with one creative and one ad. You have to understand that if you are thinking like this and you are like this, then eventually, most probably, Facebook is going to stop you and you are not going to scale. But if you are a serious person and you have, I am not going to call you just a serious person, I am going to call you a person that is having the power, the personnel, the connections, whatever you want to say about it.

If you can do it with different creatives and different campaigns and your offer is good and your product is good, then you are going to be able to scale. Okay. That's all I had about the theory today and sorry for my little, you know, rant on the beginning.

Let's start here with questions. Again, if you start the campaign with also, since we are doing that every now for 71 podcasts, I want to say that I have never seen another podcast answering actually all of the f***ing questions that they get into their channel so that people can have some clarity. All of them, they are just replying to, hey, thank you very much for your content with a thank you and then they direct them to the course.

I have never directed you to the course. I tell you, okay, what's all the things and I'm trying to answer all of the questions. The only thing that they have done is to split the podcast in the half and just have some people just to help a little bit with this.

But, you know, with the Patreon thing and everything, the subscription every month, which is only $20 also. $20? Is it $18?

Which is only $18. So, I just don't see how we are not recognized as a good channel for Facebook ads. I just don't get it.

Anyway, it shouldn't annoy me that much because at least I'm seeing a lot of you supporting me so it's totally fine, I guess. Let's go. If you start the campaign with 100 budget, is it better to start with 5 creatives like in the video or more is better?

Thanks for the reply. So he's talking about running normal, not running dynamic ads. So you have two options.

Either you're going to run dynamic ads with 5 creatives, dynamic creative ads, or you're going to run 5 ads per ad set, which is totally fine. My limit is 3 to 5. I don't like to go on more than 5.

Next one. How long will you keep the second leading ad that has good draws so that the other ad had the chance? So if we are talking about the second leading ad that has good draws and one leading ad that doesn't, I guess in the first 48 hours or more 72 hours depending on the AOV of the product, you can decide if you're going to close it and give a chance to the second.

It's very difficult guys to explain by text, optimization of advanced class and CBO. That's why I'm trying to make so many videos to explain it to you. But yeah, a safe period.

It's going to be 72 hours. Sometimes I do it faster. On 48 hours, I close a leading ad which is bad so that I can give chance to the second one to become a leading ad.

Later, I'm noticing also that a lot of times when you have a leading ad and another ad is taking some good results, I can see that we have a swift initially at the start. And maybe another one is going to start becoming the leading ad because it's having better results. So would you wait for Facebook to do that?

I wouldn't. But sometimes when I see that the swift is happening, I give it time. I'm not going to close the second one because maybe with less budget, it's going to be profitable.

Next one. At 6.15 you say some ads will be the volume and some will be the quality that will bring your ROAS. My question.

Why does the volume matter? For example, we have a campaign with two ads ads with great ROAS and two ads ads with really bad ROAS. Why not just one close the two ads ads with really bad ROAS and lower the campaign budget like you recommend based on the two remaining ads that yesterday spent?

Then duplicate the campaign. In other words, why not get volume through more campaigns with better ROI? Now, there are two types of people.

There are the types of people that they want ROAS with Facebook ads and the type of people that they do want volume and growth and all of that. If you are in the category of the people that you want ROAS, be happy with your small spend and get the ROAS that you want and that's it. Okay?

So, yes, what you can do is you can just go see two ads that they're getting instead of, let's say, that you're spending 200-300 and these two ads are getting just 30-40, lower your budget 30-40 and try to see if this is going to continue happening, giving you good ROAS. The mistake that people do is that they close the other ads and they don't change the budget. So, when the other ads are spending also a lot, they are losing also the ROAS.

Secondly, there are people that they want volume and they want growth. For these people, you have to work in the way that I'm telling you, with average results. Because if you don't, in the previous example that I showed you with the campaigns, if you don't work with average results, most probably you're going to touch one thing here, one thing there and so on.

And then you're going to ruin your average results because you're just closing campaigns that they give you volume instead of the ROAS. There are going to be some campaigns that they will give you volume, some campaigns that they are going to give you ROAS. The same thing is happening within a CBO campaign.

So, it depends on what you want to do. When you are having two ads inside and you are lowering the budget to those, that means that you stop the optimization and you want to move on with this. And you can try to duplicate and try to see if you can have again another two and so on.

But still, it's a very slow process. At the end of the day, after three, four campaigns, you will spend 100, which is not even the whole budget of what you were spending before. In an example that I gave, like let's say that you spend 200, for example, and you lower the budget to 30, 40 with these two ad set, that they have good ROAS.

And then you do another one, another one. At the end of the day, you will end up with three, four campaigns. And most probably all of these campaigns are going to still sell from each other.

So the ROAS is not going to be so good. Last thing that we need to mention here, and then another bonus, is that the last thing is is you need to understand that the more you scale, the more the ROAS are dropping. And you have to calculate your numbers and be okay with the number that you want to reach in order for you to have growth and also not losing money.

This is what most people do. Meta is not a platform that has been built in order to give you good ROAS. It's a platform that has been built in order to give you volume.

It can give you good ROAS on lower spends, but you cannot have both. Okay, so it depends on what you want to do and how you want to treat your business. Last thing and the most important thing.

Let's say that in this example over here, you have four ad sets. Okay, and you see that two of them, they're having bad ROAS, but they're taking all of the budget. And you have another two, which are having good ROAS, but they're taking a small amount of budget.

Even if you go and you check the amount of spend that these two good ads have, good ROAS ads have, it doesn't mean that they were going to get this kind of ROAS if they were alone on a campaign with the budget that they spent. Because the fact that they are in a campaign, which is a CBO, and there is, for example, $150 distributed to the two ads that they don't do well, and the $50 that is left is actually giving them good ROAS. Because it doesn't mean that in a CBO with $50 alone, without having the other $150 distributed to the two other ads that they are doing bad, it means that you're going to get the same results.

Most probably you are not. Because also, over here, the balances that the CBO is keeping, maybe they're helping these ad sets to actually get ROAS that most probably they wouldn't get in another way. And that's the problem.

That's the problem because in a CBO, when you lower the budget to $50, this doesn't mean that the ROAS of this campaign, which is good, is going to stay as it is. Most probably it's going to be ruined. I'm not even mentioning the fact that if you don't lower the spend, it's going to be even worse.

But even if you do it like this, I will tell you that most probably it won't keep the ROAS that it had while the others were there. So if in average you're doing well, you are not trying to disturb this balance over here by doing things here and there. You're just accepting that you're getting in average a good result and you are happy with it because you are getting growth and you're being profitable at the same time.

I hope that it makes sense. For me, it does. Because I'm noticing this all the time on CBO campaigns that yeah, okay, you lower the budget from $200 to $40, but these ad sets are not going to continue having the same ROAS that they had because they were just getting these ROAS.

It's a fluke, you know, it's not the reality. But when you see, for example, a high spent ad set getting three ROAS, for example, this is the truth because it's getting the full spend. The other one is just taking the leftovers and it's having some ROAS.

It's not the same at all and you cannot optimize on that way because Facebook is not built in a way of giving you very good ROAS all the time or while you are scaling, okay? It's a platform which is built so that it can give you volume. So, next one, but it's totally acceptable if you want to have a small spend and very good ROAS.

Totally acceptable. I have done it with companies that they have stock issues and all of that. I believe we have done a video recently about that and I was showing you how these companies have not been influenced at all on the bad periods because on the bad periods, they were having already, instead of having two, on the break event, two ROAS, for example, were having five because they didn't want to scale because they didn't have the stock.

okay, they dropped to four but they were still profitable. But if you are on two ROAS all the time and you are playing between the verge of growth and being unprofitable, then eventually in a bad period, most probably you are going to be hurt. Next one.

How would you promote a Facebook event? What type of campaign? The business doesn't have a website yet and is looking for people to join the event and pay by by bank transfer.

There's engagement campaign with event option but the people it brings don't seem to be very interested. So, I don't have a website. I want people to pay me with a bank transfer and actually, that's a lot of money.

So, I'm not sure what they want to do, I don't want to do anything. But, you know, you just want everything, you know, without doing any effort. What I will do though in this case is that I would try to convince them to have something like options on επariavé ofereσε apoyo.

ΈЖ thinking, το που δεν είναι ισπωρίζονται και ανάου αρκετής να κάνουμε προ 모 union. Ν votre définitive πράγμα... 100 budget, especially the 100 budget.

Each time I increase Advanced Plus to 100 or launch New Advanced Plus with 100 budget, so volatile. Is there any solution? The solution is to go with other creatives as we said or to realize that maybe your funnel is not so strong, maybe your creatives are not so strong, maybe your offers is not so strong.

Okay, for example, let me give you one example. Let's say that I'm selling this for 50. Okay, just because.

Okay, these are my numbers and stuff. If I manage to make this item selling for 30, that means that I will get more people. Okay, I can convince more people to buy it.

That means that you will do another Advanced Plus and another Advanced Plus and it's going to work and it's going to be profitable for you. So maybe it's your offer. Maybe it's the targeting that you are doing and the needs that you are actually referring to.

Maybe it's the creative which can convince X amount of people and you need another thing. It can be so many things, but at the end of the day, never stop trying, first of all. But don't just focus on just duplicating the same thing again and again if you see that it's not working.

Try other things, try other products, try to expand in another country, try other things. Now, in such small budgets as yours, like 100 or 100, I'm having the guess over here that you're not having a strong offer. Okay, because you know, if you're just spending 100 and the next 100 you are unprofitable, that means that you're not having a strong offer, a strong product or whatever that may be or a strong, not a strong pixel yet.

Next one. Mistake hashtag two. Is there where I'm getting confused?

At times, you do recommend closing ad sets and at other times you say do not close them. Is it that you always close them when you are initially optimizing the campaigns? Ah, okay, so I see.

So there are videos of mine that I'm showing CBO optimization or advanced plus optimization where I'm optimizing. Sometimes I'm going to end up with some ad sets or sometimes I'm going to end up with one or two and I will lower the budget in a CBO or in an advanced plus. After that point, after the point that I have actually optimized it, I'm not going to touch it anymore.

So it's the initial process that optimize and close to get it where you want and be sure that the ad sets or the ads that you're leaving inside are good and then you don't touch it anymore. The other thing that you might see on videos is that I might have one campaign which is running for eight months. If it's going bad for seven days, I'm not going to close it immediately because I'm working with average results as I said earlier.

So I'm not going to take... I'm really sorry that I'm confusing you. But it's two different cases.

Optimizing initially on the first 10-20 days, I don't know, it doesn't matter. Or having a campaign which is fully optimized and then you don't touch it anymore, you work with other campaigns. Next one.

Konstantinos, understood, thank you. I want to clarify one more point. In the countries of the former USSR, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, lead form are used in 90% of cases.

By the way, I think you cannot advertise anymore in Russia and Belarus. To be honest with you guys, I'm doing this for 11 years now. I have never had...

I had clients from Ukraine, Russia and all of that, but I have never had run any ads on Russia or Belarus. Never ever. Kazakhstan, no.

Ukraine, yes, I have run ads on Ukraine. The thing is that I think you cannot do it anymore, but let's see what he says. When I started running ads in Poland, where no one does this, initially targeting the store with the goal of sales, I was getting expensive results.

Later, switching to leads, I started getting cheaper and well confirmed results. Metrics like CPM, CTR and CPC were also significantly lower. You cannot compare the cost per click on a lead generation campaign with a sales campaign with a purchase event.

It's not the same thing to compare them. Okay. Having created a store on Shopify over the past four months, I have been getting results that are at best twice as expensive.

And although this is not important, CPM rates are significantly higher. Could it be that the lead generation goal itself is much cheaper and with a small budget, this option is better? Lead generation for sure is cheaper.

And you cannot compare pairs with apples. Okay. You cannot compare the cost per lead with the cost per purchase.

It's two different things. But what you can do or the cost per click in a lead campaign and the cost per click in a purchase campaign. What you can do though is this.

Do a campaign with purchases. See how many sales you are getting. You have a cost per purchase.

Then do a lead generation campaign. Take all the leads, try to sell to them and try to see if they're converting. And those that are going to convert, make another cost per purchase over here and then compare them.

Whichever of these two things is more effective and you're making more money with, just follow it with the majority of the budget, like 80% and do the other 20% with the other normal, not the other normal, with the other style of campaign. I hope it helps. Hi Constantinos, thanks for the video.

I have been running a normal CBO abroad with new DCTs every week. Spent over 20k so far and decent results. Well done.

Is it worth me creating an advanced plus campaign as well or keep running the one campaign? First of all, you are not going to touch this campaign because it's working. There's no doubt about that.

Secondly, you are going to to go and try an advanced plus campaign and see and compare the CPMs and also the results. You're going to see if it's working for you. So you're going to do it as a second campaign.

Don't forget that the ultimate goal of each other account is to reach the point that we're going to be able to do broad targeting campaigns. So it's good that you do a CBO abroad. You have to test also an advanced plus and actually try to compare if you're getting worse results or not.

And then you will see if you like the style of the advanced plus, if you like working with them and so on. But for sure, yeah, you have to test everything in another account. You cannot just exclude things.

On the other hand, if your budget is limited and you don't have more money, don't test anything else. Just work with what you have. Hi, first thing congrats with Baby and thanks for the great content.

Thank you very much. And guys, thank you very much for all of these nice wishes that I had for the baby. Yeah, I don't know how to thank you because saying thank you for a video, it has nothing to do with saying thank you for the baby.

I really thank you all for being so positive with this stage of my life. I really appreciate you all. Also, I have some questions.

I came across a theory about launching ads if you want to test new niches. First, you create a general store with products from different categories. Once you understand which category performs better, you can focus on that one.

What do you think? Also, a second question, if it's possible to combine niches like home goods and pet products for a pixel. So, you came across a very old strategy about dropshipping.

So, there is one major change that happened and I'm seeing now dropshippers having a completely different approach. I will discuss a little bit, I will talk a little bit about this. So, first of all, I think you understand I'm drinking coffee because I'm not sleeping very well for the nights.

but yesterday she was good. I actually slept a lot. So, the thing is this.

These are old, outdated, general store dropshipping. So, what was the theory? I'm having a general store with many things just tossed around and I'm just testing products there.

If something is working, I move it in one store because I'm going to have better marketing there, focus to the product and do train my pixel easier and all of that. Now, why is this thing not working anymore? Because the CPMs are higher.

So, back in the day we could have much lower CPMs like in 2017, 16, 15. We had two lower CPMs and it was easy for us to have a pixel which was going to have sales across many niches and all of that. So, right now it's not ideal because you need to pay much more and having a pixel which is making this more difficult because it's different niches, it's making it not profitable.

You have to understand that there are people that they made a lot of money with dropshipping and using all of that and when they stopped making money they started teaching all of that so that they can make money from the courses. Now, I can see, I'm talking with many dropshippers okay and I'm in several groups where I help group of dropshippers even if I don't like it as a model. There are a lot of people that they have success.

I'm going to admit that but they are not doing any more this stupid set. They are just doing other things. They are doing clothing for example okay.

So, they go to AlexBiz and stuff and they take different clothing and they try to sell clothing. They go to higher ticket items. They don't go to these small price comfort zone items.

They try to have higher ticket items and they are focusing a lot on Google Ads. They are not focusing initially so much on Facebook Ads. They are doing so many things differently from what they used to do.

They are having private inventory a lot of times and all of that. Okay, so what I want you to understand is that it's good for you to research but it's better for you to have... I know okay I'm your filter you're going to ask me but I would expect from you to understand after so many back and forth with questions and answers that this is not the thing that it can work anymore with the CPFs that we have.

It used to work and having two different pixels with home goods and pet products even if you manage to have a store like this I want you to understand that eventually you will train a pixel which is going to just look for people that they like also pet products and home goods or it's going to focus in only one which is your best seller for example. Okay, these are drop shipping things and if you don't do drop shipping or you know just don't follow them because they don't work anymore as they as you think that they are. Okay and also someone showing you a website for example oh my god look the money and stuff you need to see how much he spent you need to see if it is a drop shipping store maybe it's another store.

Okay what if I for example let's say I wanted to start selling drop shipping courses and I was starting showing print screens of Shopify from my legit customers with real brands okay. Don't believe everything that you see anything that you see on the internet and on youtube. People are going to do a lot of things to convince you and take money from you.
