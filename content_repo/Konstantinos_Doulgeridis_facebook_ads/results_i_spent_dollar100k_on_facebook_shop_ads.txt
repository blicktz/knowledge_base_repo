Hello guys! So one of my clients some months ago took a very big credit in order for Facebook to test the shop ads. Now, what are the shop ads?

The shop ads are when you're having a shop within Facebook or Instagram and Facebook wants you to push traffic there in order to actually convert there instead of going to your own store. It's working like a catalog and it's having inside all of your products. I'm not going to teach you how to do a shop because of the results that you're going to see here, but this doesn't mean that this is not going to be a thing that's going to improve and later is going to be better.

For example, the marketplace we know that on Facebook is working very well. Now, the shop is having a shop within Facebook, okay? It's like the way that we're doing lead generation, okay?

We're doing lead generation with forms or by sending people to a landing page in order to receive the lead there. And we know that because of the loss of data, because with what happened on iOS, Facebook is trying to keep more and more people within the platform to finish everything in order to be able to track better what is the final outcome. So, this is another try from Facebook to try to close the deals and keep the data within the Facebook platform, because when it goes outside of that, it's being closed or badly reported.

So, this is the concept of the shops and because they wanted to actually start tests, they have also the option to run ads that they're going to target people and send people to your shop within Facebook or Instagram shop within Facebook and instead of sending them to your actual store. Now, for this specific client, the amount that they gave us for some months, two months, it was 100K in order to test. You have to understand that they limited me a lot in the things that I could do.

And just for the sake of the conversation, let me tell you that in order for you to do this kind of ads, you need to go to the Commerce Manager over here from the menu. And then you're picking the shop that you have created and has all of your products inside. Keep in mind that if you have a lot of products, in order for you to create a shop, it's a very big job.

And you need to have a personnel that's going to work for that. And then you go here on the ads and you have the option to actually create traffic ads or dynamic ads. Okay.

So, the way that we created it, a Facebook representative came and we created the campaign together. It's super simple. It's not like you can do something.

You have your products which is coming from a catalogue. You're running DPA ads here with a catalogue. You have your tracking which is correct over there.

And then you create your ad which is something that is super basic. You're just picking the correct ad account that you want to use. And then you're creating a very simple campaign catalogue sales.

Like the way that you're creating a catalogue campaign and we all know how to do it. Okay. It's very limited in some features.

It's not like you can put anything that you want. And in my case, they didn't even let me to use different interests. Okay.

So, if we see here on this campaign, the only thing that I have done is one ad over here, which started on October 11 and finished at December 6th. At this point, I would like to explain a couple of things. I do know that the test was conducted between October and December of 2021, which by the way were considered good months in terms of results.

And some of you would say that maybe now shops are working better after so many months of Facebook improving them. The reason I decided to show this video now is because Facebook gave us another 375k to test as a credit. And the test is already running and will finish in 60 days of total runtime.

This is why I made this video now and I will create another follow-up video after the end of the second test. For your info, so far it has spent around 120k with 0.4 ROAS. So we can assume that it's still bad to run Facebook shop ads.

We had our catalog here with an open broad targeting. That's it. Not even targeting for the niche or anything.

At the end of the day, it's their money. They... It's not their money because they don't give actually the money.

It's money that is being spent within the platform. But anyway, at the end of the day, this is what we need to have over here. We have manual placements.

We did some placements over here. And 7 days after click, this is what they proposed. That's it.

Nothing more than that, okay? So don't think that this is a super sophisticated campaign, but this is what they proposed us to do. Now, let's go and let's analyze the results a little bit, okay?

Out of this 100k spent, I need to clarify also that these results that you're seeing over here, it's not coming only from the shop within Facebook. A lot of results, as you can see here, it says, these results may not include conversions from people who opt out of tracking on 14.5 and stuff. But these are also sales that are coming from the actual store because some people might click here, go to the shop and then they go to the store.

And from the shop within Facebook. And we can understand this because we are having this here, okay? It says, on Facebook purchases.

These are the purchases that happened within the shop, but the majority of the sales actually, almost a double, came almost let's say 60% came from the actual store purchases, okay? These are store purchases and these are shop purchases within Facebook. We can see that the results are very bad, okay?

It's actually a bad campaign. We spent 100k, the return answer was 0.68. For us it's free, you know?

It's free revenue, okay? It's a revenue of 67k that came like this. But at the end of the day, we were not convinced to do our own shop ads in order to produce results like this.

Definitely something which is super interesting. I must say that it's not working very well, but this is what is happening with all the Facebook things. They are not working very well at the start.

Maybe it's going to work very well later. But for sure, by just seeing having such a big testing across accounts, because I know other people also that they took credits, not so big ones, but they took credits in order to use it. I can tell you that maybe this is something that is going to be mainstream later and we're going to see several ads that we're going to create with Facebook shops and we're going to direct traffic there.

I don't know about this because still I believe that most of the return on ads came from these ones and the results were going to be even worse if we didn't have the purchases within the actual store. But at the end of the day, it's a start of something. You know that I like to bring you content that, you know, it's not going to be such mainstream thing, but things that also might come later.

And this is all I have to say about Facebook shop ads. In other words, they don't work so good for now. And if you're thinking of doing it or any Facebook representative is talking about them, just don't do it because you can see that here we are talking about a very strong account which had...

By the way, this happened during Black Friday, okay? All of our results were super crazy good and this one was not. So this also proves that the way that you are doing ads is also important in terms of the results that you are going to receive.

And this strategy here Facebook is not yet ready. I will see you in a future video.
