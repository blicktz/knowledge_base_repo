Hello Facebook Ads People, I'm Kostantinos and today I'm going to show you how you can report others that they are actually copying you so that you can stop them from advertising. Identity theft is not a joke Jim, millions of families suffer every year. A lot of times you are seeing that you are selling something, you are having your ads, you have paid for UGC content to send the product to edit it to do all of that and then someone is copying you and we have the daily loop theory basically with competition and all of that that it's actually causing you to lose money.

So what can you do in these cases? There are two ways we're going to go into MyPC. I'm going to show you that you can do it through Facebook and you can do it also through Shopify if this is a Shopify owner of course and I think it's going to be more valuable to dropshippers and then I'm going to give you at the end a small tip of how you can actually pave the way of actually reporting other people and stopping them as competition to your products.

Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have. You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. If you are seeing my videos for a long period of time you know that I hate lazy people.

I don't want to work. That's the only reason that I'm doing this video while in this specific Loom video you're not going to see the ads management at all which might have happened once or twice again in my past videos because we're focusing mostly in that. But I do hate when I see people copying other people just to make some money and this is the way that you can stop them.

First and most important thing let's go to the ad library you can start searching some people they're so lazy that they are even going to copy your copy text. They're not even going to do another while we have chat GPT and they can do another. So what are you doing first is that you're copy pasting over here in the search by keyword or advertiser your copy.

For example if you sell a lion bracelet as a stupid example put over there lion bracelet and try to find if someone else is doing your product. It doesn't matter if it's your product or if it's a drop shipping product. What you're trying to find here is if someone is copying your creatives because that means that they are not helping you to scale in the same way that we want to use different creatives and not the same creatives between campaigns the same thing is happening when other people are using your creatives.

It's limiting your scaling. So what are we going to do here is that you're going to put for example here all countries okay you're going to put here all ads and you're going to search by keywords or by what your product is trying to find people. A lot of times there are just people that they just put one employer to do this thing every day all day and the thing that you that is going to happen is that you're going to for example let's do that rich wallet for example.

Rich. And here it's going to start showing you different videos okay you start seeing them seeing them seeing them and you're trying to find any of these videos that they are your videos or they have been copied or whatever okay and this is just running for Greece obviously for rich wallet so if we go to more places we're going to find even more and here you can find also keywords in order to filter it more here we have active status only active ads and so on so this is what you do for example if you put air tag tracking over here okay it's going to let's do that i think they use the same copy everywhere if we take it yes so now it's going to a few minutes later okay so it was bugging on my end but look here for example okay so we have reads over here okay and we have the reads over here let's search it again and we have all ads okay and all goes on the links which is what we have to pay to do okay i'm not even if we have cookies it's bringing so many results over here over here we're having the active ads okay but if we remove that it's going to have even more okay and if we put any filters over here we can filter with languages and stuff and everything if we put over here on the top instead of a page for example if you put tag for For example, it will give us this, okay? If we're advertising a lion necklace like the example that I gave, lion necklace, let's see.

We have 170 results with a lion necklace which is, you see, a lion necklace and stuff, whatever that may be, okay? So you can start finding in that way, you see, lion necklace here and has this. So this is obviously a necklace about your daughter and all of that, but it has a lion.

So maybe this is your keyword in order to understand if someone is copying you or that. Anyway, you get my point. You can start searching like this and you can find competition that's actually using your ads and so on and so on.

You don't have to necessarily know the brand in order to do it. You can search also with keywords, not just with this. You can check over here different calendar if you want.

I would put all and all ads over here in order for it to work and you can start searching. After you locate the ads, you have the ID over here, okay? And you can start using it and you can go to this place facebook.com slash help slash IP reporting.

Now, the trademark is for companies like Disney or others that they are using their logo or whatever. Counterfeit is if you have a product and you are actually trying to ban people that they're selling a counterfeit of your product. This is where we are, okay?

So we're in the copyright. I will not press the report button, but you can click on the report and you can start putting over there all of the different things that you have to put. Here, I clicked it just for the sake.

Here, I'm the rights owner and all of that. It's going to take you through some questions and stuff that you have to click and then you're putting also the ID that you find from that library and you're doing and then you're going to have open cases and it's going to show you which ones got rejected, which ones didn't got rejected and you can start piling up all of these people that are copying your videos. In order for this to work, it has to be your videos, not to both of you take a video from Aliexpress, for example, use it and just because you use it and he uses it or she uses it that they're going to get banned because maybe you used it first, for example, okay?

The only thing that can happen, which I'm going to mention it at the end of the video, is for TikTok videos. If you manage to do ads first from the TikTok videos, maybe you will manage to ban some, but this doesn't mean that most of the times it's going to actually reject the ads of someone if it's exactly the same video. But there are a lot of lazy people that they are even going to use the same copy.

They don't even change the copy or they don't even take the video and make another video out of it because if they make another video out of your video, then maybe they're going to get away with it. Sometimes they also have a problem. Now, another thing that you can do, which is not always working, is the copyright infringement notice which is coming from Shopify, shopify.com slash legal slash tools slash report and issue slash DMCA.

This is the one that obviously I'm going to hide this kind of information. You're going to have who owns the copyright blah blah and you're going to give information. This is the way for you to try to shut down completely the store.

The other one is to try to get their ads rejected, not banned, rejected the ads. You don't try to get them banned with the other one. This one is trying to get their stores down.

Okay. So these are the two things. Start playing with them.

Don't be afraid that you will get banned because you know this is this has nothing to do with you getting banned, but try to be honest. Okay. So this is for people that they have a video.

Somebody took the video. They are also selling. They are hurting you because they are running the same ads and basically you are splitting sales.

And the moment I have seen sometimes that the moment you stop them, you see the results getting better until someone else does that. So this is a process that you have to do again and again and again. If you're not a lazy person and you're putting the effort to do your own creatives and other stupid people are actually copying you, the only way to actually defend yourself right now, it's this.

Try it. See how it's working. And I hope that this video is going to help some people that they're not lazy and there are some lazy people that they just want to make some fast money and they don't care about copying, especially in the dropshipping space.

This is happening. So these are the ways. I don't think that there are other ways that you can use.

If you know anything, let me know in the comments. The other thing that I need to mention is that you need to have to be the owner of the original videos and stuff, but there is also another way that you can do it. You can go, for example, on TikTok and take videos that you're going to use.

These videos that you're going to use, if you use them first and then you say that the other people copied you, you have very big chances of actually blocking their ads. And a lot of times when you're going to block them, you're going to see that you're going to have much better results because basically you have no competition. For companies that they are spending a lot of money, especially dropshippers, I think that it's ideal for you to have just one person that is going to search all of the ad library for competitors and all of that.

See if they're stealing any of your ads. And you can do this in order to shut them down because they are actually copying your videos. Or you can go, as I said, to TikTok, take the videos first, start using them.

Okay, so that the next people that they're going to use them, they're going to be, look like they're copying you. I know it's a little bit of unfair. I know that on the other hand, it's unfair to copy someone who is doing his own videos and stuff.

On the other hand, this is proving though that they can be people that they can find successful businesses that they have this creative, for example, and they just copied and they make some money. On the other hand, you now can stop this while before you couldn't. And the other thing is that they're going to be businesses that they have a product, which are not marketing in the best possible way.

And with this way, you have the chance and it actually makes sense for you to bother, to come, make better creatives, sell it better and stuff. If you think that you can do it better and you can do better marketing and nobody is going to copy you. Before, it didn't make any sense because somebody would come, they would copy you.

So why did you do all of this effort? So that other people can make money. Now that you can shut them down, it makes more sense.

And I think that it's clearing a little bit the way of all of these people that they are lazy and just, they just want to copy someone to be successful.
