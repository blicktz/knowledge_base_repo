Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss if your promo is good enough to run ads for the Black Friday in 2025. I could have said all that in the previous video but I feel like it was going to be buried away and sometimes people don't understand that there's so much competition on Black Friday with the promos and the ads that people are running that they are neglecting the fact that they need to have something which looks competitive or at least Black Friday worthy okay so if you're having for example a 10% if even if you're selling something which is 1k let's say and you're doing 100 dollars off which is 10% something that you can give but you cannot do 50% so give them 500 phrase it in a different way try to say that I'm giving you 100 off okay one very big example it's my chair for example Secretlab. Secretlab is giving 10% on Black Friday if I remember properly but they say 250 off okay they don't say for example that they're going to give you 10% discount because it looks like it's something cheap.

Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my Facebook Ads course it took me six months of video editing everything and three months of video shooting and because of that I have created the best Facebook ad course in the world. Inside you're going to find super advanced information but information also for beginners it takes you by the hand in order to teach you how to do Facebook ads from the beginner level to super advanced level it has inside loom videos from cost caps, speed caps, loom videos from CBO, ASC optimization, it has chosen five sessions, inner circle sessions and it has a lot of theory with whiteboard also strategies that are working all of these years things that I have developed things that I know that they're working because I have spent millions and millions on the platform. Currently I'm spending between five and ten million every month sometimes it's even more across 30 accounts and I have access to many many more so I know what is currently working and all the latest trends and this is what I'm doing inside the course I'm showing you live ad accounts with real spend and what is working right now and if you want you can click the link below you can go and you can check some videos that I have open free for you so that you can check if you like the course or not and decide if you want to buy it or not I will see you there.

People like to work with numbers okay they resonate with it so if you explain it to them it's going to make sense for example sometimes people they have a 20% discount but you can also do buy two get one free for example so in that way you are able to have a promo which is looking like someone is getting something for free while they don't understand that the 20% maybe it was even a better offer for them. Let's analyze one by one the offers that I have seen. Percentages okay so in percentages I can tell you that something which is above 25% or 30% maybe it's a good thing.

There is a new theory that's around that says that if you put 37% it's going to convert better there are some case studies that they're proving with results that's converting better. If you want to do it and if you want to try it try it but people now I think that if you start doing that then there's going to be people doing uh 37.5 and then there's going to be people that they do 37.32 and it's going to get mad. In my opinion anything above 25% 25-30% it looks good for Black Friday.

Anything below that maybe it's going to look really cheap and maybe you should consider the option number two which is dollars off. If you're having something which is on high value maybe you should consider or phrasing it like I'm giving you $200 off okay $500 off $300 off whatever that may be. If you do it like this then you're having better chances of converting instead of saying 10% because people are not going to just calculate how much is this.

Third one you can do buy two get one free buy three get one free don't do so like one of my past clients that he has done buy six to get one free because this is what makes sense. You can also feel that this is too much you know to say so do something that makes sense also but it's also looking like they are getting a bargain deal okay so maybe you cannot put a 10% or 20% but maybe you can put buy two get one free buy three get one free. Another thing which I have seen and sometimes business owners don't understand that people don't give a okay so let me tell you they say if you buy this and stuff then you're on the first tier and you're going to get this if you buy this you're going on the second tier nobody's going to read all of that so you need to have something which is going to be simple it's going to make sense and it's going to look like a bargain so don't try to do these different tiers of things unless if you're if you have to you're going to get a bargain but the offer has to be simple the offer has to look appealing don't try to over complicate it just so that you can throw more value or whatever people don't care imagine that in this period they are being bombarded from all of these different ads that they are showing 50% 99% off I have seen I have seen all of these things okay so they are seeing all of these offers and if you're having something super complicated they have so many options that they're not going to just sit there and read some people and some owners that they do understand the value of lifetime value customer and the money that they can spend along the way with you they don't understand that the black friday is an initiation period that somebody who doesn't know your brand maybe with a good offer is going to be lured to buy and maybe he's going to buy again and again and again the next month some people sadly for you as a competition they're willing to lose even money to get some new clients on this period so that they are going to be able to monetize them later of course it's not being done for most companies most companies are winning a lot during black friday but there are companies for example subscription models which are used to lose money on the first acquisition and they get money on the retention that they are actually losing money they're giving a better offer okay one example which we all know is netflix for example okay convinced everyone to take two or three months and then you just keep it you know because it's a very low cost but they convince you by giving you something for free i'm not saying that you should do the same but i'm telling you that there are people that are willing to do that because you have to treat black friday in a sense of being an offer that's going to bring you a lot of new customers and you don't have this chance many times throughout the year maybe this is a chance for you to get some new clients inside which are going to give you a lot of lifetime value and they're going to buy again and they're going to be repeated customers so treat it seriously find an offer that makes sense it's simple it's a good deal and it's even if you are losing a little bit from your profit and you don't have the same profit margins it's totally fine you're going to make it later because you're going to have so many new clients have a strong offer because people are seeing a lot of offers and they don't give second chances and understand that this is the only month of the year that you can have initiation of new clients which is so so so important for many companies for the future revenue that you're going to have the next months now if you want to know how you are going to run this offer because if you have solved all of these problems and you know what offer you're going to run and what makes sense and you have an irresistible offer you need to know how to run it with facebook ads and my course is the best way for you to learn how to do it it's not really late you can check it now and you can start running your ads preparing for the black friday and inside we have videos which are from beginners to really super advanced level with cb optimization sessions with chosen five sessions one-on-one sessions of me with my students solving problems on their ad accounts you can see below all the testimonials from the people that they actually have completed and how much they have benefited from it also i do have my mentorship programs it's for high spend individuals if you are spending more than 5k 10k per month 10k per day sorry not per month and you want to scale during the q4 let's talk i cannot promise you a spot on daily calls because most likely all of these spots are right now taken but maybe we can find a hybrid way of working together and you can see below all the testimonials from the people completed the chosen five programs and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
