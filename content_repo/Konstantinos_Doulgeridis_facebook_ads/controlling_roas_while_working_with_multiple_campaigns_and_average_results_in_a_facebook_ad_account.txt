Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss how you can control the average results and lowering or increasing the ROAS in an account while you are working with multiple campaigns. So I get comments like this over here which is actually telling me to give you some examples of how am I controlling the ROAS if I want to go lower or higher when I'm working with average results and multiple campaigns and the fluctuations that you can see in an account. What we're going to do is we're going to go into my PC, I'm going to show you how I was feeling there that I was getting a barrier from Meta when I was trying to scale above 1k, how I started controlling it and you're going to see how it's working and I hope that it's going to help you guys.

Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website, you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have. You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. Okay guys, so let's see this at account.

In this account, if we see the last month of June, we're having 31k spent, 3.52. A small account, okay? For some people it might be...

It's a small account. In general it's a small account. So, if we come here and we see on this month for example, I'm starting to struggle a little bit and I'm having several campaigns as you can see and all of that and now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to control it.

I'm probably on 2.5 ROAS but I want to have 3 ROAS plus over here, okay? Why does it matter? I just want to have 3 ROAS plus.

I'm having 3.21 from the first to 6. From the 7 to 13, I'm having 2.9. So, I'm losing my target and the problem is actually here.

Not here, I think it's here. From 11 to 13, I'm seeing 2.66. So, what am I doing is I'm starting to removing some of the bad campaigns that I'm actually having.

Don't see this because it has delayed reporting. As you can see, it's spent on only 82. But you can see here this one 2.1, 2.55.

Why not this? Because on this period, I guess it was a different case. I'm going to tell you that by just watching the last 7 days results, for example, you can see I'm on 2.73.

So, I do try to control it by just removing different campaigns or by optimizing. Maybe I will come inside one CBO. I will close one asset and I will try to keep an average and all of that.

But for sure, I'm just removing one from the worst or I'm trying to optimize further by just closing an asset in a CBO and lowering the budget a little bit more. I'm trying to control it. What I want to show you though is this.

During Friday, the spend is on 1.1k. On Saturday, I'm spending this less, so I'm trying to control it. 3.15.

Okay. Then again, I'm trying to push a little bit. Again, below 3 rows.

Okay. So, I'm getting the signal here from Meta that whenever I'm going to try to spend more like this one, it's going to give me worse rows. So, what am I doing?

I'm playing with it. I'm playing the game over here. Okay.

So, I'm going below 1k. Again, below 1k, I'm getting 3 rows and stuff. What is happening today?

Okay. I think I'm going to be fine. So, as you can see, in the last days over here, I'm actually recovering.

Okay. So, what am I doing? Two things.

First of all, removing bad campaigns, like campaigns that are having very bad results on the last 7 days. Again, here, what really matters is the average. After I close this one, for example, it doesn't matter what it has.

It has only this small spend. I just removed it. Okay.

So, I'm left with these and these are giving me the average result that I want. Okay. If we come on this period, we can see that most probably on the last 7 days.

Let's go a little bit on what I was seeing before on the last 7 days to understand. 2.87, I closed this campaign, for example, as you can see at this point. And this one, I removed two already.

So, now, every time that I'm removing one or two campaigns, I'm just waiting for two days to see what is going to happen and see how it's going to behave. This is how you're going to work. And the other thing that you can do is, for example, you are coming inside here.

Let's say, let's say inside here. This is an advantage plus. Okay.

And you say, okay, this one, I don't like it. This one has an average of 3.05, but let's say that it has a 2.9. Okay.

What I would do is, I would keep only these two, which have three and above. I'm going to watch what they have spent yesterday. And yesterday they have spent 40 and 30, that I will lower the budget, for example, to 50.

This is something else that you can do when you're working with multiple campaigns. So, number one, removing one of your worst campaigns in terms of ROAS. If you don't want to remove it, you can just try to optimize it further.

If you have three or four assets, maybe close one budget over there. If it's the leading ad, sadly, you can do nothing about it. Maybe you will have to remove it completely.

But this is what you do. Basically, you're just lowering the amount of spend that you have by just removing or optimizing further and lowering the budget of campaigns in order for you to be able to control it. As you can see here, by just doing that, I'm actually controlling it.

Okay, now it's again on three. If it continues, I will drop a little bit more. Maybe I will go to 900 flat, okay, and try to see what I can do there.

It's all about managing this with many campaigns, which is a luxury that you don't have when you have just one campaign, basically, and you just have to lower the budget, lower the budget, lower the budget. It's going to take you more time comparing to what we have seen here and fixing it in a much faster way. So that's all I had for you.

A live case study. I hope that's going to help you. I'm going to create more videos when I find interesting things like this in live ad accounts.

And don't forget that if you want to learn more, you can check my book, my course, my website, my mentorship programs, of course, and below my mentorship programs, you can see also the testimonials from people completing the mentorship programs. And until we meet again, guys, be creative and be consistent.
