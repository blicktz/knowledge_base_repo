Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss why you should not touch your ads all the time because you are ruining actually your results. The reason that I'm doing this video is because I have access right now in one ad account that I can see this pattern of touching the ads, doing the ads, closing them the next day if they don't have a result and so on and so on. I'm going to show you on the live account how this is happening and why it's a bad strategy and what you should do and also keep into your mind that when you are having new ad account your new pixel is going to be a little bit like not trained and you will not have consistency so a lot of times people go and close and yeah I will show you everything there we will discuss it there let's go to my PC.

So let me show you on this account what is happening. So in this month only we have how many days guys we have from 1 to 16th we have how many campaigns 23 campaigns I did just five minutes ago one optimization video that I was showing different stuff I was spending 20k per day and I had 40 campaigns there. How can you have 23 campaigns with just spending 100 or 200 per day it doesn't make any sense.

So what we're seeing here is decisions fast decisions so here it spent 85 it closed it it didn't support it at all. Let's see also the traffic and stuff so the traffic was the same let's say that this one okay that has different cost of per unique link click let's say that you can close but these are similar okay so it doesn't make any sense. So we come here and we can see we are having this one 58 then we have another one that it has spent 290 1.9 ROAS but then it was closed fast then another spending 100 most probably it was closed and it was having another sale.

So another campaign with 83 only spent 2.4 ROAS it didn't keep it most probably because it got afraid then we have 74 sales over here it didn't keep it again with 307 closing and then again and again the same situation 57 3.43 2.96 you see 36 spend 32 all of these guys is piling up and these are bad decisions that you are taking and you're closing but this is taking closing taking closing and it's piling up for you so that you are having a lot of campaigns so look here 65 8 20 11 just closing ads super fast without even closing 24 hours and then we are having this campaign which is very funny actually because I want to show you so let's see when this campaign started 12 9 okay so this campaign I think it started on on 11 on 10 on 10 then it had 9.55 okay then on Saturday it had zero sales after all of this Facebook taught him a big lesson and he didn't close it okay because he knew I was also telling him not to then we go here and we see that it's having another sale on 12 on 13 it doesn't have a sale so if you take again a hasty decision over here you close it then it's a problem then on 14 it has a sale then on 15 it doesn't have a sale and today which is 16 maybe I should have created this one day later it doesn't have a sale and let me see if it has a checkout it has two checkouts so if this person is unlucky and it doesn't have a sale today I'm very curious to see if it's going to keep it because it's going to be two days without the sale and I'm going to feel like it's going to be afraid immediately and closing it what I'm trying to say is this when you take a decision about a campaign keep it and keep it for some days in order to see if it's going to work or not if you see that it has good results and good cost per click and everything relance it and try to see if you can optimize it all over again or if you can have good results I already made a video about how relance helped me have a campaign that wasn't working before to work just two days later just because of the randomness of the initial result last thing don't spend small amounts of money here and there because at the end of the day they they compile up and it doesn't matter if you spend 1500 in a whole month it really matters how much you spend per day so if you want to spend a budget that it doesn't make sense for you to get a sale or in order for you to get a sale you need nine rows or whatever then don't do it do less days advertisement and more budget in a daily level because this is how facebook is working facebook is working with daily budgets that they are going to reset so that's what I have I think it's actually a very interesting case in order to see how how you are having a bad account so this one now had some success if it continues like this most probably if it's going to close and this is no stability guys by the way okay it's just five days if if this person is going to be panicked and close it then he's losing all of the effort that he has done and then if we see also on the last 30 days we can see that we are on 1.82 which is because of this small here and there and there and there if one of these campaigns was going to stay and you were going to optimize it most probably the results were going to be better okay so the whole point is optimizing not to just throw campaigns all the time or touch them all the time or try to improve them or try to do whatever because you are actually ruining all of your results with that I hope that this live example is going to help you but on the other hand I know that a lot of people that they just start to do now facebook ads they have a very big fear which I totally descended because I had it and let me tell you that it's one of the most difficult things to overcome to overcome your fear about facebook ads I'm not afraid anymore I'm doing campaigns with 3k in just one campaign and spending 20 30 40k I I'm not afraid anymore of it but I really understand someone who is spending their own money and they're starting now spending 100 dollars per day maybe look intimidating but let me tell you that whatever you do and the more you overcome your fear you will be becoming better and better and better with facebook ads please don't touch your ads all the time it's going to make it's going to make things worse so just to conclude if you make a decision about a campaign support it don't just go and close it see if you can optimize it see if you can do something without it this is why we like the crazy method this is why I like we like advantage plus with a lot of ads in order for you to be able to optimize because if you're just doing campaigns closing them and so on at the end of the day you're going to be losing money instead of making money I know that facebook is not a stable platform but you we always need to seek some stability by just doing campaigns that we're going to optimize so that they can stay for as long as they can don't forget that if you want to learn more
