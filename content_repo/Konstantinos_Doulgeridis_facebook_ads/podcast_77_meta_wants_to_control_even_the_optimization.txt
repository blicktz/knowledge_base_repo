Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, this is podcast number 77 and we're here today. We have a lot of your questions for today.

We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven pages of your questions. So we do have a lot of your questions. The other topics that we're going to cover today is something that I found about some automated rules that Meta is actually adding on the ad accounts with force and the way to be able to actually remove them.

And the other thing is how the results are doing so far now for the previous month and for this month. And I want to talk about a discussion that I had with one e-com owner from the ad accounts that I managed with with a discussion about average results and how we manage the ad accounts and stuff. Because some people, you know, they just want to go and touch this and touch that and they ruin the results and this is not okay.

So first of all, let's start with the main thing, which is the thing that I want to say. First of all, let's start with the performance so far. The performance, guys, for the previous month, I want to be honest and I'm not getting a lot of messages of stress from people.

So I do guess that you also had a good month. It was medium to good. June was medium to good.

This month so far, these days, they are pretty good, I must say, and they're good results, which is following the pattern from the previous year that we had good results on June and July and August was also really good. So pretty good results, pretty good, solid scaling on ad accounts and everything. So I think that on this we are covered and based on what I hear also on the inner circle from people that they are also freelancers, they manage several accounts, they also do well.

And I'm doing also less consulting calls, which is an indication for me, unless if people are leaving, but I don't think that people have left yet for vacation because I'm getting a lot of inquiries to work in ad accounts, which is also an indication because most of the times people send me messages when their ad accounts are doing well and they want to scale rather than when the ad accounts are doing bad. So I'm guessing that it's also a good period for all. Jonathan, also my best friend, is telling me that it's a good period for him too.

So we're in a good period. Thank God. It took us several months over here of misery and drama and at least we're having some good period where we can actually relax a little bit.

Now let's talk a little bit about the meta thing with the automated rules. So I was watching some of my ad accounts and I was seeing that this ad set is closed and I was saying, why did I close this ad set and I couldn't understand. Then I got mad and I said, okay, let me go and watch the logs on the right side of the sidebar.

You have a clock. You can see based on the period of time that you're going to add there which has made the ads and which has done any changes to them and so on. So I went and checked there and I saw I was expected to see the owner so that they can say if you touch the ad account again, I'm going to leave and stuff.

But no, it wasn't any owner. It was just meta having some automated rules about consolidation, about enhancements and all of that. So I was looking at it and then I was going to all of my ad accounts, checking daily which is a lot of hours of checking daily if the automated rules have been activated again because I was turning them off, deleting them and they were coming back.

So I couldn't find a solution. I was talking with one of my students mad and then we were optimizing on chosen five on the daily level and then I could see that oh this ad set was closed, this ad set was closed. I got mad.

I tell him why did you close this? Why did it do it? He says I don't know.

I don't know. And then we tell him check the log. Let's see when you did that so that we can try to understand why he has done it and then we see automated rule.

And I said okay sorry it's not your fault. Okay let's see the automated rules. Meta is doing that and he says I remember one day one stupid meta rep actually told me to go and go into the account overview as you can see here on the print screen and over here you can see that it has this performance recommendation and he told me enable automatic adjustment on this, enable automatic adjustment on this.

So this is actually creating the automated rules. The only way for you to actually manage and leave them is if you see on the top of the performance recommendation there is a cogwheel over there and this cogwheel over there if you click it it pops up this window that says manage automatic adjustments and if you turn it off and you apply changes most of the times it also deletes the automated rules sometimes it keeps them there but the truth is that you're not going to see them over again. Now if you go there and you still have automated rules coming to your Meta account but you cannot find this kind of setup the other way to find it because today that I was video shooting the video to show to all of the people and do it as a normal video into my youtube channel I couldn't find this thing while I could find it three days ago over there when I was preparing the content for the videos or the content for the podcast and then I went to the place that we have the rules on the right side next to the thrust pin you have one drop down which says rules manage rules it pops up a new window and over there you could see on the top it says rule for recommendation are now automatically automatic adjustments manage automatic adjustments you've already set up or create new ones in that account overview and I clicked on this one and then it took me back to the area that I could see the performance recommendations and I would I was able to click the cogwheel so if you have automated rules and you cannot see it this is the way to go there and just turn it off apply changes toggle off the button enable automatic adjustments just remove it and just you're just you're just going to be saved from this stupid stupid stupid setting of having automated rules I don't like automated rules I like to go every day and optimize my ad accounts later on if there is any good AI that I will create or someone else with their knowledge and stuff and it's working well maybe we can go there but as of now I think that I also enjoy my job it's obvious from the fact that I'm doing the podcast the videos and stuff you have to understand that the youtube channel is doing well because I enjoy what I do it's not always about the money the money are following with your success but mostly is when you actually like what you're doing so I do enjoy doing optimization for me it's not the problem it's my joy to go every day and play that's why I'm showing you ad accounts because this is my daily routine I just go into the ad accounts and I see things and then I say okay this would be a nice video to show to people and all of that so this is this is what we are going to focus on showing these videos of course that you really love and you really tell me that you love them and this is how I do facebook ads with watching daily and monitoring and this is how I will continue so most probably I will never in my life use automated rules for something even for something that is scheduled to happen I will just do it manually or I will tell to my employee do it manually or whatever but I like to work on all of the other accounts that I manage personally maybe I'm not going to do the workload upload or create some ads because of the time which is limited but for sure I'm going to do the optimization to all of my ad accounts myself I haven't trained anyone to do it I know I'm not going to scale blah blah I know I cannot have an agency blah blah but this is what I enjoy to do I don't want to have an agency with 20 people that they know how to optimize that accounts I want to have maybe 20 people that they do ads but I optimize the accounts anyway it's fine we all pick the things that we like to do and we're being criticized for this I know that I will never be able to scale but don't forget that I have also students that I can work 50 50 on other accounts and stuff so who knows maybe later I will scale even more but still I'm not making a small amount of money I do whatever I want whenever I want I buy whatever I want yeah my life is is totally fine so I will keep doing it like this and I hope that you will be with me in this journey liking all of the content one thing that I wanted to say now that we talk about youtube channels guys um a lot of times we have said about other people on other channels that we don't like their I don't like their com their content and stuff and I feel like it's repetitive and they don't show accounts and stuff I told you that I have um that I like Ben Heath I think that uh it wouldn't be nice to criticize Ben Heath because he has so much following and all of the people following but I do believe that he doesn't go really deep to what he shows it's more on a on a on a basic learning level and I do believe that a lot of people can learn with Ben Heath and they can go even deeper with my channel but I have to give credits to one guy that I have found recently his name is John Loomer um obviously I'm not going to do a huge uh open I have never met him by the way but he has a very good newsletter that he's sending daily videos of uh things that he has seen uh and all of that and just because I don't want to be um only negative to others we have to be also positive to the ones that they actually deserve it and John Loomer uh you can go to johnloomer.com or google him you will find him subscribe to his newsletter he's having very good daily videos about things he's doing his own tests um and all of that uh and I think that it's a very good newsletter if you want to stay updated I'm part of other newsletters which started really well and they didn't do uh really well at the end they just became worse and worse but this one is always you know in a very good level good speech a good level of one minute video every day not spamming you just pure information uh I really liked it and I just because I think that the whole thing over here is not about me but about becoming better on facebook ads in general johnloomer.com go and subscribe to his newsletter about daily videos you will get one video every day I have never met the guy I hope that I will meet him in the future but I don't think that he has a youtube channel to be honest with you but um I think that for a lot of people that they like facebook ads like me this is a valuable thing and if I find anything else which is valuable and it's going to be vetted for one or two months so that I can know that I really like it I will let you know before we go to your questions one thing that happened today I had a very good discussion with one of my clients um about average results he came to me and he said dude this campaign is not too well this answer this answer this answer you have to close them the reply was this don't interfere in the way that I optimize I can explain to you whatever you want just understand that you cannot apply pressure to me one of the good things that I have when people work with me is that I'm not afraid of them why because I don't care if they will fire me or not I'm going to express my opinion or not someone who is dependent on your money is being afraid of you and if you tell them close this and stuff they will try to close it so that they can please you facebook ads is not about pleasing you facebook ads is about the results that you're going to have and if I'm going to have an argument with you so be it and if you find me so be it I'm going to express my opinion and this is why I have people and corporations for many years for people that they pay me a lot of money just because I'm not afraid of them and I'm going to express my opinion so I came to him and I told him even if you pressure pressure me even if you do whatever you want to do I'm not going to do it if I don't believe in it so of course we are all humans if someone is sending you messages every day eventually he's going to get into your head that's why I wanted initially to tell him that don't do that because maybe I will be in a very bad day that I haven't slept well because of the baby and stuff and then I will not be so strong and composed I will be more vulnerable and I will do a change that I wouldn't do in a normal situation but because we are humans okay I'm not a machine so I told him that look you have to understand that when we are operating and we want to scale if you're just doing that and you're touching campaigns all the time even if they don't do well and you don't watch the average results then eventually you're going to end up scaling up to 100k and then back to 50k 60k then again that if you want to go to 300k 400k as I have proved with case studies because all of this is proven okay it's not just theory it's proven with videos and results and stuff I was lucky enough to actually monitor with videos the three months six months 12 months and not before happening while it was happening so I did three months then three months past I did six months then six months past I did one year of results and you were able to see the progress of these accounts this happened because I was watching average results among other things that we discussed like using different angles on creatives and all of that so that you're not going to cannibalize go watch my daily loop theory so the thing is that you need to understand that if you have for example a campaign that operates with 2.5 and your average draw is 3.5 you're going to keep this campaign when are you going to remove this campaign when you're going to have good bad results for two three days then you can start removing one if you have bad results for two three days but across all of my ad accounts I'm having bad results I'm going to be more flexible I'm going to keep my ads for more days without touching them there is one undeniable truth something that I have seen to other accounts that I go and to my students from the mentorship programs the less you touch the other accounts the better it is of course you always need to think if I touch another account if I touch an ad what do I have to win if it's a bad campaign which I need to optimize the worst case scenario is that I will close it because I failed to optimize it the best case scenario is that I will be able to fix it but if you go in an in a campaign and you see for example over there that I'm having three ad sets one of them it's having 1.2 ROAS the other one is having 2.3 and there is another one which has 3.4 this in average let's say based on different spend it's actually giving me a 2.8 ROAS and my break-even ROAS is too short with 2.8 I'm happy why would I go and close the 1.2 and 2.3 while I'm having 2.8 ROAS which is good for me why would I go and close it what do I have to win just to have a better ROAS campaign so what this is not going to help me scale if I have only one campaign then yes I will try to go and fix it but if I'm having over there many campaigns and I'm operating there with many campaigns some of those are going to be the volume and some of those are going to be the good ROAS campaigns and the more you understand that and the more you calibrate your mind towards that then you're going to be able to scale if you go and you say okay I'm going to kill this so I'm going to fix this and that and that which is also another problem with people that they meet me initially because we do cb optimization and advanced optimization it doesn't mean that you have to go every day and do it just because you like it I also like to do it but I do it in a more composed way composed way not compost way composed way because I really like to I really like to always think before doing something so do I have to win something what am I going to lose in case that I'm wrong into my optimization okay let's put them on a scale let's try to see which one makes more sense that's the way that you need to operate also when you go into another account and you make a change always keep in your mind that you might be wrong and you might start a chain of events when you go in a campaign even if you have one ad set having bad ROAS and the others are having good and the average results is good this is not influencing you because if you're getting in average results the results that you want that means that the other campaigns that are good they are having more spend from the bad one but you have a balance over there there's no point of going into a lake which is really calm a tranquility lake and just throw a rock just to it will go back to calm but you don't know maybe you're going to cause so many problems and you're just going to close the whole campaign so when you do something it might cause the chain event of different things that are going to happen in the ad account and maybe it's going to ruin so what's the point if I have something working in average to go and just close one ad set just because I don't like the ROAS that it has while the average results are there still I'm getting what I want do you understand if you think like the way that I think you will be able to scale if not you will just have ups and downs you will scale the moment you will start touching everything again because you want to make it better you will go down again and again again and you will do that until the point that you are not going to be able to do it just because the competition is going to catch up just because it's not going to be a trending product anymore or whatever that may be so that's all the thing about the average results that I wanted to cover I think that it's very important to start understanding I have videos of course on youtube that I show how to optimize and all of my optimization is based on that but the same way that you are treating one campaign with average results and you don't touch it the same way you're treating the same way you're treating also another account with average results between the campaigns so that you're not going to have issues now if the results are bad you can start removing one from the worst ones another one from the worst ones is stabilized okay let's stay there let's try to push a little bit more and so on but you are always operating with average results and if something is having less ROAS it's fine as long as the average results is there and it's not ruining your average results because this owner was asking me but if you keep doing that you will get worse ROAS no because I'm watching the average results the only thing that I can control is the average results because this campaign and you have seen it Facebook is not a stable platform it's an unstable platform so this campaign is going to have good results one day the other day bad good results one day the other bad we're watching last seven days then we're having delayed reporting we're having all of these issues with less reporting also in meta and stuff so what is the only thing that is the most stable the average results the average results of all of the campaigns is the most stable number that we can see within the ads margin so this is the one that we can follow and of course this is not going to hurt us because even if we have bad campaigns and the average is good if the average starts dropping we will start removing from the bad ones uh so that we can fix our average results again so no it's not going to hurt us anyway that's my mindset this is how I have done it and I have proof for all of this uh to my videos that's all let's go to your questions because we have a lot to cover hey bit of a side question but have you noticed on the flexible format I'm getting no actual asset breakdown on those that are achieving conversions unlike DCT uh where we did uh pretty annoying uh there's a bug right now uh from uh dynamic creative ads the breakdown you cannot see the creative asset uh anymore uh on the breakdowns you can see all the other breakdowns from text and stuff uh but you cannot see it I think it's a bug and it's going to be fixed and um uh yeah I also have it on my other accounts I I think it's a bug I think that there's no way that they're giving the uh flexible option and uh they are not by the way the flexible option is on sales but they still keep the dynamic ads I think on some things like uh traffic uh or uh other things even on leadgen I think but I'm not sure but for sure they keep the dynamic and stuff I think that they should remove it everywhere they just put flexible if they want to put it um anyway I told you that for flexible we will talk about it in the future but they haven't done any serious testings about it maybe in the future I will just try to see others burned with it uh most of the times new uh features from meta they have problems like the problem that we mentioned so I'm going to wait a little bit on it um I'm doing some tests already but nothing really massive hello Konstantinos your knowledge is greatly appreciated by all of us thank you guys uh would this problem be solved with a look like a triple whale uh are the sales delayed also in Shopify's dashboard thanks okay uh he's referring to my last video about uh delayed um reporting from shop from checkout to purchase and basically what I was saying in the video is that you need because we have delayed reporting you need to watch your um checkout purchase ratio for example if in all of your other account in different campaigns you have every two checkouts one purchase it's important to actually know that in the new campaign that you have done maybe you see four checkouts one purchase that means that you are expecting for some sales to come because it's a new campaign this is pretty standard and this is how I optimize so if you have an asset which has five purchases and in the ad account you're getting every two purchases one sale then that means that I will give it more time because I'm expecting for some sales to come instead of closing it super fast now with triple whale you can get an indication so I really like to see triple whale in terms of getting some info but not influencing my final decision it's just another info in the equation of my head of what am I going to do with an asset or an ad so in triple whale you can see okay I'm seeing five purchases do I actually have sales yes but maybe the sales are never going to be reported you know my opinion about triple whale that these are amazing tools that you can use for many reasons like known lifetime value retention rates and for subscription models and all of that but I don't think that you can use them for optimization because the optimization is happening on the asset level they do upload offline events to your pixel to give you more data but they don't give the events to the asset level for optimization if they say that they're lying the thing with the thing with the triple whale and all of that is that you can see it in order to know okay out of the five checkouts how many sales do do we have here triple whale three maybe none of them is going to be reported by meta but the other thing is that maybe one or two of them is going to be reported so you get an idea from this how many sales you are going to get that's with the triple whale I think I had another question about this here at the end maybe because I did have it here yeah so he's asking I'm asking hello Konstantinos a question please is this purchase ratio not related with the cost or the niche of the product you sell will you have the same ratio if you sell a beauty product with five euros and a cell phone that costs 199 euros thanks in advance of course you're not going to have the same purchase ratio the problem over here and you know a lot of times I don't know how else to explain it on the videos all of these are examples it doesn't mean that in your ad account you need to have two checkouts and one purchase for example like the example that I gave or the example that you have seen in one of my videos of course you can have other items I have an account that they have three checkouts one purchase four checkouts one purchase you just try to find the standard thing of the ad account and how it operates if now you're not profitable you start researching also if this ratio is good or bad but if you're profitable of course you're saying that this is the situation that I'm profitable in so maybe I'm having four checkouts one purchase but since it's working it's fine it doesn't mean that all of the other accounts need to have two to one or three to one and and of course if we talk about high ticket items they never do so yes it really matters what you're selling next one should I use the option of maximize value of conversion in advanced shopping campaign if I only sell one product how much percentage do you set at the existing budget customer cap so in order to reply this I must say that if you use the maximize value basically you have to declare what kind of rows you need to get and it needs a special handling because then you it's like you're operating with a manual bidding campaign that you're just trying to find the correct ROAS that you should put there in order for it to work so this is a completely different handling if you know how to do manual bidding or if you are experienced do it if you want to learn watch my videos and try to experiment to learn but it's a completely different campaign and they cannot tell you if you should use it or not because it's all about testing now about the percentage that you set on existing customer budget cap for for that I can tell you that most of the times I don't touch it but at the same time I'm monitoring the breakdown of results and I'm seeing the audience segment in the demographics audience segment on the breakdown and you can see how many people you are targeting from your existing audience if this is really high then I might go and control it but lately I don't see more than 20% or 25% on the targeting audience on advantage shopping campaigns let's let's go to next one which is actually a little bit of funny so we have here Jonathan not the actual Jonathan one other viewer of the channel says should I trust this it says scale your high performance ad set consider increasing the ad set daily spent by additionally 28.80 or more and then it has some potential outcomes over here that says 43.20 plus 108% 33.6 plus 86% 28.75 63 based on modeling first of all I do reply below what does your gut tell you and he and he did that so I guess that you do understand that of course Meta is going to try to Meta is not a non-profit organization Meta is here to make money so they do serve you that in order for you to spend more money so this is modeling they say it's modeling they don't give you any guarantee that it's going to work so it's a risk that they want you to take they say that okay given the fact that you have so much that are working we believe that if you spend more more you will make more money if you don't oops sorry we did a mistake start all over again no don't trust them and it's it's it's based on modeling and I can tell you that that you know the things that we are doing scaling with different campaigns it they're much more stable than this okay question Kostantinos what's even funnier is that if you look at the comment section of every video that preach is broad you will always see people making comments like hey I've tried interests as well as broad and the interest work better can you comment on that again it really depends now if a person goes there with an untrained pixel and he he looked at the interest and it worked yes of course the interest have worked but this doesn't say that broad doesn't work broad it is working and the ultimate goal of each ad account and targeting is to go to broad targeting and being able to operate there so that you can scale and yet they still will come up with some lame excuse to stop running interest campaign and allocate all budget abroad even though it's not profitable yeah I'm against that because I think that you need I will never so if someone comes to me and tells me this thing is working for me I will never tell them that this is wrong if it's working it's working and the fact is a fact I will try to understand why it's working for him I will try to understand if I am doing something wrong but the fact that it's working if he's not lying of course but the fact that this thing is working it's a fact for him it's something that he's seeing so we all have to respect that shut the up and just see what he's doing if he's doing something that we don't do if we try to interpret it for example if someone comes and tells me I started doing broad targeting since day one with an untrained pixel and it worked perfectly just this I will try to ask him which was the country if he tells me Denmark okay then I will say okay it makes sense because the Denmark for example full potential it is very small so even if you do an audience or an interest or whatever it's still the same if he comes and tells me that I did this on United States then I have seen it also but it's very rare and with a new pixel for example if someone comes and tells me that broad targeting doesn't work for me I will ask him also because I don't think that broad target so I don't think that broad targeting doesn't work it does work really well so it really depends on whom you are talking to and sadly when we are doing videos or when we are commenting we cannot know all of the information for example okay you might for example show another account with two ROAS and someone can tell you that it's very low ROAS because they are getting with very small spend five ROAS or because they have a high ticket item which is selling you cannot just compare every case is different and you have to just address it in a different way if you want to be accurate okay next one this kind of analysis tips from this channel has helped me tremendously in optimizing our campaigns amongst other things learned from here thanks I would love to see a bit more technical tips very useful it's really appearing into experts of what they see when optimizing uh the result that I'm putting this here is not just so that I can flex is guys are you are you really I'm putting so many videos with live cases and uh and examples I don't know how many more I should uh I should uh I should put you say a bit more how many more all of my videos they have live accounts uh my video editors are are close to their limits I'm I'm hiring most probably another one just to keep doing that because it has a lot of uh effort to the blurring and all of that I think there are enough I guess uh but I will keep doing it uh thank you Konstantinos for the great gems of knowledge that you are dropping I have a question I'm noticing one of my ad accounts uh that the purchase events are way more than the checkouts around two pairs per check out and that does not make sense hence uh does that mean that the devs have implemented the events made a mistake with the checkout event or they made a mistake at a different place as in my option there has to be a mistake somewhere with the integration even though when testing I see the event triggering have you seen a case like this if you did do you um do you were usually the problem do you know I guess where the problem usually occurs um thank you and keep up the great content long time follower uh long time follower but I haven't seen you on the comments um good good thing that you're not saying anymore um the thing is that um the only thing I replied to you I know because we had a conversation that this is a dev problem because I told you do you see this in volume so for example you see uh 100 checkouts 200 you see uh what's the opposite 200 checkouts uh um and what else so if we have more checkouts or less sorry my my mind is frozen right now so if we have 100 checkouts and 100 purchases for example or if we have um 50 checkouts and 150 purchases for example this is what you want to say so the fact that we're having much less checkouts from purchases while you we should have 200 checkouts and 100 purchases okay now I'm unstuck um if you see such a high volume then you have a problem into your reporting and all of that I have seen it happening with smaller numbers when people have PayPal but I know that you don't as you told me and they click on the checkout express checkout with PayPal this might mean that they might skip the checkout event uh but it doesn't happen a lot so most probably you will be able to see more checkouts from purchases and not more purchases compared to checkouts uh so yeah that's the only case that I want to share with you that I have seen that checkout is not being reported and you you might have more purchases but it's happening with very small volume numbers this is the end of the first part of the Facebook ads breaking news podcast if you don't want to miss the second half of the podcast where I'm answering all the remaining questions of the week visit my pattern page following the link on the description this was the Facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is go
