Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today after a bad period on Facebook we're going to discuss on how you can recover from these bad periods. These bad periods are happening from time to time we cannot avoid it there is going to be always bad periods with Facebook and a lot of times I see people destroying their ad accounts because of that because they don't understand what they have to do how do I know it because I have done a crazy amount of consulting calls now and on July that the results were good I have done almost none so there are people that they come to talk to me about having bad results and how they closed all of their campaigns and all of that and I need to address all of that in order for you to know what to do we have analyzed it a lot in the podcast I think I wanted to make a dedicated video by showing you also other accounts that they had bad periods and how you can overcome them. Facebook is a platform which is working by charging impressions what does this mean that if a lot of people they come and they advertise we're going to have more people advertising which means that you're going to be charged more it's the CPM as we call it the cost per thousand impressions not only that if there are more and more people coming to advertise a lot of times we're going to have less sales because somebody is taking something one sale from us here and there and there even if there are a lot of people with small budgets they still take a sale here here and there and the volume that these people have it's actually being shown on our results why is this happening because we had a very good July and August everybody's talking about it on Reddit or on other platforms and they do come and they advertise because they think that now Facebook magically fix the numbers and they can advertise and they can have good numbers.

These are a lot of people I like to call them Facebook immigrants they come and go basically and what they do is that they want to come and advertise because their numbers they don't make sense they want to come and advertise only in a good period but they are not they never come in a good period because a good period has already passed and they didn't have the information at that point so what do they do they have numbers that they are in the verge of being profitable or unprofitable so for them in order to be able to have good results the only way to have good results is to actually come in a period that Facebook is having lower CPMs so that the numbers are going to make sense and of course I'm not talking about Black Friday. Black Friday has so much volume in terms of orders that we cannot see this kind of effect but I'm talking about other periods a lot of times they are random and there are a lot of people that they come to the platform they advertise and the whole point here is for you to hold and maintain your position even by just losing a little bit every day in order for them to panic start losing money lose all of their money I don't care and stop advertising so that the market can come back to normal. So it's going to be always like this there is going to be always good periods and bad periods the whole point is that in the bad periods what you're doing is you're holding your position you're maintaining the people who are going to be afraid first they're going to close their ads or the people who don't have so good numbers and they are losing a lot of money every day they're going to close their ads and then what you need to do is the moment you will see some good you know situation that it's coming better and better two three four days or see it across your ad accounts which is a better verification you push because at that point all of this market that was left from these idiots or Facebook immigrants as we call them as I call them it's something that you can actually go and snatch okay you can go and you can take it and you can maintain it then they are going to come again eventually you're going to maintain your position you're going to do that again and again it's always trying to push a little bit more but we're not pushing on the bad periods a little bit of what you should do when you have a bad period so here we apply the rule that says during the bad periods we are the laziest person in the earth and during the good periods you are doing testing new campaigns scaling whatever you want to do even if you have the craziest ideas or whatever you want to do during a bad period let me tell you that it's not a proper test because it's a bad period and you don't know if it's working or not working second thing coming here and okay you're having a good period on June July and August right now and on September you didn't have a good period when you when this is happening you coming and changing this a little bit of that a little bit of that a little bit of that this is just small mistakes every day that they compile to the destroying of your ad account and I have seen people that they have closed for example one campaign that was doing very well but for the last seven days it wasn't doing well so they closed it and basically this campaign actually lost all the data and everything they lost all of the progress just because of seven days this is not correct and you should do nothing that's the sad truth when things are not doing well you just you just sit down and you wait and you try to maintain it by just maybe lowering the budgets a little bit and stuff but not doing anything crazy not doing anything that's going to disturb the ad account in a very big level I do understand that you are afraid and this is something that it took me years to overcome the fear on Facebook ads is something that it doesn't go away that easily and I do understand that you don't have information like I do and whatever but still that's the sad truth and you need to train yourself of not being afraid and you need to be able to overcome the spirits because if you don't you're just becoming a hustler that it's coming and go all the time and you're doing changes whenever things are doing good or bad do you want to be part of the people that they are just not being affected by those or do you want to be the person that you're always going to have issues because of this bad period because they are not going to stop there are always going to be people that they will try to enter Facebook and they will be disappointed there are always going to try to be changes from Facebook maybe on September we had a lot of changes this is why this happened maybe we have a lot of people coming and advertising because they are preparing for Black Friday this is also another scenario I remember another September which was bad with the Biden election we had so many ads for political reasons that it was actually ruining all the CPMs in United States all of that it's actually creating periods that are going to be bad and good and you need to be able to overcome them and I guess it's up to you after that to reevaluate a little bit your way of thinking or if you want to start all over again all over again all over again when something is actually happening this is also the reason that I don't like consolidation because if you have only one campaign there's nothing that you can do you just have to wait okay and maybe it's going to work you're going to wait and stuff but if you have a lot of campaigns and at least you have some space to close one keep another one but you're not going to completely stop your ads or whatever that may be or you can lower the budget now you can tell me I can lower the budget in a campaign if I have only one consolidated campaign okay but from my experience seeing it this is going to mean even worse results for a period in a bad period because when you're lowering the budget in a campaign the campaign doesn't react really well to it especially at the start until it stabilizes again and it's a bad period so it's not going to stabilize and Facebook doesn't care about that okay Facebook doesn't care about the 10 days that you're going to have bad result and they talked about consolidation but it's not their own money if you care about getting fire dry like me then you talk about these things in the way that I tried to explain to you let's go on my PC let me show you these periods and how to overcome them I have done also another video which explains how to overcome a bad period if the results persist and they don't go away you can overcome a bad period by just doing a promotion so that you can flood the system with data it's going to inflate the results but it's going to help you overcome this period by just having a lot of data and having better optimization than the others that they are not running a promotion you should go and you should watch it I think it happened on May or June for this account so just to prove my point I'm going to show you several accounts smaller ones bigger ones and show you the trend you will see we have analyzed it in another video but it's actually funny because when I was trying to find which account show you it was pretty obvious so we come here 8 to 17th okay this is the bad period that that I have seen it's actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 days it's actually 10 days very bad results and I do understand that 10 days for some of you are going to be a lot but I'm going to show you how it looks and then the average of the month so in this one for example this is a smaller spending account from 8 to 17 we have 4.4k spent 1.24 and then we go from 18 to 28 2.89 and if we see the whole month over here let's see how it has been affected 2.34 still you are above break even on this ad account which is fine because you maintain your position you're above the number that you want to be but you had a very bad period do you know what most of the people did here they come from 8 to 17 and then come here and they close these two campaigns okay let's see them these two campaigns they close them they kept just this one which is a very small spend it's just a retargeting and maybe this one but I believe that most of them would close also this one so they would close all of their ads basically here and they will start all over again but if we see the whole month over here we can see that this one this one is not doing well but still we keep it for volume but we can see that this one for example has 3.66 in the whole month okay so it wasn't destroyed and we can see that in average we are having 2.34 which is good here for example just to give you an example it was losing money okay so from 8 to 17 it was losing money and the truth is that I had an argument with the owner of the ad account but of course I'm working with him for years and he knows that I'm not joking when I'm talking about things so here I told him that lose look a little bit lose a little bit of money now but for the whole month you're going to be profitable and this is what happened now can you do the same do you have the same information as I do and stuff certainly no but this is this is the truth over here and we need to actually address it let's go to to another small account before we go to the big business okay this other account for example okay just a spend from 8 to 17 it has 3k spend 0.82 okay and then we go from 17 to 28 okay this person lowered the budget a lot but it's a mistake if this person was going to keep the ads over here it was going to have much better results because he just closed the ads but the ads didn't work because he closed them the ads work from 18 from 18 to 28 right now because they were going to work anyway this is what I'm trying to prove that this bad period it's about who is going to just start stopping their ads or whatever because reddit then they go and they say the ads suck and stuff and people close and close because they are afraid it's like the stocks you know that they're afraid and they're selling but somebody holding position maybe later they're winning or they're buying and so on in this ad account you are seeing better ROAS in that period but it was going in my opinion if it was going to leave the ads I'm not managing this ad account by the way if it was going to leave these ads they were going to have much better results by just keeping them and staying there and I know that they're breaking my ROAS is one here because this is a digital product so they are afraid of actually losing them while they have the luxury of having lower ROAS in order to maintain it but as soon as they show that they are losing they just close all of the ads and they start new ones it's not okay to start new ads when you're having a bad period you're just making new ads while everybody else is making new ads and you're competing with each other on the new ads whoever is having older ads they're just having older CPMs or let's say older data and that being said they have an that's against you that you are just doing new ads all the time again and again and let me tell you that you will do new ads you will try this that that eventually it's going to work when it's going to work for everyone else like the 18th to 28th of September it's not going to work earlier just because you're doing a big change now if you do a big change and it's going to work in a bad period that means that you did something really well but let me tell you that most of the time this is not the case and all of the changes that you do because you are panicking they're making they're destroying your whole ad account let's discuss about another account 18 to 17 over here 1.67 below breakeven over here okay 1.8 is the breakeven ROAS if we see then from 18 to 28 62k spent so here this is an account that manging for a long period okay so 62k spent and 60k spent okay we have two different periods 2.24 we have we are above our break even which is 1.8 we are making money here and this month we're going to close to 2.06 or maybe even more because we're doing pretty well in the last seven days what's the tendency 2.09 okay let's say that we will close close to 2.05 or 2.10 but we're not expecting this month to be the best one after having 10 bad days but again here i'm proving my point i didn't close my ads i kept my my way of working with a lot of campaigns which helped me a lot instead of having one bad campaign with the consolidation that facebook is actually proposing and i kept my position i had a profitable month i did hold all of my spend and i actually was able to scale more because i'm scaling now also after after i have seen that it's doing well i'm also doing more campaigns in order to take all the space that these facebook immigrants have left behind we say that in the nature every gap has to be filled by something this is how marketing also works whoever is not spending money somewhere somebody else is going to come and it's going to spend money there to take the position this is what you're doing you're maintaining your position and you're taking the position of someone else the first account that we showed i think it was united yes it was united states the next one it was australia the other one that that we showed it was united states this one's united states the next one is united kingdom just so that you can understand that it's not only about united states but it's also between countries countries or one of them was new zealand i i don't remember anyway if we see again here from 8 to i think it was 8 from 18 no oh this is the previous year let's go on this month from 8 to 17.

okay we have 4.07 we are really close to the break-even rows over here okay this is a situation that at least we say we are on break-even rows fine it's not going to affect us so much we're not even losing money i have already proven to you that in other cases that i was losing money i was still maintaining a position it's about the faith that you have on the ad account and you know it after many years you know that this account works like this so if it has a bad period it doesn't mean that necessarily your ad accounts or your ads stopped working so that it's something else that is influencing it then this is what you need to actually understand so 4.07 and then we go from 18 to 28 6.44 okay huge change okay and i'm even scaling now because in this account i'm going super aggressive towards the black friday because i want to spend half a million here how much did we spend this month this month 256k most probably i'm going to close and you can see also that in the whole month i'm actually super profitable break-even rows here is 4.0 break-even rows here is 4.0 in this period i was losing money 8 to 17 3.42 i was losing money and then we go from 18 to 28 we have 4.91 so the situation is good uh this month was probably okay that that's acceptable uh because i'm scaling also this ad account these are bigger ad accounts they have different rules it's not like the other the smaller ones over here even if i have four rows or even 3.5 for a month for example just to give you the whole picture let's say that i have 3.5 on september and i'm maintaining my spend and i'm spending more on crumber i'm going to do it because i want to maintain my position and i want to make others suffer that they compete with me on the market and i want to go and spend as much as i can during the black friday establishing a new position which is going to help me spend much more in the next year actually suffocating all of my competition i hope that it helps you to understand that these bad periods are going to be here and they're going to come again and again and again and this is how you need to actually solve them in this specific account i convinced the client because it's a big spend to do a promo so we do an autumn sale which started here i believe it started on monday and boom you have inflated results of eight seven yesterday wasn't so good five and this day so far have 4.8 but it's too early so you're having a promotion here which is actually fueling the results in and data of course is fueling data in and you're able to overcome a period and it's not about the inflation of results because i can see someone thinking like this it's about the data that you're going to have inside which is going to help you overcome this bad period because as i said it's not your fault it's not your ad account it's not your structure it was working for two three months and now suddenly it doesn't work for 10 days it's because of the volume of advertisers and change that facebook did and stuff whoever is closing the ads on this period and they are being afraid or they cannot afford it which is another case they are the losers and you are the one that you are winning from this situation because it's an opportunity like every recession this is an opportunity the moment that you see that the results are improving you can do more ads and more ads and you're just establishing a better position in the market and you're just being able to scale more the company i'm actually happy when i'm having these bad periods because i know that immediately when i see one or two results one or two three days that are good i'm launching new ads and i can see it because across all the ad accounts i showed you the pattern okay there's nobody who can say that uh from uh from 8 to 17 it wasn't a bad period for uh uh september and i hope that all of these discussions that we had in the podcast and all of the messages that i got now it's more clear to you that you see it in a bigger picture i hope that i helped you to understand it more the reason that i created this video is because i had so many comments about this bad period and what they do and the saddest part is that i had a lot of consulting calls and i have seen with my own eyes people destroying their ad accounts just because they had two weeks or one bad week and now they try to build them all over again and i'm sure from some of them that i talked to that they are so afraid that they're going to do it again and again and they're not going to be able to overcome just one note i had one message from one person uh that because i was explaining that to the podcast and this person told me that yeah it's easy for you to say if you maintain um the ad account and you have a little bit of profits or a little bit of loss but i'm losing a lot of money well if you're on the side that you're losing a lot of money i do understand that you have to close your ads i'm not crazy but what i'm trying to say here is that if your numbers are not so strong enough and you're being influenced so strong by these bad periods then that means that you um that you cannot advertise always on facebook the things that i'm saying here is about people and companies that they have strong numbers and they can advertise always on facebook and there are people like this they just don't know it because they just closed their ads for five seven bad days results and they are not waiting on the other hand you can tell me i'm afraid i don't know how much to wait and stuff well this is what you need to train your self about and this is how you need to get trained for facebook ads or if you cannot do it leave someone else to do it and don't bug them during that period that is doing bad because if he's telling you that in the other ad accounts things are bad and you have to wait you have to listen to him and if you don't believe him tell him to show you the other accounts to compare that being said if you want to learn more about facebook ads you can check my book my course and my website of course and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
