So that's an idea that came to my mind. We tested it for about a month right now and of course it's working, why not? Because basically, we are taking the best sellers that we see that they exist on the market based on reviews and based on sales and we just do our ads with them and we're having good sales.

So if you're selling products that you can find also in other places, just starting to see in the marketplaces which of the designs are selling the best and try to go with that. Now, second thing that I wanted to discuss today and maybe it's our main topic, it's I'm a little bit tired of all of this craziness με τον τρίπου Βαλ και ΧΙΡΟΣ και αυτές τις τρίτοις πράγματα που θα δημιουργήσουν να δημιουργήσουν να έχουν, όπως λέγονται, κατασύνουν με τα κατασύντα. Ή έχω βίντεο στο YouTube για αυτό, αλλά με δημιουργήσω μου πάνω μου πάνω, γιατί πιστεύω ότι έχουμε την Αντριατήτρα του Αντριατήτου.

Αυτό που δημιουργείται αυτό. Αντριατήτρα του Αντριατήτου, γιατί όλοι που ήταν σκορές του Αντριατήτου, were becoming affiliates and they were selling also his scores. So they were doing videos about him and so on.

And this was his model. So the same model is being used by Triple Whale and Hyros. Everybody is proposing them because they are taking a percentage as an affiliate.

So you're seeing so many people that they are just proposing this and that. And you say, if all of these people are proposing it, then that means that I should also use it. So let me tell you what is happening with these apps.

First of all, I'm not against them. I will have to say that. And I will go into details for each one of them.

But just in a general way, let me tell you that these apps are very good for business owners. in order to know a lot of things like what is the lifetime value of a customer of mine. If I have a subscription model, what is the actual retention rate?

When people are coming and how many months it's taking them to leave so that they can know what my cost per purchase would be. For example, this is a major issue that we have in subscription based businesses. When there's a subscription model, we don't know when we are onboarding someone, what's the cost per acquisition has to be in order for us to be profitable.

Because this person might come with $10 per month, but maybe they're going to stay over there for a year. So this is $120. That means that we can onboard them with $100, with $90, $80 so that the company can make money.

Of course, in order for us to do that, we need a lot of time and we need to be able to actually have data in order to decide the retention rate and to see that. But these programs are also helping us a lot because they are seeing each one of the users. they are understanding what the users are doing and they are understanding the lifetime value that they have because we are going to be able to know all of these people for how long they're going to stay in our business.

This is the lifetime value of the customer. So that being said, that being said, that being said, we have all of these data that are coming and we know how much money someone has spent to our store, how long it took them, how many times they came back, how much time they passed to our sites, all of this kind of stuff, which are very important information for business owners. but are these programs useful in terms of the data that they are going to give me as a Facebook marketeer?

The answer is yes and no. Let me explain. So my main issue and the way that the Facebook platform is working, as we said several times in this channel, is that it's getting a sale and then it's getting another sale which is being held by the previous sale and all of this data that are fueling the next sales that are going to come.

It's a part of optimization that the algorithm is doing. If, and the whole idea came after the iOS 14 that we don't have proper reporting anymore, so we need to know what's the actual situation. We need to know what's the actual situation, but it's not going to help us in optimization.

And this is a debate that they have with some people that they just don't understand that whatever Facebook cannot see, it cannot optimize towards it. So if in reality we're having five sales in an ad set, but Facebook is seeing two, it's going to use the data of these two sales in order to optimize and not the data from the five. And a lot of times there are people that they are trying to scale by using the data of Triple Whale or Hyrus or any other app that exists out there.

And this is the biggest mistake because then you are entering the realm of actually gambling. and then you are entering the data of the company. So my problem is that there is this craziness of people proposing them and they are not even analyzing in technical, on the technical side, if this is going to help them on the Facebook side.

So the situation is this. If these programs are, you want to use these programs in order for you to be able to know lifetime value customer, to know, for example, because they said yes and no, to know, for example, if, okay, I'm seeing 2.5 ROAS, but what is the ROAS in reality? Okay, you need to know that.

You should not be, you should not say, okay, this is the ROAS on the Facebook platform, I don't care about what's happening in reality. You should care what is happening in reality. The problem is how you're going to optimize it.

Okay, maybe by observing Hyrus and the Facebook ads, you are going to see that whatever, 1.7, for example, ROAS is working for your business or 2.5 ROAS is working for your business based on what you see there as a combination. But you cannot optimize based on what you see on Hyrus because Facebook doesn't see it and it's not going to optimize with it. So this is my problem with it.

And there are a lot of people that they say that we go to a cookie-less, cookie-less periods and social media platforms period. so we will have to use these programs eventually. We can use these programs but it doesn't mean that the optimization that we're going to do based on them is going to be correct.

And from my personal experience by using these programs a lot of times with people that they were stubborn enough and they forced me to do it, I can tell you that it's not working because the moment you're starting to optimize with false data, you are scaling ads that you shouldn't and then everything just collapses. On the other hand, there are businesses that they don't care so much about what is happening on the platform and they are just optimizing with these programs, which is fine as long as, you know, you have different metrics that you are watching so that you can define success. There are commodities, for example, that they care about the cost per click in the platform because they're going to make them convert anyway along the journey.

they're so confident of their funnel. So this is my opinion about Triplewell and Hyros and now we're going to go a little bit in detail for each one of them. But let me tell you that don't fall for because you see so many talk about them.

The fact that you see so many talk about them is because a lot of times people are lazy and they just want to find a magical solution which is going to help them. But this is not the solution for Facebook ads optimization. it is a solution for business owners to know what is happening in reality.

In other words, they could use these programs anyway even before iOS 14. Okay. And these programs, by the way, existed because before iOS 14 they just found a new use and a new story to say.

Also, I don't like the fact that companies like Hyros, I have seen mails from their tech support that they say that yes, Hyros is sending data back to the asset level that helps for optimization. This is a total lie and I'm not the biggest fan of Alex Becker. I respect the guy but I think that he's a little bit ruthless based on what I see on crypto also and stuff.

I think that he's a little bit ruthless and that he would do this kind of stuff or maybe he doesn't even know and the guy who is managing the sales on Hyros took this decision without telling him. Who knows? But telling that Hyros or I never heard it from AAA to be honest but telling from Hyros reps that look this thing is working and it's sending data to the asset level for optimization it's a total lie.

It's not happening because it's not even partnered with Facebook in a way of doing that. Now have I used Triple Whale and Hyros? Yes.

Am I going to use them in the future or force my clients to use it? No. I don't think that it's necessary.

Is it helping? It's helping a lot does it worth the money? Triple Whale is cheaper to be honest with you it worth the money Hyros doesn't even worth the money it's super expensive for what is giving.

Both of them are good in terms of tracking and everything I have nothing to say about that. I must say that Triple Whale is a little bit better in a way of actually having faster reporting okay so it has a 24 hours faster reporting so sometimes and I'm going to say that but you're not going to use it in most cases because it's for very exceptional accounts if you're working in Europe with faster reporting on 24 hours you are able when you see one asset working to scale it super fast for example when an asset is spending 1k you are watching Triple Whale and you are doing a bump of 20k you're putting 21k for example in order for the asset to spend 5-6k so you're trying to push more budget because if the asset doesn't start at 12 o'clock and you put 20k it's not going to spend 20k it's going to try to spend as much as it can so the more budget you put the more you push it to spend more if you see that something is working anyway this is a very complex strategy that I wouldn't suggest you to do it's for very big accounts and stuff and it needs a lot of you know monitoring while you are doing it but yeah it's a very interesting thing that you can do only with Triple Whale I have done it and I can tell you that it's working flawlessly so that's my opinion about Triple Whale and Hyros now you know how to use them and I hope that you're going to use them wisely also let me tell you that all the agencies are proposing them and yes of course they're proposing them because it's an extra income for them now now that we're done with Triple Whale and Hyros I would like to tell you that in the description of the podcast there's a link for my affiliation link with Triple Whale no I'm actually joking it's not let's go and talk about something else I was watching a video the other day there were some people that they were saying that when you are having negative comments into your posts you should go and you should reply to them and everything let me tell you that I think that there are posts that they can be saved for example if someone is saying something about shipping you can go and you can address it and you can say that hey our shipping times is this and that if someone is saying for 3-4 weeks so that you can pass a message whatever you are doing into your comment section it has to give a message to the other people so don't go into fights with people over there if you see someone not being able to communicate in a proper way and actually do a proper discussion about it just hide the when you are having a page sadly you have to be a dictator there is no freedom in a page you can do whatever you want and you can represent the brand in the way that you want and of course there are situations that somebody is very polite and they are saying something and I don't think that you are going to has them but I think that there are some cases that people can be extremely rude and people can be extremely toxic just because of the anonymity of social media and I think that because of that you should hide the comments now on that note I need to say also something else I need you to understand this a lot of times when you are doing dynamic ads and this is a technical thing or we are doing normal ads and everything the the first thing that the ads are using is the engagement so this is also the reason that we are saying that you should not use images with videos together because one second of play and as you scroll down all the videos most of the videos autoplay so one second is considered engagement the images need more than clicking or commenting or anything in order to engage so when you're having engagement by comments and somebody is engaging for example you have a t-shirt and you have a spelling mistake when you have a spelling mistake on the t-shirt maybe there are going to be people that are going to come and they're going to say oh my god you don't know how to spell this and start laughing at you or whatever and this is also considered engagement the problem is that Facebook is not able to understand that this is a negative engagement and not a good engagement so what this is doing is that it's spending more money so whenever you're doing your ads if you're seeing one of your ads spending a lot of money and you're seeing that it's also engaging well having clicks and everything just go check also the comments if you're not having sales of course because at the end ads because Facebook at the start it's taking the engagement says okay this ad set is engaging very well this creative is engaging very well so I'm going to give it more budget so that it's going to have sales eventually this is how it's working and then it's optimizing with a conversion event it has to start from somewhere where is it starting from the engagement side so these are the little things that we need to monitor because we say that we trust the algorithm a lot and we trust the algorithm doing everything and optimizing and finding the proper audiences with the help of the pixel and everything but at the end of the day we need to also check the engagement and if it's bad or not in order to understand if Facebook is optimising for a wrong gadget because it thinks that it's good because of the engagement that being said I want to share a story I had and this is also one of the reasons that I actually don't criticize the creatives a lot of times I was criticizing the creatives and I was telling I don't like this I like that or whatever and then there is a period that I was working with a company that was having t-shirts and they were doing a lot of different creatives and designs and on one of them there was a spelling mistake the guy that was working with them it was a very talented designer but he was from India so he did a spelling mistake in a t-shirt I don't even remember the quote so it was back in the days that and I don't care something like that and it was selling okay it was not that competitive so there was a spelling mistake let's say that he wrote mommy with IE and everybody was putting comments below saying oh my god you don't know how to spell and stuff and everything but the t-shirt was selling like crazy crazy and this is the this is when I realized that it doesn't matter what opinion I have for creatives or what opinion the owner has for creatives of course there is a direction and we can say we like this or that let's test it or keep a brand guideline and say okay let's test this and that it looks okay but at the end of the day you never know what is going to work and what doesn't until you are going to test it do you know what is the funny part the funny part is that we corrected the spelling mistake and we ran ads with a correct ad with running it to a page that had a new t-shirt with a correct spelling now and it wasn't selling at all so we kept running the other ad that it was having the spelling mistake it was selling very well as a design for some reason that we don't know and we were just laughing with all the people mocking us below in the comments saying that we have a spelling mistake and stuff it was a very funny incident that happened and this is the reason and this is the way that I realized that you should not criticize all the creatives that you see you should just test them now in other news we are having Mark Zuckerberg actually firing 100,000 people from Facebook and I don't know if this is related with Metaverse and all the people that he hired there but when I first heard that I just prayed for a second that this 100,000 people they're Facebook representatives imagine if he fired 100,000 Facebook representatives that would be amazing because my phone is ringing all the time from Facebook representatives and they're causing so many issues there are cases that they just try to talk to the client and they say you should do this and that and they try to make them spend money in a wrong way and you know my opinion about Facebook representatives we have already said it in a previous podcast but at the end of the day I was saying to myself how better was Facebook going to be if he didn't fire people that they were doing their actual job in the engineering department or whatever and he would fire all the Facebook representatives and then he would hire some people for customer support that would be amazing news for me and I have seen his video of him almost crying that he fired all these people does anyone believe him that he actually cares I don't think that he does care about that we had also Elon Musk firing so many people from Twitter and then we saw some people in the United States they call them liberals I don't understand the concept sorry I don't understand what are the Democrats and stuff sorry for that but at the end of the day there are people that they said they are not going to be now on Twitter because Elon Musk is actually changing the things here and there well let it be all I know is that for example I made a Twitter account and I'm going to be active from now on posting there some of my opinions about Facebook ads because to be honest with you it's not about Elon Musk it's a long period now that I want to test Twitter even to ads eventually to it I don't know but I think that Twitter is a platform that and this is what really intrigued me when I was discussing with people that they have Twitter they told me on how much they love the platform which is the only time that I'm talking with people that they are using a platform and they say how much they love it instead of how much they hate it for example myself or other people they say I should delete TikTok because I'm losing so much time to it I should not be on Instagram because it's making me toxic to post pictures of having fun while others can be at their homes and I'm trying to tell them how awesome I am so things like that they exist on the other platforms but when you see Twitter you're seeing people that they actually love the platform and they love the community and everything and yes it's a super toxic community in some ways but let me tell you that for me when I realized it it was a little bit shocking that there is actually a platform that people love to use and they really like okay so that being said let's move to another topic yeah okay so I was debating with a person it's not a client it's actually a friend the other time not a friend he's a business owner and we were discussing a little bit and he was telling to me this when I'm doing top of funnel campaigns I want to exclude all of my past clients or people who engage with my social media because I just want from Facebook to give me fresh people all the time let's discuss a little bit about that whenever I'm using I'm not using it but whenever I see it being used in I'm talking for changes like going from three rows to one for the top of funnel and then the owner can come and say yes but this is true top of funnel it's not actually retargeting people and I totally agree I'm not going to say that Facebook is sane and it's not stealing sales from retargeting also on the top of funnel but let me tell you that based on what I told you earlier about Triple Whale and Hyros that this is totally fine what if we let Facebook steal some sales from our previous customers in the top of funnel which are going to be used for optimization in order for us to find more customers so what do we have we have two cases case number one is that we are excluding everyone and we are just trying to find super fresh new clients all the time I don't think that this is super sustainable also especially for businesses that they want to scale this is very difficult and the second thing is that we are having Facebook stealing some sales the rows that we are going to see are going to be higher but in that case maybe because of that we're going to win one or two or three people that we wouldn't win on the other case because we have more data and Facebook is using more data from our previous customers in order to optimize and have more sales in our top of funnel Now the debate is this do we actually want Facebook to do it in my opinion not necessarily but even if it does it it's fine another example is the automatic we know that we have four placements that are only working when we see we don't use it always of course with train pixels we can go to only the four placements but when we see that this is working better this is what I'm teaching to my YouTube channel that whatever is working is working and you should not touch it so if automatic placements is producing better results just because Facebook wants to push the concept and they want to steal some money if at the end of the day I'm still winning more from what I'm losing I'm totally fine with it okay so the same situation is happening with the cold traffic ads if in the cold traffic ads Facebook is stealing some sales from people that they were going to convert anyway or they were going to convert in our Google they are stealing sales from each other that it's helping them to actually optimize and get more sales fine let it be so in my opinion we should not be so you know strict with Facebook and stuff because at the end of the day it's data sorry I'm having a short throw today so if it's taking all of this data and it's going to optimize it's fine let them to be a mess as a business owner to be able to understand how much you're winning for this platform but this is e-commerce e-commerce is not a thing of I'm selling five I'm getting ten I'm winning five you need to watch it from a holistic view and you need to understand how it's working as a total if you want to advertise on several platforms be sure that each platform is going to steal sales from the other platform email marketing is going to it's going no email marketing is not going to steal sales but Facebook is going to steal sales or Google is going to steal sales from email marketing branded content ads on Google they're stealing sales so be prepared of having something like this and be able to evaluate the whole effort that you're doing with your social media as a whole and not as how much I'm winning from Facebook how much I'm winning from Google it has to be a total effort that is going to work so on that I think that nobody should actually go and exclude past customers and whenever I do it guys I can tell you that the results are much worse and of course we know that the rose is going to drop but the issue is is also that we are also losing potential sales because we are not having all the data that we could have the other day also I was watching another guy talking about he he he's a Greek marketeer he was talking about Facebook ads that he's doing Facebook ads and that he's disappointed that we have to change platform and stuff guys if you are disappointed from Facebook change platform stop advertising to it so that all of us that we know how to advertise on Facebook we can stay and we can have proper results for us it's going to be less competition and this is something that also happened after the iOS 14 changes there are a lot of people that they have led the platform and that means that we have a new after iOS what happened a lot of people led the platform so now we have a new balance and people that have companies that they can actually advertise because back in the days you could run ads with let's say having 5 or 10 dollars cost per purchase and that was very good for your business and your business was profitable but when more people came to the platform this cost per purchase and the CPM rows and we had more sales we had less sales for the people and the people needed to rework their numbers and stuff so the companies that they needed 5 or 10 dollars cost per purchase sustainably in order to be able to be profitable they just left the platform and it's totally fine because they protected their businesses there are other companies that they have actually changed their numbers they increased their average or value so that they can be able to operate with Facebook or Google with higher cost per purchase so that being said if you cannot advertise to Facebook you should not advertise to Facebook and if you can make changes in order to adapt to the situation of Facebook nobody invited you on Facebook if you make the changes you can come and you can advertise to Facebook it's totally fine but don't tell that Facebook because this is total BS if you are so obsessed with TikTok and you think that TikTok is the solution go there and just watch and discuss with other people that they're just saying the same thing the CPMs are very low but the sales are not there of course the sales are not there and maybe TikTok is going to become a better and better platform as the years pass by because and they're actually saying it so whatever we see now maybe on TikTok it's like how Facebook used to operate at the starting years but as TikTok is growing and growing the algorithm is going to become better the algorithm is going to understand what people like and don't like and it's going to have more sales and more sales but not yet maybe in two years from now because it needs data and is that actually we're having TikTok having all of their interests being populated from credit card information from companies that are selling to TikTok instead of having an algorithm that's populating this interest because it understands what every people want which was also the biggest power of the Facebook algorithm that understands the behaviors of people for example if I'm having my cat sugar here Facebook understands that I own that if I'm speaking a language it understands that I do this or that this is why I'm saying that Facebook is a platform that is actually convincing people to buy something that they didn't know that they wanted five seconds ago that being said totally fine guys whoever cannot advertise on Facebook they can leave they can let us stay continue advertising because Facebook has such a huge potential and it didn't lost that they are just businesses that they were super spoiled in terms of the results that they were getting and they just didn't do the extra step of adapting to the situation for the next for the changes that actually happened now I have two more topics and then we're going to go to some of my print screens how much time to 36 36 36 36 is fine we have 30 more minutes of me talking so first of all we have I was talking to a company the other time they have bought another company and something happened so they bought a company but they couldn't take the pixel that the company was using so my question was to them why did you buy the company if you cannot take the pixel because if a company is actually having the majority of their sales on Facebook and you're not taking the pixel with you when you're buying the company what's the point of acquiring the company and then I realized also something else I realized that they bought a company that had inflated numbers let me tell you how this is working I hope that this podcast is going to help at least one of you understand how this scam it's not a scam but it is a scam we have spent this amount of money and we have made this amount of money on the platform what they're doing though is that they go to their ad account for example they spend 100k and then they have for example a revenue of 8k so they have 0.8 ROAS what they do is that they go and they delete the 50k spent from their ad account and then they say that in order for us to get this revenue we run ads with only 50k and we got 80k for example and now someone can say you can go and you can see the deleted for example let me tell you that a lot of people are not doing that I'm actually working with one company that is helping other companies to acquire and I if a purchase should happen if a company is legit or not if the numbers that they say they're actually there the situation is that a lot of times they're hiding it in the deleted section by deleting campaigns so that they can say that this is the actual spend that we spend in order to get this revenue so they're deleting spend from the ad account or they're having another ad account that you will never see that they're running more ads there so they show you the one ad account which spent 100k they show you 300k revenue but maybe there's another ad account that spent 200k and this is how it's working this is how they're inflating numbers and they're showing you that this company is making X amount of money with X ROAS and then you give it to someone to run the ads and you're just seeing 0.8 ROAS the same ROAS that they were also getting with their brands I have seen this a lot of times happening I hope that this podcast by saying that is going to help a lot of people to understand that most of the times the good companies that they make a lot of money and they have 3 4 5 rows that are not being sold and the companies that are actually being sold in the e-commerce business is the companies that are actually distressed so there are companies that they are not doing well and they are being sold so that someone can take them and actually reform them and make them better just because they have already some clients this is the situation most of the times the profitable ones are not being sold and and this client is actually having a very interesting brand and I really like to work with her and everything and we're discussing about the ad account and she is telling me that the only ad she has run is Kickstarter and because she had very good success with Kickstarter something like spent 10k and got 100k she thinks now that we can have the same results by spending 10k have the same on the actual side just a second the fact that you have spent 10k in a Kickstarter campaign or in a campaign that goes to Kickstarter however you may call it it doesn't mean that if you spend 10k you're going to have this amount of sales on your store these are two different things a Kickstarter campaign is different and having an actual store with actual sales purchases and stuff it's a completely different funnel so for whoever is doing Kickstarter ads let me tell you that the situation after that is going to be completely different and you know that you have a proof of concept you know that people like your product you know all of that which is very important it's 90% of the job but after that the numbers that you're going to have in actual situations by having R2 card checkout purchase repeated customers and all of that it's completely new situation that you have to discover you don't know for example Kickstarter is a site or Indiegogo is a site that is it Indiegogo Indiegogo I think it's called it's a site that they're actually they're optimized for fundraising you don't know if the site that you have made it's actually good for purchases and stuff you need to start testing your funnel optimizing it making it better make the experience and the funnel better for your clients so that being said don't make assumptions for different kind of funnels if something is working for example the same thing happened with a company they were having a site in WordPress then they did another site in Shopify because most of the people actually integrate to Shopify nowadays and let me tell you that they didn't have the same results until we go through a process of optimizing the site all over again so that we can go back to the normal numbers because they changed completely the site and they did a rebranding so that being said whatever you do on Facebook understand that each funnel is going to be different and you have to work through the process of course having proof of concept is very important because you know that you are not trying to sell something that is not selling but at the end of day always have into your mind that Kickstarter for example and an actual store with purchase and stuff they're two completely different situations now let's go to my print screens there are some things that I have prepared here okay so first of all the previous time we were discussing preset today I have seen a message yesterday I have seen a message about a new purchase preset that Facebook has with 10 options and this time maybe they're watching the podcast I don't know they don't have any cost per click they don't have anything else they just have attribution setting which is important purchases website purchases meta purchases cost per purchase budget amount spent budget which is all the things that so just because the other time I was saying a lot of bad things about Facebook about the purchasing and stuff let me tell you that this time I totally agree with this preset and I think that if I said anything bad about the previous preset about this preset I totally agree and since I don't have that big ego I should say good job to Facebook whenever he's doing a good job and I should say the things that I said in the first podcast about the first preset whenever they're doing a bad job so next thing is I was watching the other day one job post and before I say anything about this job post I want to say this I am sick and tired of watching all of these job posts with agencies guys it's enough it's enough and I'm seeing all these kiddos 20 years old 21 years old and I totally blame Iman Gazi for that okay he did the whole thing with agencies and him and Tai Lopez and they convinced all the people that they just can become agency owners and now we see so many job posts in Appwork that there are so many agency owners I'm starting an agency I'm starting an agency I'm starting an agency and you also see the attitude of people saying you're going to work for me if you have to be hungry you have to be that and I'm sure that videos from other people and I'm totally against that way of showing or flexing money in order to convince people to follow you and take your course and stuff I don't like it at all I think that it's actually consuming your soul and you're becoming something else at the end and you're just living I'm not saying that these people are not having money I'm just saying that they're just this is so sad you can do so much things with your money and nobody know and actually have fun instead of just not leaving the moments and just being always in a mobile phone trying to video film it and just show it to other people so that they can be convinced and buy your course about having an agency and then we have the situation that we have all of these people analyzed how an agency actually worked and stuff by the way this client is coming to work with me again on December because he worked with them only for one month and he cannot do it anymore so the situation is that I'm talking to more and more and more people that they are just have a bad experience with an agency and it's all about people convincing that convincing others that they know about who they're going to hire they don't care about their media buyers if they're going to be good or bad and if they're going to have a good service anyway I think that agencies right now they are a big huge issue for the industry because there's so much fake credibility out there and so many bad agencies that they're just promising crazy things or they're just working without money or just spending money or they're just doing whatever they're doing which I think that they're causing a lot of problems and they're just making people more reluctant when they come to Facebook ads so well done to all of you that you're flexing money and you're just convincing 20 years old kids to have an agency and stuff and hire people from India or Bangladesh and I'm having nothing with the people from India and Bangladesh there's some very good professionals there but let me tell you that there are a lot of people in India and Bangladesh that they're just going to do a job for $10 or whatever and they are clueless about Facebook ads they're just going to watch a course of one hour and they're just going to do some basic ads so this is my problem with that and to be honest with you I'm not working anymore with agencies I only have some connections to some very serious agencies and because of the fact that I'm managing the ads on these agencies I can tell you that they are also doing well but in most cases I have seen people super disappointed come to work with me on one on one and the way that I work this is also one of the reasons that I will never become an agency because sadly I don't believe in hiring people to do Facebook ads even if that means that I'm going to work with less clients and selected clients that I'm going to have I'm never going to have employees that are going to do ads for me I have friends if I'm not going to have the capacity to refer but I'm not going to make an agency ever ever ever going to make an agency because I don't believe in it and even with my friends you're going to work in one on one but there's no way that I'm going to make an agency and I'm going to just be the person that is going to convince you to come and then delegate I'm just selecting also the people that I'm going to work with just because I don't have the capacity of working with everyone anyway that's the thing that I want to say about agencies let's go about the post that I read it says I have a small online business that sells Disney products I'm not going to continue reading this it actually brought me memories because back in the day I also tried to sell Disney products I was clueless at that point I thought to myself that's amazing I'm having a business which is having so much marketing about their products and about everything so I'm just going to sell their products but little I know Harley Davidson Gucci and Disney I think these three companies they are the most cruel ones when they come to copywriting things so whoever is selling these products let me tell you that even if you spend one dollar or one penny they have complete legal departments that they're going to hand you even in hell in order to take you money for what you have done and they are ruthless and they don't care about that so because I didn't know and now I think that this is something that everybody should understand but let I didn't know about that let me tell you that if you have an idea about selling products that are copyrighted you should not do it and now it's also the question that comes from some people why the people in China are doing it the people in China are in China you are not living in China and people can find you so even the people in China have problems but this in Europe if you live in United States you're going to have a huge issue with that and I didn't know it when I started it I didn't have a problem because it never went too far I realized it in the middle of actually trying to do it but let me tell you that if you are doing it now you should stop it immediately if you don't have a special permission and maybe this but I know that they are extremely costly and yeah I don't think that he has the way that he writes the post over there and yeah it was actually a good memory because it reminded me of how naive I was when I was starting doing e-commerce and how different I think right now after my experiences then we go to this one let me see what is this okay so it says I have set up a Facebook campaign to run traffic to my booking page for backyard remodeling I'm getting clicks at 0.5 but after sending over 150 people to my site I'm getting zero conversions well another topic that we can discuss over here is this it doesn't matter how many clicks you have what kind of CPM you have it doesn't matter what kind of cheap traffic you are bringing to your site it really matters if you are optimizing for conversion the algorithm is very strict in what you have to ask it's a machine you have to ask the thing that you actually want because if you don't it's going to give you clicks so traffic so when you want to have a lead for example into your page you need to do a conversion campaign with a lead event if you do traffic campaign and then you are trying to send a lot of people to your site and some to convert let me tell you that nobody is going to convert because Facebook is extremely capable of bringing you only junk traffic because it knows from all it knows all of that so guess what is going to happen it's going to send you all of these people that are going to places and they're not converting if you're asking for traffic campaign and for the people that they're asking for purchases it's going to send all the people that they have completed purchases because this brings more possibilities to actually completing but we should not blame Facebook because because if you're asking for traffic this is what you're asking and for you to say that hey I'm having 150 clicks but zero conversions means nothing okay so doing a conversion event and saying that you have 150 clicks and you get zero conversions it's completely different of saying that I'm doing a traffic campaign I'm having 150 clicks and I'm getting zero conversions there are two different worlds okay now that we said about that now we have another question from my group it says hi again I had some ads in a CBO campaign they were wrongly rejected after subsequently revised now I've placed new ads which were also rejected for very strange reasons a drawing of a gadget was shown in the woman's neck so most probably it goes for nudity now have collected a lot of offenses in a very short time we have to worry about that let me tell you about rejected ads when you're having rejected ads I think that you should not push too much okay so you're having rejected ads okay try to do another creative stuff don't try to push again the same and the same a lot of times these are wrongly rejected ads and you're going to review them and they're going to pass but when you're doing this kind of when you're having this kind of problems don't push with 50 100 ads at the time just try to do it in a slower pace so that you're not going to trigger any automatic mechanism of and maybe get you banned this is my suggestion also if you see that you're having a problematic creative try to go and create something else okay and these are typical situation with some accounts that they have a specific creative that they don't like just remove it from the equation and just also another thing that I want to say here is that recently one of my friends had an ad account which had a payment failure and this is also in the same category it's all about having ads that are not a threat for the community what I'm trying to say about the payment failure a lot of times after the payment failure we can see that the ad accounts are having very bad results so you're having very good results payment failure and then very bad results let me explain to you what is happening Facebook is working like this it's saying that whatever somebody is doing as an advertiser it's influencing the community and we try to protect the community from bad advertisers so when someone is not actually paying Facebook considers this a bad account what does a bad account mean that it might be another account that is not a threat for the community when another account is paying and everything is fine and they are not having rejections what is this account it's a good advertiser so it's not a threat for the community what does this mean we're going to give them better traffic so I don't know if Facebook is doing this deliberately in order to punish you if you are until it recovers again and I think that the reasoning behind that is that Facebook now from being a good advertiser immediately categorizes you in a bad advertiser and you might be a threat for the community which means that it's going to give you less quality traffic so very important and golden rule as an extent to what I said to my friend here about the rejected ads is that don't have rejected payment failures in your account because most probably you're going to regret it and it will take you some time to recover and be considered again not a threat for the community and a good advertiser sorry but this is how Facebook works it's not my fault then we have another question from a guy in my group it says I have a pretty good Advantage plus campaign shopping campaign how can I scale this the best possible way okay first of all let me tell you that for the Advantage plus campaigns the way that they are working is that first of all not all of you are going to have them but Facebook is working on actually putting them in all the accounts the thing with Advantage plus is that after you do the Advantage plus you should not do more I'm observing and I'm seeing that Advantage plus is working in a way that it's optimizing for one or two ads and after that it's forgetting all the others so there's no point for you to introducing more ads inside your Advantage plus the second thing that I when you are duplicating this campaign you are going to put a higher budget with more ads or you can put the same budget but instead of just increasing it what I would prefer personally is to duplicate this campaign and put other creatives more penetration to the market from more entry points or duplicate the same one even with the same budget or higher budget if you want to scale another way is the ABO optimization way which says that I have done it let me tell you that I have done it and I'm not disappointed from that either it can work also so in Advantage Plus what you can do is whatever we're doing in ABO optimization the whole purpose of Advantage Plus is that you're having one ad so that you can pass the learning phase what is the 50 events in the attribution conversion window which is going to be 7 days in that case and the truth is that it's working very well with low CPMs and everything so whenever you're passing the learning phase in order for you not to enter again the learning phase you should scale by 20% not more than 20% so every 2 days you can go and you can increase by 20% and see if you are for some people that they have less budget you can I guess you can do less not less I guess you can do more days so you can for example increase for 20% and then change the budget again in 5 days to see how it's going to go so increase by 20% see how it goes if it goes well increase another 20% another 20% this is the rule that we use in ABO optimization so this is also another way of doing it and I would propose you to use it also because to be honest with you I have tested it with Advantage Plus and it's working also well golden rule over here if you see that the ROAS are dropping so much that you don't want to drop so much start and decrease the budget by 20% in order to find your balance again to the budget that it's actually going to spend with the best possible results okay the next message is and I have and now we're going to the two last things that I wanted to point out before we close the podcast so do we have 10 more minutes how much it's on already okay so we'll do 10 minutes more so the thing is that there's a guy that sent me an email and he's from Sudan and he's telling me I'm from Sudan I cannot use Facebook platform what can you do if you're from Sudan you cannot if you're from Sudan and Facebook is banning the Facebook platform don't use it on the other hand I don't know try with a VPN or whatever but in my opinion if you live in a country that is banning Facebook and you want to use it for professional reasons either you have to move away from the country or you will just have to be okay with having always issues crazy crazy issues because you're using VPN or whatever and if you ever get banned don't blame Facebook for that blame your country that is not allowing Facebook and I know that there are more countries that are banning Facebook and everything which I think it's crazy but anyway now last thing this is about freelancer diaries one of my favorite topics so here we are having this one thing from reviews of course I'm going to hide the names and everything and just keep the text it says here I need a graphic art t-shirt designer it says for this person warning beware I have used the freelancer more than one time so I know her well I thought her talent was great until our recent contract I asked for original images for t-shirt collection in return I received breathtaking beautiful picture from her I thought until I searched them in Google yes Google she told me images straight from a stock photo website after sending her screenshots and exposing her she kept asking for more and more money to do replacement images why would I pay her more money and everything ok please don't waste your money here and you can see below that she actually worked with this person again and she says she is the best she is the best is the best is the best is the best so let me tell you what is happening over here and the reason that I'm showing this is to explain that there is one side guys which is called Graphic River ok so whatever you see on Fiverr for $5 is just something that people buy from Graphic River and they give it to you don't think that these are original works also I'm watching here that you paid here $50 $40 $7 one time so what kind of work do you expect original artwork for this amount of money just stop thinking whatever is cheap is cheap for a reason ok and if you don't know it because I didn't know it also go to Graphic River ok and then go to Fiverr or go to Upcork and see the portfolios of people you will see that most of these assets are being from there are being taken from there and it's totally fine for the amount of money that you pay ok so be careful of what you are paying and of course let me tell you that sometimes you might pay something for $1000 and it's still going to be from Graphic river ok so you have to be very strict with the people that you are working with for this kind of stuff and here I'm seeing that she's disappointed after working with her for 3-4 times but let me tell you that for the amount of money that you are giving her she's actually giving you something what do you expect here to tell you go and buy this image from the stock don't have the knowledge of specific areas you didn't have the knowledge drop shipping is working like this drop shipping is working based on the knowledge that you don't know that Aliexpress is existing and you can go and you can buy something from Aliexpress and I'm not saying that to blame here I'm saying that in order to tell you that whatever we are doing and whatever we are seeing on the internet it's based on the assumption that somebody doesn't know the thing that we know for example somebody doesn't have the knowledge that I have about Facebook ads this is what I'm using somebody else doesn't have the knowledge that you can buy this from Walmart and he is buying it and somebody doesn't know about drop shipping and how it's working so there are people that they are selling items with drop shipping and somebody doesn't know that you can go to Graphic River and you can buy a logo for $5 from there and sell it for $20 to someone on Fiverr okay these are things that are happening every day and let me tell you that they are very and that for an amount of money like that you shouldn't be so upset with here that she is using stock photos because everybody is actually using stock image and stuff I don't know what kind of idea do we have here about logos and everything they are not people that are just painting the logos or creating them in Illustrator from the beginning they are just taking them ready and they just I think that this podcast is the biggest one so far I had so many things to tell you for one more time I hope that you enjoyed it and until we meet again guys don't forget that you can check my book or my free course if you want to learn more about Facebook ads and you can check my link about Hyros I'm joking there's no link and until be creative and be consistent I will see you the next week in the next podcast which is actually the podcast before Black Friday it will be fun bye this was the Facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is and thanks you I I I I I I I I I I I I lot done there's all I I I I I you I I I I I I I I I
