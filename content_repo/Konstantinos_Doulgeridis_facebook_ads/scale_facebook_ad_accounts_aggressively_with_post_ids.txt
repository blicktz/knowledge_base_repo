Und you cannot scale because your ROAS is dropping or you cannot scale in a profitable way or whatever. What you need is credibility. If you take credibility from the comments, you are going to be able to scale more and more.

I have seen it. There is no doubt about it. I believe it 100%.

The post IDs are the one thing that even if you are a small account, they are going to help you go better. If you are struggling with some ROAS, they are going to give you better ROAS. If you are not having them, for instance, because you are not spending a lot, okay.

Try to find first campaigns that are working. και όταν θα πιστεύουν κάποιες πρώτες ιδέες και θα προσπαθούν να χρησιμοποιήσουν τα. Αλλά στην τελευταία του γεγονός είναι πολύ σημαντικά και για εμένα είναι η τελευταία ειδικά που θα παίρνεις και θα θα σκέψεις όσο μπορείς να μπορείς να κάνεις με αυτό.

Συγγνώμη για το μεγάλο μεσότητα εδώ, παρακολουθούν τα πράγματα και τα πράγματα αλλά όπως ξέρετε, θα προστατείωσα όλους μου κοινούς. Θα έχετε την πλήρη ιδέα για πώς αυτή η πράγμα είναι να δείξει. Basically, the thing here is this, you go to your business suite and after that you can click over here to the drop-down menu which I'm not going to click because it's going to migrate it in a shell and you can see all the different facebook pages that you have.

If you have a lot of different facebook pages because you're an advertiser this is where you're going to find it, you have access to them and what you're doing after that is you click on facebook comments and over there you're going to have a list. If you cannot see the list it's because maybe your virtual assistants or whatever they are doing work with. So, in press done for example, in order to see all of the ones that they have been shared and answered as questions.

So, when you're doing dynamic creative ads or normal ads, basically it's creating a lot of different post IDs based on the combinations that you're going to have. It's going to take copy one, headline two and video two for example from your dynamic ad. This is just one combination, one post ID.

If this one starts working very well, it's getting sales, comments, share and then if you don't have a way of finding those and using them, you can do nothing about it. For example, if we come here we can see that this specific, the first one for example, it has 145 comments. Okay, if we go on the next one 79.

Most of the times you're going to see the same video, the same creative, you're going to see all of that. Then we go 56 comments. Okay, and then we go 160 comments.

There are some bigger ones, two comments, 113 comments. You will see some small ones and bigger ones and you're doing that. Okay, so whenever someone is commenting on something, you are going to be able to find it here.

In other words, and if we want to put it in a very simple way, it's better to use a post ID that has, of course you can read the comments to see if it's good or bad or whatever, but it's better to use a post ID that has comments inside instead of doing another dynamic creative ad, for example, starting from zero building it. So that being said, the way that I have found that you can take this is by clicking on the date over here. So if we click on the date over here, we're going to be able to see one URL.

Okay, and this is our ad and we have the comments here, which again, sorry, but I'm going to hide. Over here, what you can do is you can take this ID, which I'm going to hide the half of it, so that you're not going to be able to find it. Sorry guys, but I don't trust you at all.

So you see, you copy all of it, you are going to see half of it because I'm blurring it. And then what you're going to do is, let's say for example, that we go in this account and we press, for example, creates us to make one dummy campaign. Let's do it at Banas Plus.

It's going to be easier. Okay, let's come here and then we click here, use existing post in order to do it. and if you come here and you click on this one, sorry for that, of course, you need to select Facebook page in order to do it.

So we selected the page that we want here. And if you go to select post now, we can use this one, the exact and boom, you have your post ID there. Now, a lot of times I see an indiscrepancy between the comments and the comments that you see there.

For example, in this specific situation, we could see that the comments were 93. We see 57 inside the ads manager when we do it, but it's still better than nothing. And I think that this is a way that it's going to help you.

What I like to do is that I like to use advanced loss campaigns with a lot of post ID. So I go to the comments, I take all of these different post IDs as different ads, and then I try to optimize them in an advanced loss campaign. And this is helping me to scale more and more ad accounts.

Let me show you for instance. Over here, for example, we're having one account that I'm having for a very long time. Basically, if we come here from...

I can go even back. I'm going to do a whole case study with this ad account, most probably. I don't believe that this is the actual spend.

I'm sure we have spent more than that. Let me see. Yeah, it's almost 900k.

So from February until now it's 900k. Let me compile all the ads that they have spent something on that period in order to see the results. Filter them by together.

You see, I'm taking also the bad draws just so you know. 5.64 hours. We generated 5 million dollars with this account.

The way that I have kept scaling this account is that I was doing a campaign. It was working well. After some point I was locating the post ID that it worked very well from all of my dynamic ads or the different ads that I had.

Of course, here we have a very steady flow of new creatives. We have the money to scale and we don't have problems with stock. The break of ROAS here is 4.

I'm scaling even more and I will continue scaling more. Except from one month that it was on 4 ROAS and over there I kept it stable so that I'm not going to lose my momentum in the scaling that I was doing. I believe that this month was June.

Let me see. So June I think it wasn't a good month. Yeah, it's 4.29.

Okay, we can see that the other months we hit 6.34. This month alone we are scaling 4.49 150k. On June we had 167k and we had 4.29.

This doesn't mean that we are going to just close all of our campaigns and stuff. This is where the experience of a media buyer comes. You have to talk with your client, you have to tell them that they have to be okay with it and the next month as you can see we got paid for that decision that we took because if we were going to scale down to 100k we wouldn't have the momentum of sending 150k so far and we have another 7 days.

If we see the spend yesterday it's on almost 6k. 6 multiplied by 7 makes 42k so basically this month alone we're going to spend 180k. 190k which is good because we are coming closer to the Black Friday period and we want to set ourselves ready of having an account.

By the way this account came to me in the previous year in August with a spend of 20k and in the first Black Friday we did 150k. Now we try to maintain that and now we go to the new Black Friday period with 200k or 250k in the previous month so that we can spend 300k, 350k, 400k in the Black Friday period. This is the way that you're scaling accounts and this is how you maintain them and then you keep.

But the post IDs and this is what I want you to understand it was a very crucial part of this strategy and this is what helped me to actually scale these ad accounts. In another ad account over here for example we can see that that I'm using exactly the same thing with the post IDs. This ad account for example I'm scaling super hard because again I need to scale because I need to set myself to be ready for the Black Friday period.

In this ad account I wasn't able to spend as much as I could because of stock issues from the client but now that he gave me the green light on June I had 82k spent with 6 ROAS and this month so far I'm going to hit 150k, 160k spent with 7 ROAS. I even increased the amount of ROAS that I'm getting. This campaign for example over here is post IDs.

This campaign over here is post IDs. Of course I have to hide the names again as I said but you get the point that there are a lot of campaigns here that they are bringing me volume in their post IDs and they are helping me improve my ROAS and I keep building them more and more by spending to them. So in this one right now I'm setting myself to 150k.

Most probably in the next month I'm going to go to 200k, 250k and just try to have a very good Black Friday. Let's go to another account which operates with a little bit less ROAS over here. Let's go to this ad account for example that operates with two ROAS as a break-even.

I'm hitting 2.78k this month. I'm scaling most probably to 160k. Last month it was 86k.

The reason as I said that I'm doing this kind of scaling is because first of all I have the post IDs. Right now after a year of running ads and having all of these variations now I'm in a position of using them and plus I need to go to this kind of numbers if I want to go strong with Facebook ads into the Black Friday period. Like, What i have other money on theναnate I saw this over 4k alongside some people.

But I still tried to carry on лон hour and lite planning for the tempo. Which is like, what if you normally have the legal money for the monthly control? That's OK.
