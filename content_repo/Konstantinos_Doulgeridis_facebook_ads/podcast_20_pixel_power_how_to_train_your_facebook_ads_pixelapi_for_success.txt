Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News podcast. Hello fellow friends, so we are here for another podcast. Just a heads up, the Greek Orthodox Easter is coming, so I don't believe the next week, the other week, most probably one week we will not have a podcast, but for sure we will have in the next week one, maybe we will not have in the week after.

So welcome everybody, it's another podcast about Facebook Ads. Today we're going to talk more about Pixel and how to train it and how it helps us and what is our ultimate call with Pixels. But before that, let's talk a little bit about what is happening right now with the ad accounts.

To be honest with you, I can see all of my ad accounts recovering super fast, especially the trained Pixels from what happened in the middle of March, which was a very bad period across accounts and I'm seeing consistent good results for the good accounts. The smaller accounts with the new Pixels, and this is the reason that we make this video today about the Pixels and everything, they are struggling a little bit more. But you know, I'm always up for the challenge.

One thing that really makes me happy is that I see more and more people coming to my YouTube videos that they spend 5k, 6k, 7k and this is the reason that we have this channel because we want to have advanced content and not beginner content. Okay, we will make from time to time some beginner-friendly videos but the ultimate goal of this account is to have a very strong community with people that they understand and they also have experience with Facebook ads. Now, this is going to give us a slower growth but it doesn't matter.

Before we go to the main topic which is the the Pixels and everything, I would like to discuss about one thing and then we will go to the main topic and then two questions. And these are the things that I gathered for today. More and more people talk to me through the YouTube channel, I go to the accounts and I see people who are disappointed from agencies that they are just running three campaigns.

One testing campaign, one ABO testing campaign which are spending a lot of money, one campaign which is a cold traffic campaign with one ad set and then just one retargeting. So, we analyzed several times why the agencies do that because they don't care about the individual results of another account or having a good relationship with someone. They care about the masses and having another account, another account and if this thing is working, okay, but they work with volume.

So, they don't care about that. You cannot and to be honest with you, there was this other podcast that somebody was mentioning that he was having very good results with having several campaigns like 50 or 60 dollar campaigns and having 100 of them and then having like very good results. Well, I'm telling this for the past five years.

I don't know why people were amazed when somebody tells it in a podcast. Maybe I don't have the luxury of being so famous so that these things can go faster to more people but still, I don't believe in the consolidation in other accounts and they believe that you should run a lot of campaigns. I totally believe that if you're in a situation and you are listening to this podcast that you're having just three campaigns or one campaign and you're spending a lot of money in your account, this is not the correct way to go and you should change it because you need to have more campaigns in order to target more hot pockets.

That being said, I know that there are a lot of agencies out there that they claim that they know how to do Facebook ads but they don't and the problem is that there's a lot of fake credibility in what we do and a lot of people are going to say a lot of things so before you even and to be honest with you, if they show you one or two other accounts it doesn't prove anything because maybe it's a good account that doesn't need any effort. It doesn't mean that they're good with Facebook ads. Try to see some proof if you want to work with someone or at least try to understand what they are saying and if it makes sense.

The reasoning that this is what Facebook proposes is not something that makes sense but on the other hand you can tell me that Konstantinos they can come and they can tell us that look this is what we have seen that is working very well across other accounts. Well you can say nothing about that and sadly there are a lot of people that they say this kind of stuff and I was having a discussion with a person the other time and these people they are actually proposing that they are going to work for you for free and guess what if you accept that you're just working with the worst of the worst because there's no way that somebody who knows how to do Facebook ads is going to work for free unless it's a very exceptional case and one account that he believes a lot in, a lot to it. But on the other hand the only thing that they want to do is just to get trained with your own money and this is why they don't get want to get paid because they want to get your money, spend it and actually learn how to do Facebook ads.

So when somebody is offering you to work for free if the results are not there either they have seen it in a course for having a Facebook ads agency or they have seen it as a way of actually being able to spend your money and get experience without caring basically what's going to happen. And if it's going to work it's going to work they're going to it's going to be fine but if it doesn't who cares for them. Now that we cleared this out because I had some discussions with people that they had bad experiences with agencies and also the structure that they have three campaigns and everything you can check my videos and stuff and you can see that in this channel we propose something completely different and we propose of having a lot of campaigns and spreading your budget so that you can be able to have better results and it's working flawlessly at least for us.

Now let's go to our main topic. The reason that I want to actually talk about this is because one of the most common questions that I get, the first question that I get is and we have I think questions like that today I'm having a CBO campaign which is working can I add more ads inside? I'm having an advanced class that is working can I add more ads inside?

And the answer is no as a simple answer but we will explain it later. But the second biggest question that I get it's one similar to Christophe here which says from the end of October I was selling on my account using creative ads set up with two campaigns, each with four ads sets where each added ad set was a separate interest of about 3.5 million recipients. He talks about potential reach.

Everything was working fine but in mid-February these ads started to work less and less when I switched them off. So it was working less and then he closed them, he turned them off. I then created two new campaigns on Advantage Plus for two products and this is also working poorly.

Should I put all my products in one Advantage Plus ad or maybe the pixel is too fresh and I should go back to creative ads? Now this question actually made me understand that we need to explain a little bit of how the pixel is working and the API okay and first of all before we do that I would like to let you know that there is one interview that I have with the CEO of Wicked Reports, Scott DeCoselay, which you can go and you can watch and we go very deeply inside reporting and to what is pixel, how it works and everything. I think you will get a lot of good information there.

So what is the pixel? The pixel is a unique code that we get from the Facebook and we put it on our site so that it's going to be able to report what people that they're clicking on the advertisements on the platform, what they're doing when they enter to our site. So all of this is being reported back and if we're optimizing for example for a purchase event if a purchase is being reported back it says that Konstantinos was the one that had the purchase so Facebook says okay let's find more people like him.

What most people didn't know before iOS because after iOS everybody started talking about pixel and API and there were people that they were getting more educated about it. What they didn't know before that it was that the pixel gets trained and the API. So the more you are getting sales the more it's going to understand the ideal avatar of your clients.

Now this is good and bad for example if you're having a very broad audience for example the traveling niche it's very difficult to train a pixel to a traveling niche. If you are targeting a lot of countries it's very difficult to target a niche for a lot of countries with different demographics and everything. If you are targeting a sub-niche it's very difficult because it's going to be very small and most probably you won't have interests.

We will talk a little bit with different cases because I have some examples that I think that they're a little bit interesting but before that just so you know the more sales that you get the more your pixel ideas I understand the ideal avatar of your clients. What is the ultimate goal of each account? And this is also answering the question of Christophe here.

So Advantage Plus is a broad targeting campaign. It's a consolidation method but a broad targeting campaign. Broad targeting is the ultimate goal of each other account.

So what do we need in order to do broad targeting and by broad targeting I mean for example that you don't target men and women 1865. If you see on your breakdown of results that it's working for the ages of 18 to 55 women, you're not targeting men and you're targeting only women and we call this broad targeting because it is broad. We are not using any interest.

So initially this is the ultimate end goal so that you will be able to target very big audience and then your pixel is going to have the power to go inside there and pickpocket and pick the actual people that they're going to be buyers and they're going to help you get more sales, more sales, more sales. Now let's go to the journey from the beginning though. Let's say that you're starting with a new pixel.

How can you train it and then we will discuss about different pixels and the cases? First of all you're going to start with interests. That being said there are some niches that you cannot target interests which means that you have to go with general interests.

I will name one example. The biggest example here is the Christian niche. The Christian niche used to have interests like Jesus, Christianity, gospel music and all of this kind of stuff that you could use but all of these were available up to the previous spring.

After the previous spring and what happened with the removal of a lot of interests like the ones that they were about the LGBTQ or Jesus and stuff so that it's not going to target people that they are part of specific groups. We had the removal of these interests also and let me tell you that 150 interests or whatever they have been removed. Now that means that there are niches that you cannot target anymore with this kind of interest which is the first thing that we do when we start with a new pixel and there are others that you can like fishing for example you can still find interest and target it.

When you're having an audience and a niche which you cannot target with interests that means two things. First of all that you need to have to spend a lot of money in order to train it or you need to have organic traffic in order to keep getting sales to your pixel and then start doing eventually lookalikes. So the first step which is doing interests when you can to some niches that you cannot use interests it has to be skipped in a way either with spending a lot of money and just bending money to very big interests for example in the case of Christianity it can be Justin Bieber for example who is also somebody who expresses his feelings about Christianity stuff or Kanye West and stuff like that in order to find some people from the sub-niche of Christianity inside the Kanye West niche.

Now the situation is that either you will burn a lot of money as I said or you will have another way of getting traffic and training your pixel up to the point and you will be able to do lookalikes. When we can target with interest because of the second one you just wait and you just do a simple retargeting and you wait for the pixel to get ready when you are having by the way the pixel I forgot to say that it's going to be removed on 2024 so we're going to be left only with API so you should use both of them. Basically pixel is browser to server reporting and API is server to server reporting.

It's not as fast as the pixel but it's more effective and right now we have both of them working in accounts especially for Shopify accounts in order to have the best possible reporting but we know from Facebook that the picture is going to be removed eventually and we're just going to have the APIs because it's more it's having better reporting. And if you want to know my opinion about the programs that they can help you with better tracking and everything you have to watch the wiki reports interview with the CEO Scott. When we are having interests and we can actually go down this path and have this kind of option we start with smaller interests so in there's of one two three four five million maybe five ten million something like that and then when we have consistent results with that we go to bigger ones then when we have consistent results with that we go to bigger ones.

Don't forget that when you do CBO campaigns you should not put on the different ad sets completely different potential reach so if you put a potential reach in one ad set of 30 million and in another one only 2 million in an ad set Facebook is going to spend the money to the one that has the biggest potential reach so be careful on that if you want to actually be able to do it efficiently. The other thing that I need to mention and of course you have the crazy method which if you have if you have some success in a bigger audience you can go and you can do the crazy method in order to find success to the hot pockets of this big interest. Another thing that I want to mention is the grouping so let's say that you have a very small interest like 200k 300k and you don't want to run it alone you have you can group it with other interests and create a bigger audience but you have to be careful and you have to group same size of audiences because if you group one audience of 200k and another audience of 10 million Facebook within the ad set is going to spend all the money just to the 10 million so if you want to test efficiently the 200k audience group together 200k 300k 400k 200k 300k and group them together until you create something big enough like 3-4 million.

Now that we passed the face of the interest after the point that you're having 100, 150, 200, 300 sales depending on how broad your niche is you're going to start testing lookalikes you're going to start with one percent lookalikes and you're going to do CBO campaigns with you know you're going to put in one ads at one percent in the other one one two two two two three three two four four to five you can put five percent you can put three percent two percent you know at the start start with smaller audiences also again for the lookalikes and then if something is working integrate it to the crazy method. After that point you have to start working with the crazy method and 10 percent lookalikes or five percent lookalikes when it's working very well with the smaller ones and do that in order to get more sales with your bigger lookalikes. And the last thing is that when lookalikes are working like this you do the stacked lookalikes so you go and you stack five percent out to cart, five percent initial checkout, five percent purchase, five percent view content, five percent top 25 visitors, you stack them in the same ad set and then you do crazy method and this is called the stacked lookalikes method which is working very well but it needs some good trained pixels because the audiences are very big like in the United States when you stack 10 percent lookalikes it's more than 50 60 million.

The last thing that I want to mention is the broad targeting. After you have all of these results you can break down your results you can see ages and demographics what is working and then just run broad targeting crazy method with this kind of thing in a CBO and of course now that we have Advantage Plus you need to start testing Advantage Plus from the point in my opinion since day one you have to test it in another account if it's not working because it's a broad targeting method go back to the interests and then go to lookalikes when you go to lookalikes test again the Advantage Plus when you go to broad targeting if broad targeting is working Advantage Plus is also going to work. So the ultimate goal of each other account here when you're training a pixel it's to be able actually at some point to go from interest to lookalikes and then to broad or from lookalikes to broad targeting if you don't have initial interests and we mentioned the different ways.

So this answers the question of Christoph here which says should I put all my products in one Advantage Plus ad or maybe this pixel is too fresh and I should go back to creative ads. It's not about the creative ads or the one ad set or whatever it's all about that Advantage Plus is a broad targeting method and if you have the option of doing lookalikes or interests because the Advantage Plus is not working then yes you should go back to doing this kind of ads until you are able to train your pixel enough to move to Advantage Plus which is going to help you scale and target in a very good efficient way broad targeting. Of course you know that I like to use a mix of them especially in other accounts that they're spending a lot of money but yeah here is your answer.

I want to mention two last things just so that I can give a little bit more examples about the pixels. One of them is I have some recent clients which they have the acne, the skin problem, this is why I wear my this is the acne but the whole thing is that the acne is a niche that the biggest problem that it has is that it is a part of a broader niche. For example we have a company which is called La Roche-Posay for example.

It's a French company and in this company they have also a acne skin treatment line. When you target La Roche-Posay because they are not interested to go specifically for acne when you target this then you're trying to get a sub audience from this full audience of La Roche-Posay which is also on the acne niche and you do this with Avene and you do this with another product and another product and another product and another product and you try to throw money to these interests trying to train your pixel with the sales that it's going to get so that eventually it can understand and go to look-alike audiences. This is one example to understand for example the acne is a very difficult niche because you don't have interest basically okay.

On the other hand it's a very easy niche to go for fishing and try immediately with audiences as we have explained in one of my videos about audience research. Now this has advantages and disadvantages. The advantage here is that if you manage to go past the face and training your pixel into the acne skincare niche then that means that you're going to be let's say in a very close circle of monopoly between players that they're having trained pixels for the acne products and there is not easy for new players to enter the market.

On the other hand for the fishing niche if you're doing that that means that there is always going to be new people coming from dropshippers to someone spending five ten dollars per day still all of them together they are going to compete and the CPM is going to be much higher in these niches because simply there are a lot of people that they can just enter the market by using interests while the others they have to do a lot of effort in the Christian niche or the in the acne niche in order to be able to train their pixel with organic ways affiliate marketing or by spending a lot of money in the platform to get these random sales here and there that eventually they will train the pixel. Another thing is the Christian niche I have a brand which is very which is very well known. To be honest with you after the removal of the interests this brand is now part of just a very close circle of other Christian brands that nobody can touch because there are not a lot of people that they can enter the market because there are no interests basically now and they have a very good trained pixel and I can tell you that their CPM right now is on three four dollars five dollars and we are spending 200 uh 200 000 per month easily and we are scaling every time so yeah good for them because they had the trained pixel but for someone who's starting now you need to research and you need to see what kind of niche you are going to follow if you can target it if you can enter the market and if you don't have a plan or a lot of money to bear on Facebook to train your pixel well you need to see what kind of e-commerce store you will do and what kind of a niche you're going to follow because it doesn't mean that if you have an idea that you can actually market it efficiently on Facebook.

I hope that this explains a lot about the pixel and the API and how they get trained just one thing to finish with the main topic today there are a lot of times people that are asking how many sales do I need to train my pixel there is no such thing as training completely a pixel it's always going to be a room for improvement on the pixel but let me tell you that when we talk about one item store if you get 500 to 1000 sales then that means that your pixel is trained if you go to a niche store one store that is having several items but in one niche let's say a cat store okay depending on the niche and how big it is or if it has a lot of competition inside and everything the moment that the you can train that by having 10 000 sales let's say okay and they have to be across all of the products or if they are just on one or two best sellers then you're training your pixel to this one two best sellers okay it will understand the whole niche but it's going to be on one or two these best sellers mainly training for that and sadly if you have a store which is having a lot of sales across a lot of countries and across a lot of you know let's say an amazon store okay you need to have at least 100 000 sales across a lot of products and across a lot of different niches if we want to say that you are going to have a pixel which basically is going to sell everything to everyone okay it's going to be a pixel for selling everything that's all about the pixel and the api i hope that it's explained that it explains it and if you have any questions let me know in the comments now let's go to your questions i don't have too many this time because obviously the previous podcast we did by the way i've seen very good numbers to the previous podcast you liked it and and you like the fact that i was answering questions um just so you know it was very stressful for me because i was trying to answer 40 questions in just one hour i didn't i wasn't so successful because it took me one hour 20 minutes uh but uh i'm a little bit proud you know it was 40 questions so i i did fine and if we ever gather a lot we will do part two part three whatever so what do we have this week uh zen life products this is my new friend uh he came to by the way here i see so christophe is a person that i know from the channel a lot of times um we have zen life products which is also um um somebody that i have seen commenting a lot it says would it make sense to have just one good ad ad per ad set and duplicate it several times then letting facebook find hot pockets for this ad because i found that when i combine different converting ads into into one ad set most of the time facebook spends more of the budget on a non-converting ad well you're making an assumption here first of all but let me tell you if we talk about a campaign which is on a cbo i would propose you to do dynamic creative ads which means that you can use 10 of them with dynamic creatives and it's going to be one ad but dynamic creative ads if we're talking about advantage plus advantage plus is a consolidation method working with one but it's very good to have more than 10 options there so that it can choose the correct one and if it doesn't choose the correct one you have to go and you have to kill it so that it can choose the correct one with your help the fact that you're saying that when you use a lot of them uh it just uses the one that is not converting instead of it's just conspiracy theories or some bad experiences that you had and this is how you translate it okay don't make this kind of assumptions uh immediately um yeah so don't use one okay uh more it's better and uh when you're using one you're limiting your options of actually being successful because you are having less options there we need more options then we go to active digital marketing there's another person who is uh commenting a lot if we stuck in one percent view content lla and a 10 view content lla in the same ad set will facebook prefer the 10 only is this why we stuck only one percent with one percent yes this is the only reason that we do it i mentioned it earlier with the interest the same thing happens with the lookalikes you cannot put the lookalike of a 10 percent at one percent because then facebook is going to favor the bigger audience the same way that it's behaving on a cbo level giving them more budget to the bigger audience the same way it's actually behaving on uh inside an ad set distributing the budget between different interests or between different uh lookalikes so you need to have the same size so that you know it doesn't have the easy solution to go to the 10 percent okay uh and i'm glad that you did this question because you mean that you understood what i was saying on the video then we have uh bridge gark which is also another person that's commenting a lot and he says hi thanks for the great content as always thank you for watching uh also i have been getting a feeling that meta decides uh target sales for an account and if that sales target is achieved earlier in the day there will be less sales later in the day in my is my observation valid if yes how to increase meta's target for another account so look what is happening because february was a very uh no march was a very difficult month uh now we have the new conspiracy theories so everybody is disappointed by the ads or the things that they see because they're producing less and they start making assumptions about things now in order to to explain this to you in um in a professional way let's say that facebook has a threshold for each set account we know that because we know that if we try to spend more facebook is giving us less rows across the account this is fine so in order for you to do that you need to always i recently uploaded a video which i'm showing that facebook i'm trying to scale facebook is stopping me i'm going a little bit back i'm trying to scale a little bit back so let's say i'm having a five thousand dollars budget i'm trying to go to five thousand five hundred facebook is giving me less so as okay i'm dropping to four thousand eight hundred i'm getting my rows that i want again i attack again so at some point it's going to let me do it a lot of times it's let me it's going to let you do it during the attack period like black friday or whatever that may be and this is going to help you increase your threshold in the amount of money that you spend with the ROAS that you actually want now what you're saying about during the day it is true that in a lot of accounts facebook is going to optimize for different hours of the day if it sees that it's getting better results on the evening it's going to spend a little bit more on the evening this is something that they have observed and i think that you are right here but you also need to understand that facebook is like a very big machine that says okay how many sales can we get today from people that they like fishing 500 sales it's just a stupid number it's thousands 500 sales okay so we have how many accounts we have 500 accounts that they are running ads okay in this account we will give none in this and stuff and they do it based on how all the accounts are how much money are they spending and of course the offer that they have and if it's converting very well and everything it also influence the results because if your funnel is set and everything they're not going to give you the best possible result and they do this kind of obviously nobody knows 100% but let's say that they do something like this so that they can share the pie as we say and so that everybody can be happy and they can continue spending that doesn't mean that you will get a fair thing but it doesn't mean that you if you deserve it you are not going to get something good so what we're trying to do is to try to give to facebook the best excuses that it can have so that it can give us sales with our creatives and our studies and everything but be but know that we just influence in my opinion 20 or 30 percent of the game everything else is rigged and facebook is going to just scatter the sales among so if i'm having the best product and the best offer and everything and stuff i'm still not going to get 100 of the market like what is happening in the actual life nobody gets all the share of the market even the ones that they have the best offer i hope that this answered it uh about the about your observation no it's not valid uh facebook is not doing this on a day level it's doing it um on on a weekly level with the results and stuff and decides how it's going to distribute the sales and another thing that i want to mention is that when we're having bad results in the platform we tend to see things and we tend to believe that this is the truth but it's not it's just a bad period and we should not take into consideration everything that is happening in a bad period on facebook now because it's not representing the actual big picture and now we have alan i i think i know alan also uh let's see hi constantinos thanks for the content do you have any video specific for new pixel explaining how to train it i'm struggling with it well alan if you are going to if you are going to watch this podcast i think that's going to help you a lot but i'm answering here that i have a very good video with a case study it's called how to start with a new pixel and a new facebook ad account case study and this video is actually showing how i i have done it in one other account and i think that uh also in this podcast that we talk about the pixel it's going to help a lot of people to understand more about it then we have a new guy who is actually made several questions to the channel lately and he says i noticed you changed the budget on a daily basis is this healthy for the campaign also do you consider the 20 rule for increasing the budget and this one actually it was the video that i was referring to later about spending a little bit more slowing down spending a little bit more slowing down or having a bad period and facebook is not giving me the results that i want with 5k spend i'm lowering a little bit to 4800 still i don't get the results 4700 by optimization and stuff yes you can go and you can change the budget daily by watching the last seven days and you are doing this by optimization you don't just go and you close all of your assets or just cripple all of your budgets you just go to the campaigns that they're struggling a little bit based on the last seven days and you lower these budgets so the about the 20 rule to be honest with you i don't follow it okay because after some point you get a feeling about that account and you have spent some money to it and you know how to actually have the results that you should have and how it's behaving how many money you should put in an asset or in a campaign in order to produce results and everything and what is the ideal cost per purchase and how to achieve it and all of that so i'm not following the 20 rule not because i i think that it's stupid it's basically facebook theory i just have seen that it's not helping my way of thinking in optimizing i just like the feeling that they have with the ad accounts and to be honest with you i find it a little bit difficult to even apply it for example if you do 100 you're going to do 120 the next day and then after two three days you're going to do another 100 another 22 so it's going to be 100 22 it's 10 12 24 another 24 so you're going to do the next day the next two three days you're going to see it again and if it's working you're going to do 146 in that way it will take you forever to scale what i would do is that would go from 100 to 150 see if it's working they go to 200 from 200 to 300 i would do this kind of jumps i think that the 20 is a little bit um slow and to be honest with you i don't care so much about the learning phase because they say that the 20 thing is about the learning phase i have seen ads performing very well without the learning phase so i'm not focusing at all in the learning phase and i don't think that anyone should especially the smaller accounts with smaller spend because you don't need it it can you can have very good results without passing the learning phase uh let's go to the next one 8roas a very good friend of the channel it says i've made this mistake so i was talking this is a new video that i made and i was having an advantage plus which was having a leading card which was a bad boy i'd say and it was spending a lot of money for no reason so what i have done is that i saw that when you can when you close it when you have the guts to close it and you are not afraid uh maybe your whole campaign is going to be revitalized which happened in this case study uh and uh the problem is that a lot of people wouldn't close it because it would it was close to the break-even ROAS um so do you you have one advanced plus campaign which is having 1.85 ROAS but you want two ROAS if your leading card is having that your advanced plus campaign is never going to surpass the two ROAS because all the money is going to go there so you need to take a decision there either you're going to relax and try to optimize it all over again so that you can pass with your leading card the two ROAS or you're going to close it and you're going to try to find another one or two leading cards which are going to give you the ROAS that you want but if you leave it and this was the point of the video it's never going to give you the ROAS that you want if the leading cards has less ROAS i'm talking about advantage plus if the leading cards has less ROAS from the one that you want now eight ROAS i've made this mistake multiple times in the past letting an ad run for too long and also turning off an ad too soon distributing disturbing the balance sorry but my my print has very small letters in general it have been harder for me to maintain a possible ROAS using advanced plus than with other methods for me for trained pixel state ROAS i think it's advanced plus it can be super consistent super consistent in smaller ad accounts everything is not consistent even normal campaigns they they need to relaunch and they need some special care but i'm always testing it and learning anyways because i think it has so much potential it does in my experience the algorithm almost always allocate too much budget to one or two ads affecting ROAS for those and damaging ROAS this is why you need to intervene in advanced plus you have to watch all of all of my videos here because as i said it's a campaign which is a consolidation method it's actually focusing on one or two so if something it doesn't go well you need to close it i've tried it using big budgets small budgets a lot of ads fewer ads killing fast letting it run etc so he has done a very good testing i've never had three plus ROAS consistently like when i use your crazy method for lookalikes or no interest cpo's well maybe your pixel is not ready yet for for super broad consolidation method and by the way you might say yes but why then it's working with your crazy method broad targeting because my broad method crazy targeting my crazy method broad targeting it's having several adsets which are the same on broad targeting and most probably you're doing maybe a little bit of demographic tweaking and even if you don't you have the option of optimizing it with different hot pockets in my opinion that means that your pixel is not ready yet for a broad broad audience for example it's this other counts that what whenever you do ads something is going to work and then it's all about ROAS but if you if you do something like broad targeting advantage plus with one ad set then your chances are less it's going to be a good thing to do and maybe you need a stronger pixel for that and for all of you watching this it doesn't mean that if you if you have a new pixel you should not try advancements because it's working also with new pixels and you should do what what he is doing here he he's testing it with different ways and stuff and eventually something is going to work this is what you should do also amazing content as always Konstantinos best on youtube by far thank you bro have a nice day then we have another one it says hi Konstantinos it is not something very urgent that i'm writing to you here i wanted to ask you if you have any materials about the differences between advanced plus campaigns vs conversion campaigns when each should be used and what type of ads are best suited for each casuals images collections i think that so far we covered the different cases because of the pixel and everything for when we use interest when you use this and that and based on all of that you you get an idea what i want to say here is that because he's mentioning it casuals images and collections i don't think that it makes any difference if you put casual in advanced plus or collection here and there and stuff it doesn't and what i'm trying to say is this carousels images and collections can work equally well with cbo but equally well also with advanced plus campaigns you don't have to use something differently the only thing that i want to say here is that for catalog carousels be careful in advanced plus especially when you use different ads if you have one carousel if you have a catalog if you have a video if you have an image i wouldn't use them together because the catalog is going to take all the budget this is the reason that when you have because i like to do advanced plus campaigns with more than 100 dollars if you have 50 or 40 i would prefer if you do a catalog over there first before you test anything else because catalog tends to work also with small budgets in advanced plus another thing that i want to mention here is that okay you're mentioning casual images collections and everything you should not test together videos with images okay when you put them in advanced plus or in a cbo campaign dynamic ads or whatever because the first thing that facebook is watching is the engagement when you are having the engagement as your first key metric what facebook is going to do is going to say okay in the image somebody clicked somebody liked or whatever and stuff this is engagement if it's getting a lot i'm going to give it more budget so that it can get sales because engagement means that people are interested to that perfect when you have a video one second of photo play as someone is scrolling down the feed it it is an engagement that means that you should not test them together because all of your budget is going to go to the videos because facebook thinks that videos are engaging more so it's going to give them more budget have i seen images winning videos yes it's not always the case but it doesn't mean that if you do it an image is not going to win a video but if you want to be fair you should put them separately i think that all that question gave us also the chance to discuss about other things like the things that we mentioned now we have again zen life and then last question from ride which was his second question for the week so zen life products question if you have a higher budget than another advertiser using the same cost cap will facebook give you a higher percentage of traffic available at that cost cap no it's not facebook is deciding the threshold and how much sales is going to give you based on the total amount of money that you're spending on your um ad account and yes we're competing with each other and this is what the cpmc is for and we're all of us we're bidding for the sale here and there but uh if you have higher budget facebook is not going to favor you of course we're going to take a little bit more sales because of that but it's not necessarily something like i'm rich give me more sales and screw all the others who are the small fishes it's not going to happen facebook is going to try to distribute it in a way that everybody is going to get something so that they will continue advertising this is what you need to keep in to your mind so no if you have the same cost cap and stuff you're not going to get more sales you are going to get more sales if you have more budget but it's not about preference it's about volume that you get because of your bigger budget and at the end of the day facebook is going to try to give equally and then it depends also on your funnel and on your different ways of advertising and everything now because don't forget that facebook is giving you intention okay so it gives you people that it thinks that they are going to convert if they're going to convert or not and then facebook so it's sending this kind of traffic for people that it thinks that it can convert especially if you have a trend pixel and all of that but if they don't convert it doesn't give a okay don't forget about that last question i have continuously optimized i have continuously optimized my advantage class campaign which is performing well by disabling underperforming ads until i reach a total of four ads in the campaign super normal structure to have three or four left in advanced plus it is possible for me to add new ads to the same campaign in order to have more options when the existing ads stop performing well or would it be better for me to start a new campaign altogether you need to start a new campaign so as i said in a cbo campaign and in an abo campaign not an abo in a cbo campaign in an advanced plus campaign facebook and the campaign has already decided where it's going to spend the money based on engagement based on sales it doesn't matter it has decided so if you're spending 500 per day in an advanced plus for example it doesn't make any sense for you while the 500 is being spent among some ads to go and that inside their other ads even if you increase the budget it doesn't it doesn't make sense because facebook has already decided where it's going to spend this money so whatever you're going to add there is not going to be tested properly you need to start a new campaign and you need to optimize it all over again in order to see which one is going to work and which one is not going to work and don't do it not even in cbo don't do it in advanced plus because it's not fair for the testing that you're going to do and at the end of the day the budget has already been decided the only thing that you can do is maybe introduce so your main leading card on advanced plus is not doing well kill it introduce new ads inside but and if this is the 90 of the budget then yes it's going to give some chance on the other but i just but still it's a problematic situation i don't see the reason of doing it especially in a working campaign if your campaign doesn't work okay you will have to start a new one anyway why keep using this one the i don't understand it but at the end of the day you might say for example that yes i'm keeping the sales on the asset level so it's going to keep the same sales over there in order to optimize i don't think that the advantage plus is working like this if it was working like this the crazy method for advanced plus it wouldn't work but for some reason it's working so in my opinion i don't believe that it's working like an abo campaign but i think that it's a completely different structure that they did for this kind of campaign this is why it has completely different results from doing if you do exactly the same thing as we do with advanced plus with a normal conversion ads campaign and we have only one asset with several ads it's not going to work in the same way i have tested it i have tested it advantage plus yes it's a consolidation method which is something that facebook was saying for all of these years but it's not the same as an abo simple campaign with an ad set and several ads just so you know so no my answer is no do a new campaign we're done with your questions let's go to one thing that caught my attention it's for freelance diaries uh for uh what i have seen so there was a clever guy over here in app work that he was scamming uh people and um uh the first the first thing that i've seen it was saying shopify experts for small tasks and it has one star from the freelancer and he gave three star to the uh free freelancer the uh the the the guy who employed him gave him three stars and says i have done all work after that uh he well cancelled the contract fraud client and he has a fixed price of five dollars and then i was watching this and i watched another one which was actually funny funny for me not for not for the person now it says q a website plus mobile it says the client is a scammer proposed a project for 150 and that paid me only five dollars talk to him about the payment and he keeps lying that the person handling my project is sick now it's two months now and still no updates not even replying to me anymore the client also had a history of negative reviews of scamming people which is the one that i read you earlier now experience it in myself um don't try to work with this client he paid the five dollars then keeps telling me i'm already paid which is the full payment do not work with this camera so i have seen after that there's another job with five but there was no comments this is why i didn't put in another job with five this person was hiring people he put them do the job and then he was paying them five dollars and closing the uh contract um well for me it's funny for these people it wasn't funny it was an unfortunate thing uh but anyway uh that's all i had for you i hoped you liked it i hope we explained about the pixel and everything if you have any questions let me know and i will see you next week on the next podcast this was the facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is this is you
