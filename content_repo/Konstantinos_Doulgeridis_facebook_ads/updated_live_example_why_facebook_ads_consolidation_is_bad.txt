so guys I have a very quick update about this previous thing that we were discussing so this was the previous campaign that we were having over here if we see on the maximum we can see that it's the same thing so it's spent basically in six days with 500 dollars one ad set inside as you can see over here so we are not happy with this result and then I was telling to you that it's better to break it down in several different campaigns and then try to spend this amount of money so I was actually right and let me show you why so these three first campaigns are exactly the same over here ad set which we're using of course with the crazy method so in the last seven days we can see that we are having by the way we already spent 2k instead of spending 3k from this campaign we can see what's the maximum actually maybe we spend even more so yeah in the actually in the actual so we're close to that so we are close to the 3k and we have already have 1.56 1.63 when I was watching it yesterday I think it was better Sunday most probably wasn't a good day so if we remove it let's see uh what yeah see we were having two ROAS 1.89 still we are in the process of optimizing these campaigns as you can understand some of those they spend 150 180 of course it's not pending the 500 but my point is this now I'm starting a new campaign so what if I manage to have three campaigns as a crazy method running at the same time some of those are optimized to 100 dollars 120 150 150 it doesn't matter what really matters is that I scattered and I broke down all the budget it's spending across different campaigns several uh assets so it's not risky and here instead of this campaign over here that was actually uh having very bad results because we were spending everything on the one asset so this is another proof that it doesn't mean that you have to that in order for you because sometimes the argument is that yes you are doing what you're doing but you're spending less money well here you are you can spend the same amount of money but you just need to segment it and you need to do it more carefully building it okay not just because you're lazy to do it just with you know one campaign with one asset or maybe because facebook is saying to do so so here is a proof for you I think that it's going to um it all depends to that but I have already spent with better results let's not look at this but let's look at seven days if we want to be fair okay because we will have also bad days with facebook so over here we can see that I spent already on the maximum uh with 1.5 1.6 so let's say 1.55 in average instead of one ROAS that we were getting with this one 1.04 I spent exactly or close to the same amount of money uh let's say 200 dollars short so what is the best of course this is the best okay so in my opinion and to my eyes this is clear at least now I have this example to show it to you because sometimes I'm talking about things and I'm telling you that I have seen them this is how it goes and stuff but now it's in front of you basically okay and nobody can deny that uh that's all I had uh for this this was just a follow-up video so that I can show you how it went with my way and how it went with the consolidation way by the way this is also called the symbol method it doesn't mean that it cannot work in several accounts maybe in some account it can work but if it doesn't work there you go you have a plan b and you can do it uh the only last argument that some people have is that okay but you're not running them at the same period sadly we cannot do this test guys because we will have to spend one thousand dollars instead of spending five hundred dollars and stuff uh per day just for a test and I think that this is uh too much for uh this account um I can tell you that I have tried it in other accounts uh but it doesn't it doesn't make any sense since I'm doing this video in order to show it uh for people that they don't believe in it uh so I'm not going to say it uh I'm just going to imply it let's say and uh guys uh that was my update until we meet again have a great summer you need to relax you need to fill your batteries and come back again because we are having black friday and christmas coming get so many ads and until we meet again be creative and be consistent guys bye you
