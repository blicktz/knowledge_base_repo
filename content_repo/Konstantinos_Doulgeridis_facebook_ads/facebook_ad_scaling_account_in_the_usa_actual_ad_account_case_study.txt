Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we are going to analyze another account that I have showed you in the past, the case study of it, how I scaled it because I managed to scale it more. So long story short, you have seen this case study in the past, I was able to scale from 20k to 170k, now I was able to scale to 150k. This month so far as I'm going to show you and this is the reason that I created the video, I was able to not panic and maintain the same spend with the same or better ROAS which is good because I'm setting myself very strong for the next month but I'm going to explain all of this on the case study as I show it.

So this is the previous video of the case study if you want to keep a track on it, then it was three months, now we're going to we're already on the eight months. Time passes by my friend and this is one very good example of how I scaled this business. In the previous case study I did one video which had the United Kingdom account and the United States, sadly because now the spends are too big, too big, I will have to show you the different route that United States took, the different route that United Kingdom took so that you can understand.

Let's go into my account just to take an idea. I remember, I don't remember it, I just looked at it before the start of the video, that the ROAS that we had on these three months it was 7.7. The ROAS that we have on this is 6.74, the BREAK EVENT ROAS of this account is 4.

So we are doing very well and we are scaling and I'm going to show you again the different months and how we scaled and what happened and explain to you the situation. Of course I cannot tell you the name of the company but here what we have after eight months of working, not eight months but let's say seven months and 20 days because it's April 20 when we do this video and I wanted to show you this video so that I can show you that even on bad periods you need to keep momentum if you want to keep scaling accounts especially if they are strong and they need to scale more. So the spend that we have so far it's 886k on the period that I took the account and I will show you what was happening before.

6.74 is the ROAS, almost 6 million I would prefer for the video, it would look much nicer if it was 6 million. Most probably if I do it one day later because they have easily 20k days it would be 6 million. But let's see what happened.

So let's go on August just to get an idea. When I came on August for example they were just spending 31k. I tried and I did some changes gradually and I was getting some crazy roads and stuff and the owners told me, hey what's the point of making 14 ROAS if we spend 30k and we have a 4 ROAS break even so why don't we go through the process of actually spending as much as we can as long as we hit 4 ROAS.

And they said okay I'm going to help you with that but it's going to happen gradually and we're going to build it and this is what we are doing and this is why they like me also. And this is also another thing that doing immediately 100k, 200k just in one month it's going to work maybe or not but it's not going to be sustainable. The way that I have built it you will see later most probably at the end of this case study how it survived during the April because I was stacking up a lot of campaigns and a lot of campaigns with different creatives and then other creatives are coming and then we have the posts and all of that and all the things that I'm teaching basically which I'm going to explain now.

So let's go first through the numbers. On August we had 14.5 ROAS almost 32k spent. On September I'm starting to scale a little bit so I'm going to the double one I'm going to nine ROAS.

Then we go on October. October is the period that we have before Black Friday so you know getting from 30k to 60k, 80k it's not so difficult but getting from 100k to 300k it's where the difficulty is and right now in the process of being close to 150k we'll show you in a little bit and of course we have 8.69 very good because we can see also that in September we went to the nine ROAS okay with 60k but we lost only a little bit of ROAS in October going to 8.68 with 87 ROAS close to 90k. In November of course we have Black Friday which is our first attack period.

I have mentioned several times how the attack periods are working and the reason is this Facebook is going to give you a specific slice of the pie to each one of the advertisers based on the amount of money that they spend based on their fame or whatever not fame based on their score if they have been good boys with the platform if they have good creatives engagement they are old advertisers and all of that. So when you go to Black Friday Black Friday is a very good period for you to be able to spend a lot of money while you are maintaining a threshold and then you are able to say okay now I'm a bigger boy I'm a bigger advertiser give me a bigger slice from the pie. So when this is happening is you are spending money on Black Friday in a much safer way because there are more people that they want to buy your products but you are also building your future because you are just saying I'm not a 90k account I'm an account that I can scale more than that and I can do it profitably and this is what I have done in November of course with a cost with 6.47 but this is also the point that I realized what kind of ROAS am I going to get if I scale much more.

Of course don't get me wrong at the same time that I was doing changes on Facebook ads and I was scaling with analyzing data and everything the business is also doing their own thing by trying to find new products on this specific case they were taking care also of the creatives and everything. I was just here making sure that all of their efforts that they are doing they are going to be presented very well in front of the eyes of their customers. We have November 1 to 30, 6.47, 132k and of course as always this is very typical with businesses on December we drop a little bit further down from what we had.

So it's on December we're actually having 9 to 1k spent 6 ROAS and then we go on January that we are having 100k 5.5. I believe that January was actually the month that was the lowest in terms of ROAS but still it's fine because we are scaling and of course we are having new campaigns that we do and we are having more budget which haven't optimized yet completely so this is something that you have to be okay with okay and of course you need to set up your limits super straight you need to say follow us don't go lower than that and scale as much as you can this is how you scale accounts. Then we go to February.

February guys was a very good month for everyone okay if you go to forums if you go everywhere you will see that everybody's talking about February that it was a good month 6.44 ROAS 136k on spend over here then we go on March on March I was able to scale even more go to 157k 5.48 super happy with the results everybody was happy and everything and now let's go to the most critical month. If we come here on the April and see from 1 to 9th we can see that we have with that spend 3.86. That means that on this period we had a problem and there's specifically a period I believe it's 3 to 9.

No I believe it's 4 to 9 5 to 9 let me see I guess it's that period then or that period let me see yeah this period over here it's actually representing the Easter okay so 9 the 9th was actually the worst day I believe it was 1.53 it's ridiculous for this amount. Now what I want to say and what I want you to realize here is this are you going to lose all of your progress that you have done in the previous month which is actually having 5.48 ROAS with spending 157k just because you have on this period over here very bad results most people would do that mistake experienced people and experienced advertisers don't do these kind of mistakes because they know from trends they know from all of the ad accounts that they have they know from other people that they run ads and I know from your messages guys that you're sending me my ad account is not doing well and stuff so I'm realizing that this is not a problem on my ad account this is a problem which we are actually having in this specific month and you have two choices either you're going to go to your to the business owner and say hey it's going to be a difficult week we know that okay I know it I can see it on other accounts we need to soak the damage and then we're going to see if in the next three weeks we can recuperate and we can actually save it which is what happened with this account another choice is to say hey what do you want to do and give the option to the owner don't give him any chances of actually thinking of it and telling him what do you want do you want to gather the profits and lower the spends in order to survive it or do you want to take the risk to go on the side now it really matters to what kind of relationship you have with the owner of course here I'm also eight months on the ad account if I was just one month I wasn't going to be able to know if if it can sustain but I have a feeling now from the ad account that I can understand let me show you what happened after that so this is the first nine days okay if you go from 10 to 20 the situation has changed completely don't imagine that I have done any crazy things I'm not going to come here and pretend that I'm the magical savior that did this what I was having was patience because if you're patient and you go outside of this bad period your account if it's structured properly with several campaigns and stuff it's going to work okay I have lowered the budgets I have closed one or two ads and stuff but I don't believe that they have done so many big changes in order to justify going from three rows to seven point thirty seven what is the outcome though this month alone I'm having five point seventy two which is something standard and typical for me so far I spent eighty six K yesterday alone I have four point thirty four point thirty six so four thousand six three multiplied by thirty let's say so this is one hundred no no no multiplied by ten what am I doing so four thousand three six three multiplied by ten this is 43k plus seven days not only seven days sorry last month plus 86k plus 86 000 this is 130k so what did I lost 15k okay 15k but I maintained the ROAS I didn't lose no ROAS and this is something that I can easily recover in in the next month by scaling more with more creatives and everything so keep it to your mind that the whole situation in this month it was a very stressful situation in the first week and if you're experienced you can recover it but if you panic you can go in a very and take very bad decisions so far if we think of it we have scaled and of course I'm not I'm not going to talk about the Black Friday because we have done the video in the previous case study explaining what I have done but what we had in Black Friday it helps us also to have after that point the next months of February which was very good but also March and May on on the same amount of money spent as the Black Friday this is what we expect to get after we get some results on Black Friday after one or two months we should try to get the ad account to the same level and this is what we did and everything worked perfectly here it's a United States account you know I'm very happy with the results I wanted to share with you I also wanted to share with you how I wasn't panicked and I managed to keep it and the next month most probably I will be able to scale more so one last thing before we go except from the panicking thing which I'm going to mention a little bit on the closing of the video it's the structure the structure of this ad account is that after trying all of my methods okay all of these months I have realized that think one two three four okay advantage plus is one main thing that is working here it's working I have realized that my way of thinking about optimizing advantage plus it's also working and my mindset is also working for this ad account I didn't kept pushing different ideas to that because it's working and it's still working if I can see that I cannot scale in more maybe I will start introducing new ideas but so far whatever it was tested with my strategies not all of them have worked but of course Crazy Method worked CBO campaigns stacked lookalikes work and Advantage Plus and Advantage Plus Crazy Method which are basically right now my flagships uh they have worked and this helped me a lot to scale maybe in your account one or two of these things are going to work but the reason that I'm showing you on the channel all of this is so that you will be able to test them why because it's very important to have differentiation the whole reason that the account actually survived during the April period is because it had very strong roots what are the strong roots all the work that was done the previous months and the Black Friday September October November December all of these months having campaigns because I was having one campaign good creatives and stuff and I was building it in a way that it was going to be an evergreen campaign so what do we have this month okay let's see in order to work in another account like this I'm having right now one two three four five six seven eight campaigns most of the times you will see agencies that they are saying okay you need just one campaign for testing one campaign for call traffic and to add retargeting well here we don't need retargeting we just have one small one because we have Advantage Plus we have seen in other accounts that Advantage Plus it's actually taking all the sales so there's no need to do an extensive work on retargeting secondly we do have a lot of Advantage Plus campaigns that they are having different optimization with crazy method and normal ones we do test while we're having sales because we have a lot of Advantage Plus and in this specific situation we have Advantage Plus campaigns that they are having a lot of different creatives and then we optimize them and see which ones are working as I said in another video whatever is working if we have a lot of creatives that haven't been tested efficiently we duplicate the Advantage Plus and we run it again without the ones that they have worked in the previous one in that way I was able to actually have several campaigns and very strong groups which are having creative from different months but they are working as Evergreens and of course we are having some posts that they are coming from creatives that we have seen that they are working and if you are not using Advantage Plus campaigns with posts you should use it because it's very good in other words it's not only the strategies that you see on videos it's also the experience that you have with the ad accounts and the feeling that you have in their accounts and of course the talent let's say that the talent is going to influence 10% but everything else is going to help you a lot in order to have better results and of course as I said several times in the videos the fear the more you do Facebook ads the more you are going to overcome your fear and the more you're not going to do mistakes that they're going to take you back months in the progress that you have done keep watching my videos see the strategies and everything try to see what is working for you what is working with your mentality and your way of thinking so while I was watching the editing of the video I realized that I have done let's call it one mistake but I I want always to be super upfront with the accounts and what they're happening so I realized that as I was changing the months over here for example if we go for example on November okay yeah I have here amounts but I didn't have the amount spent and I'm not sure if I had okay so just to make sure that the video is going to be fine if we come on the August I would like to show you this if you want to compare them with basically what I say during the video 31 14.5 these are the campaigns that they had spent on that period if we go on September 9.06 57 these are the campaigns that we had at this point sorry that I'm blaring the names but this is how it should be as you can see on October I started doing much more campaigns testing and stuff you can see that we are having and as as you can see here this one and this one is still open which means that I still use them since October okay so I stacked up all the good campaigns and then we go on November just so that you will be able to see the numbers 132k these are the spends here we have another campaign that came to our life and let's go to the next one which is December on December for example you see the I this is what I remember maybe this error from this so we had these campaigns also this one this one do you see several of them and let's go on January 133k again we have this issue maybe let's put them by ROAS okay now we can see all of them we have several of them and stuff and on February again we see all of the campaigns now on March we were left with less I believe yes we're having much less because we were able to have less campaigns on what was working and what wasn't and also I believe that in March we didn't test any new creatives which we're just maintaining that but it was good because we were managing to scale and then if we go from now to this of course I had to to remove one campaign just to survive on this period and still do that that's it that's all the numbers I don't remember clearly if I had them or not but just to be sure I'm I'm showing you also this just so that everything can be clear so that's all I had if you if you should take one advice from the things that you have seen in this video is that you should not panic if you have the experience to do it I'm not saying that you should be just a dreamer that says it's okay it's going to work eventually and stuff but I'm just saying that if you have enough experience you are able to understand if this is just a trend or if this is something that it's here to stay and you have to lower the budget so as you can imagine dropping down to 100k or to 90k for this specific case it would take me back at least two months in order to recuperate and go there unless if something crazy like the covid period with crazy sales and everything or a black friday would be there this is what I wanted to teach you in this video don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my free course my paid course and my website and until we meet again guys be creative learn
