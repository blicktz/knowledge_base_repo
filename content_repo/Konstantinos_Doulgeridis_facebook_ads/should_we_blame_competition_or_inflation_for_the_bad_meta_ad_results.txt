Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss who we should blame for the bad meta ad results. So after a devastating march for many companies, there are a lot of discussions which I'm seeing and I'm also part of them and we have analyzed things on the podcast and everything and I would like to make a video in order to tell you my honest opinion about the situation. As marketeers we always tend to talk about AOV, you have numbers that they don't make sense, the CPMs are rising every year so it's more difficult for people to advertise but today with this video I would like to give a different perspective to it.

So we have all seen all of these different you know reports about Timur saying advertising and spending billions making the stock of Facebook actually be you know rise more and Facebook to be profitable and stuff and a lot of times people are coming and saying okay the CPMs are rising it's more expensive now to advertise on the platform and so on but then there are people that are coming and they keep advertising on the platform. There is a situation with some companies that they have very good numbers and they can still afford to advertise, some others they are losing money because they want to actually grow within Facebook and some others they just abandon the platform. Is it the truth though?

Do we have higher CPMs? The truth is that we don't. If we compared 2023 and 2024 and especially the previous month, March, that we had some problems with the results we could see that the CPMs were kind of the same but the only thing that increased was the CPA.

So maybe we should not blame Meta after all about that but maybe we should start thinking of some other things because the CPMs are staying the same but on the other hand it's more expensive to advertise on the platform. Can we think of any reasons that they might cause this problem? Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have.

You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. When you have more competition within Facebook ads this is something that we can easily measure with the CPMs. So if the CPMs are staying the same it's not that team wars saying they came with Chinese money and they started advertising so they're ruining our ROAS and our profits.

It's that the cost prerequisition has increased and let me give you the perspective that I think that it's the most valid over here. It's called inflation and basically the problem is that people don't have money to spend. A lot of times people tend to think of competition it has to be on the same niche or whatever but I want to recalibrate your way of thinking about competition.

If I'm here for example okay and I'm buying let's say luxury items okay I'm buying a watch or I'm buying a jewelry or I'm buying a t-shirt. So if I don't have money anymore, so much money as I used to have, instead of buying three things in one month I'm going to just buy one. This is also a passive competition okay.

So the company that has the watch and the company that has the jewelry maybe they are going to see the results while the CPM is the same dropping because someone like me bought only the t-shirt for example because of inflation I didn't have the money to buy on the watch and the jewelry and the t-shirt while I used to do that in 2023 or 2022. So now the competition is not only for a t-shirt company that has other t-shirts and you know we tend to think like this okay he's going to buy another t-shirt so these are competitions. In other words these are competitions from other companies that they have a watch.

It's also the competition of people having money to spend. So if for some reason I decide that I want to just buy the t-shirt because I don't need the watch or the jewelry then this is also competition for these companies and all of this is coming from the fact that I don't have money to spend for all the three items. We live in a period that right now even McDonald's are increasing their minimum wage to the $20 per hour which is something unheard and we have wars happening all around us and the inflation that we see it's something that it's global and worldwide and all of this is actually affecting the businesses and the e-commerce and of course a platform like Facebook which is really tied with the e-commerce and whatever is happening.

So instead of blaming Tmoo and saying that Facebook is becoming more and more expensive why don't we analyze the data and we we can see I think it was Triple 8 that had a report and it was saying maybe we should stop blaming Meta after all because the CPMs are kind of the same. It increased I think one dollar in just one year. On the other hand maybe we can start thinking about inflation and I know that it's very difficult to make this discussion but sometimes maybe the answer is going to be to increase our prices like every other companies are doing but of course as marketeers or as experts we're just saying that increasing your price is very bad and it's going to hurt you and you should try to fix your AOV, you should try to fix your cost per purchase, you should try to do this and that and that instead of increasing your price because you know all of these discussions are you know the elephant in the room discussions that we cannot make because nobody wants to touch their prices but maybe the answer over here is that because of the inflation some companies they do need to increase their prices if they have done everything that they can from AOV decreasing the costs of goods and all of that maybe the answer at the end of the day is going to increase the prices.

And now guys it's a time that you can ask okay Konstantinos you are saying all of these things what can we do about it we advertise on Facebook we want to have good results the answer is that you can do nothing about it okay I'm just discussing here a problem that we are having and I'm thinking that okay all the time we're trying to decrease the spend of this decrease the spend of that try to find better deal with our different distributors or try to increase the AOV or do all of these actions but maybe sometimes some businesses are just not going to make it because these numbers are not optimal anymore in the time and in the era that we live with the inflation that we have. I have one example for example there is a company that used to be profitable in the first year that they started because they didn't have to give VAT and now that they have to give VAT they are actually unprofitable so they are just going to stop advertising on Facebook and I'm thinking while they were there advertising there might be other companies that they are advertising and they were saying how are they able to charge X amount of money for example for this product while we have to pay VAT and all of that and all of that and we have to charge X amount of money in order for us to be able to be profitable. This is the answer there are going to be companies that they're going to come with new rules or maybe with just an advantage against you and all of that and it's just a fluid situation that's going to change all the time and on top of that we have inflation which is making things even worse and more difficult for all of us that we advertise and it's becoming more and more and more difficult.

I declare bankruptcy! At the end of the day guys the company that has the best numbers is going to win. The company that is going to stay and it's going to keep growing it's going to win and the company that is going to care about the offer given the fact that they told you that competition is not only the direct competition but it's also how people are spending their money.

So if you have a better product if you have a more appealing offer and not in terms of money but in terms of what your product is offering also then you're just going to win others in the finish line and you're going to have better results if you manage and if you start thinking like okay I have to make my product and my offer and my website the website that people are going to care of spending their small amount of money because right now they don't have a lot of money to spend across all of the different websites. I hope guys that this is going to help you a little bit to understand the situation. It's not about more advertisers coming to the platform it's actually the same situation but it's all about inflation it's all about how we perceive competition and at the end of the day it's all about numbers and competitive advantages of one business towards the other that they make them be able to advertise on Facebook platform while others cannot.

How many times have we heard of companies that they do say that they said that we were profitable in 2022 and after IOS we are not profitable or in 2020 or whatever. Well these companies didn't adapt to the changes and they died in terms of Facebook advertisement because they had profit margins that they used to work remember the example with the company and the VAT ID. They had numbers that they used to work but after one change they were not able to actually make it work anymore.

That's all I had for you guys I hope that you liked this info video that I wanted to share with you about my new perspective about competition. For all of you that you have been to the podcast many times these are things that we discussed a lot of times and we read all of these different articles and these different news from the sites and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book, my website, my course and my mentorship programs and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent.
