Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, Podcast 74 if I'm correct and I'm changing something basically at the start of each podcast I'm going to tell you what we're going to see on this podcast. If you're listening if you're listening from Spotify or other places just audio then I'll just let you know that there are going to be some print screens of the questions and I will say also the topic.

So let's start. First of all what we're going to cover today is the main topic is going to be the new cookies, think the compliance that we have for EU, United Kingdom and some states in the United States and what happened and all of that I would just need to clarify that for this one I'm not a developer so I'm going to share with you whatever I have gathered and then we can actually take it from there and you can research it more or we can spark up a conversation on the comments and see what we have. I have over here also a Shopify article about the things on Shopify and what is going to change based on that.

I do have something that happened on Friday and campaigns for some reason were not working. New interface things, dynamic creatives are going away, we're going to discuss also that and we have the cookies and there's another thing I have another print screen over here about how Meta is trying to convince us to do several things and then we do have the questions which is... so I'm going to leave just 10 seconds so that you can see them, you can pause the video and watch the questions and see.

Basically the way that you're going to see them they're going to start appearing, it's going to be the line and how we're going to reply them. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So I hope it's enough time for my video editor to add all of the questions that we're going to reply.

Don't forget you're going to put them pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, just like this so that they can be able to stop the video and you can do it faster if you don't have enough time. Now, first of all, I would like to know your thoughts about something that I'm thinking. I don't know if I'm going to do it now but maybe I will start doing it from September.

I'm thinking of making a live on YouTube with Q&A questions and I would like to know guys from you in the comments if you would like something like that. I'm thinking of making it once per month, for example. If we see that it's super viral or whatever, we can make more of that.

But yeah, I think that and of course it's going to be free. So I'm thinking of doing something like this. The truth is that all of these things with the YouTube channel that happened to me, I wasn't expecting it.

I was just a guy that was having several kinds of stuff. Now I have more and more people coming from YouTube and a lot, of course, the Chosen 5 program, for example, is closed. There are not free spots available right now.

I'm going to increase the price of Chosen 5 to 10k today so that I can filter more the people that actually want to come. Also, it was a huge success. The people that are inside, they tell me that they would easily pay this money for that.

So this is going to be the new price. Of course, for these people that they came earlier, the price is going to stay the same. There are no spots available but you can check from time to time to see if there's going to be one.

Right now, there's only one person on the line for that and I'm waiting the answer of someone else. But, you know, that's the situation right now. I don't think that, I hope, that the channel is going to grow so big that I can make it 20k, for example.

I don't know. But I don't think that the 10k is going to change for a long period. The truth is that the 5k, because it is daily calls and stuff, it's a little bit small fee for what it offers and the progress that they have seen that these people have made.

I just need to clarify also that these people were already successful, okay, of course, because they had the money to pay for it. But they were already successful and they came to go one step further because apparently they have been in other mentorships that people were doing a call with them every once per week or which I don't call a mentorship, I call it a consulting call. Mentorship means that you care about the other, that you do talk with them and all of that on a daily level and you try to make them excel.

And this is what I have seen. I have seen that these are people that they had the mentality of taking mentorship programs, but they have been mistreated on these mentorship programs. And that's how the Chozen 5 is going to continue.

Let me know in the comments if you like the idea of YouTube live Q&A maybe for one hour, something like that. And if you would attend, what day it would be suitable because we have also this problem. We have a video uploading on Monday, video uploading on Wednesday, we have the podcast uploading on Friday or Saturday depending on when it's going to be finished and how long it's going to be.

So let me know which date it will be suitable. I guess Tuesday is always full of calls. Monday, Tuesday is always full of calls.

On Thursdays, I'm doing the podcast video shooting. On Wednesdays, a lot of time I'm doing the normal video shootings. On Friday, we have the Inner Circle call.

I guess let me know guys of what you think about it. Now, before we go to our main topic, two things that I want to discuss. First of all, we had a new interface introduction.

I'm putting here a print screen which is showing that we have the active ads and had delivery and all ads and everything and how it looks now. So this is a new interface. I can see also different green circles on the delivery.

On some, they look just a green circle. On some others, they look a little bit more of a different design of a green circle. So I'm seeing UI changes, interface changes.

And there's one strange thing that happened. It happened on Thursday night to Friday morning. I was publishing campaigns.

I told it, I told also to other people, it happened also to them. I was publishing a campaign and you couldn't see the campaign on the campaign level, but you could see only the ad sets. The next day, if you had any campaigns running on this period, the next day, I wasn't able still to find them.

So I created new ones and I could see the new ones. So if you have any discrepancies into your spends and stuff, just try and go and see if you have any hidden campaign that is not being shown on the campaign level, but just try to see because the ad sets are going to be shown on the ad set level. So try to see if you have it there.

Anyway, we're not going to cover much more of that because it happened and I hope that now it's fixed. But I haven't seen my old campaigns actually, that I created and I couldn't see on Thursday night to be active the next days. So I was looking at it to see if there are any hidden campaigns.

I haven't found anything the next days. Just take it also, just to be safe on your end. We do have news about dynamic creative ads.

We all know dynamic creative ads. We use them a lot on the crazy method and we use them a lot on other instances. They go away.

The message that I got and I have seen also the format which is this. The format it says choose how you'd like to structure your ad. Flexible will show your ad in the format we predict may perform best.

So flexible now it's like dynamic creative ads and it says on the top dynamic ads will be going away soon. Until then using dynamic creative will enable the flexible ad format. This allows you to continue providing creative elements to automatically generate combinations tailored for your audience.

We'll also show your ad in the format that we predict may perform best. So they are going away. Basically it was the toggle on off button that we had on the ad set level called dynamic creative ads and we use them a lot.

Now I have seen people using flexible ads and not being happy with it and telling you bad things about them. Most of the times guys when something is being launched in Meta I'm going to test it on new ad accounts for example not immediately on working ad accounts because I'm afraid that the new features that Meta has they never work really well. There's only one exception to that rule which is the dynamic shopping dynamic creative campaigns.

The advanced shopping campaigns which worked immediately since day one. CBO didn't work immediately. We had very bad results initially until CBO starts working and now it's working much better than ABO.

So all of this means that I'm just going to test it a little bit here and there but not massively. So when there's a new thing coming with Meta I'm a little bit reluctant and I'm not testing it immediately. I'm just waiting a little bit.

One thing that I can tell you about flexible ads is that they are not working in the same way as dynamic creative ads. The thing is that we can have multiple ads per ad set which wasn't the option for the previous format with dynamic creative ads and yeah I'm listening bad things about them. They're not on all ad accounts.

I don't know if they are going to be but it looks like they are. I have seen them in some ad accounts. I have tested them.

I haven't seen anything good and a lot of people told me bad things about them and the difference is that you can do many ads now. So we will see. We will see maybe what is going to happen with this in the future.

Next one... let me fold this. Okay so next one I was watching this the other time and it was just a print screen that I took because I was trying to do some changes and Meta was trying to push me to use advanced plus audience and advanced plus creative blah blah and they say 33% lower cost per result based on our experiment or 3% lower cost per result based on our experiment.

Well these experiments just so you know they're happening they're happening to companies that they have trained pixels and all of that. So how can you go in a platform and actually propose this kind of changes for a company that you don't know if it's a new company or if it has a trained pixel or as we said in the previous podcast apparently there are people that they don't believe that pixels are getting trained and one of my friends Michael was actually liking the idea and now he's debating to his head and he says but maybe the ad accounts are getting trained and stuff. No guys the pixels are getting trained so Michael don't overthink about it okay the pixels are getting trained.

I know it because I have tested with the same pixel in other accounts getting similar results. I'm not saying that from ad account to ad account you have the same results. I do believe that ad accounts are getting trained and pixels are getting trained but for sure I know that if I was going to go with a new pixel in a new ad account and with a new pixel in a with a trained pixel in a new ad account the same ad account the results are different and this is this is a test that I have done okay.

I have done it when I had limits of spend on specific ad accounts and I was using several other accounts to spend more money but if we if we think of it we can never be sure about anything okay. It's just about observing but I do believe that pixels are getting trained and I do believe that pixels also get trained to send you traffic that converts for your funnel even and it makes sense if you think of it the people that are converting in a landing page with more and more and more data that it gathers about what they like and all of that the ideal avatar which is being formed for the from the pixel for the product it's also people that they're converting a specific landing page that's why you go to other landing pages and even if they're looking better from your old crappy landing page they're not working anymore but that's my theory. Anyway so we have these suggestions from Meta I would just strongly do you see how they have with green button publish with adjustments and public publish without adjustments with gray you know so you know and basically they say that based on our experiment which is being made with I have been part of this experiment in very big ad accounts that even if you use advanced plus ordinance or something else is not going to make a huge difference let me tell you also that in these experiments because I have been part also from the site that they tell us okay now that we finished the experiment let's write for example what's happening they're not lying it did actually help um 33 percent lower the cost but for example they're not saying that the CPM has increased for example or they will not say other things so they do write for the experiment whatever whatever it's convenient to them okay so you might see for example and the lower cost per result also goes along the way because it doesn't talk about purchases and stuff and secondly they don't even guarantee you that because you know because it's Facebook now you can tell me do you guarantee stuff no I don't but you you do get my point saying things like that coming from Meta people are sending me messages and they tell me hey I have seen this blah blah do we believe it no we don't believe it just because it comes from Meta they just believe that it's going to happen anyway that's it be careful about that now before we go into our main topic I would like to discuss something that happened with one of my friends that they do Facebook ads he's not as experienced and I have been to another account with him that he has only a very small spend like 30 per day to spend and I was watching that he was doing an abo with three ads at 10 10 10 just because it it looks nice to have 10 and 10 and 10 it doesn't mean that it's correct and the the the thing that I told him to notice first of all is can you see if CBOs are working in this ad account because when you go in a new ad account it doesn't mean that you have to reinvent the wheel so can you see if new CBO if CBOs are working yes you had some campaigns that there are CBOs and they're working there perfect so step number one step number two can we see over there if uh we have an average cost per purchase let's take one campaign that has several uh leads for example because it was lead 10 so the cost per lead in this campaign that had much volume and it was successful also it was 15.

so I told him that how come you're adding 10 10 10 in a daily budget that basically it's going to reset on a daily level and it's like you're asking I want to have a cost per lead every day for 10 dollars while your best ever result was 15. so I told him look if you don't want to use a CBO for your reason perfect use an EBO but just do one ad set and do do all the 30 there take the best ad set that you had move it on 30. if you want to do a CBO again you have better chances because you can have three assets for example but it doesn't mean that it's going to spend 10 10 10 you have better chances of spending more money to one of them and actually getting a cost per lead that makes sense because as we said several times on this channel it doesn't matter if you spend 300 dollars for example in the course of how many days I don't know many days but it matters if you're spent how much so let's say it doesn't matter if you spend 300 dollars in 300 days it matters if you're spending 300 per day because with 300 in 300 days you're just spending one dollar per day which is nothing so the end budget that you're going to have it's it says nothing okay your daily budget says a lot and when you have you just just observe guys just go to the ad account you're seeing cbos are working okay I have to try try cbos do I have limited budget perfect I have only 30 dollars to spend what is my average cost per lead that I'm getting here 15 was the best one okay so I cannot have a budget on an abo for 10 dollars the minimum that I have to do is 20 okay but if I can do a cbo maybe I will try to do a little bit better but you know with cbo I can put three assets which means that I'm trying to get 10 on each but cbo is going to distribute the budget so I'm having very good chances of actually getting better results so with cbo I can test faster three assets instead of one or run a crazy method it doesn't matter so I can test three assets instead of one with abo it's much more slower so I have to put 30 dollars in just one so I would prefer in my case in if it was mine I would prefer to run a cbo with 30 and have three assets inside so the best ones that I could see on the ad account again don't forget that you don't have to reinvent the wheel in an ad account you can go and you can check what was working and just move with that before we go again to the main topic I want to say two more things that came to my mind while I was talking about that first of all there are a lot of messages that I'm getting which are all about hey I want to do this change here and there and I want to do this or do that and everything I just want to clarify something that whenever you're doing a change on the ad account you need to think if you're winning something out of it if you're just touching something just to touch it this is this is always bad and a very bad behavior keep in your mind that whenever you're touching something you're taking a risk of ruining something or making a mistake or making something correct but still you're taking a risk of doing something wrong the ideal case scenario is that you're running ads the ideal okay and you you don't have to touch them that's the ideal case scenario if you have to touch them you are always thinking what am I going to win out of that because if I have if I'm going to win just 0.02 ROAS by just doing a change it's better for me not to touch it because I might ruin it so first thing first thing is this that you need to always ask yourself what am I going to win out of that and does it worth it and the risk and all of that because there's always going to be a risk and you have to wait your options and the the other thing that that I want to mention is something that I forgot okay I remembered the next thing that I wanted to say is that we need we need at some point guys we need to stop all of this madness with blueprints okay I do know that they sound appealing I do know that people like to follow rules and stuff but you have to understand that Facebook doesn't work like this so this madness has to stop when you listen people talk about follow this blueprint and stuff you have to run away from them the same way that I'm mentioning here that Meta cannot just say that this advanced plus audience is going to increase 30 percent of your results just because it increased in another business the two businesses are completely different so when we see someone saying that follow this blueprint and stuff and just because it worked for their business it doesn't mean that it's going to work for yours this is this is a new crucial thing that whoever is following my channel or my students or on my mentorships and stuff I want all of them to just follow this common sense uh concept because this is not about training people in this channel we don't care about training people for one business but for every single business that they're going to create in their lives that's why we don't have blueprints and we don't say that the crazy method is working everywhere I'm not saying this kind of things I'm just saying that I'm I'm just trying to put as much content as I can with things that I'm seeing that are working so that you can find your own blueprint and what is working for your business now and maybe find another blueprint for another business and so on so that being said a lot of times people tell me how can I test new products guys it's very simple based on this previous discussion you go into your ad account you see what is working for example you are seeing that you're having a campaign of 200 300 cbo with five assets that it's that it's actually a a winner campaign perfect the question here is how can I test things on my ad account with only one variable and let me explain what I mean so I'm having for example in my ad account new creatives that I want to test I will take a proven structure a cbo campaign that is working on an uh with some other creatives there but it's working so this is proven that this structure is working for example it has lookalikes or broad so I know that I'm going to test it with lookalikes because they do actually work this period on my ad account and I'm going to change the creatives one variable the creatives let's say for example that I want to test different things I'm taking the creatives that I have which are working I have seen them working with a structure and then I'm changing for example I'm doing crazy method broad targeting I'm doing crazy method stack lookalikes to see if lookalikes are working I'm doing an advantage plus with the creatives that they are successful in order to make it work so all of these are things that whenever I'm doing something on um on meta I'm trying to have one variable and now comes the question what if I have a new ad account you can do whatever you want if you have a new ad account guys play okay you can use things that they're working in other ad accounts but just try to test them and stuff as soon as you find something working though you have to move with the one variable rule and try to do it again and again because it's going to be more cost efficient for you not for any other reason now by talking with people I realize that all of these things are common sense to me but since it's not a common sense for a lot of people I'm not going to be bored of telling them of saying them and explaining them again and again and again now so much time passed and we haven't touched the main topic so let's go straight away to the main topic make sure that all the main topic is on the free part I don't I want this to be on the free part if we end up having all the questions on the second part do it so I got a message from one old friend she send me that hi Konstantinos I signed up for your patron thank you very much by the way guys thank you very much for the support on the patron and uh for you liking to listen to all the podcast um love learning from you and congratulations on your baby thank you very much actually yesterday guys she slept for six hours straight which is a very big progress for us uh I'm still trying to figure it out and as I said job I've taken um on designing other authors season author um other authors Shopify stores and landing pages and some of my clients had suddenly stopped seeing their UK conversions she posted also on um on the group which was crazy because it was it was something I I'd done so after a lot of research we realized that in an effort to comply with all the GDPR regulations by putting up the Shopify cookie banner we lost the ability to track them in the UK they have opt-in into tracking and who's going to do that it's much uh like the iOS 14 debacle um she's an author so I guess this is this is a word that I have to learn uh so we removed the cookie banner and uh tracking uh continuous but uh all the risk of uh non-compliance at least the mystery is solved first of all I have done this discussion with several people uh there are few people that are uh having this um compliance ready and get going if we're talking about Shopify I need to clarify that whoever has done the Shopify integration on the settings and then uh on the I think it's on it's on settings personalized somewhere there it's on you are going to find the cookie banners for EU UK and United States the different states um so this is for EU and UK it's a DGPR regulation and we have also the states of um it's called CCP something let me find it yeah it's called CCPA California uh uh ccpa uh India has DPDP uh Virginia has CDPA uh GDPR and others the states that they have it is California Colorado Connecticut Utah and Virginia and here I'm having a road map of why this is happening actually now you can see that on 2019 on October 9th we had submission of proposal for California privacy rights then we had some privacy protection agency established on 2020 process of formulating adopting on 2021 so this is something that starts from 2020 with the personal data and everything uh personal information collection 2022 uh becomes liable under the CPRA um then final CPRA regulations adopting by CPPA uh I'm not an expert all of that I'm just giving you a time frame so a time frame and um the information that I have guarded so that you can research it more um the only reason that I'm mentioning this is because it's affecting uh reporting and we're going to discuss this in a bit um then on January 1st 2023 California Privacy Rights Act enters into full force and then enforcement of the CPRA begins under the CPPA on July 1st so there are going to be several companies that they're going to try to do it because before the July 1st now what are the consequences I have no idea I have I don't have any clue of what's going to happen is going to be fines is it going to be getting banned on Shopify getting banned on Facebook is it going to be getting sued by people I don't know what are the consequences now uh two things first of all the people who have done it through Shopify they had huge problems and basically uh they lost reporting we need to say something about cookies first of all into your settings on your uh Facebook on the events manager if you go to settings you're going to see first party cookies on this was the first thing that we had and we said okay we're not going to have a problem with cookies because the removal of the cookies from Google meant that okay we have a problem over here but then we had this setting inside meta that was saying that first party cookies are on so we're not going to have a problem we're still going to be able to capture data secondly cookies are being categorized to three brackets it's the personal it's marketing and it's general so if someone goes into a website and they click over there that I don't accept the marketing cookies there's no reporting zero reporting so what is happening is that I guess with the way that it's being set up with Shopify it's asking them if you accept this cookie or that cookie all of that with different check marks so when people don't accept we don't have any reporting in case you stopped having reporting because you have done any changes and stuff that's that's the reason over there you have to research it secondly there are some ways like over here I had a suggestion from someone saying that you can use a service but the developer will know better of course always talk with developers about that I'm pretty sure it's going to be a learning curve also like the API integration that we had a lot of people saying that they can do it that they couldn't do it and then it's more mainstream for people to do API integrations you need to have a good developer I guess free and custom solutions like this is not affiliated by the way it's called cookiebot.com basically what it does is that it takes you to the mode of having from from my understanding okay remember I'm wrong it takes you to the mode of having not the different brackets of cookies but it has it has something like and it says another message here also says just to help it more and the solution I know is through google tag manager google tag manager is a container where you can have all tags without going into the original code of the website with the risk of breaking something you will need a developer to do the setup of the consent mode in gtm also there are two modes in the settings the basic mode and the advanced mode in the basic mode if the user doesn't consent you don't get any data in the advanced mode if he doesn't consent you don't get the personal data to use it in remarketing but you do get the conversions you have to tell this to the developer so basically there are just these two settings even if people are going to decline you're not taking the personal data but you're getting the marketing cookies in order for you to be able to continue with the settings that you're doing on shopify you're not having this advanced mode so you're having a problem I have companies that they have implemented that and we have zero problems it doesn't mean that you're not going to have problems but be careful in general we don't have a lot of time if we believe on the timeline and it's going to be start it's going to start being in full power on july 1st the other thing that i must say is that meta has paid a lot of fines to eu for the gdpr and all of these things so i think that they're also going to take action on that now that because meta and shopify go together when api came out shopify was one of the first companies that actually had an integration with meta so they're they're brother companies they do work really closely and in my opinion that's one of the reasons that shopify is doing so well except from the fact that it's a very good platform actually it gives you the possibility of having an e-commerce store without the fuzz of several other things that you have to do so i think that the secret over here is the advanced mode uh compared to the basic mode that the advanced mode even when they're going to decline personally guys and let me know in the comments i never uh decline cookies i don't know why but i never do you decline cookies on you do so she does you uh so sorry so basically the problem is this i i don't know why but i don't decline cookies i do accept most of the times because there are just some uh stupid um windows that they open and they bother me while i'm shopping um but uh as i said there are people that are declining them um the thing is that i think that even if they decline them and we have the advanced mode that it's actually going to just decline the general the personal cookies uh then we're going to be able to capture the general and the marketing ones i hope that they given the fact that i don't like to analyze things that i'm not 100 sure and i don't know them also i'm i'm answering to one comment on my group there's nothing wrong with admitting that you don't know something it's it's always good okay because it helps people and saves people time this is what i have gathered guys and this is what um you can research also uh about this cookie thing and let me know also the comments if you have any good solution and stuff about it um but uh i'm pretty sure that that that's uh that's all i have gathered and i have nothing else of course now this is the thing that i'm going to cover more and more by watching what some of my clients are doing but i need also to say that most probably they're going to be people that they might find solution let's say for example that this is very bad and there are solutions but they are very difficult or that not a lot of people know them the logic says that people are not going to share them because they're going to have much less competition in their ads if we want to be pragmatic over here uh if if someone has a solution about this and he's the only one the others are going to stop advertising because they don't have reporting so basically he's going to be able to make more money for a certain period until other people's uh cuts up but we'll see guys if i have a solution i'm i'm which is solid and concrete i'm going to tell you with shopify i think that's going to be easy uh i don't know if cookie bot integrates with several sites and stuff i know that with some platforms like click funnels which is always problematic there are going to be issues wordpress i think it's going to be fine then and i don't know the consequences now let's let's read a little bit about uh shopify and what we have here from from what they said how does that affect shopify event tracking this new update affects the data collected for marketing and analytic purposes the direct conversion api integration the shopify store is also affected as the user event data data is not tracked at all when the user's location is eea or uk i don't know what is eea ea is eu let's search it right so that we don't have any what the eea ea ea countries is the european union yeah yeah but what does eea stand for ah european economic area yeah i should have known that because it has it on the it has it on the selection of countries if you can just want to get the countries that they have euro and the default setting is changed from partially collected before consent oh i forgot to tell you that now that i see it another person a developer actually told me that with google tag manager and with these programs because you you might be thinking that someone is coming and they are not clicking on the uh on the box um somebody told me that with the google tag manager and stuff um again i'm going to explain it in the way that i understood it there is a delay on on when events are going to be triggered until until someone is going to click for example when somebody goes to the site the event doesn't trigger immediately it gives it a delay until it's getting triggered so that somebody can click accept or decline on the cookies this is another thing that they told me the default setting is changed from partially collected before consent to uh collect after consent so this is what the send is doing okay if you don't um consent we are doing partially collection of events now we don't do any collection of events therefore the shopify event tracking does not yield accurate results there is a lot of signal loss that happens causing discrepancies in the data set to google ads google analytics meta ads and others the shopify marketing analytics will also not be able to give you the full accurate data so if you're relying on the data in the shopify dashboard then be cautious as to what you see do not believe what you see oh so it's we're not going to have accurate reporting also on shopify data but we're going to have the sales i guess over there in order to compare it uh how to know um but but we're not going to have other data like uh visits and all of that because the sales is something that we're going to have anyway it's happening on shopify how to know do you know do you know something that i'm thinking now you don't accept cookies that means that you don't want to share your personal info okay don't buy why do you buy and you you don't accept cookies why do you buy if you don't accept cookies and you don't buy fine but why do you buy if you don't accept cookies uh and then you're sending your information like you're paying with your card you're i just don't i just don't get it i think i think we're going into i do understand that we have to protect personal data but i think that we we take it to a whole other level anyway but but of course we cannot complain because to be honest the um all of these platforms have been abusing the users data uh of course it was written on the terms of services and stuff when we were accepting to be part of these uh platforms but still they have been abused a lot uh the shopify marketing analytics will also not be able to give you the full accurate data yeah that's it we read it uh how to know if you're affected by this opify update if you notice the sudden deep in web traffic for european regions your store is likely affected by this update compare the data with your shopify analytics blah blah that's easy why did shopify bring in this event tracking change with meta facing huge fines in the eu for not complying with gdpr all the big tech companies are looking forward gdpr compliance the recent move by shopify is personally a move towards gdpr compliance gdpr to date is seen as the ideal data protection regulation that all the other companies are looking towards india ddp dd dp dp california ccpa virginia cdpa and others see gdpr as an ideal regulation and have almost all the provisions of gdpr so to avoid any further complications and fines from the government oh so it says that it's about fines from the government and law implementing agencies shopify has made a clever move of course they have to protect their side how to implement shopify event tracking that means the constant update you can fix the shopify event tracking issue uh that means the major update by shopify which prevents tracking users before concern here's the three three steps and it has step one which is talking about the preferences no two this temporarily fix might not be able forever as shopify also looks forward transitioning into a tool that complies with data privacy laws and regulation step two adopt a consent manager to display a cookie consent banner the one that we said for the people in european uh in eurozone and the uk cookie bot oh so cookie bot the one that i mentioned cookie script and other cookie consent managers are easy to implement the same so they're also proposing cookie bot cookie bot is one of the most that they have seen from more people actually proposing it step three use server side data collection using two such customer labs cdp to collect first party data using customer labs it has a link also here so i guess they are they are cooperating with each other will ensure to have one source of truth for all of your customer data by having an unified profile for every user your behavior data is stored in a gdpr compliant way and helps you use it across multiple ad platforms i'm pretty sure guys that most probably there are going to be news also from companies like wicked report triple whale and all of that that they will try to make their own versions of that in order because all the thing that they do is tracking here's how we check the impact of this change collected before concert for the users from uh european uh zone and uk we have first chosen the option collected before consent in shopify customer private settings in the preferences under online store the data flows seamlessly into the customer lab app this option has no impact and therefore when we looked at the data at the event parameters we were able to collect uh were all there we can collect enough data to send it to meta and other ad platforms through the server in a secure way preventing the privacy of the user perfect collected after consent next we have turned on the collect after consent option with this on when the user comes in and makes a purchase all the behavior data is still flowing seamlessly oh so my point of view that when they make a purchase they actually share the data so they do go through this because um it is a first party data and it is a um private serving method of collecting data and activating it across that platform so even when you choose uh the collected after consent option using a tool like customer lab so basically they are selling a little bit the customer lab solution over here uh anonymize the data group and it understands the behavior to come up with marketing strategies and to personalize that experience we don't like things that anonymize the data because this is not how facebook works on facebook we want to know who made the sale in order to continue having sales don't forget that we have reporting on meta that it's not um tied to a person and this is not helping at all this is what companies like triple whale and other companies are doing they are also reporting data back but we don't care about that we care about having reporting on the asset level of who was the person that bought if we are missing that then we have a problem into the optimization optimization process i'm not saying that facebook is going to close and so not going to be effective i'm just saying that we're going to have less and less data in order to continue optimizing and have better results so after that we're going to have x results on meta for example one rows and in reality it's going to be 2.5 rows but this is not something that we can scale because every scale is going to be a gamble because it's going to be without data that met actually sees within the platform i hope it makes sense the above experiment has instilled confidence in our clients the customer data is not being missed out due to any of the policy changes as our innovative technology is compliant with gdpr already conclusion the update released by shopify on october 31st 2023 that changes how the data is collected in a milestone and it's called to be fully privacy compliant of course all of us we caught up on that this month because the next month is going to be applied after the limited data in california colorado and connect can they collected after consent option in european zone and uk shopify is trying to be compliant with all these data privacy regulations the only way to leap ahead into the future is to start collecting your first party data using a privacy compliant customer data platform that's all with this thing i think that we covered it enough now guys that you know it's up to you to do your own research and stuff i think that i covered it extensively now for all of you asking if i'm going to make a video about this on youtube i'm not why because i don't have the answers there is no point of me posting a video saying that i have seen this and that and that this is why we have the podcast i have seen this and that if i don't have a solution i cannot create a video telling you that you should do this and that and that also i do believe that this is more of a developer thing and a company thing to be compliant with things and we are just being involved a little bit because it affects us in terms of reporting let's go to your questions hello hello paul hello i'm doing only dynamic catalog ads on broad good for you it's working on several accounts because trying readers and look alike wasn't good enough in broad they are giving me positive results i tried to scale doing crazy method but the results wasn't that good okay my question is that dynamic catalog ads don't work to scale of course they work for scaling um or say or should i do advanced plus campaign or just increase the money by 20 every three days thank you very much okay the answer is very simple if you if you have something that the logic here says this but from my experience at least not because i want to defend the crazy method maybe it's not working it's not working or you don't know how to optimize it there are several aspects to it so if something is working with volume and draws not just having a small not just having a small spend and good draws if something is working working by having good volume a lot of sales and good draws then it's going to work on crazy method you can tell me things like i did the crazy method campaign and killed my previous campaign these are things that can happen but in from my experience and in theory it's working always if you have these two things in an ad set now you are saying things like it wasn't good enough so i'm guessing that it's having results but you're not happy with the rows maybe you want a lot of rows and you're trying to scale maybe for example there are some people that i meet a lot of times and they say i have five rows okay by spending 100 and they want to spend 1k while they're breaking my rows is 1.8 spend 1k still have five rows this is not going to happen forget about it i'm sensing that you are in this category of people so if you want to scale while you're maintaining your high rows that you have now on smaller spends it's not going to happen you have to decide what you want if you want rows or if you want growth now if you're not in that case and you just want to scale but it's not about the rows you should test all of the things that you mentioned and see which one is working better for you not only in terms of a technical level what is working better for you but what works better for your mentality your character and all of that maybe the crazy method is not working well for you because you don't like to optimize on cbo maybe you like to optimize better on advanced plus maybe you are a person that you like more to do the 20 percent um the 20 percent thing okay so this is so if you if you like for example the 20 percent more uh it's up to you to decide what uh what you're going to do there okay but for sure be my guest and test if you if you test you never lose okay now let's continue to the next questions we have renat over here hello constantinos what do you mean with the term consolidation campaigns so this is not the term that it's mine this is a term which is coming from meta basically what we have is that meta is saying that you should not run multiple campaigns i don't know with who i have done a discussion recently that was talking about uh yeah i remember it was a message sent to one of my students from one of his old mentors telling him that what we're doing right now is just two campaigns one for testing and one for um one for cold traffic and um i i was actually amazed by that because i don't believe at all at it and i believe in doing several campaigns but not in not in the way that they mean it so we have to we have to explain a little bit what we mean by doing several campaigns and what they are proposing what they're proposing is doing consolidation which means that you are running the least possible campaigns that you can if you're not running for example more than 100k they say that you need to have just only two campaigns and put all of your budget there now this is something that if your product is very good and all of that it's going to work on some other accounts but in the majority of the other accounts if you don't split your budget because you have to scale gradually you're not just going to scale immediately since day one either you will have to start with a campaign that you're going to scale with the 20 rule which has a lot of risk or you and you will have to be able to scale also by just using the same creative stuff so which is a problem what i'm proposing is that you're scaling with multiple campaigns having multiple different creatives that they are convincing more people to buy if you haven't seen my video about the daily demand the the daily loop theory and how to break the daily loop theory i think you should go there by the way i'm going to make a part b for the more complex stuff about the daily loop theory so this is what they mean by consolidation that they want you to have the least possible number of campaigns we believe the exact opposite that you should have many but not with the same creative this is where this is where the misconception comes there are a lot of people that they just want to scale with one creative and one product and we say that you can scale but you can scale with many creatives many products many winner many different creatives for the same product different countries this is how you're scaling in ad accounts uh yeah i guess that's all and you know the the problem with one other account that's starting right now because i said it i said several times that going from 50k to 100k it's not so difficult basically uh it's it's really easy instead of spending 2k per day you spend 3k per day it's also difficult if you do it with uh three 1k campaigns be my guest for sure do it that's not an issue but in most of the accounts when you are scaling you have to break through uh you know you have to keep spending more and more by just making a breakthrough month by month so there is already an established spend of your competitors and they have to make mistakes or liberate budget or you have to make better your offer in order for you to take bigger chunk of the market so you're doing this gradually you cannot just do one campaign that has 3k and now there are people that they just use the 20 rule eventually you're going to make a mistake with the 20 rule i have videos showing that and it's going to collapse when you have several campaigns even if one campaign collapses then basically what you can do is that you can just close it and move on with another one and just not replace it also you are having more campaigns with more creatives that they're becoming post ideas and they are super powerful and they are actually helping you to scale because they have so much credibility anyway that's uh that's what we mean with consolidation and that's why we're against it this is the end of the first part of the facebook ads breaking news podcast if you don't want to miss the second half of the
