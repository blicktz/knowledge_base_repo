Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about the new ASC style that we have in our accounts. Some of you might not but some of you are already having it and if we're going to start using the crazy method again heavily. So there were comments like this that they were saying that okay crazy method maybe it's the opportunity again to use crazy method because now we have multiple ad sets.

I'm going to show you into my pc the differences about the new ASC campaigns which are now named instead of advantage shopping campaigns they're called advantage sales campaigns. I'm going to show you in my pc how they look and what we can do there and the different tests that I'm running right now but with comments like this that they were saying that hey maybe crazy method again and stuff. I have tried the crazy method the previous spring that they tried to do the same thing it wasn't working and this time I have tried again and it is working so this is what we're going to see today.

Before we go into my pc a little bit of context from several people that they have asked meta reps they are going to roll these changes gradually and everyone is going to have eventually this kind of setup it's not something that they're testing and maybe they're going to take back it's official it's going to happen to all their accounts it's a matter of when but they always roll the changes bit by bit across their account. Thank you very much meta for doing this while I was creating the videos for my course that means that I will have to do some of the videos and stuff but anyway I don't think that it's really bad because so far it's working and I haven't seen any issues but we will see how it's going to end up being. On the other hand I'm starting the tests already of testing it with ABO with CBO with crazy method and I will let you know more and more as I test what are the results.

Let's go into my pc because as you said I will have to do all the hard work so I'm doing the hard work so that you will know what to do. Let's go into my pc let me show you what I have done maybe later we will have more videos this is the start bear with me I'm also testing but I'm also going to do it like meta I'm going to test gradually is it working here okay let's do it now to two accounts is it working there let's do it now there and there and this is how I also test by doing it gradually and not to all of my other accounts. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that's going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there.

So as I said most of you you're not going to be able to see it I'm having access to more than 50 now accounts and I have it in only two so it's a change that is being rolled out across the accounts slowly. You are going to be able to see this message over here that says new way to edit sales campaigns blah blah and all of that you're going to see this option when you're going to create one campaign and it's not going to prompt the option of picking the ASC campaign or the manual sales campaign. So basically now on the sales campaign you're going to have one option as I said it's going to be a change that's going to be rolled over across many all of our accounts eventually this is what Meta does and they do it you know slowly.

This is what I also do this is how I test. First I test into my good ad accounts into very good ad accounts so I'm not going to be an asshole and tell you that this thing is working 100% because I'm always honest with you but I'm testing it in a good ad account. Why?

Because if it's not working in a good ad account I'm not going to test it on the bad ad accounts it's very simple. So if it's working on a good ad account I'm going to start spreading more and more and more and testing it into more ad accounts as I said. So let's go and let's see what I have done and let's see these new settings also.

So as you can see it's a new ad account it's another account that I'm scaling right now. When you create so you're going to have this okay it's going to create immediately you're not going to have any option. You will see this one on the right side and it means that everything is going to be turned on except for this one we don't want it.

It's like now we don't have the option of doing ASE or manual we have the option of doing only advantage sales campaign as they call it and this is a CBO it has also the option for ABO we're going to talk a little bit about it. Basically this is like a normal campaign but there are several things that I would like to show you. This is the CBO setting.

I will show you in a little bit how to go into the ABO setting. Nothing else here, nothing important. Again the same thing all the settings over here that you have to add are the same except from this one.

The placements again it's automatic placements over here okay and we have the suggested audience. In order for you to go to the original audience which is not the original audience like the original audience but we will talk about it. It's your switch setup.

Of course they encourage you not to do it and all of that. Still we have the option over here advantage plus on as you can see but we need to define something. So my opinion about this okay and I want to be very honest of what I believe it's happening here.

We do have over here the this is the advantage plus audience okay there's no doubt that it's the same style. It has the limits the location minimum age that can go up to 25 years old okay you cannot go more than that and you have all language and all of that. So this one even if you put suggestions over here for age, gender and some targeting custom audiences lookalikes whatever it's going to start with those and then expand to whatever it's here.

This is what is going to actually respect okay. Now if you do this one which is looking like the original audience option that we used to have let's switch it up you are seeing that what we're having is this and it shows detailed targeting it shows that we can use also different custom audiences here lookalikes and all of that. I can tell you with certainty that these are interests that they're very close to my audience.

So it's taking this relevance from somewhere which doesn't say from where okay but for sure over here it's taking some interest that I would be using to target this audience. This is happening to the original one let me see what is happening if I switch to this one and try to add suggestions. It's doing the same thing so it wouldn't let me.

Okay so it's trying to find relevance on its own. I'm trying to understand what is going to happen on new ad account but this is something that we'll just have to see or maybe now it's bugging and I'm completely wrong but for sure it's having some here that they represent the audience that I'm targeting if I want to use interests. So in this option over here my opinion is that what it's going to do if you are going to because advanced plus is on what is going to happen is that it's going to respect the age gender and location only okay so it might expand it to the full potential reach so if you're having broad over here and the potential reach is 169 and then you come here and you put only women women then we also reach people beyond your gender setting and you can remove that.

This is a new setting also that they don't have in other places okay so you can put that so that you can actually put only up to women okay and when you put the gender the age okay they have also the same option. This is also a new setting as I'm seeing over here that that means that they are you're going to respect like this so this is the new setting that we have that you can put your own settings here that it's going to respect that it's not going to expand it to a better to to a bigger audience which is the age and all of that of course it's going to for sure if we do only one state is it going to expand it to the whole united states let's say for example that we do Nevada United States is it going to expand yeah is your select adds to people interested in your selected cities and regions in those countries so yeah so in this country it's going to reach to more people so it's going to expand also here if you want to expand to more united states if you uncheck this button okay perfect good to know all of that and then we have all of these let's see if we are doing if we're having something on the lookalikes and then guys i know that you're here for the crazy method we will go to the crazy method okay so the lookalikes we have nothing so i guess this one is just here and it's just going to expand it to more people yeah because now it's actually really small because we have Nevada let me remove that and we'll put united states okay so the potential reach now is 7.7 million uh which is because of that so i'm guessing that if we check the marks over here it could expand it to more because we expand it also to men and to all genders 8.1 million and this is a suggestion as it says in the custom audience and it's going to expand it then to the full potential uh and it's i'm i'm guessing okay uh but if you remove those it's not going to expand to those it's just going to expand it to if you remove that then so sorry if you remove this and if you remove this then and you remove the lookalike it's just going to expand it to the broad which is going to be 60 million so it's going to start from the 8 million but it's going to expand it to this 60 million if you check the buttons it's going to the expanded to the full potential reach i hope that all of this makes sense because this is something that you need to know in order for you to know where you can expand and when where you don't want to actually expand now this one we're going to keep it like this we have done videos about the automatic placements and what's happening there and why we use automatic placements there is no point of discussing it let's go a little bit to discuss on how you can do instead of doing the campaign budget optimization to the campaign level how you can do asset budget then the thing that you can do which is pretty fast and it can work pretty well for you it's just duplicate one asset immediately 15 minutes later and as soon as you have a second asset you can see now that you can use the asset option over here now enough with the new setup let's go now to discuss about the crazy method and all of that and what i have done so in this campaign since we can work with multiple assets over here as you can see what i have done is that i have done a crazy method basically which is from now on when we're going to to refer to crazy method asc is is going to be not many back in the day it was having an asc with one asset and duplicating the same ad multiple times and i told you that i don't like this strategy i do it only when i'm desperate and most of the time with a catalog now we have the option of having multiple assets over here in an asc what is an asc first of all asc campaign i think that from now on we're going to call the campaigns that we have everything on the cb optimization which is the advantage over here which is this one basically this over here which is going to be this when we have the budget we're using campaign budget when we're having the audience as a broad audience for the pixel to know what to do over here and for placements this is what we're going to call a crazy method ac you can still do a crazy method by just doing stacked lookalikes here on the audience you can still do a crazy method by using different interests and all of that but over here you can see that this is going to be a crazy method asc if we cannot use interest also in the way that i have seen unless it's a bug or whatever and it's just going to tell us what kind of interest we will use as a suggestion then what is going to happen is that most likely we're going to be running only broad and just hope that we're going to train the algorithm enough so that it can understand how we can run eventually asc campaigns and in my opinion the crazy method with the different hot pockets and all of this it's going to help a lot and i think that we're going to start using it a lot if all of this system is going to work but as i said it's going to be something that they're going to roll out across all their accounts so over here we're seeing that i'm running a crazy method asc basically which is having everything on no interest nothing just using the advanced plus audience advanced plus placements just pro targeting and just focusing on my creatives for this specific case i'm using six ad sets over here with a budget of 200 it's working pretty well as you can see but don't get fooled because as we said this is a good account that i was expecting it to work well if it wasn't going to work well we were not going to even have a video i'm going to start testing it now as i see it more this kind of style of campaigns to different accounts and start seeing if it's going to work there and if the hot pockets are going to help it i have a better feeling about the previous feeling that i had on the previous spring about this one and i think that it's going to work better i use the same six ads across all of the assets all the assets they have the same six ads i'm going to optimize it here only on the asset level based on the results there's nothing to optimize here the results are very good anyway and i'm going to keep running crazy method campaigns because here it worked so now this is one option that you have the other option is to run an advanced plus campaign and this is what i'm going to do from now on if i have a lot of grades let's say that i have 10 or 20 creatives the other thing that i would like to do here is to run it like this basically with two assets one of them is going to have just one dollar spending and the other one is going to have my main budget why am i doing this because if you remember i didn't have the option of changing to abo over here on the campaign budget i couldn't change it to abo because i had only one asset so in order for me to run as an abo i need to have two assets so in order for me to do my optimization on the ad level like this one okay i'm going to run it like this here i'm having six ads because i'm testing right now anyway there are different ads from the previous one because i'm not trying to find if one is better than the other i'm trying to find now if they're working later i'm going to pass to the phase that i'm going to check which one is better because there are more factors also like sustainability how long they can stay and all of that now over here as you can see i'm having the one which is one dollar you can put 50 cents whatever and over here i'm having the 200 which is again six ads and i'm optimizing this time on the ad level now someone might come and say are you crazy what's the difference between running a cbo one ad set ase and running an abo one ad set ase call me crazy that is totally inappropriate but in the previous spring what happened is that when i was doing that i would see that the cbo one ad set ase wasn't working so now because i don't believe whatever meta is going to say i'm going to test everything okay so i'm testing to see is abo better than cbo and so on so i'm trying to treat it like an abo over here the only way that i have found is by just having one ad set here with one dollar because it couldn't let me do it with one single uh ad set and that's my update about it these are the things that i'm testing right now i think that the crazy method is going to work i have this feeling i don't know but we're going to see on the other ad accounts and for sure you're going to see more videos in the future it's not only about the crazy method i show you also how the new ase advantage sales campaigns are and what you're about to see in your ad account in the close future and i will see you for the closing of the video so these are the new changes if you believe it or not i have a very good sense about the crazy method that this is going to be another cbo optimization and stuff i don't know if we will end up optimizing with a much more difficult structure to cbo and ad set level we're going to see i haven't seen that yet and i don't know but for sure what i'm going to do is that i'm going to start expanding to more ad accounts doing the crazy method ase as long as i'm able to do so and start testing it i'm very positive about this you can also test it and let me know in the comments please if it has worked for you or maybe the other thing with the abo worked better for you don't forget that you can learn more about my book my course my mentorship program and below you can find all the different people that they have completed my mentorship programs and their testimonials and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
