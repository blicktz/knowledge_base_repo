Hello Facebook Guts people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about this video that I have created and now we're going to see the progress after one month. If you haven't seen this video I think you should go check it first and then come to see the second part which is the progress so that I will not have to say all the things that I said in the previous video on this one and if you're lazy to do it I don't give a **** you should go and you should watch the first video. So let's go on my PC let me show you how this account is doing after one month and I will see you there.

So back again in this ad account what do we see over here? We see the things that we were discussing that the CPMs are pretty high as you can see over here but this is the campaign that I was talking to you about in the previous video that now I was aiming for consistency. So I managed to get 77 sales over here and the truth is that there is no other campaign in this ad account that had so many sales even on promos and stuff.

The biggest one is with 24 or whatever. So 77 sales the cost per purchase is still not good, the CPMs is not so good and everything but we have managed to also lower the cost per unique click to 2.68 which is it's not even compared with the others and the CTR to 2.36. That means that in this campaign we were actually able to get some decent results for this ad account which is a new pixel and stuff but now we have the other discussion because as I told you the initial thing is to see can I get some results in this ad account which are going to be consistent and if we watch on the last 7 days we're even going better in terms of the cost per purchase that we are having over here but if we go on the 13th for example 13th zero sales 12th we have three sales on the 11th seven no sales then on the 10th one sale then on the 9th three sales then on the 8th no sales of this one on the 7th one on the 6th two on the 5th two and so on and so on what I'm trying to prove with that that from the point that we were having one sale every two three days and that was also rare now we're at the point that we're having sale sale sale maybe one day without sale sale sale I want to reach the point that we will have sales every day with my ads of course right now I'm spending just 100 dollars per day on this one which is a new because it's a new pixel and everything but also except from that I managed to have a campaign which is working for a very long period generating data which is going to help me to make the pixel better and optimize better for the niche having lower cpm comparing to what I'm having on the other campaigns okay optimizing in a hot pocket inside over here because it's only one ad set that actually worked in a hot pocket which gave me better cost per click better cpm better everything and now that I reached the point that I have consistency I know that over here I'm getting this kind of results this is where I am how can we improve that and this is the discussion now that you have to make with the owner and explain to him that look the results that you're getting right now the cpm's the cost per click and everything that you're getting right now is this can we make something better happen with the data that you with the numbers that you can improve within the ad account for example can we increase the average order value because over here we are getting on the last seven days we're getting 86 dollars cost per purchase which is much better from everything else that we had so far it is our progress and we are getting 0.8 rows in order for us to get even to 1.6 we need to get 40 dollars cost per purchase which is a half one and maybe it's not even going to be enough what does this mean that we have a problem in the funnel the numbers of the company are not correct over here we have numbers that they don't make sense maybe we need to increase the average order value by doing bundles we need to lower the cost of the products because they are super expensive and we are pushing the price of the product to be expensive all of this kind of stuff and this is how you know because now you know that you have consistent sales and this is what facebook is giving you as I said in previous videos nobody invited you to advertise on the facebook platform flashback dear constantinos please come to advertise on our platform and we will give you exactly the cpm that you want and the return on ads that you want so that you can be happy and profitable we promise yours sincerely mark zuckerberg and it doesn't mean that because you had an idea or a product or something if you put it on facebook it's going to be profitable the numbers also need to make sense this is why a lot of times when i meet people that they have a brand which is already working and they don't understand how important is this i'm telling them that they were lucky enough to have something that worked with the funnel that worked and they never had the hassle of actually being able to find something that's working the numbers to make sense and everything so here we have a typical situation that we reach to the point that we can do nothing better with facebook ads whatever i'm doing on top of this campaign it's having awful cpm what whatever you may think of very bad cost per unique click other creatives other creatives it's not working so we reach the point that we have one campaign with one creative that is working very well and now what we need to do is we need to improve the funnel the numbers the cost of the product the shipping the average order value everything because as it stands right now for me with the results that we're getting over here it's very clear that it's never going to improve to a point where is it going to get to 20 dollars cost per purchase to 30 still it's not going to be enough so something needs to change on the numbers of the company i don't mind if someone comes and tells that that uh he could have done it better be my guest but the problem here is that we need to also understand that not every business is suitable for advertising on facebook and unless if there if changes are not going to be made i'm not going to continue working on this account because this is where uh i can reach it now if other things come to place like influencer marketing organic or whatever which is going to help it then maybe it's going to work for sure we know that it's selling okay and it can have consistent sales but we know that the numbers of the company are not correct and i really like and i enjoy making this kind of videos so that you can understand that it's not only a channel that is showing six rows seven rows five rows two rows with very high expense or whatever it's a channel that is trying to show also content that it's deep technical so that you can understand and it's going it's going to help you but because even if you have a trained pixel and the trained account these kind of situations here help you to understand how good you are comparing to other advertisers that they haven't sorted their numbers yet it's not fancy but it's reality so that's all i had to show you as you can understand it's not only about what you're doing in facebook ads the strategies that constantinos or somebody else is giving but it's also about the product the pricing the funnels everything has to work flawlessly in order for you to be profitable don't forget
