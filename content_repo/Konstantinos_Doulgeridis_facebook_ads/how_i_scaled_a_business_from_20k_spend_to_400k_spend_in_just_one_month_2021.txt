Hello Facebook Ads people! Today I'm going to show you one of my case studies for 2021 where I implemented all of my ideas and all of my different strategies. I had the budget to do it and I scaled one account from 20k to 400k in just one month.

Before we go there and show you the actual results, I need to point out first of all that this is an old account with a seasoned pixel and the second thing that I would like to point out is that if you have enough spending and you are having a well-established store, you can always reach me in this email in order to see how we can help your business and scale it also. Let's go to the case study. This account was given to me from one of the agencies that I used to work with in the past and let's go straight away to the video.

So let's go and let's see this account. It's a very good case study. Basically throughout the years I developed a lot of different strategies which is coming from pure knowledge and by spending a lot of money in order to be good with Facebook Ads you need to spend a lot of money across a lot of different accounts.

So basically we're having this company that we can see that they were spending and this is for February 2021 as you can see here from one to six of this month they were just spending 180 per day in one campaign. You can see that the total here it's 2.2k, most probably I have one small campaign running but all of their spending was just 200 or 200 something dollars per day and they were getting 2.34 hours. A very good account.

What am I going to show you over here it's working not in of course we can do a lot of things with new pixels and stuff but this is an account that it has a lot of pixel data. It's easier for us to actually scale and a lot of strategies and a lot of ads in a good technical with good technical knowledge if we if we make them they're going to work very well. So straight to the point this was the campaign that they were having.

I started working with him a little bit because he was hesitant. He couldn't believe that we can scale as much as much as we wanted and we were saying. Constantinos just quick question and just clarification.

So at that time that we basically took over their ads they were getting a 2.34 ROAS. Can you explain ROAS to people out there just for those that maybe don't know what that means and kind of how important that is? Sure.

The return on ad spend is when you divide the number that you the amount of revenue that you are getting. So in our case it's going to be 4850. Okay and you divide it with the number the amount that you're spending on your ads.

It's ROAS is return on ad spend. So basically with this we are seeing how much we are getting back depending on what we're spending. Okay as you can see here we're getting 2.34 as much as Facebook says.

Okay so this guy is that we put in a dollar we put in a dollar and Facebook is pushing out two dollars and 34 cents basically right? Yeah we're taking back in revenue 2.4 dollars. Now a lot of things really matter on this subject basically a company should be able to recognize how they are going to find their breakeven ROAS.

It's a very important chapter. I also have it in my book. Let me pull it up here.

So there's a chapter in my book that I explain how to yeah here. So basically here it's a very good way of understanding what is your breakeven ROAS. There is an example whoever is going to get the video they're going to read this and they can understand immediately how to calculate their breakeven ROAS because I can tell you that most of the people that I'm talking with they don't know how to calculate their breakeven ROAS after spending money on Facebook ads and this is going to help them a lot.

Okay so let's let's move on the ads again. So in this specific case what I have done is that there are a lot of strategies that you can use in order to scale. Personally I have developed some strategies with manual bidding and the strategy that I like to call crazy method.

In this specific case I didn't want to just reinvent the wheel. So because the client was also hesitant. I told him that we can use my crazy method strategy and see how it's going to work.

So if we go from seven to nine, I'm starting to doing my scaling. This campaign only is doing one K and I'm spending as much as he's spending from one to six I'm spending in this period of the three days on my own ads. Basically, first step it was to start building some retargeting campaigns of course okay.

He was having a whole structure of doing ads spending a lot of money from time to time just when he was going to see some results but at the end of the day he wasn't having any retargeting which for me means that he's leaving a lot of money on the table. So several structures for the targeting. First of all we're doing a social retargeting which is basically a retargeting that we are targeting the people who engaged with the social media.

That means that they're going to be people that they're going to watch your ads but they're not going to end up to your store for many reasons that we're not going to analyze now. But if you don't retarget these people with these custom audiences basically you're losing them and you're losing money. If they are commenting for example or if they're tagging a friend and they're not clicking to go to the actual site you're losing them if you don't retarget them.

Then we are having a long term retargeting. This is a company that is operating for a long period so I'm breaking down the long term retargeting in two audiences. They have a very big a very good post which is having a lot of video views so definitely I want to target people that they have seen the video 95% of the video in the past 365 days and maybe these people they didn't convert at this point and they want to convert now.

As you can see it worked very well immediately and then we are having the site retargeting which is which started super sai with not very good draws but as you can see later it really picked up and then we are having of course long-term retargeting that it's for 180 days the last 108 days the people who purchased the people who initiate checkout top 25 viewers based on how long they stayed on the site and all of this again in CBO campaigns basically spreading out the budget across all of the assets so that we can have very good spending. So here at this point we are I'm also starting a campaign with him which is what I told you the crazy method. Basically what I have done is that I told him I asked him what was the best ad set that you ever had.

He told me that he was having an answer that he was targeting 77 million people. He was targeting charity and causes and motorcycles. So basically what I have done is I duplicated this specific asset that was proven that it was having very good conversion rates and results and I have done this.

I have done 25 adsets okay so I'm having 25 adsets and a central CBO campaign which is actually spending it was spending much more money at this point I think let me see. I think that this one started with if I can find it yeah most probably this one started with 300 dollars and after some point I started closing the ones that they were performing bad so I kept the only the only ones that they were doing well and I let it running with a smaller budget. This is what I like to call the basis so basically you're doing a lot of campaigns that are going to be the base for what you for what we're going to do later in order to scale and you're getting a proof of what you're trying to do here it's working.

Let's see after the initial week I work with him with with a little bit you know trying to to make him understand what we what we are doing so basically from 9 to 12 we have done 6.5 6.5 gain spent at this point he I earned his trust he was saying okay this guy knows knows what he's doing so I'm going to spend more money as you can see my targeting campaign started to work very well I started to do some lookalike audiences based on what is worth working on the past and I also I also as you can see starting to do the same way another crazy method so that I can have a better scaling I can tell you that all of this has worked very well but this was the breaking point that that I actually took the whole account and I started working it on my own so let's see what happened after that from 12 to 13 and let's go until this date here this is the point that I started working on my own of course I'm an expert I started to do my own ads and everything here I'm going to show you a lot of different strategies and a lot of different things that that they're working in this account apart from doing the crazy method with something that is working very well either it's one ad set or it's something or it's an ad or a creative that is working very well and you duplicate it a lot of times so that you can have better results another thing that that is really very good is doing dynamic ads okay this client was not doing dynamic ads dynamic is this specific button over here basically you're getting a lot of creatives like a lot of pictures a lot of different texts okay and facebook is going to blend all of them and it's going to get the best results out of it okay um yeah so basically can you see that okay so uh basically it's going to get the the best results out of it uh and the best combination is going to be the one that is going to win let me show you for example if we come here and we see the purchases we see that this one it's having 26 sales we can break down the results and actually locate which one of those was working the best so for example we can see that for some reason that we're not going to analyze and we don't care these specific payments were working better than anything else so now we also have a proof of what what is working better as a creative or what is doesn't work very well as a creative another thing that that really worked very well is is doing campaigns that they are actually having so here we're having some cold interests i have done a very good audience research uh finding more interest about his niece and another thing that it's very interesting is that you can do the same by actually using look-alike audiences and tithers together it's the blender method as i like to call it and it's having also very good results because you are having smaller audiences but they are super focused in the interest that they have been working for you before in the cold traffic dynamic campaigns now all of these uh you can you can do one campaign one campaign again and again and again and again and you are just establishing the the small steps that they're going to bring you to the top basically this is what i like to call that it's my base but after i got the proof of one campaign that is working very well either if it is uh look-alikes or dynamic creatives or whatever i'm moving to my mob strategy which is as i like to call it mother of bombs uh this is what mob stands for and uh as you can see this campaign in this period it's uh it's about how much it's about 40 percent uh of the budget let's say or uh 35 percent of the budget um it spent 10k with 3.4 roars it's it's it's a scaled number with with even better dollars from what uh this person had uh basically my manual bidding campaign is working like a normal campaign but this time i'm using a lot the attribution model feature over here the attribution setting in one day after click and i'm having a bidding of the target rows that i want to achieve it's extremely volatile and extremely difficult to work with people that they don't know what they are doing it needs a lot of optimization during the day as you can see i'm having crazy budgets in the daily uh 1.5k 1.8k so you have to be very careful with it and needs very careful optimization but if somebody knows how to do it personally i haven't seen it in any other account it's it's a method that i developed on my own um it's extremely volatile and it can actually scale your account super fast and what happened is that actually from wednesday to friday uh the spend over here is already 38k so basically we're doing just in three uh days 38k uh which which is something that uh wasn't done before uh with this account and what were they spending before in three days on average what like five to a thousand dollars in three days if we go from one to three over here they were spending one so so it's it's so they were making okay so if they got even if they got a three row as on that thousand dollars so they made three grand okay yeah they will get three k in our specific case over here with the 38k if we go only to the manual bidding they made 37k just by spending uh 17 2.13 rows and here in this campaign they made with five rows almost triple uh 15. so the manual bidding campaign is working very well it needs a lot of caring and a lot of knowledge but at the end of the day it's working very well this client is very happy he's telling me every day that i'm breaking the one record after the other uh bringing more revenue and uh getting record days uh one by the other uh the scaling is very good uh we can see that for example i'm still scaling okay i'm still scaling we are having at the 17th of february 11.5 k at 18 i did 15 and today that we are speaking the day is not over and uh we already spent 12 point you see i'm just refreshing something and it's you know it's crazy it's like working the it's like watching the stock market uh so basically yeah and these are the results today i'm not even watching attribution model and days even the results of the day are are pure gold okay um and i'm still going to do new campaigns and new manual biddings and everything these are some other manual bidding as you can see they're not spending a lot of money most probably i will have to try to find because these are not optimizing based on the value they are actually optimizing based on the cost control it's another way of doing manual bidding i still haven't found for this account what is the sweet spot for this one so that you can start spending like crazy as i found the value which is 2.5 rows for this account and it's working very well so yeah this is uh this is all i want to say as you can see today uh manual bidding is spent all the uh 5.5 k already on one campaign 2.2 uh 12 k revenue here we're having campaigns that they already spent just one not simply spending one point they were uh they were basically making what 200 bucks a day constantinos and now they're making like 10k a day already and it's not even scale all no no they make they make even more than that i think they make more than uh because this account is having a break-even rows of uh 1.3 or 4 i think uh so they are making uh more than 30k per day holy cow wow so that's basically yeah that's 300k a month that's that's millions it's it's a very big uh so basically imagine that in the previous month if we go let's try to see what they have done in january i'm curious so they spent 17k okay and it was coming from this campaign so they have earned so basically what they spent the previous month and spending now in one day let's say like that yeah they basically 30x their efforts yeah yeah so basically this is what is happening over here and without a huge cost in the rowers okay so because uh what what i have seen is that we are about 2.5 rows so far and maybe they were doing 2.7 by just spending 70k in one month which is nothing um so so far this month for example and we started i believe we started here somewhere around here and obviously constantinos it takes a lot of a lot of skills to do all the optimization stuff i mean would you say that's one of the biggest things that a lot of clients they're just not really able to do yeah the strategies are here i also write them on my book but as i as i say on my book the optimization is is something which is very difficult and the only way to learn optimization is by spending money uh even going broke until you until you learn what what you have to know in order to optimize especially with manual bidding manual bidding can be super misleading because it needs special care every day since you're using very big budgets you can end up losing thousands in one day which is going to cause a very big problem in all of your os for the month yeah okay so i mean most clients you know as far as you obviously you're seeing a lot of facebook accounts so most clients are just very basic with with their efforts so that so this is just you know on a totally another level let me tell you something so basically um sometimes i think that some things that i do they're they're super simple but apparently since i don't see them in many accounts it means that they're not that simple and maybe they're just simple in my mind so after doing a lot of optimization this is this is a very uh good account with a good pixel uh just the people that they have it they didn't know it so what i have done is that i have started to analyze where the sales are coming from and guess what i did an arrow down based on uh demographic so basically i did an open targeting without an interest this is this is an answer to the people they they say a lot of times but i don't have a lot of interest you know the crazy method which is actually duplicating the same asset a lot of times and the open targeting that i'm doing here based on the sales of the previous days it's actually proving that you don't need so many interests in order to an account it's just an excuse that somebody can say that my niece is super focused or anything if you if you're having some decent pixel data you can just analyze who are the people that they're buying so in our case it was 35 65 and only men and you're having a 56 million audience which which is very good it's a very good audience to target so basically you're having zero zero interest here and you can do open targeting with my crazy method duplicate it a lot of times and then starting closing the bad ones and keeping the good ones so that you can keep optimizing uh in a daily basis um yeah so and another thing i'm seeing so many accounts as you can see i'm managing many accounts over here so uh another thing which is really strange for me is that nine out of ten accounts they are not using dynamic creatives which which i found it super odd i think that the information in youtube and everywhere is super outdated something like doing ads for 2017 and nobody is actually doing facebook ads with dynamic creative which is just a simple button to use and you just mix a lot of creatives together with a lot of copy text and you don't have to worry about um being able to track what is correct or not because at the end of the day i think that your opinion and my opinion doesn't matter only somebody who is paying his opinion matters so what what you have to do is give to facebook the options to optimize because facebook is very good at optimizing okay so let's throw all of the images let's throw everything together with the copies and everything and then facebook is going to decide which combination is the best and this is something that only 10 percent of the other of the advertisers out there are using most probably the people who are watching now they're going to have campaigns that they're going to have an ad set and just a lot of ads like five or six i can i never guarantee stuff on facebook but i can tell you that from my experience uh nine out of ten accounts that they do dynamic they have better results from instead of doing uh one ad set with many ads yeah we even saw today constantinos we looked at that account where they're spending four million dollars a year and they're not even running dynamic yeah they're not even running dynamic and they don't even have correct proper tracking i guess yeah i mean there's there's so many things that you know people are doing wrong with facebook no no and i don't blame anyone you know because outside there's they show fake credibility outside there with the advertisers and everybody uh just claims that they know how to do facebook ads and they just don't focus on the technical side on facebook ads or spending money how i learned doing facebook ads basically because i wanted to do very good with my own business and e-commerce store this is a reason that i learned facebook cards and then i got hooked i i love them and this is why i'm trying to evolve all the time with that and finding all of these different strategies and methods uh that they're actually uh super effective okay so now you can see why i'm proud of this case study i will try to show you more case studies in the future not uh just to show you that i'm good or bad or or whatever but because i think that each one of you can learn something out of these accounts that were scaled and understand maybe or get an idea of how they can scale their all their own accounts in any case that's all i had for you about my case study you can find me in the email that i provided you can also find it in the description if you want to learn more about facebook ads you can check my book or read my courses links are below in the description and don't forget that i'm super active on my instagram you can always go and check there because there's content uploaded every one or two days uh and i can also answer in any of your comments there until we meet again be creative and be consistent
