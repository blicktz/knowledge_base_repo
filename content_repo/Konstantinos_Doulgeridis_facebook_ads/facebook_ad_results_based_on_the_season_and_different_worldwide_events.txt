Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to analyze why some periods of the year are not so good for Facebook Ads because some people don't understand that this is a whole economy and it's working with the global rules. So, I already made a video about the war and the inflation and how it's influencing the Facebook Ads. The past two months have not been so good.

One of my opinions is because of the inflation, because of the war, the prices are coming up. So, the consumer power that someone has, if she or he has less money, it's less so they are going to consume less. But, based on that, I need to point out that there are certain periods that Facebook Ads are doing better or worse and that we always need to know these periods.

Not to stop trying on these periods to get good results, but in order for us to be able not to be frustrated, to understand that this is a general situation, okay? And not just think that something is wrong and our company is going to fail. First of all, let's start from the start of the year.

No, before we even do that, let's talk about the global things that happened recently. We had the pandemic period, okay? The COVID period and we had the period that we had the lockdown.

During the lockdown, it was like another Black Friday. Even stronger than Black Friday. There were a lot of people that they had money because we didn't have inflation at that point.

They stayed at home and they were ordering everything from home. It was a mess, okay? I scaled so many companies.

We didn't have IOS at that point also. And I can tell you that there are a lot of companies that they didn't have also stock because it was the period that we started having a lot of problems with the stock because of China not being able to deliver the orders. So this was a good period for some companies that they had stock.

I had companies that we had stock but we sold out, which was also another problem because we had to stop our ads. And you know, e-commerce is always a battle of things happening. Then there's another period that I remember.

It's the previous elections with Biden and Trump. We can see that this September the results were very bad. The CPMs were very high because everybody was actually advertising.

We need to understand that Facebook is a platform which is like an economy. It has competition. It has other people that are doing the same as us and we are competing with each other.

So when we have so many advertisements coming for the elections or whatever, all the CPMs are going to get high because everybody is going to try to get a spot to go and being shown to the eyes of the consumer. Then we have the war, of course, which happened and we had the inflation and all of that. And we can see that this is impacting the global market.

People are buying less. For me, the most difficult problem is the inflation because I can see that you used to be able to buy something in X price. Now you need much more money to buy the same thing.

The other periods that they're a little bit good to discuss and they're happening every year is first of all, the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year, which is happening on January and February. I don't remember exactly the dates.

It's a very good period because a lot of people that they are doing trading e-commerce from China, like dropshippers and so on, they stopped working for this period and they don't take orders because they're not going to be able to fulfill them. That means that in that period you have less competition in the platform. This is why you see sometimes that you have better results on January and February, because people stop advertising so you have less competition.

Okay. Another period that it's actually, I'm not going to talk about Mother's Day or Valentine's Day and stuff because these are a small influence on the market. These are not massive periods like Black Friday, for example, which is a huge period and we know that a lot of people are advertising, but there's also a lot of demand there.

So it's not like there we have less competition. We have more competition. Even people that they never advertise throughout the whole year, they just advertise on Black Friday and I can tell you that it's still not enough because people are buying like crazy in the Black Friday.

Black Friday to the minds of the people is that, hey, I might be saving money just to buy on the Black Friday because I will get good deals. Even if you don't get good deals, you're going to buy on the Black Friday period. I'm not buying on the Black Friday period because I know what is happening.

Then we have the Christmas period. The Christmas period is also another period which means that people are going to buy gifts for other people. So even if you don't have money for yourself, you need to buy something to your kids, to your husband, to your wife.

So this is a need that is going to be covered by e-commerce. So we know that this period is good. And guess what?

After the 25th up to the 31st, it's one of the worst periods of the year. Nobody is buying anything. So a lot of people are actually stop advertising.

I was actually laughing once because I think that Facebook was mentioning this period as Q5. They were saying that this is called Q5 and because a lot of people are not going to advertise, you should advertise this period because you will get very low CPMs. Yes, but nobody wants to buy anything on that period.

Also keep in your mind that most of the people have spent all of their money before that. And it's actually very funny because Facebook is actually trying to push all of these concepts of making you, hey, what is happening from 25 to 30 to the 31st? We're making less money.

Okay, let's convince them that they have to spend more money this period because they will get more sales. Okay, it's a business. And the other thing that I want to mention is August.

August is a very strange month because a lot of times we see that in this period we don't have a lot of sales because people are not on their homes in order to get the products. So we see that the sales are declining in this period. And this is something that you also need to take into consideration when you're doing your ads.

Maybe in these periods you need to adjust your budget. What am I saying is this. I'm not saying that you should go in August and say, no, I'm not going to spend because of that.

Because this is an assumption. Maybe your product is going to work in this period. It doesn't matter.

What I'm trying to say is that if you see that it's not working, don't panic. I want you to know we can get through this as long as we panic. Don't think that your product is rubbish.

Don't think that the problem is your price. Don't think anything if it's happening on this period and try to spend as much as you can in the most profitable way. Now, that being said, keep testing on these periods.

Don't get disappointed. These are the most critical periods throughout the whole year that I wanted to mention. I'm talking more about the general economy thing because Facebook is actually a community which is being influenced by the global economy.

Okay. And it's working through their global economy because the people that they are actually within the platform, they're not machines. They are people that they actually live and they are being influenced by the global economy.

So, that being said, keep this into your mind. Take this into consideration when you're doing your ads in certain periods and stuff. For example, don't launch a new collection in August.

Launch it on September-October. Launch it on Black Friday, on Christmas. You're having better chances of having more sales than Facebook ads.

That's all that I want to say. If you want to learn more about Facebook ads, you can read my book or check my free course. And until we meet again, guys, be creative and be consistent!
