Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, another podcast, Podcast 65 and first of all before we start, I would like to thank all of you for the subscribers and stuff. The channel is growing faster from what I have anticipated.

If we go like this most probably we will hit 100k subs by the end of the year which was something that I didn't expect for this year at all but maybe for the next years but we will see. So let's go straight away. Let me tell you a little bit what is happening on the ad accounts.

So basically I get a lot of messages from people asking what has happened and if it's going to continue like this and why it has happened. From my perspective and from what I see on ad accounts I can see that many other accounts are recovering. Let me tell you what I mean by that.

Basically in March let's say we had three bad days, two medium and two good. Now we have three good days per week. I mean three good days, two medium days and two bad days.

Okay so it's better so the average on the last seven days when you watch it is better and in several companies I have done promotions, spring promotions and stuff which is helping also a lot the situation in terms of data coming inside the platform and helping the campaigns to revitalize. Two things about March that I want to just say here because I cannot just make a video about these little things. First of all I have seen that and then I would like to make a general discussion about all of this so follow my way of thinking and let me know about your opinion.

So I was looking on the CPMs on January and February and the CPMs were actually the same or a little bit better and on March we had the same CPMs. So it wasn't an issue on CPMs but we had higher cost per click and we had a higher cost per acquisition and this is something that I have observed across our accounts. It's not that we had crazy changes on the CPMs.

On April now I can see that the CPMs are dropping and we have better results and I believe it's because a lot of people stopped advertising but if we go on March we cannot just say that the results were bad because a lot of people were advertising because the CPMs haven't increased comparing to January and February. Now there are two more things that I would like to say. Recently I got fired by a company because I was working with them for a period and then they were a new company and now they have a VAT ID added because they were registered and then they had VAT ID.

And basically we were doing really well but when the VAT ID came it wasn't sustainable anymore with the numbers that we had. And that made me think you know a lot of times we tend to say okay we have this kind of results in the ad account and these are the numbers but we cannot do better. And people come and say why is this company running ads and they do it.

You cannot know all the things that are happening in a company. For example maybe it's a new company which is entering the market and they have better prices from the distributors. They don't register VAT or they're you know they're illegal who knows you know and they have found a way of not being taxed for example or whatever that may be.

And they are more they are having better profit margins. This is why they can advertise while another company can advertise. And I was thinking so a lot of times there are companies like this they start they have their VAT not being registered and then they have the VAT that they have to register and so on.

They start with healthy numbers and then they say yeah but later it died. Well your numbers have changed and there are other people that they enter the market also at the same time and they also have more competitive numbers. And I was thinking about that and that you know you can never know how many people entered the market.

A lot of times also we tend to talk about competition but for example let's say for example that this is a product okay and we are producing just this bear wooden bear. This bear is a puzzle okay and we have this bear for example and stuff and we produce this product or maybe let's go for the lamp okay. It's a design lamp and stuff.

It has this thing here with magnets and all of that. So some people will think that the competition would be another design with a magnet lamp but a competition can also be someone that likes this kind of things but he didn't buy the lamp because he haven't seen the ad in time. He has seen something else but he bought this one so he doesn't have enough money this month to buy something else.

This is also competition. People deciding to buy this instead of that which is which both of those could be their options but they're not buying both of those because they don't have the money. And I do believe that right now everybody is talking about you know as marketers we come to the company and we say you have to fix your AOV, you have to fix that, you have to fix that, your numbers are not sustainable and all of that but nobody is talking about inflation because the inflation that we have even McDonald's for example took their minimum wage to $20.

That means that in the United States and in other countries we have a problem and the lower wages they have to increase in order for the people to be able to actually live. So if you think all of that the competition can not only be a company which is selling a same product but it can be also a company which is selling something that also a person likes and he has to decide between you and the other brand and if the other brand wins because he bought another product then this is also competition. Competition is not something that it has to be similar but also competition is when people when more people come to Facebook and advertise and people buy other things also instead of spending their money on you.

So if you think of it inflation has also a big impact to all of that and okay we can talk about Timu and how they're spending a lot of money but the CPM on March hasn't actually increased. So I don't believe that it's because of the volume of many advertisers. I do believe that people have less money okay and we have read also the article from Triple Whale that they were that they were saying that maybe we should not blame Meta all the time about it and as marketeers we always tend to say okay fix your AOV fix that because it's not sustainable and we're telling our truth based on what we see on the numbers but nobody is talking about inflation and about the fact that maybe the prices need to increase.

For example Walmart and all of these brands they are increasing their prices and nobody says anything but if as e-commerce owners we come and we say okay let's increase the price of this and that and that everybody starts saying oh my god this is a bad thing people are going to be angry and all of that well this is the inflation the same way that all of the rents are being increased across the world including mine over here in the studio everybody is actually you know everybody is actually thinking on how they're going to suppress more and more and more their profits as e-commerce instead of increasing the price because you know in our books and as marketeers this is the worst thing that you can do and it's not a solution you know because a lot of times people are going to think that this is a solution. So that's what I wanted to share these are my concerns about all of these things based on what happened also in March. I think that this period is kind of ending this bad period and better days are yet to come but I do think that we will have these periods more often and you know the same way that for example a company that now has VAT problems and they stop advertising and this liberates places to another company that doesn't have this issue or has better numbers the same way that you might be operating and then you have four new companies coming without any VAT so they can have better prices because as you have seen from my previous client we were operating like this there could be other people in other agencies saying how are they doing it you know how do they how are they able to sell in this price for example because they didn't have the VAT and they were a newly registered company.

So if you take all of that and if you start thinking at least for me that I have that I talk to many people and many businesses this happened here this happened here this happened here it's impossible for us to know the actual reasons that actually influenced March on being a bad month why a company suddenly after two years while they were having healthy numbers they don't have anymore you know because it can be a million things like new companies entering the market their numbers don't make sense now the inflation is hurting them and all of that so that's what I wanted to share with you about the bad periods and um these years bad periods the inflation and um the thing that happened with the other company with the VAT that it was having super healthy numbers and now because of the VAT they don't have healthy numbers so their total numbers are problematic and they have to find a way because they cannot advertise anymore they just need to have x amount of ROAS more and all of these situations that are changing and they are influencing other marketeers on top of that and so it's just like a domino effect you know this company for example stop advertising maybe it's going to make another company which is advertising right now and it's struggling profitable so it's crazy if you think of it but this is how it works and of course the inflation nobody I know that it sounds odd and everything but nobody talks about increasing prices maybe in some companies that they have done everything from bundles optimization buy three get one whatever you can imagine and they still cannot make it work while it was working in the past maybe the solution is to increase the prices you cannot just always squeeze your profit or try to find another way in another way um companies like Walmart Walmart and that that they you know they have a model we make x amount and stuff if something changes okay we change our prices because we need to make again x amount profit percentage of profit um that's all I have uh and let me know about your opinion in the comments uh we had again uh small problems with the platform I'm giving you here a print screen uh the ad manager was down um for the previous week I can tell you that uh uh Tuesday Wednesday so Tuesday the yesterday because I'm video shooting this on Wednesday Tuesday was a bad day but the weekend was actually catastrophic across accounts so these are our three bad days the other days are other medium or good uh Monday for example was really good across accounts anyway we still see these patterns of good and bad days but um I must tell you that now the average is is um is is getting better and better because we have more better medium days instead of bad and medium days so some problems over here again with the ad manager they have been solved really fast nothing and even on meta status they haven't even mentioned it and nothing um uh super important uh so life goes on I have a message here from Isabel uh she says just here to say that when my budget allows and that will be working consistently uh it has improved uh a lot so uh soon I hope I'm absolutely signing up for your mentorship programs let's go so Isabel has been uh in the the group for many uh many months if not year uh and um the reason that I'm posting this year is because uh I would like to invite you to check my mentorship programs uh into my um into my website uh you're going to find the links on the description uh so that you can check uh the inner circle group uh uh has already uh has already uh six people uh oh no five people uh and six including me uh we are doing weekly calls and uh the group is going to get bigger and bigger it's not even a month uh that uh I launched this um I should have done it earlier but to be honest with you um I wasn't feeling ready I didn't have the infrastructure and stuff and I didn't believe that the channel will start growing so fast so now most probably more and more people are going to come and I hope guys to see you there or in the chosen five which is a completely different uh thing um let's go now to one Reddit post I really like when I see this post it says it's one of these days kill your campaigns just do it if you're not getting anything today tomorrow is a new day so I'm seeing this as you can see I'm up voting also uh I really like when I see these comments because all of these people they are just making other people stop their ads and this is good for us that we are stable on the platform and we're spending uh of course I'm not going to post something like this to lure people but if someone is because he's stupid I'm going to upvote it so that more people can stop advertising and we can have better results but I do consider these people dangerous but this is what Reddit is everybody can post their opinion over there without any background check or whatever and without seeing who they are um you know you know it's a little bit of um it's a little bit of a difficult equation over here because on on on the one side uh if you are anonymous over here on Reddit you can say things that you would not say for example that I will say something that I would say over there but okay I will say it here um the love that we take on our YouTube channels on the comments uh it's not uh something uh that uh it's um you know it's representing the actual truth let me tell you why all of these people that they are posting and they are polite with us in the comments and stuff I do believe that they say thank you for sharing this with us but this is creating an effect on the YouTube videos on the comments below that whatever we say it's completely uh correct and stuff while we might say something which is not going to be correct across uh different ad accounts but we do share our experience and when somebody goes there and sees the comments they do believe that this thing for example it's uh correct while uh for example I might disagree with some of this and I have seen videos which are really really bad and have really really bad um you know uh not consultation advices uh on them uh about Facebook ads that they get uh below uh positive comments and all of that and I believe that you cannot extinguish who is actually an expert and who is just uh a YouTube persona saying a lot of things in their videos and all of that so this is something that you could express in a in a you know without being afraid like I am now saying these things openly um these are things that you can express on Reddit anonymously on the other hand if you are anonymous you can say stupid things without any consequences for example if I come here and tell you that um all of you you should use uh ABO campaigns because Advantage Plus is not working for example if I say this uh then and I don't have any consequence consequences um then I can say whatever I want no matter how crazy it is this is why Reddit is full of conspiracy theories and all of that so it has a good side and a bad side in the good side you can say things that you wouldn't say with your name but they're the hard truth but on the other side um you can say a lot of stupid things without caring about the consequences and this is what is happening over here we don't know for example if this person is a stupid person that is posting this because he believes in it or it's a person that it's actually trying to convince people to stop their ads so that he can have better results with his clients so I don't know anyway let's go to the next question I have two questions for the community or for Kostantinos what are your thoughts on or on Advance Plus campaigns for newer account with no data I saw a video that you said it works but uh but won't confirm so um when I talk about things I need to cover a lot of different cases because this is how it is which is also another problem with Reddit somebody might come and say for example that uh Advance Plus I have a new pixel and Advance Plus campaigns didn't work for me yeah it's a possible scenario in the United States if you do broad you are going to have worse results but if you're in a very small country with five million people for example uh it might work uh work immediately because it's a very small audience so the broad it's already a small audience like an interest so when you're reading something on Reddit first of all you need to be able to understand it and actually be able to have filters to know if it's uh true uh or the other thing if it's uh if it if it's an information that applies to your case um so if someone goes and says that Advance Plus is not working for me use it as country uh nice maybe he's doing for example local business for example and he cannot use it because he cannot use specific uh location target you don't know so all of these are things that you need to check when you are reading something also date for example you might read something which is outdated and all of that so Advance Plus campaigns uh do work um even if they don't work you have to test them even on United States and stuff I have seen other accounts which are completely new working immediately with um Advance Plus and the new pixel uh I have seen uh many more times in smaller countries working immediately because over there it's a smaller audience but in United States Canada United Kingdom a lot of times I have seen that when I start campaigns with Advance Plus they have high CPM then I'm testing Kindreds they have lower CPM so I'm going with um and results of course uh but if they if they have high CPM and uh results I'm going to leave the Advance Plus I don't care but the point over there is how fast can I train my pixel so if I have this kind of results and the interest is giving better results I will go and do interest interests crazy method interest later and then eventually I will try to end up with Advance Plus campaigns and broad targeting because it's going to be more cost efficient the ultimate goal of each ad account is to reach the point that they are doing broad targeting for many reasons from scaling sustainability and other reasons but if you are in a small country it doesn't mean that necessarily you cannot start with Advance Plus in any way you should do Advance Plus then you should do interest compare the CPMs and see where you're having the the cheapest traffic with results of course not just the cheapest in order for you to train your pixel in the most cost efficient way if my creative uh are uh videos or one mean like isn't better to edit the placements and just keep facebook feeds uh I don't see the reason of not having a different creative you have the placements you have a video use this video for the feed and do another video for the reels and the stories you can edit the placements and you can decide which other creative you are going to use for the other placements facebook gives you this option let's go to Sasha hi Konstantinos a few questions on scaling CBO ads sets with crazy method let's see if I can I can reply okay are winning CBO ads sets each have are winning CBO ads it's have one to two ads with spent and four to six with essentially zero spend do we duplicate only the ads with spent or duplicate all of the ads in the ad set both of these are acceptable it depends on your budget if your budget is is big and you have enough room you can duplicate it with all of them a lot of times we see in smaller ad accounts that they don't have a lot of budget that when you can narrow down for example you start even with dynamic creative ads you start with 10 after seeing one or two of them working over there you can you can just duplicate sorry you can just duplicate and run it with only the winning ones or the ones the ones that they are taking the budget is not correct the ones that they're taking the budget and they have results it's correct because if they just take the budget we don't want them so this is what you can do if you have enough room with your budget don't change anything just duplicate them as they are they are again they they want to ads that they have been working they're going to work again if you don't have enough just duplicate them with these two just to focus on them because it's going to help you more with the budget distribution when we duplicate cbo ads into crazy method do we use the same post id to leverage the social proof or create brand new ads with new post id both things are acceptable again the reason that we the reason that you can use the post id is to just leverage your previous effort so both of these things are going to work if the ad set that you have decided it did to move in crazy method it's a actually working ad set but of course post id is better because you can use it again and again after that and you're building also more social proof to the ad if we have a winning cbo ad set with audience one and we know we have three winning audiences for this product should we set up a crazy method only with audience one or set up a crazy method for all three audiences but if we have a winning cbo ad set with audience one and we know we have three winning audiences for this product how is this possible if we have a winning cbo ad set okay so an ad set with audience one and we know that we have three winning audiences for this product should we set up a crazy method only with audience one or set up a crazy method for all three audiences but each audience in its own campaign have multiple audiences in the same crazy method campaign and we know we have three winning audiences for this product so we have one ad set and i'm guessing you're talking about having three audiences three interests maybe because the audience yeah i think that your wording is a little bit wrong here so three interests i'm going to guess that you mean three interests within an ad set first of all how if that's the case how do you know that one of these interest is the one that it's actually that's the good one so if you have one ad set which is working you duplicate it as it is exactly as it is to the crazy method you don't do any changes yeah that's my answer to that and if i understood wrong sorry but this is what i could understand from this so the crazy method for all three audiences for each audience in its own campaign if you are meaning what i understand if you mean what i understand um if you have three interests to do three different campaigns with each one of the interest on crazy method no just do one crazy method with these three interest combination as it was next one hello at the end of the video you mentioned cases with a limited and very limited budget i want to clarify if i have a budget of 80 per day then creating a structure of four different advanced plus campaigns at 20 per day each with an average cost per purchase of seven could that be a successful option i kind of disagree with that i think that in budgets like 100 200 300 you can even operate with one campaign okay guys let's not over exaggerate on that let me let me continue with your question or would it be more suitable to combine them into one campaign perhaps with a catalog inside as you mentioned would work as if successfully in that case my my reasoning is based on the understanding that in the worst case scenario losing 80 per day would be difficult for me but better if it's scaled down a version of structure where one mini campaign supports another at the same time another thought comes to mind campaign with 20 budget will need more time uh will need much more time to truly become stable i don't know why you think that the 20 campaign budget will need more time to become more stable because it won't it's a small budget it should become stable fairly easy you just need one or two sales per day or three sales per day in your case with seven uh i think that okay in this channel we like to not talk about consolidation and we don't like when people are trying to push consolidation and we don't accept this concept and all of that but i must say this let's not over exaggerate guys okay on 100 200 300 per day i think that even with one campaign you're going to do fine can you do with 300 three campaigns can you do with 84 campaigns you can do whatever you want it's up to you i just don't think that it's efficient guys now spending 80 dollars i wouldn't do three campaigns or four i would just do one campaign and if i had the option and it was working let me be clear on that if i had the option it was working to spend 500 i wouldn't do five campaigns i would do just one if it was working and i would sustain i would i was able to sustain it like this but most of the times if you have an an one 500 campaign working that means that you can scale more a lot of times the facebook doesn't let you to have a bigger budget campaign this is why we're segmenting it to more campaigns and yeah okay let's not over exaggerate with multiple campaigns for an account when i'm talking with multiple campaigns i'm talking about bigger budgets and stuff and having a lot of different creatives and a lot of different products so you need to have more budget also in your case i think it's an over exaggeration and i will just try to establish one campaign now about supporting each other bad periods and all of that bad periods are not going to influence you as much as you're going to be influenced when you're spending one thousand dollars because you're spending 100 it's not like uh you are um in the big not big one thousand per day it's not a big tier but um i don't think that it's going to influence you in a way that's going to influence someone who's spending ten thousand dollars per day on a bad period um spending 100 is just it's just an easy thing you're not going to be influenced one last thing that i forgot to say at the start of the video is that now that you're mentioning cbo's and advanced class on this bad period on march i have seen that advanced plus campaigns are much more stable what i'm trying to say is this because until now we have a limit of advanced plus campaigns eight advanced plus campaigns per country uh now we have unlimited uh before several of my ad accounts have been structured in a way of having cbo campaigns also advanced plus campaigns and stuff if i had the option i would do only advanced plus campaigns in several uh ad accounts not even retargeting because advanced plus campaigns would take care also of that what i have seen in the bad period of which is consistent with another observation that when you touch a cbo campaign and you increase the budget it collapses completely what i have seen is that in this bad period the ad accounts they were having only advanced plus campaigns they have been impacted less uh comparing to the cbo uh and advanced plus campaigns uh ad accounts which have been impacted more and we had worse average because of the cbo campaigns which is something that i'm changing and i'm going more towards i'm talking about the train pixels to a purely advanced plus campaign uh structure on the ad accounts because they're more sustainable and this is also another observation that i had with advanced plus that you can actually go and increase the budget and you have zero issues with it so the 20 rule can work on advanced plus if you start using the 20 rule especially in complex cbo campaigns that we do with many ads and stuff it completely collapses and this is why i want to use several campaigns actually today i was observing one other account that for that had an advanced plus campaign uh which was optimized with a 20 rule from an agency and i'm preparing a video where i'm going to show you how they ruined the ROAS instead of keeping the ROAS where it was and do another campaign another campaign another campaign which actually proves more the point about several campaigns instead of scaling with a 20 uh percent uh rule because a lot of times it's just ruining your ROAS for no reason next one hi i had almost 5k 5k sales with my ad account pixel last november and december so also black friday uh difficulty scaling before that i sold a product there that was aimed for parents men and women this product has now been adapted and is currently only aimed for men i have never used advanced plus campaign only cbo's i haven't tested it yet but would the advanced plus algorithm understand that this product is now only aimed for men in my new video ads for example there is a voiceover with uh in which uh love dad is spoken plus caption that's enough for the algorithm or should i adopt my primary text for example in which um gift from dad is mentioned uh or does the algorithm generally understand that if it shows the video to 100 women and then show less interest than men and uh what budget do you recommend for a good advanced plus campaign video test with eight videos and a cpa in march of 34. if you have a cpa of 34 and you want to test eight videos i would suggest that you could do something um 200 200 is an ideal to start with i don't know how much you're spending on the ad account though if i could see more campaigns and how it spends i would have an idea but as it is right now 200 is a safe budget now first of all i had a much more deep discussion in the comments so i know some things um this has been proposed by an agency that they told him that you need to change the product from men and women i asked him in the comments what was the percentage of men and women buying and he told me that it was a 60 percent because you know the pixel is also getting trained on demographics so if it was being sold 80 90 to men then fine you're going to have zero issues but i asked him have you done a breakdown of the results to see if women were buying or men were buying before what are the percentages and he told me something 60 40 um 60 uh men 40 women or the opposite i don't remember uh completely now uh so um i told him that in my opinion then it was a wrong decision because you don't have any clear data just to go because if you if only 40 of people they are just the men that they're buying and even if it has higher average value you cannot just do a turn and ignore the other 60 of sales on women just because the men they are having higher average value and change the complete direction of your pixel targeting and the thing is that now it has been done also comparing a period like november and december with other periods is not fair because you are having completely different results on that period because of the mania of people buying but in your question about the algorithm the algorithm is going to understand results so who is buying who has done a purchase is not going to understand oh the text here says men so let me target men it doesn't go like this it goes based on the results and even if it targets men and women you can actually of course you have the pixel data which is a problem because you're using the same pixel and inside it has almost 50 percent audience of women which are buying so it's data and then you're just asking it to go only for men i think that this is going to share to your results unless if you are completely unless if you're completely right in your analysis that you have done and you know that you can sell more to women but even as this if you're having 50 50 sales and you're just limiting yourself with 50 only on men this means that you're going to have also a problem on scaling so the pixel is going to understand also 50 women and it's going to be more difficult for you and more expensive to advertise only on men because you haven't trained your pixel on that way on the other hand after some period most probably your pixel is going to understand that you want to sell only to men with your targeting because the purchases that you're going to get are only going to be men but it's i'm guessing that it's going to be a tough period with worse results when it comes now to pixel to your to the algorithm understanding the algorithm is going to take an initial push from the pixel which is going to give some direction in the bro targeting on who to target and the second thing is that if you have bro targeting men and women for example in advanced plus it's going to target both and based on the results that it gets it's going to get go more to men and of course now your product is only for men so you're how you're going you should have zero sales from women in my opinion it's a mistake i wouldn't have done it because i don't like when you're limiting yourself like this while the results are saying the opposite that you can sell to both genders the pixel has been trained to understand both genders and it's going to be an issue when you're going to target only men and no the algorithm is not going to understand based on your wording or captions if you want to sell to men but it's going to understand based on the results that it's going to get and the data that your pixel has this is the end of the first part of the facebook ads breaking news podcast if you don't want
