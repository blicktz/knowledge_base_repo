Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about promos and sales that you can run into your e-commerce stores or into your Facebook ads so that you can have better results. I mean you might ask, Kostantinos what are you talking about? Okay it's it's simple if you run promos you're going to have good results.

Follow my way of thinking over here. What if you have a very bad period and I have done a video in the past explaining that but now I have some other examples and you're having a very bad period. Let's say that your breakeven ROAS is 2 and you're having 1.5 and then you cannot just throw all of your campaigns, lose your progress but you want to keep continuous spending because you believe that you can escape.

So instead of you stopping and dropping or managing lowering budgets and stuff in order to get to two ROAS, what if you can do a promotion which is going to inflate your results within the meta platform and then you're going to see that the results are going to stay on the higher levels because you just inflated your numbers with more and more data. What have we seen after IOS? That after IOS we are missing data.

This is why you are hearing people here and there saying that Facebook ads were effective before and they're not now. It's not because the ads are not effective, it's because they were optimizing with more and more data because we're targeting more people. After IOS we're not able to target as many people or even the people that are doing the sales, we don't have all the reporting back to meta.

So instead for example of optimizing with the same amount of money with 50 events on an ad set, now we're optimizing with 35, with 40. We're missing 10 events. So 10 events less means we have lesser results not only on the ROAS that we see but also on the long term because it's optimizing with less data and less people that they have actually purchased.

Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website, you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have. You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. If you have watched several of my videos you know that we have attack periods.

Why attack periods are good? Attack periods are really good like the Black Friday or the first lockdown. Because of that period there are more people buying.

That means that we have inflated results within the ads manager. It's not because our product is selling like this normally, it's because we have more demand on these periods. That means that we have more data within the platform and by having that we are able to optimize even not only our promo campaigns but also the campaigns that are evergreen over there with more data because of course Facebook is going to steal some of the sales of the promotion that we are actually running right now into our ad account and into our e-commerce store.

So what are we winning here? We are just inflating the results for one week. So what?

No, we are not. We're just inflating the results for one week but the results continue to be good because we have given more data inside the algorithm or in the asset level on the campaigns to optimize. And we're going to go into my pc.

I'm going to show you previous results on some of the accounts that they didn't want to scale down and we had the 4th of July promo of course coming. So I didn't scale down. I kept it as it is.

The results came and after the promo has ended, we are reaching now the end of the month, you're going to see that the ad account continues being strong and not having the worst results that it was having during the start of June. Of course, in order for you to do that, you need to have an email list, you need to be an actual brand. But if you're an actual brand, you have this thing as a weapon to run a very good promo even with a higher percentage of discount because you're going to get much higher ROAS because of the volume that you're going to get.

And this is going to help you a lot to overcome a bad period while other companies don't have this luxury and of course they're going to be victim of higher CPMs or competition or a bad period for any reason that may be. So I do have some other accounts that I run promos for the 4th of July and we're going to start with this one. As you can see, I'm having results 3.41.

This is not good ROAS for this account. We need to be on 4+. And just because I didn't want to wait up to the 4th, I started earlier.

I started from the 25th to 30 over here up to the 4th of July as an early promo access. You can do whatever you want, you know. When things are getting difficult, you can do whatever you want.

I'm increasing the results here and I'm actually managing to close my month over here to 3.9 which is close to 4. So I'm not losing the month. And then I'm coming here on this period.

As you can see, I'm having almost 9 ROAS because it's inflated. It's inflated, okay? I'm not taking credit of that.

It's because I'm running a promo with a very good discount on my website. It's 4th of July. People are buying and all of that.

And then what I want you to see is that I didn't go back to my bad results that I had over here, which was actually 3.62. But because I inflated my ad account with data, I'm continuing having 6.69. On the other week, on the 14th to 20, 4.41.

Still, I'm above in the place that I want to be. Over here, 5.16. So it's not like I just inflated the results for a week because this is what most people believe.

That you're just going to do a promo. It's going to help you. It's not going to help you.

Basically, I don't consider these 9 ROAS, the ROAS from the... It's also getting from email, SMS. It's stealing from all of this effort.

But if you do that and you know that for a week you don't care about the results. It was a promo. It went well, blah, blah.

But after that, you're not going to be on 3.5 ROAS again, but you're going to be on 4 ROAS plus that you want to be on this account. And you're going to be able to continue like this. This is actually reviving an ad account.

Okay. So, and as you can see in the whole month over here so far, I'm doing pretty well. Okay.

After the promo. Of course, it has some first days, the first, the fourth, these results. But even without these results over here, we can see that we are having some pretty good results.

Okay. Nothing compared to the previous month. Now, let's go to another ad account.

Let's go on this one. So here, from the first of the 25th, I'm having 1.91. I need two ROAS plus.

So I was struggling again on this other account. Of course, we have 4th of July coming also here. And you can see that I'm running ads here from...

Also, let's check the... I think I managed to close the whole month with 2.02, which is my goal to always be on two ROAS here. Then if we go up to here, we can see that we have some inflated results, of course, on the fourth.

And after that period, let's see what is happening on the other count. 2.13. I'm also scaling, by the way.

Okay. 35K. 35.4.

Okay. Not so much. 21 to 25th, 2.12.

So, not only I was able to close my previous month profitably, but I was able also to keep it after the inflation of results. I was able to actually also keep this one to two ROAS plus that I want. And that's a very big win.

Let's see also another ad account. So, in this account, 1st to the 21, 4.09. Just a little bit above 4 ROAS that I want to be.

And if we come here on this period, 1st to 4, I'm getting almost 5. And then, if we continue on this period, 5.57, which is after the period of the results. Okay.

So, imagine that up to this period, we're having the promo. The promo stops here on the 4th. Okay.

But because it got so much data, even on campaigns that are not the promo campaigns, the other campaigns, because Meta was actually getting sales from there, I know it's stealing the sales. Okay. This is not the point of the video.

The point of the video is that even if it's stealing the sales, if it's stealing them in order for the ads to continue producing more sales because they got more data, that's a win. And that's what I'm trying to prove to you over here. Okay.

4.28 still, I'm doing well. Let's come here. 3.15.

It's dropping now. So, it didn't last as much as it lasted with the others. But for sure, I'm going to be able to have a profitable month, even without the period here.

Again, I'm saying. Okay. I'm going to be able to be on 4+.

Which I wasn't going to be able to do without lowering my badges and stuff. So, this is a very good strategy that I'm using across accounts if they have the credibility and all of the things that a brand needs to have in order to do that. In order for me to not cut my spend but keep my spending, bully my competition that might be losing money on that period because their ads are not doing that well and maintaining my threshold on the spend.

That's what I wanted to show you. I hope that it's going to help you. I had a video from the previous year doing that and I wanted to do one now because I actually applied this to many more ad accounts and it actually helped me well to overcome some bad results that I had on June on some of my ad accounts.

I will see you for the closing of the video. So, that's all I had for you and I hope that it's going to help you think out of the box and not just use promos as you know as something that you have to do from time to time but maybe as a safety think from time to time in order to recover all the ROAs that you want or in order to save the spend instead of limiting it or for example running a promo before a period that you're willing to scale and all of that. So, I hope that's going to help you.

I hope that's going to inspire you and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book, my course, my website, my mentorship programs. You can also see all of the reviews below my mentorship programs for the people that they have completed the program and until we meet again guys, be creative and be consistent.
