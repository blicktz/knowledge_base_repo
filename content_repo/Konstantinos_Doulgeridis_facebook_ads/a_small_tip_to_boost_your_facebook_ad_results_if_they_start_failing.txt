Hello Facebook Watch People, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about one tip that I have for accounts that they are having stable results, suddenly the results are dropping and it actually saved me a lot of times from travel. Just to save your time, if you're here and you're having zero sales in your account, this is not going to help you at all. You can go and you can watch any of my other videos which is going to help you kickstart it.

This video is all about having stable results and then suddenly having a very tough period and this is what we're going to analyze. If you are here to find a magical solution to just start having sales, this is not the video for you. Disappointed!

So the solution is this, when you're having an ad account which is working properly, you have found the amount of spend that you need to have every month and you have everything working, there are some periods that the results are declining. The solution is not always to just close all of your ads and start all over again because we don't like that. We like stability with Facebook ads.

One solution that I have found is that I come in a close cooperation with my client and they say, let's run a promotion. Let's run something like three or four days of a discount that you can afford, something that it's going to fuel the results. Why?

In a technical level, this is going to fuel up with more sales, all of your funnel, and then you're going to be able to continue with this data. The problem here is not the ROAS. The problem here is for us to fuel with data, more data points that they're going to help us find more people.

And let me tell you that it's working flawlessly. It's not only boosting the results of this period, it's also boosting the results for later because you're having all of this data which is fueling your results later. Some people might say that they don't have the option of doing a promotion.

Okay, if this is the case, then this is not a video for you. But still, this is a tip that has helped me a lot of times. It's the same principle like the one that we use on Black Friday.

We don't want to enter Black Friday on the Friday just without ads starting then, but we want to enter with many data so that we are going to be ready for the Black Friday period. And the ads, by the way, that we are having on the Black Friday period, because they are having so much data, we want to keep them active up to the Christmas period. Okay, so we are using this all the time.

Why don't we use it also in periods that we have bad results? We can make our own small Black Friday so that we can fuel up the results. That's all I had.

A very small video. I just did it recently. This is why I thought that I should share this with you.

The campaign was optimizing for 2.5 rows. We started getting 2.3, 2.1, then it went to 1.87. Then I discussed with the owner, we did a promotion, we get it back to 2.3 because of the promotion, and now the account is running on 2.2.

Much better than instead of 1.87. I'm talking for a month period. Okay.

And I think that this is what helped us a lot to overcome this. Of course, I also relaunched one campaign here and there, but all of this data has helped me a lot to overcome this bad period, and now the account is working flawlessly. If I didn't have this, and if you don't also have your clients understand this, it's going to be a problematic situation for you to always relaunch new campaigns, which by the way are going to take you so long in order for you to get back to the point that you were.

If Facebook is going to let you, and don't forget that in periods that the Facebook is not working properly for several people, we also have the case that a lot of people are leaving the platform. So for you to be able to sustain and to be able to keep these campaigns that they're actually working and get past this bad period, it's going to get you in a better place instead of the other people that they have abandoned. We see this all the time.

And this is why we see from period to period that Facebook is doing better or worse. It's because people are coming, they are being disappointed because they don't get results, they leave. The ones that they stay, they make more money on that period until they hear again that Facebook ads are working and they're going to come and they're going to advertise and so on and so on.

Okay. So that being said, this is a little deep. I hope that it's going to help some of you and don't forget that if you want to learn more about Facebook ads, you can check my book or read my course.

And until we meet again guys, be creative and be consistent.
