Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about my visit on the Meta headquarters in Ireland. First of all I would like to say the reason that I went there is because you know Meta is actually calling some of the advertisers as a part of a loyal program or whatever that may be based on the spend okay. I have some accounts that are spending a lot of money so I have been invited there so that they can inform us about the new ways of advertisement and stuff.

If you're bored to watch the whole video or whatever and you're trying to see if there's any crazy information about it I can tell you from now just to save you some time that they have learned anything new but I have seen the way that they operate and I think that maybe this is valuable for you to know. So as you can see in these pictures it's an amazing place having a lot of cafeterias inside and a lot of open space people can go and they can do their break and there are people that they go to the conference room A, B, C, they meet with their teams and all of that. It's just a corporate world you know there's a security in order to enter you need to have your own card then you go to these spaces that it's a free open space where everyone can work anywhere that they want they have also their personal work spaces it's a big tech company you know like any tech company that you would know.

I kind of understand Elon Musk going there you know when you go from a factory that you are building cars and everybody's working and you go in a space space like this you have the idea that everybody is slacking and they're not even working and they're just having three hour breaks all the time and everything you could even take a shower there or go do yoga or whatever that may be there's even a soft ice cream there there's a specific hours that they go and they eat all of that you know just just a very relaxed place to work and stuff I don't know how it's working but all I know is that customer support is not good I know that meta reps are not doing the work that they're supposed to do a lot of times and everything and we're going to go and deep dive a little bit in what is the reason and what I understood from my visitor. So in the main event we had some of the people that they talked first it was the leader of the area leader or the area manager because in this year quarters they have the Europe Africa and Middle East I believe that they are managing all the operations over there. This woman the let's call it for now CEO okay CEO is Mark but let's call it CEO of the region okay this CEO was on the stage talking about how how many people they employ and all of this corporate stuff that I don't care about to be honest I don't care if you employ 120 different nationalities or whatever that may be I just care about the product if it's good or bad and I expect from you to tell me what are you going to do to improve it they told me that they have spent I don't know the number just out of the top of my head I think yeah it's 33 billion spent on AI and they're going to spend even more so this is one thing that I have learned that they are focusing mostly on AI and broad targeting there are no engineering teams and this is what I suppose nobody actually confirmed that for me but when I was asking them they were just telling me do broad and they were just focusing on that and I believe the reason is that there are no engineering teams that they are actually right now working with interests or lookalikes or whatever mostly their focus is on broad targeting and they try to make broad targeting by just making it better and better to actually work even for new ad accounts the CEO kept talking about how much money they are investing to this and that and what they are doing and all of that so nothing important from that the next pitches was were actually not not important also in terms of something that I would learn something new for example they were talking about how good advantage flash is and that you should do broad targeting they talked also a lot about consolidation which you know that we are against that on this channel and they have some previous case studies that they prove that consolidation is not the solution when it goes to that because you don't have control on the bad periods this is also another thing that I realized in the year that passed that you cannot just go and do just one campaign and when a bad period is coming from Facebook you just do nothing and you wait for everything to be fixed you don't you're not flexible on that also consolidation is not possible with companies that they are actually having a lot of products products that they go out of stock if you have something if you have 20 products and some of those are going to go out of stock you cannot just close and open the campaigns they were proposing crazy things like having an advantage plus put the creatives from black friday inside there close the other ads leave the black friday creatives and then let them run for black friday then close the black friday ads and add the creatives and the turn on the creatives that you had before some crazy things like that and they were proposing a lot uh rich campaigns i don't know the reason the reason now is that there's a new uh thing that says that you should run a lot of rich campaigns in order for you to reach more and more people because you're not reaching a lot and i have even been to a room that they were presenting to me that i'm just giving random numbers we have reached 10 million people in the last 12 months and the frequency that we had was 0.78 and when i told them that there's no way that we can have a frequency which is below one they told me that these are the numbers and stuff they didn't even realize what they were showing to me and the reason for that is because they had a presentation which was prepared by someone that he was just dividing the frequency within with the months without taking the average of them of all of these months so that we can have a normal number of frequency because either they are lying about the let's say 10 million that we reached and it means that if we have 0.78 frequency we reach 7.8 million for example just it's not like that i know but just to give a very easy stupid explanation but if we don't have one frequency it means that we haven't reached 10 million people so there's a lie somewhere here so in other words i met with a lot of people and i have seen a lot of discussions from people that i know that they haven't even been in a nudge manager and i'm going to explain what happened in in a workshop actually when we had over there one case study they divided us in different groups because after the main speeches that i told you this is these are all the things that i have learned in the main speeches beats do advantage plus do broad and do consolidation this is the biggest thing that everybody talked even before we go to the workshop even there is a guy who talked on the meta conference is a guy that i met and we were in the workshop actually together after that um a guy that i could understand that he knew about facebook ads because he was talking about how he scaled the business of doing 1.5 million per month on spend on a lot of different countries and i was actually amazing that i approached him after i told him i don't believe that you're doing all of that with with consolidation are you sure and he takes to me and says i hate consolidation so basically even the people that they were talking on the speech they were not doing the things that the meta wants them to do on the platform and they do it in another way in other words meta has a very good algorithm but the people that they are working over there they don't understand and my only hope was that i was going to be able to meet one of the engineering team or someone there because i cannot believe that advantage plus has been made from people that they don't understand how ads are made and how are they running in within the ads manager i believe that there are people working there but i but i believe that 80 or 90 of the whole people working them they they have no idea about facebook ads and how they work they just follow the guys lines that they get and there's another 10 of or 5 percent that is actually knowing what they're doing and they're the engineering team but i was not lucky enough to meet any of them and that's the logic way of thinking it right if meta says something should follow it because they are the ones that they have created well it's not like this because consolidation doesn't work in the way that they want to i don't know why they're pushing consolidation i do truly believe that they tried to make the platform super easy for everyone so that everyone can use it but at the end of the day we need to understand that in bigger spends it's very difficult actually to just have one campaign spending everything or if you have different products and everything and i don't know why they're not understanding that and they try to push it so much pushing other things like rich campaign i do see on their eyes that they do believe that this is going to help you but they don't understand that when this comes from meta as meta it's coming as another way for them so that all the advertisers can spend more money in a rich campaign which is not going to give them anything but it's just going to give some extra revenue so that they can hit their numbers at the end of the quarter or whenever that may be also they don't understand that they are having some problems with customer support because when somebody is doing customer support and he's replying to you with an article within meta this is not a reply this article doesn't say anything for example if you say to someone how can i increase my spending limit and this is what is happening actually you're talking with one person second person third person fourth person they all give you the same template answers because they don't care or they have to go for a break for two three hours or whatever that may be and at the end of the day somebody is going to solve it for you do you know how someone who has solved it for someone else before so basically experience over here is something that is problematic i have also learned that they have laid off one out of three people over there and the problem with that is that all of these people they have left from customer support or other places and this has made the situation even worse on the whole august we have a whole huge huge issue with rejected ads which is now being fixed slowly customer support is not good so it's not only about the fact that somebody was showing me a presentation with 0.7 frequency it's not about the fact that they were talking about consolidation it's not about the fact that they were talking about rich campaigns companies i do realized in the workshop that the people that was doing the workshop the actual presentation wasn't the person that has ever run any ads let me tell you why there was a case study that they were telling us how would you approach this at account what would you do in order to fix it it was giving a cost per acquisition of two dollars two dollars in united states for people that they see us right now it's almost impossible okay or ireland it's possible also on ireland or united kingdom i don't know then it was having a look-alike of three percent which was three million it was having a broader in this account let's say it was having another it wasn't an account it was just written there it wasn't the pre-screen then it was having um broad targeting of women female uh third no 20 no 18 to 40 years old which was actually 10 million people only women uh broad a wellness audience broad targeting men and women all ages which was 7 million and beauty which was 6 million whoever is running ads knows that these numbers don't make any sense why you cannot have a three percent look alike which is three million and have a broad targeting of women in this range of ages and be 10 million and then the beauty um it's going to be six million these numbers don't make sense why am i saying that you are going to make a presentation to some people that are coming from all over europe or wherever they're coming from and you don't have the audacity not audacity you don't have the um a few moments later sorry for this so you don't find it necessary to actually go and actually open that's manager check your numbers so that you can give a proper case study this this person has a sit down in a room and he has done a presentation with numbers just out of their head which makes me think if i was going to have people coming all over the world advertisers would i ever expose myself to something like this no because i do care i don't want people to call me someone that doesn't know what he's talking about second thing i would have done a proper case study by opening the ads managers showing proper numbers over there and showing actually that i know what i'm talking about we're talking about people that they haven't even touched an ad manager and they just talk about theory without ever run any ads so what's the problem with that the problem with that is that you cannot go and you can consult people if you haven't run any campaign on yourself what i would do i would strongly suggest mark and most probably it's never going to happen but i don't give a i would strongly suggest to mark take these people to run campaigns even on a demo account make them run campaigns how the are they going to talk about interests or lookalikes if they haven't created in any interest or any if they haven't created any look-alike if they don't know the process of creating a look-alike if they don't know how it is to have big uh interest or smaller interest if they don't know that the interest have been removed if they just read theory theory theory and they don't know how it's implemented is it going to be difficult to have one workshop every month that everybody stays on the pc in your luxury offices and actually make them to actually do a campaign in the ads manager even if it's a demo account you can create a demo account everybody would have the feeling of how it is to create a campaign okay they will never be super experienced but they will understand the whole situation and i do understand that as a company you have to push the agenda of doing um bro targeting which is working okay but why nobody is mentioning that in the new ad accounts bro targeting is not working and what are they going to do all of these people do you want them to advertise or not no you're not going to say that okay bro targeting is not working on your ad accounts you will just say test everything and see how it's going to work and this is the way that we also talk as advertisers and to understand it because facebook is an uncertain platform but if you see it at the end of the day you will have to understand that the new businesses also matter because maybe they're going to become big enough and they're going to start spending so not giving them the option of actually being able to do other things and you focusing only on broad targeting while some people they're not going to be able to kickstart their campaigns because of that it means that you don't care you just see the bigger picture in the future as a big company that you are and you're just saying okay we're just going to try broad broad broad until we reach a point that even the new ad accounts are going to work with broad targeting and we don't care what is going to happen in the meanwhile that's all the things that i'm realizing about meta and my visit even when i didn't meet anyone from the engineering team i asked to meet someone and i gave a list of questions and they told me that these questions are not part of of the ad account that i'm managing and how how is it possible to make a technical question for example how an advantage plus is working okay is it with ai is our ideas about having one dominant ad correct how am i going to address a question which is only tailor-made it's a technical question okay how is it going to be only tailor-made to one other account that i'm actually managing right now anyway all of these issues and i feel like all of these people working there in this such great environment and made them not care about the product and no training at all to understand the ads manager and how it's working and just theory theory theory being brainwashed and just believe whatever facebook says because they don't have their own opinion okay and you know i just don't like it the way that it is am i going to go again most probably not because it's a waste of time okay as one time experience it was okay but i i didn't manage to find someone apart from the guy that i met who was a guy who had a lot of experience running ads i haven't met anyone else at my level so that i can speak to even the executives they didn't want to speak about technical things they just wanted to speak about general things about meta or whatever and they were irritating if you make any question which was on the technical level so i'm not going to miss them they are not going to miss me it's fine but for me it was a fail because i didn't manage to actually have a communication with someone from the engineering team which is what i want to because all of these people they are just unreachable and you just talk with sales people or executives or reps or whatever that may be which have their own goals of selling you to do reach campaigns or whatever that may be and for me this is not enough because i want to go deeper and understand more things about the algorithm if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my paid and free course my website and because i'm super right now from all the things that they said don't forget be creative be consistent and i will see you guys on the next video
