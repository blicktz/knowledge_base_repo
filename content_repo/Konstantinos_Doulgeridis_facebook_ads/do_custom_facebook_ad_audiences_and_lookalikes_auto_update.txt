Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss if our custom audiences and lookalike audiences are auto-updating or we should delete them and create new every time. So Facebook is very clear about this and they say that the audiences they do auto-update and stuff but I was thinking are they right? So I started using audiences and I haven't changed them in some accounts for a year or two so this is a long-term plan that I have thought in order to test if they're working or not and today we're going to go into MyPC and see if these very old lookalikes and very old audiences are working even after 365 days which means that they were that it's impossible for them to work if they don't keep auto-updating because okay Facebook says that but can we prove it with data because this is all about this is what they care about I don't care if Facebook says this or that I just always want to test it.

If you're bored of watching the next the truth is that they do auto-update and they keep working even for a very long period of time but let's go to MyPC so that you can see also the data. Hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So I'm not going to I'm going to keep it simple okay so this is a retargeting campaign over here guys okay it has been created on June 3rd of 2022 we have 17th of January 2024 more than one and a half year I guess okay so at this point we know that these custom audiences that we're using in this retargeting if they are not going to be sorry I made a mistake actually this campaign this campaign it's October 16th 2022 which means that it's one years old and something so the custom audiences that we're using over here they are middle of funnel so these are audiences of 30 days so it wouldn't be able to work for a straight period of producing so many sales okay because this one on the max period has actually spent half a million over here having 7.7 rows which is something that we expect from a retargeting campaign so this one wasn't going to be able to produce so many sales if we were not going to actually have the audience auto update all the time because it's an audience based on the 30 days and of course it's a retargeting campaign that we have some decent budget to it because in this account we're spending a lot of money in a day level more than 10k 11k per day so it's just if you think of it it's just the rule of 20 percent 80 percent that being said this is happening on the custom audiences but my question was also about look-alike audiences so this is a campaign with look-alike audiences over here obviously I'm hiding the names because it's going to reveal who the client is but you can see that this one was created on January 15th actually the reason that I'm creating this video now is because now I'm sure also about look-alikes not that I wasn't sure earlier because the look-alikes all the audiences most of the audiences are being based on 180 days don't forget that we can take up to 180 days website events like purchase shot to cart and all of that so the look-alikes are being created from these custom audiences but my question wasn't so much on if the custom audiences are actually being refreshed because in these custom audiences I knew from other ad accounts also that they're working for a long period you can have a retargeting campaign for years and it's not updating does the look-alike audiences also auto-update based on the custom audience I cannot believe that these look-alikes are working for such a long period of time if they're not auto-updating also the custom audiences and then the look-alike audience to that and this is one of the cases I have other ad accounts also that they're proving that you can have these look-alikes for a very long period of time even past the 180 days and now past the 365 days which is one year and the only way that this is happening is only if they're auto-updating so now I'm convinced with data Meta was also saying that they're not updating but now I'm also convinced and I wanted to show you this with actual data so that it's going to be clear let me see if I have one more ad account that proves my point just give me one second guys let me find one with other look-alikes okay so I have found another example here this ad account operates with two break-even rows this is a campaign that has been created on July 18th so if we count August September October November December January because we have 17 of January you have six months three multiplied six it's 180 days I'm using look-alikes that are based here on the 180 days events so this campaign wasn't going to just produce this kind of results if it wasn't the case of things being refreshed I'm pretty sure about the custom audiences I don't know if this proves 100% that the look-alikes are also getting refreshed but in my opinion as I have showed you here I have campaigns with look-alikes working for more than a year so I think that they do auto refresh I haven't found the need of actually needing to create them all over again because even when I don't have a campaign for a year I'm still having in ad accounts and in audiences look-alikes that I have created two or three years ago and they are still working pretty well maybe you can tell me that yes but they have the previous audiences maybe inside and they are still working well I don't have an 100% answer about the look-alikes but I'm 100% sure about the custom audiences because I have been using Amiver for two or three years in some cases in that case I can see that look-alikes are working for a very long period without you needing to refresh them or do something so I believe that they auto refresh also auto update but I will keep monitoring it I guess and if I change my opinion I will make another video that I'm going to correct and say for example that they don't auto update but as of now based on the data that I have they seem to auto update if you have any idea about it let me know in the comments and we can start a discussion there about it so that's all I had for you a very small video with my one year test and it's actually funny because it's taking one year for me to think of it and actually testing it and now it's a video which is very small but it's fine you know all of this is going to be the English style of the YouTube channel as theory so I'm happy for it and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course or my website and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
