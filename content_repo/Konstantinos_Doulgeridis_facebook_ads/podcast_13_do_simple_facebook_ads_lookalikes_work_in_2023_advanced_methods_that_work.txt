Είναι σκέλασσα στο σκέλασσα στο πρώτο μήθος, που δείχνω ότι δεν μπορώ να σκέλασσα πιο πιο και να αυξηθήσω όλες τις ROAS, επειδή, μόνο το σκέλασσα και αυξηθήσω τις ROAS είναι ένα αποδεκτήριο.

Το πράγμα είναι ότι μπορεί να δείχνω ότι οι πιο καταγραφές μου, έχουν τα ΡΟΑΣ 3.8K, και οι πιο καταγραφές μου έχουν 3.2K. Εάν είμαι ότι οι πιο καταγραφές μου, οι πιο καταγραφές μου, θα έρθουν στην πιο καταγραφές, οι πιο καταγραφές μου, και τα άλλα πιο καταγραφές μου, θα έλεγα ότι μπορούσα να το πω το μήθος στο 4 ΡΑΣ.

Υπάρχουν πολλές πράγματα για το lookalikes και πολλές μέθος που έχω δευθυνθεί, που θέλω να δουλειώσει με εξάρτηση. Πρώτα, τι είναι lookalikes? Lookalikes είναι οι δημοσίες που, για παράδειγμα, έχουν άτομα που πρέπει να προσθέσουν στον πόνο, ή αδητοί το cart ή έχουν ίδιοι να κάνουν την οικογένεια, και τότε έχεις και κάνεις ένα lookalike από τους δημοσίες.

Πώς κάνεις αυτό είναι το δημοσίες, όπου μπορείς να κάνεις και να πείτε... Πρώτα, κρήσετε την κυρία του κοινού, που θα είναι οι άτομα που πρέπει να πρέπει τα πρώτα τα 180 μέρες, και τότε κρήσετε ένα lookalike από τους δημοσίες, που πρέπει να πείτε το χώρο και το παράδειγμα, το παράδειγμα. Το παράδειγμα του παράδειγμα μπορεί να μην πειτεύθει από 1%-10% και μπορείς να κάνεις συμβινάσεις όπως 1%, 1-3%, 2-5%...

Τι πιο δημιουργείς το χώρο με τα παράδειγματα, και μετά από το χώρο και πόσο μικρό είναι το χώρο, πιο πιο δημιουργείς το χώρο. Για παράδειγμα, το 1%-1%-2.3-3.000.000. Και αν πέρας πέρας σε έναν άλλο μικρό χώρο, μπορεί να είναι 50.000.

Για παράδειγμα, το χώρο μου, Ελλάδα, πιο πιο πιο πρόκειται, είναι 50.000 ή 20.000. Περαδείγμα. Επομένως, εδώ έχουμε τη βασική δημιουργείς τι είναι πιο πιο πιο.

Okay, it's the same principle like the one that we have when we have one item stores. So, when you have one item stores, when you have 100 sales, for example 100 purchases, then you go and you can start creating some lookalikes. It doesn't mean that they are going to be effective, but it is the right timing for you to start actually tapping and try to see if they are going to work or not.

Second thing, after that you're going to try on 200 or 300 or 400. Before that, before the purchases, you can try to see if you are going to start doing lookalikes from initiate checkout people, from people who added to cart, from people who view content and stuff. So the more you fuel data, the more you start testing different custom audiences and lookalikes out of them in order to see how they're going to work.

Let's talk now about the structures. The structures that you're going to have are going to be those. You're going to do, for example, a CBO campaign that you're going to have a budget.

Again, the number of assets and the number of budget is really being decided by a simple equation that I have, but it's going to be improved by the time the more ads you do and the more you understand the ad account. Let me explain. So what you're doing is that you go and you watch.

If you have no idea, you just do ads blindly. Let's say that you do $100 with five adsets or eight adsets in order to see if you can get sales. But if you know, for example, in your ad account that you're running some ads, you go and you see what is the average cost per purchase that I'm getting between my different campaigns.

And of course exclude, if it's possible, retargeting because it has completely different cost per purchase. So what are the numbers? If the number, for example, is 20, I'm getting $20 cost per purchase as an average with my cold traffic ads.

What you're going to do is you're going to say how much do I want to spend? I want to spend 100. Perfect.

So you're going to do 100 divided by 20, which is your average cost per purchase, which means five ad sets. So what am I asking from Facebook for each one of my five ad sets? I'm asking to get a cost.

I'm asking to get a purchase for every $20 spent on each one of these ad sets in the CBO. And then you're going to multiply this by two. In that case, for example, you're going to have $100 spent in a CBO and you're going to have 10 ad sets.

Why? Because you need to start optimizing and you need to go the next day and the next day and start seeing how much money is it spending across... First of all, you want to improve the $20 cost per purchase into your CBO campaign.

Second thing is that you want to go and you want to see how much money is it spending across this ad set? Is it spending, for example, $2 in each one of them, $3? Then it's moving very slow.

What am I going to do? I'm going to remove the 2 out of 10. I'm going to run it the next time with 8 to see if it's going to spend enough.

Is it spending too much? For example, is it spending in all of my adsets? I go the next day and I see 20, 20, 20, 20, you know, I know sales.

That means that it's moving very fast. What does it mean? That I need to add more ad sets so that it can spend in a slower rate between the ad sets, all the budget and I'm going to give it.

And by the time by doing this again and again and again, you're going to be able to understand how many ad sets you should have in each one of the budgets that you're going to decide for your CBO campaigns. This is the most important factor because you are going to be able through that to run crazy method, interest, CBO campaigns, normal lookalike CBO campaigns. This is one of the most important things that nobody can teach you, but you can teach yourself through the experience that you're going to have in the ad account.

And of course, by watching a lot of my videos, doing optimization in several accounts and stuff which I'm doing. The difficult part here guys is not the strategy that you're going to have. The strategies are 1 million strategies here and there.

The difficult part is the optimization of CBO accounts and this is why a lot of times people are hiring people like me or somebody else who is having a lot of experience. They don't want us because of the strategies. Because the strategies are out there, Konstantinos is putting them on their YouTube channel, whatever.

The problem is the CBO optimization. Even if I put 10 or 15 videos of CBO optimization, you need to do it on your own in several accounts in order to master it and learn it. And let me tell you that from the students that I have, it's taking them months or even a year to go and master it in the level that I have it and I understand it.

And of course, after that, I have to teach them also manual bidding and other more advanced stuff because it doesn't stop there. It's getting even more complicated after that. Now, the whole concept here though is to understand what we are talking about here.

Don't be lazy to think that you're going to follow a blueprint, but understand the whole philosophy in order to adapt it to your own ad account because every business is completely different and every ad account is completely different. So, that being said, we can have a structure like this that we have a CBO campaign with the budget and the ads that we're going to decide and we're going to learn more about the ad account by optimizing how many we should have. And we can have one campaign which is going to be...

I'm not going to talk only about lookalikes now. We're going to have one campaign with lookalikes, for example, we're not going to start with any crazy method at the start. We're going to start with 1% in one ad set.

The other ad set is going to have 1-2. The other ad set is going to have 2-3%. The other ad set is going to have 3-4.

The other ad set is going to have 1-3. Another one which is a good, it's 3%, 5% and 10%. These are the ones that I have seen working the best.

Have I seen having sales in 8-9%? Yes, in some cases. But let's say that you have a limited budget and a limited amount of ad set.

These are some of those that you can use. Now, at the start, I would like you not to go to very big lookalikes. So, start with 1%, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, that's it.

Don't go to 1-3% which is going to give you a higher potential reach. As soon as you start seeing some results, you can start increasing the potential reach of the lookalikes. You can go to 5%, you can go to 10%.

And then, you can also do crazy method with one of these if you see that it's actually working very well. The thing here that you need to look is that, of course, in the United States it's much more easier to do it like this, but if you go in another country, let's say for example in Greece that I live here, if you do 1%, 1-2, 2-3, the audiences are going to be very small. So, in smaller countries, go with audiences like 5%, 10% immediately go to these higher, bigger numbers.

Of course, in theory, always the 1% is always going to be better, but what can you do if 1% in your country, which is a small country, is only 50k people? Nothing. So, after that, I came up with another idea, which was the Blender method.

What was the Blender method? The Blender method was all about, back in the days, just below the interests, we were having one button which was called Expand button, Expand audience. So, what was doing is that you were putting one audience of 2 million, but it was actually targeting, starting with this audience and targeting 200 million people, the whole broad targeting of the demographics that you were adding there.

If it was male 25 to 65 on the United States, it was going to target the whole thing, but start first as an initial pinpoint with this interest. So, what I thought is that what if we blend that with lookalikes? So, you can put, let's say, for example, 1% lookalike and you can put an interest below which is much higher than that.

For example, you can put an 1% lookalike, for example, in the United States, which is going to be 2-3 million and then put an interest below that which is 8 million. And with this Expand button, if you still have it in your account or you can test to see what is the potential reach that you're going to get, you can go, for example, and target 8 million people, but this time start from the lookalike first as 1% as your starting point and then move to the 8 million people which is the interest. So, this is a very interesting thing because it was using the Expand button as Expand now in the interest and not in the whole potential reach.

So, you were putting on the top one lookalike like the 1% and what I like to do is I was putting 1% add to cart lookalike and the 1% purchase lookalike. So, I was having two lookalikes on the top and one, two interests on the bottom that they were giving me my full potential reach and it was working flawlessly because it was starting with the lookalike even if it was small or whatever. It was starting with this core audience and then it was expanding to the bigger audience which was the interest.

This was the blended method and you could do all of the combinations that you wanted as long as you keep the 1% purchase, 1% add to cart on the top and then you were changing in the different matches, the different interests. Second thing is that, and I'm going to take them by the line that I started inventing these different methods, is that I always believed, by the way this is why I, because at the start the Expand button was considered a very bad setting, I always believed that there are no bad settings, there is just bad use of them. Okay, so I found a way of actually being able to use this button at that point.

Now the Expand button is actually mandatory, so you will need to go and check if you can actually use it and what is the potential reach that you are getting if you combine combined together lookalikes and interests. After that, the iOS came and we were having a lot of issues, so in theory as I said the 1% lookalikes are always going to be the best. What happened after that is that guys after the 14.5 iOS changes all the 1% lookalikes were not working, you were doing it in accounts, it wasn't working, it wasn't working, it wasn't working.

So I started thinking why they don't work anymore and the answer that came to my head is that at the same time I could see that the broad targeting was getting more and more and more space and don't get me wrong, I was using the broad targeting even before the 14.5 iOS but I realized that it was becoming stronger and stronger and stronger and back in the days when I was using it before the iOS 14.5 I had the crazy method already and people could not understand why I use broad targeting because at that point interests and and of course lookalikes were considered very strong. So I was using it and I was able to scale accounts where others they were not even using broad targeting at that point. So broad targeting became mainstream after the iOS 14.5 changes because people didn't have the lookalikes to use anymore, they were not working.

A lot of interests were removed and then we had also the next interests that have been removed one year later in the next spring and everybody was actually trying to find a solution with broad targeting because it was the only thing working and of course my crazy method kicked in there and I was having very good results but still I believe that okay we still have lookalikes, we have to find a way of using them and then I realized that okay what if the lookalikes that are going to work are going to are going to be broad lookalikes. So I started using 10% lookalikes instead of 1% and I realized that the 10% were working very well and I have made one video which I was saying that bad advertisers still use 1% lookalikes. This thing is changing now, I will explain it a little bit.

So I said to myself okay 10% is working, can we make it more? Can we make more of 10% or just use just 1% each of the time? Because I like crazy method and I have to use crazy method whenever I can.

So I said to myself what if we take the 10% of Add to Cart, 10% of Purchase, 10% of Initiate Checkout, 10% all of the 10% that we can get let me tell you which. So view content, top 25% You can see all of these custom audiences and how to create them in my 4 plus 1 ways to retarget video. Then we have the Facebook Engagers, Instagram Engagers, you could put even people who view 95% of some of your training videos, you could put Initial Checkout, Add to Cart, purchase your content, I said it, I think that's all.

And then you were putting inside the ad set all of them. So instead of having just one lookalike of 10% you were stacking them all together and you were having for example in the United States a potential reach of 50 million people with lookalikes though. Not just with broad targeting but lookalikes.

So you had some direction to the pixel to go and find the specific audience. So that worked flawlessly and I named this strategy Stacked Lookalikes. So basically Stacked Lookalikes is all about stacking all the lookalikes of 10%.

Now you can do Stacked Lookalikes with 5%, you can do with 1%, whatever you want, as long as you stack them together so that you can use the full potential reach. I don't want you to stack 1% with 5% and 6% and 10% in the same because all of those they need to have exactly the same size. It's the same thing as when we group interests.

When you group interests, if you put an interest of 20 million people and an interest of 1 million people, Facebook is going to spend all the money on the 20 million because it's easier for them to do it and for the algorithm to do it. So when you're stacking lookalikes you need to stack exactly the same percentages so that you won't have any issues with the potential reach, first of all, but also spending all the money in just one lookalike. With this way, the budget either is going to be spread or you're going to give enough chances to all of these lookalikes until Facebook decides to use one more, one of them more because it's getting better results.

So the fragmentation of the budget is going to be even better when you use the same, don't just use different ones. And even if you do, try to do it with ones that are going to be the same. For example, 1%, 1% to 2% to 3% if you want to stack them together, it's fine.

If you want to stack together something with 1 million and 3 million, it's still fine. These are similar, but don't stack something which has a potential reach of 20 million or an audience of 20 million and another one with 1 million because it's not going to be served. So this was the stack lookalikes and of course it was working with crazy method.

You were putting several ad sets which are going to be exactly the same, all of them having inside the same stack lookalikes in each one of the ad sets with all of the interest together so that you can target the different hot pockets. We have explained the crazy method, I believe, in the previous podcast. So in the previous podcast we explained the crazy method.

So now you might say, how the you don't remember in one week. A lot of things are happening in my life, sorry. So we explained how the crazy method works in the previous podcast.

Please go and listen it. From what I have seen, from the engagement of it, I think that you really liked this video. What I would really like to know in the comments, if you understand 100% of the things that I'm saying because I feel like sometimes it's super technical and maybe inside my head all of these are easy concepts for me to understand, but maybe they're not for you and if it's not, you always have the option of putting the question because I'm answering questions and I'm going to do it even today with some of your questions in this podcast.

So this was the beginning of the stack lookalikes and it went very well guys. For one year and stuff it went very well which really proves my point about blueprints. You should not follow blueprints but you should try to explain in the situation why.

For example, until that point I had the blender method. Was the blender method working equally well after the iOS? No.

So what are you doing when you're following a blueprint? You're going to be left at some point with a method that maybe it's going to be outdated or it's not going to work just because you follow blueprints and you don't understand in a deeper level and in a technical level how a platform is working. And I understand that some people they just want to follow orders but I think that the ones that they're are going to become much better on Facebook ads are the ones that are going to understand everything and they're going to understand why they're doing this or that without just following blindly.

This is why my CBO optimization is really based on your experience on how you're going to do it and not just by following a blueprint even if I have a very simple equation at the start in order to explain to you how many answers you should put and what kind of budget. Now after that point it was working well for one year but then I realized by testing and it's still working very well by the way but I started thinking but one percent why did we abandon one percent? One percent it's always going to be the best in theory.

So I came up with another idea and don't ask me how it's about going to several other accounts, it's about talking to several people, it's about having aha moments when you are taking a shower, it's all of that okay. When you live and breathe about Facebook ads these things are happening. So it was really really really annoying me why one percent is not working anymore.

Can we make it somehow to work because in theory it's always the best. And I said what if I create one percent look-alike, make it worldwide because I had this option when I was creating. So when I was creating one look-alike I saw the worldwide option and said okay let's create it, let's play with it a little bit in the asset.

And I created an one percent look-alike. It was having 50 million people let's say in a United States account for a purchase. And then I went, I put the one percent look-alike and I'm putting as a country United States.

So basically my worldwide look-alike is going to take only the audience of the United States inside the look-alike. Do you know what I realized? It was targeting different people from different ad accounts to different countries when I was testing it.

So in the United States in in one ad account it was 20 million people. In another United States ad account it was 30 million people. And it was always based, it was bigger and bigger and bigger, the better the pixel was and the stronger the pixel was and the more data that the pixel had.

So I started thinking why if you put it as a worldwide and then you put the country, it has 20 million people potential needs and when you create it as one percent look-alike it has 2.33 million people. So I came to the conclusion that of course nobody couldn't answer it, story of my life and I came to the conclusion of what if, which by the way cannot prove anything but it is a logical explanation, what if by default the one percent look-alike that you create in the United States for example it has to be 2.3 million because this is the one percent. Okay, it's 2.3 million but what if Facebook can find more people in the one percent similarity but by default it has to populate 2.3 million people out of the 20 million people that it can populate that they are similar to your people who purchased or added to cart or whatever.

So I started thinking and I said, are these other people people that we don't want to target? Hell no, we want to target them because Facebook still considers them close to the one percent similarity. So what if we could use one percent look-alikes as worldwide just narrow down to the country and we can have one percent look-alikes but bigger ones.

Okay, so the possibilities here are endless. Why? Because the problem here is that the one percent look-alike wasn't working anymore because it was very small and Facebook was favoring broader audiences.

So with that way we were able to actually, I was able to actually target much bigger audiences while I was using one percent look-alikes. Sometimes it was like I was targeting with stacked look-alikes like this which were having 20-30 million people but with one percent look-alike just one look-alike I was having 20 million. So what if Facebook is creating this 20 million pool and then it's creating out of them 2.3 million just because the platform it has a specific number for one percent look-alike for United States.

Then as a marketeer I want to target all the other 17 million people and the other thing that I'm thinking here is this. Even if we go by the best intention and say that Facebook is taking the best ones to the 2.3 million, are there still sales to the other 17 million? Of course there are.

So this is how the high society look-alike method came out and this is how I started using one percent worldwide look-alikes by narrowing down in the country inside the asset level and it worked flawlessly and after that the stacked look-alikes high society came when I was putting one percent look-alikes worldwide for auto card purchase you know all of that and I was narrowing down with the country and it was working also flawlessly. Now all of these are still working except from the bledder method which is working but I'm not using it anymore because I have the stacked look-alikes and stuff and in most accounts I'm scaling so I'm not bothered of using this method which is all about starting with new pixels. I prefer to go with interest and then with look-alikes and then with crazy method so I think it's a little bit outdated on that side but I'm starting to observing that right now I'm having some accounts which are new and I'm starting using again one percent one two two two two three three to four and I can tell you that these look-alikes are starting to work again.

So I'm seeing that stacked look-alikes are working very well for sure I'm using them in several other accounts and I'm scaling but for me the reason is that okay it's close to broad targeting if you put such a lot. What happens if you have smaller and newer pixels and you want to go deeper to look-alikes? Guys one percent look-alikes one two two two two three they started working again well and I feel that it has to do with the 20 days attribution coming back which is going to help also in some interest coming back and also for one percent look-alike maybe working better.

I think that's all I have about look-alikes you should start using again one percent I think you will find it interesting that maybe it's going to work again if you're disappointed with it because in several accounts it's working. That's all about look-alikes in 2023. I hope you like the way that I found the methods and the way that I'm structuring it and if you haven't tested any of those you can watch some of my videos and you can go and you can test them on your own.

So how much time? 39. Okay perfect.

So let's go now for the different questions so that we can answer them and then we can close the podcast. So question number one. Hi Konstantinos, how many days do you give a crazy method campaign to run without any sales when you first started?

Also if you determined it's not working do you try again with the same ad set or another one? Now based on the second thing that you said the crazy method is all about scaling. We are not using the crazy method if we haven't seen that one ad set or ad is working because it's all about hey I'm having one ad set which is working which is targeting 20-30 million people how can I target more people inside this pool audience and because I'm targeting them very slow in a very slow rate with just one ad set that they have.

So this is the crazy method you create it and you target the different hot pockets over there in order to get more results and faster and also to scale your accounts. So yes you're going to relance it you can relance it and you can try it another time or with more adsets less ad sets for example if you have done what we talked earlier before and you see that they are not spending enough every day or if you speak or if you see that they spend a lot have less so you're going to do it like this if you have proof from a previous ad set that it was actually working and yeah you should not abandon it immediately. Second thing how many days do I give a crazy method?

Most of the back in the days guys before I was touching them the first day but we had better reporting at that point and not delayed reporting. The other thing is that I need to tell you that when I'm touching them is different in terms of its account for example if you have an account that you're running crazy method and you have items that they have high average order value and stuff and they need more time to sell you're more flexible with it. If you see that you're having another account which is having big delayed report it you are more flexible with it and you're taking a lot the checkouts.

If you're seeing a lot of checkouts you're being more flexible and you understand if you want to keep it or not. If you see zero checkouts on the second day you have to close it I guess okay or maybe relance it. Then you watch the clicks for example if I'm having a lot of campaigns and my cost per click in the other campaigns is 0.6 cents per click per cost per unique click and my CTR is 3% and I'm seeing in this new ads that they have 3 dollars per cost per unique link click and 0.8 CTR something is wrong and you will have to close it because you're not getting the same cost of traffic over there.

So it's not like having sales or not it's about do you have a lot of delayed reported in the country or in the ad account based on your experience? Do you think that you put it enough number of assets inside? Do you have an asset that it was actually tested so that you can relance it?

Do you see a lot of checkouts over there so that you can give it more days for some delayed reporting and some delayed sales to be reported so that you can see what you're going to optimize? It's all of these things. Now if you see nothing obviously in the second day you will have to close it okay I wouldn't let it more than 48 hours and you might see a lot of videos in youtube talking about leaving the ads for seven days and stuff with the crazy method and the CBO way that we are working in two days you can know if you have if you can leave something or just abandon it and try something else.

So seven days I think it's too much. Now here I have one comment in my group it says hi people excited to be here I have a question. I test the product in multiple stores I got high sales with low CPP on one store and got less sales or none on other stores.

Some of my friends face the same issue with a single product in different stores what factors would would be would be decided I don't know how to read this what factors would would have decided this behavior? So first of all I'm doing I'm doing one basic question over here are all the stores that you're testing it the same because you cannot compare sending the same creative event the same ad whatever to one landing page and to another landing page and say why it's not converting here or there. Guess what?

The problem is the landing page. If it's converting in one landing page and not converting in the other the problem is the landing page and he says nope the store is different then your problem is on the stores. He says we had high results on one store and we tried to do it the same on on another and post and post there for some reason but it didn't get sales on the new store.

I have faced this several times in last year. I'm unable to comprehend this behavior. Does the algorithm have to do something with this?

And then I say same landing pages on the stores. Apparently if the pixel is the same and everything is the same and everything is the same they like one store more than the other and it converts better here. Think of what is changing.

Is it only the domain name? Everything else is the same? And he says domain names are different, Shopify is different, undercounts and business managers are different, pixel is different, everything is different, just the product is the same and it's landing page is almost the same.

So guys, here and I have nothing with Muhammad here but Muhammad is lying to himself because he's saying I have the same product so even if I put it in store A or store B or store C it has to sell. No, it's selling with the way that you have it. So by the way here by discussion you can understand that there are more problems.

Different ad accounts, different businesses. The businesses based on the amount that you spend they give you better traffic or worse traffic if you have a lot of spend on a business manager. This is a fact, we know it.

Another thing is that the business, the ad accounts they have behaviors and maybe one ad account is going to do better than the other. How do we know that? When I'm scaling businesses and sometimes we have hidden limits in some ad accounts, we tried to use several ad accounts.

I can tell you that we never had the results that we had in the main ad account. We never had such good results in any spend in the second or third ad account. So this is how I understood that the ad accounts that they have a lot of spend and stuff, they have also better results and they have their own behavior.

How else do I know it? There are other accounts that they just work with Advantage Plus just because this is the only ads that they were doing since the beginning and if you try anything else it doesn't work. Okay, so there are the situation.

Then we have the pixel. The pixel is 90% of the job. If you have a different pixel, it doesn't mean just because you have a profitable store, it's going to be the same everywhere.

Even if you were sending people in the same landing page that it's converting well with the same product and you have a different pixel, you would have different results. And this is what he didn't understand that the product is not dictating the sales. The landing page and the pixel are dictating the sales and the product has to be good.

But all of the other, basically, and the product has to be good and the pixel has to be good, everything has to be good and everything is a chain link which if you're missing one link, then the whole thing crumbles and it doesn't work. So you don't have the same pixel and almost the same landing page, not even the same landing page. So here's your answer.

You cannot just say that this item A is going to sell no matter where you put it or with whatever pixel where you put it because you might spend in one ad account one million dollars to it and in another ad account 500 dollars. It's not going to have the same results and the pixels are not going to be the same. Okay, now let's go to the next question.

Hello, I got a question. Do you exclude the retargeting audience from cold audience? I have a hotel ads usually do this.

I exclude page viewers 180 days and social, Instagram and Facebook 360 days from cold from cold targeting and usually make remarketing with other creative for 30 page views. You think it's correct? I don't think it's correct.

I think that the only reason that you should exclude customers and we have discussed this in a previous podcast that we were discussing about retargeting is when you have something that nobody else can buy again. You have to understand that Facebook is all about repeated customers and having repeated sales and even if you think that this is a customer that would have come anyway, my suggestion is okay then don't run ads, number one, and see if he was going to come and I can promise you that in five months he's going to forget you. And the second thing is that when and you might say to that yeah I have alternative ways like SMS and email, fine, but still the person that is if Facebook is stealing one sale from retargeting from other channels it's being used for optimization and this optimization is going to help you get more clients.

So the more data that you fuel it in even if it's stealing some the more data it's going to give you and the more sales is going to give you. Now I don't understand the 360 days Instagram and Facebook people who engage with the social media these are not even people that who have converted. So if someone is engaged with your social media it doesn't mean that they have been to your site necessarily.

Why? Because all of our ads are considered posts. So somebody watching a video he's engaging with our social media which is our page because our ads are being published by our pages.

So this person might have seen one second of the video and you're not going to target them, you're not going to target them again on your call traffic ads. Why? They might have not even ever been to your funnel inside your landing page or whatever.

So I consider this a very good practice, a very bad practice. As I said it doesn't matter if Facebook is stealing a sale because if it's using that in order to get us another call traffic sale that we wouldn't have because it didn't have the data this data then it's fine. I'm against of excluding people that they have been to the site on the last 180 days or the social media or whatever.

I can understand some logic behind excluding people that they have purchased in the last 30 days. I can get that but even in my call traffic ads I don't do it, I just do it in retargeting. But let's say that we have a company that when somebody buys they're not going to buy for the next 20-30 days because first their product has to be depleted and then buy.

Okay so that's fine, you can do that I guess but excluding all the people and just and I actually remember that I told him that you should not do that because this is not a good practice to always want to have fresh clients from Facebook. He told me why is this a bad practice and it is a bad practice because even the data of retargeted customers they're going to be used as optimization. As we said a lot of times Facebook is all about having repeated customers and if you think that you don't want, I'm sure that you want the repeated customers, you just want the repeated customers just to come out of thin air and not from Facebook and you don't believe that Facebook is helping to that because you have email marketing and SMS marketing.

My answer to these people is that if you have the guts, stop running Facebook ads for one year and see this number of repeated customers just decline because the moment you're going to do it you're going to see that. If you are that good and you're just having repeated customers with that way and you can maintain it the same, fine, still accept the fact that these sales that Facebook is going to steal, you can consider them as an as another data point that's going to help you get more new clients. That's all about it.

I am totally against it just to answer and I think that I answered to him to all of his questions after that. Now we have Joseph says, please help, I'm trying to run a simple ad but I keep getting rejected with ad can't run third party infringement policy but I own the rights to all the photos I'm trying to upload. No matter what photo, text or type of ad I run it keeps getting rejected.

When I requested for review still get rejected and I cannot talk to anyone from Meta so frustrating. I don't know why I put this question. I don't think that I have many things to say about it.

The only thing that I have to say about it is that when you have rejected ads it's better for you to go through the review process. Let me tell you that sometimes you might go with the same 10 ads, ask for review, it's going to approve the four and just disapprove the other six which doesn't make any sense how is approving four and six. So I think it's trying to find a common solution there.

Another thing is that if you have all the rights to the photos... So I had the situation once with one freelancer which was working from Fiverr and she was saying to the person that you have all the rights to these photos but he was actually stealing the photos. So are you sure that you have the right for the photos or this is what the designer is telling to you?

Third thing is that if you're still getting rejected you can do nothing about it and I would strongly suggest to you not to keep pushing it because you will end up getting banned because you have too many rejected ads and this is something that you need you know so if you're getting... Anyway it's a nightmare. If you're getting rejected you can try something else.

If you don't want to do that be careful of not doing all this time the same ads and even if you have rejected ads that they stayed just try to delete them from the account. Don't just keep them there open rejected ads because it's bad for the health of your ad account. And the last thing that I want to say is that if you ever manage to go to contact customer support you can contact customer support in order to do a custom review of the ads with you and maybe they can tell you why they're being rejected or not.

I know how frustrating it is, I know that the customer support is bad but this is also another solution that you can try if the automated system of review is actually rejecting all of your ads. Other than that there's nothing else to do just keep trying with new creatives and don't force the same creatives all over again and again and again because you might get banned. That's all with your questions let's go to Freelancer Diaries just to close it.

I'm getting some strange messages from time to time from people that they just want to come and live with me like I have a camp over here of marketeers that they come and we can be all together and do ads and this is a message that somebody sent me on Appwork. How would you feel about mentoring us? We both have zero experience sir.

We would like to learn anything really without getting in your way and wouldn't mind helping you out. We would be thankful from anything we can learn from you. We live in Utah so we would like to come to you if that's all right with you.

So basically I have a proposal of having two people from what I understand. He says we have we both okay so it's two people thank God. So there are two people that they apparently want to come and live with me and they don't want to get into my way but they want to learn from me.

I don't know what they want to learn which was a funny proposal that I had and I thought that and I thought that I should share it with you and they are actually here with us. Amir! I'm kidding they are not here.

Anyway that's all I had for you with the podcast and I hope you like the lookalikes. I think that I explained them thoroughly. Let me know on the comments if you have any questions so that we can answer them in the next podcast and what else?

That's all I guess guys. I will see you in the next podcast. Have a nice day!
