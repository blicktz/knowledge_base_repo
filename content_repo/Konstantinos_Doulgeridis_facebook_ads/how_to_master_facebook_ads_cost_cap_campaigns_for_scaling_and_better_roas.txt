Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about cost caps, a super volatile method but with better returns. So just a quick introduction, you know that I'm having a method which is called MOB, it's manual bidding and we're using value optimization over there. Now I have recently seen because I'm testing all the time things on the platform that with cost caps you can actually have some good results of course you need the trained pixel and the good account with seven days attribution, conversion window attribution however you want to call it and I can see that it's working so I have the ad account and let's go on my pc to explain to you everything on how it's working, how you should treat it, the fact that it's dying super fast and you need to relaunch it, you know to try how are you going to find the ideal spot and the price that you're going to put there and everything.

Let's go. So guys first of all before we start this is not an easy way first of all secondly it doesn't mean that it's going to work in all ad accounts I can tell you that out of the 10 ad accounts that I'm using it it's working only on two okay and it's working also with strong pixels. Third thing why then are you showing it Kostantinos because I need to show a lot of things because I don't know your ad accounts and I don't know it's something that worked so I have to show it whoever is going to use it and it's going to work it's fine whoever it's not it's also fine because they tried and they know now that it's not working on their ad accounts so that being said let's go let me show you how it's working how you set it up and everything but keep into your mind that Kostcaps are not for new ad accounts so if you have a new pixel and stuff most probably it's not going to work for you also keep into your mind that Kostcaps is for ad accounts that they also that they spend right now and you want to spend something extra because you try to find more methods to spend in an efficient way so over here what we observe immediately is that we have on the last 14 days we have a 4.79 by the way this ad account last 14 days 51k it's another account that's earning almost 100k per month 2.33 break of a rose of 1.8 I have shown this at the count another time also the thing that we notice immediately is that all of our campaigns they are above two rows because this is what I'm trying to do in order to scale as much as I can by staying on two rows and here we have the cost caps which have 7.79 so it stands out a way immediately we're not going to talk about anything else just for the Kostcaps for this one let me explain to you how the structure works first of all Kostcaps campaigns are ABO campaigns they are not CBO we're working on each ad set separately and let me explain to you why basically all of these ads here they haven't spent because I'm relaunching them I will explain a little bit why first of all you see here we have crazy budgets for example we have 150 daily 200 daily and stuff but it's not going to spend all of the money this is the concept behind the Kostcaps that you you say to Facebook give me this result or don't spend at all the money that I'm giving you and the way that you're going to do it is that you go here you set up your campaign normally everything that I teach in all of my other videos 6am in the morning here we have a broad targeting because as I said this is a trained pixel and we have the targeting that they feel that it's better for this account you can even use automatic placements if you feel better with that and here I'm having a 22 how did I decide to go with 22 it's this because here I'm having a lot of data I'm I'm taking something that makes sense okay so here these are the targeting in one of advanced plus I'm having 18 then it's 25 28 17 here so it's not something that I'm not hitting okay I'm I'm able to get this kind of cost per purchase consistently okay because here we're talking about 475 sales with 70.69 so 20 22 it's okay also even if you're hitting 25 23 you have to go to two dollars lower in so here we're going to start testing and try to see what is the right balance between spending and not spending and what is the right area that you should be if you want to have some sales now what is it going to happen if you put over here 12 for example okay most probably it's not going to spend anything because it's not going to be able to find any sale for 12 dollars or maybe it's going to have just one or two the point here is how am I going to make it to spend as much as I can but at the same time also have good draws and be able to hit my targets so I'm starting here on this one for example it has 24 I have exactly the same match at 22 23 24 okay and I'm trying to work my way up in order to see how much I'm going to spend now you can see that in the results over here it's spent on the 24 it had 13 7 14 here on the 22 so that means and over here on the other results on 22 23 it had 20 24 so it doesn't mean that if you put 22 it's going to give you 22 most probably it's going to give you a little bit less rarely and in the accounts that it's it's not working I see it giving you purchases which are higher the whole idea here is that you when you put it here on the bottom you say meta will aim to get most purchases and try to keep the average cost around 24 some results may cost more and some may cost less this is what it's doing most of the times it's less and now the other thing that you need to know about that is that you can come here so you can put a budget over here of 300 for example it might spend only 50 or 60 or 70 it's not going to spend more than that if we go here on the last let's go for example on one day let's go on 22 okay so here on 22 you can see that here we had a 200 budget it spent only 83 82 over here most probably I lowered the budget over here yeah because it wasn't doing well so another thing that you need to know with that is that you need to monitor it okay and also another change with my other manual bidding method is that over here in show more options you're putting seven days click or one day view in MOB that we I'm having other videos I'm going to put links on the description it's all about the one day and we are doing it differently there so here you need to come every day you need to see what has worked then scale more because Facebook is giving you the chance and says okay I'm getting good results out of that it's pending so I'm going to give it more budget and it's risk-free because if it's not getting results it's not going to spend more the other thing that you need to know about the cost caps is that they die super fast so if we see here on the last seven days we can see that it's it's not spending so they are spending for a period and then they are just dying so what you need to do is you need to duplicate them and relance them now what have I learned in the maximum period from this campaign I have learned that even when I put 22 okay or 23 or 24 it's going to give me a little bit less I have seen also from the ad account that I showed you earlier that I'm also profitable with 30 28 so what I have done is that I duplicated it and this time I'm running with 25 24 26 okay I'm running it again with 28 over here even I'm trying to see what am I going to get so the whole concept is that now that I see that it's working on the ad account I'm going to increase the cost cap so that I can see if I can get more volume because my ultimate goal is not to get 7 4.79 if I'm on 3 rows or 2.5 rows with more volume it's good so I'm going to do 28 and if this is going to work I'm going to go to 31 32 33 see what kind of results am I going to get there but all of this needs time duplication your ads are going to die from time to time you need to come here and watch if something is is looking like it's spending you give it more budget but keep into your mind that even when you scale a lot you can see that it's a very controlled situation because Facebook is not spending a lot of money to it anyway most of the times they work for two three days and then they die but after you do all of these research over here because right now it's giving you such high ROAS because it means that I can give you ROAS I cannot give you volume what we want is is to find the balance so by increasing or decreasing in some cases if you're getting bad results and you're getting volume you are trying to find which one is the cost cap that Facebook is going to let me spend and maybe this is going to change from time to time based on the CPMs of the period and if the ads are more expensive I know it's a little bit advanced I know that for some people that they like cost caps they can play with it and they can understand it further but this is how I do it I am showing you in one account that it's actually working it's not something that I'm going to be relying on for the account I'm just using it as an extra and I'm going to do it again and again whenever I'm having some new creatives I'm also doing them as cost cap I'm managing it but still in this account I'm in the process of finding the sweet spot I haven't found the sweet spot yet I believe from my experience that if the average that I'm getting on on my normal results over here what's the average let's see what's the average cost per purchase uh yeah we don't want to see the maximum let's go on the last seven days for example um and let's go with this so the average that we're getting here is 24 most probably this is why I played between 23 24 and stuff but based on the fact that I can see that on other accounts I'm getting good results I can I can do that so uh this is my take uh I'm going to keep increasing it I'm I'm even going to take it to 30 or 31 to test it because most of the times I see that it's giving you a little bit less so maybe on 30 it's going to give me 28 or 27 cost per purchase which for this account is good I hope that it's not super complicated I hope that you're going to play with it I'm not worried about this because uh it's uh kind of risk free and you're not risking of losing a lot of money in the process because Facebook is going to protect you because of what you're putting there as the pact that you have between you and Facebook so as you can see this is not a method that you can rely on but it's going to be something extra and when you're scaling something extra and maybe you're going to master it or maybe your account is going to work better and it's also not risky it's also rewarding very well with high ROAS so why not anyway if you want to learn more about Facebook ads you can check my book my free course my paid course or my website and don't forget guys that until we meet again be creative and be consistent
