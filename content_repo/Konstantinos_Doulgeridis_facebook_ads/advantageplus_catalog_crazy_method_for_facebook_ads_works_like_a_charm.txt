Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about Advantage Plus Crazy Method but this time with a catalog. Before we go into my pc to show you this live example and how it's working it's not any crazy science but anyway I would like I always try to show you as many other accounts as I can. I would like to tell you the theory behind that just so you know this ad account it's a little bit difficult because I'm trying creatives and they don't work and only catalog is working there.

I have a new theory which I'm trying to test now I'm just going to do carousel ads maybe it likes carousel ads for example because catalogs are carousels but I haven't tested it yet in order to know but still only catalogs are working so I'm trying to scale this account spending 150k per month and I'm trying to scale scale but I came to a dead end okay because if you just use catalogs you don't have many options so I said I remember I used to do Advantage Plus with a crazy method and one creative there if it was working very well the whole idea is that even if you have one creative working over there very well it doesn't mean that you're targeting all the hot pockets that you can create basically my theory about hot pockets says that if you are having an audience of 100 million people also these are accountants in the United States and you're targeting with one ad the hot pockets are being formed in the ad and how are they being formed based on the fact that I'm Konstantinos I'm actually converting so it's going to find similar people like me so I'm forming a hot pocket with similar people like me so if the initial sale is someone else then it's going to create a hot pocket based on them so the randomness of the initial sale it's for it's forming actually the hot pockets and this is the whole concept behind the crazy method and all of that and now the crazy method with Advanced Plus I must say that I'm not very big I'm not a big fan of Advanced Plus but as I said in this channel several times I'm thinking of other things of doing ads and this is one of the cases that I was really trying and they couldn't find anything else so I was trying to find a way and at last the Advanced Plus crazy method with catalog it's working very well what is this basically instead of doing just an Advanced Plus with one ad which is one catalog you duplicate the ad which is exactly the same ad in the same Advanced Plus several times is it abusing yes do I like it no is it beautiful no is it working 100% but it doesn't mean that it's going to work in all ad accounts so I'm trying to show you different things because in this ad account nothing else is working basically except from stacked look alikes and catalog okay or broad targeting and catalog so I'm a little bit limited in terms of creatives I'm always telling to the client that we need to get more creatives but on the other hand on the meanwhile I need to scale this is another thing that I have tried and it worked pretty well I would like to take you to my pc and show you what is it maybe some of you that you have the same problem you're going to use it maybe not it doesn't matter I'm still going to keep posting things that I find interesting and maybe some of you you can use it maybe not it doesn't matter you can use something else that I have posted in the previous days hi guys I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there so guys I'm in this account it's in the United States you know that I never talk about the niches and stuff from my clients sometimes I talk about their niches but not always so here what do we have we have always the same situation here we have an advanced plus catalog as you can see this is a catalog it's taking all of the budget in the maximum period it has this kind of results it has spent a lot of money it is profitable for this business the break event ROAS is lower also the results that we see over here they are not accurate they are getting much more sales than that and it also has a significant spend in the last seven days I said okay I cannot scale because I did 10% lookalikes with catalog again it's working advanced plus with some videos that they found which are the only ones that they actually did work well okay I did it and now I'm trying here an advanced plus with carousels because I told you that I'm trying to test this theory if it likes more carousels and now what I did is that I took basically all of these ads inside they're just the same ad exactly the same ad the catalog which is working and it's bringing volume and as you can see it's working pretty well we're having some very decent results and also the biggest thing that I like over here is that I'm having very good results on my leading ad having such good ROAS I started doing some optimization cutting the budget of this one why because it's a crazy method catalog I can be super aggressive with it and I'm trying to be super aggressive with it just to control it but I think that it's going to go really well and you know even if I'm not the biggest fan of advantage plus crazy method campaigns sometimes they are working and they are doing really well and this is why I wanted to show you that just to prove you that maybe by doing that maybe you're going to have some good results I have messages from people talking to me about advanced plus advanced plus crazy method but we have never done a video with an advanced plus catalog crazy method if you're in in a dead end if you just have one creative in advanced plus and nothing else is working maybe this is something that you can test and see if you can scale a little bit more with that actually because this campaign actually now it's helping me a lot and to be honest with you if it's going to work that well I'm going to do even another one this time with $1000 per day and try to see if I can get another campaign going there I will just keep doing it as long as it's giving me good results uh that's all I know that it's not super pretty uh but uh on the other hand it's working so why not you can try it I guess okay so that's all I had for you I know it's not beautiful I know some of you you might disagree a lot with it but it's working so what can you say even if you don't like it or not in some other accounts if nothing is working and this thing is working so be it you know that's all I had for you guys don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course or my website and until we meet again be creative and be consistent
