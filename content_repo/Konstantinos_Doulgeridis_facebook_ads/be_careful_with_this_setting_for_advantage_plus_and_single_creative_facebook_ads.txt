Hi guys, just a quick update. I'm inside an Advantage Plus and I was working doing ads the other day and let's open this ad set for example just to show you. On this ad set for example, we are having let's say one primer text or you can add more and more and more here and you can work.

Most of the times what we know from our dynamic creative ads is that we are adding over here different options of text, of headlines and we have our different creatives over here and boom, everything is working very well and whenever you do a change over here it's fine. Now there's one big difference over here in Advantage Plus and in campaigns that you're doing single ads and it's this. When you are putting your and you create your ad immediately here and you are having your first texts then when you go here and you edit it you can see that you have also primary text and you have also headline.

It's going to take the first ones that you add and then when you go and you're going to change them on this level it's not going to change them inside here. So what you need to do just to be sure every time because once I did a mistake like this I changed it here and the ads were kept running with whatever settings they had inside here. So in order for you to be sure if you want to make a change, if you want to duplicate a campaign and run it and you want to have another copy over there, what you should do is that you should come inside here in the primary text and the headline even in the destination link and change all of these things here and change them also here just so that you can be sure that you don't have any mistakes.

Don't change them only this level but change them also inside. This is a mistake that I have done and I don't want you to do it so be careful with it. I will see you in the next video.
