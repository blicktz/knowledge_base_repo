Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about the Black Friday which is actually coming so I'm going to analyze all of the strategies that I'm going to use and how and when. First of all we will talk a little bit about theory and then I'm going to take you to my PC to show you the journey of Black Friday because as we say a lot of times in this channel it's better for you to know where you want to go but if you haven't seen it it's much more difficult to visualize it so this is what we're going to do so let's go straight away to theory. In my recent visit to the Meta headquarters I have listened to one thing that I haven't realized on my own and sometimes when you talk with experts and stuff you get this kind of epiphanies and basically Black Friday if you think of it and this was coming from Meta so that they can convince you to spend more money and stuff Black Friday is a period that it's a very good initiation for brands to actually take new clients because for example the example that I used also in my last podcast is that when you are buying from somewhere for example underwears okay you are buying the whole year you know that it fits you well that it's good and stuff the quality everything so you buy you like the price so you buy buy buy the whole year and then you see in Black Friday you see just another ad with a very good similar product you like the marketing you like everything you like the price and you like the offer of course because Black Friday so in Black Friday you are more keen to actually try a new brand or something else that you haven't tried before that being said it's a very good thing because you are having new promotions that they're all around and you're going as a customer you're going to buy this and that and that that you have never bought during the whole previous year so maybe you're going to try it you're going to like and you're going to buy again and again and again so Black Friday is not only about the volume that we're getting from existing customers it's also about the volume that we're getting from people that they don't know our brand but they're going to be introduced to our brand and maybe they're going to continue buying increasing the lifetime value of our customers and our average order value for any of you that you are thinking that okay Black Friday is coming I'm going to launch some ads on Friday and then on Cyber Monday on Monday or keep them during the weekend you're actually wrong Black Friday is all about preparing and you know step by step building up in order to reach the Black Friday period and let me explain to you how that works I'm actually going to show you this build up also on PCs and how I'm building up now for some actually it's actually good because you're going to be able to see the previous year and now how I'm building up this year so it's it's a whole year journey so that you can understand how it works I have two ideal brands that I can show you because I started with them on August on the previous August not this August in Black Friday you can scale that's for sure let me tell you that from my personal experience every year when I run ads I always have good results and I'm always thinking at the end of the Black Friday even if I'm tired or exhausted or whatever that I should have spent more I never had a Black Friday I hope this one is not going to be an exemption that I told to myself okay you spent enough enough it's not only that you are having the offer but the volume it's so big that you are even getting higher ROAS even when you are having very big promotions and we're going to talk about promotions in a little bit but first of all let's talk about the building of the ads in the building of the ads I would like to tell you that first of all if you're spending let's say 50k you cannot just spend 200k in Black Friday if you are not going to organize it what do I mean by that I do mean that you need to start scaling a little bit before Black Friday by just doing campaigns of course there are going to be evergreen campaigns not campaigns that are going to be dedicated to Black Friday so you're going to start new campaigns on the middle of October start of November middle of November and then you all of these campaigns are going to stay as evergreen why because we need to have a stronger base not necessarily stronger but a bigger base so that we're going to be able to scale and cover the volume that we want to actually have second thing these evergreen campaigns and Black Friday also I'm mentioning Black Friday as an attack period because Black Friday is an ideal period for you to actually increase the spend on your ads manager and try to maintain it there I'm going to show you in the pc how it works basically if you go from 100k to 200k then you can spend the whole other year 150k and eventually two three months later go again to 200k because you have scaled your ad account in other months that we don't have that Facebook is going to stop you and so on but it's very important for us in these periods to exploit that and try to scale as much as we can that being said you build these evergreen campaigns you let them run even if you're losing a little bit of money at the start of the month it's okay because you're going to be compensated you need the volume you need to increase the threshold of your account believe me i have done it successfully even if you're losing a little bit of money you keep the campaigns you don't just scale down just because a lot of people are running ads you're going to be compensated in the Black Friday period of course i don't understand that a lot of you you are not going to do it and you're going to be afraid but just keep the rule into your head that you need to scale before Black Friday in order to scale much more during Black Friday you need to have a base and the other thing that i want to mention is that these evergreen campaigns are going to stay there and they're going to be flooded with all of this data from Black Friday that means that you're going to have campaigns that they're going to become super powerful and you're not going to close them because they're not going to be designed with a special code or whatever for Black Friday and you're going to keep them also for a longer period as long as you can with good profitable laws because they're going to take so much data which is going to help them a lot actually in the optimization so so far we talked about what we do before the Black Friday let's talk about Black Friday a lot of times i see people that they do the mistake and they do their ads during the Friday and or on Monday i totally disagree with that i think that you need to have campaigns that you're building eventually reaching the Black Friday scaling a lot and what do i mean by that there are a lot of companies that they do early access on Black Friday the reason is technical the reason is that you need to have some days with your ads and you cannot just start them on Friday with all the CPMs on that day you need to have campaigns that they have some data and they enter the Black Friday with some data that being said what i propose to all of my clients and what i do these years is that i have a promo code or a promotion which is Black Friday Cyber Monday they go together and we start on Monday Tuesday as an early open to Black Friday and we advertise up to Monday some people do an extent to Tuesday or Wednesday that being said you have a whole week you start the campaign for example for 100 or 500 or 1000 or 2000 doesn't matter it depends on your ad account you spend and every day you see the results and you spend more and more and more you increase the budget all the time it's completely unconventional to what i'm teaching to the channel but believe me what you when you're having for example a 500 campaign and you are getting when you're breaking when it was two you're getting three the first day do it 1000 the next day 1500 the next day 2000 the next day 3000 when you reach the Friday for example you do a much bigger thing on Saturday it's going to drop a little bit on Saturday it's going to be fine and on Monday increase it a little bit more so you are having all of that which is one campaign or two or three or five campaigns you start them earlier as an early access and you build them up to the point that you put a crazy budget for Friday if you see that you are having good results on these campaigns so before we go into my pc and visualize this a little bit let's talk a little bit about the offer we talked so far about how you build it how you manage it during the black friday period the evergreen campaigns that you're going to keep after the black friday period and now let's talk a little bit about the offer the offer a lot of times i see owners that they don't want to go an extra step further don't be afraid of your profits the volume is going to cover it i have sites for example that we do to and don't compare it with other periods i have sites that they do for example 20 off and they're getting 2.5 ROAS but when they do 40 off on black friday which they do it only once per year and the reason is obvious because only on black friday they can have good results with 40 off they have 3.5 ROAS the volume is going to cover it so you need to have an offer which is going to look good people are expecting from the black friday to see a good offer or something that it looks like a good offer for example if we go to one famous company secret lab which is my chair okay secret lab is not giving 10 discount to the chairs because it's an expensive item instead of that they give a coupon code for black friday of 100 150 dollars off because this is what the people are going to see 100 dollars 150 dollars off if they see 10 they don't perceive it as a very big thing on another hand if we say for example a t-shirt and we give 50 off on a t-shirt of 25 dollars if you put a coupon code of 15 percent of 15 dollars off it doesn't look as good as it looks the 50 off do you understand basically you need to find the magic way of a deal that is going to look super good if and i do understand that not all of you you can give the offers that other people can but you have to understand that your offer has to look good okay it has to be buy two get one buy three get one free or having an offer of money when the percentage is very small because you have an expensive item or have a good percentage when you can actually afford it the other thing that that i want to mention is that to me this whole program is working very well i don't know if it's going to work this year we will know about it but i know that this has been working consistently in the previous years for example in the previous years there were people that they were just running ads on black friday and i came and i said to several people that we need to have a pre-lunch for example in order for us to be able to optimize the ads everything that we do it comes to technical for example why the evergreen campaigns the evergreen campaigns are there so that you can have a higher um spend um also even if you lose you're going to do you're going to be compensated and all of that you are stabilizing your ad account to higher spends in order for you to spend more in the next year which i'm going to show you in a little bit and also you're flooding these evergreen campaigns with results so that they can continue having results even after black friday because a lot of times people they do spend a lot and then they drop their spend hugely during the christmas period which is also something that we need to discuss i guess now that after that you need to have a promo for christmas but if you have correct evergreen campaigns it's not necessary because you're going to have the volume already coming from these evergreen campaigns that you didn't close because they were not just a black friday ad let's go on my pc let me show you the journey of two other accounts that i took the previous year and what i'm doing for this year and how i'm preparing them let's see how i scale some campaigns what am i doing right now in order to prepare myself for black friday guys i wish i could do this video also at the start of the month but it will be too late for you to see what to do i think that the period that i'm uploading this is ideal so that you can start of course i cannot do a black friday video on july to tell you to start scaling since that point but we were discussing this kind of things on my podcast so basically this brand i i was on board it on august i believe look it was spending just 32k with 14 rows break even rows on this account it's four the reason i'm mentioning break even rows is important because sometimes there are bad periods i have a case study which was earlier uh to this video uh but let's see what happened in black friday in september i scaled to 57 on october so it's the same pattern okay i'm scaling scaling so 30k 57k almost a double now 87k which is almost a triple from where from where i started and then on black friday period boom 132k getting another count from 20k 30k to 130k on the black friday it's super important getting another count from 150k which is this to 500k it's also a different level of difficulty and so on so after that of course on december we're dropping a little bit because it's black friday okay but we try to go back to our numbers on the black friday as soon as we can okay and i don't know when i managed to do that here 100k on january on february uh 136k so after uh december uh january february on february i was already on my previous spend on black friday and then we go on march here we try to maintain for some months 157 okay on april 133 you see i'm trying to maintain always my black friday number here this is my magical number 151 on may and now from now on and later i'm starting scaling slowly here look at this don't forget four roas break even okay if we see here we can see that we have 6.34 on 151 i'm scaling on may and i'm not doing that well i'm having 167 i'm holding my number over here to july to scale even more to 178 by just increasing again uh roas and then on august i'm doing a big boost to 226k 5.59 and now this month so far guys what i'm doing is 5.3 256 now this month i'm going for 290k because i'm going for 290k um this is what i'm trying to explain i'm setting up a strong foot to spend 500k now why 500k because this is what i'm the feeling that i'm getting from the other account that i can reach it there from my experience in the previous one i was spending uh 90k and i went to 130k maybe i should have scaled more who knows nobody knows but right now that i know the account better i can tell you that i'm reaching it to 300k this month because we have some days left and this is spending 11 or 12k per day and that being said i'm going to reach 290k so 300k 350k or more during october and then i will go for another 150k spend with the extra campaigns that i told you from october from november start and mid and then doing the black friday ads and so on this is the strategy that you need to use and this is how you need to build it now this year was ideal because we had a very good uh july and august which helped a lot of businesses to scale if you didn't uh follow uh that and you didn't scale that's a problem you are going to do less revenue during block friday if you scaled and you ruined all of your results which is something that i have seen a lot because september didn't start so well that's a big issue and just to give you a clear perspective over here the same way that i'm keeping of course with some management okay uh not may uh it was june i believe the same way that june for example was difficult for me with 4.3 167 but i hold it and the next month i actually won the same way on september i can tell you that i was having some difficulties here at the start of the month it's 4.93 but i'm guessing that there was a bit period back period here yeah or here let me see yeah you see here i'm close to the break even and it's actually from 8 to 16 okay let me just try to increase it a little bit to see the whole period that was bad no it's not this one this is the worst period september 8 to september 17 most probably most of you if you see it on your ad accounts you will see this is the period guys and this is the reason that you need experts first of all in order for you to not be afraid from a 4.07 because here don't forget that i'm scaling hard i'm going on the previous month from 126 to almost 300k and if you haven't done it in the past it's going to be a huge issue for you in order to actually be able to hold and here i was holding because i knew that it was i didn't know it but i could feel it i i don't know sometimes it's intuition over here i hold it and now i'm getting compensated for that in the past days with 6.44 this is what is happening with facebook it's going to be bad periods bad weeks and stuff you should not ruin all of your progress just because of that because now i'm going in a very strong position as we said also in the podcast it's not only about the amount of money that you spend but it's also the amount of money that you are you're stopping your competition of spending so the more that i scale the more all of these people that they didn't that they were not experienced enough in this bad period because it's a bad period for everyone okay not just for me and they lower their spends i was able to actually take their market by spending more this is what is happening in the past months i'm taking more the market and i'm more aggressive and i know because funny story is that for this specific brand one of their competitors reached out to me without knowing that i'm doing the ads for them they told me that they do for example three rows with spending 100k and i knew that i was doing much better with much higher spend which is very good because you know i know that i'm just the leader over there spending in this specific niche a lot of money in these specific products and so on this niche is the interior design of course there are bigger spenders that they have more products like furniture and stuff but in these specific specific and direct competitors i'm the one which is spending the most on the market right now and i know that for sure because it's also verified by meta who has done a research between the competition that we gave and they told us that we are the bigger spender because they didn't tell us how much the others spend and given the fact that the other competitor which reached out to me and i i didn't work with them because i told them that i'm working already with this company they were spending 100k with actually three ROAS that's it this is how you need to approach it so in this other account as i said this month so far 256 290k going uh very strong don't get dazzled by the five ROAS the break even ROAS here is four okay we go for volume over here i'm going to make also a video about explaining why you should go for volume instead of going for only ROAS but in these high spends you cannot just go only for ROAS of course they are super profitable because it's not only the facebook it's also all of all of facebook traffic that goes and the email lists are growing every day and every day but as i said the most important is that the competition is dying because of me so guys another account this is in united kingdom again there was a case study about this one break even ROAS here four and this is what i want to show you because you might say in the previous case yeah but you were having four ROAS this is why you kept it at least you were not losing money here i was losing money okay so from 8 to 17 what a coincidence right 8 to 17 again here is a bad period in united kingdom the other one united states as i said facebook has bad periods and it's bad for everyone i can understand it the amount of consulting calls that i did this month september based on the amount of consulting calls that i did on july which everything was doing well it's not comparing let's say it's a ratio 1 to 25 something like that okay i did 25 consulting calls this month alone and i did just one on july because and this one was about scaling i do understand that there are bad periods from that i do understand it across my accounts i do understand it by talking with friends the point is what you're doing in those and how you're going to overcome your fear of course this is not my own money so i can be subjective to it but at the end of the day this is what i'm getting paid for you need someone who has the to keep the account in a good shape while everything is collapsing around you we are going to come here but let's see the journey of this ad account as i said in the previous case study this other account was spending 7k again similar ROAS but i think i came on september on this one yeah 7k here spent and then october 11k spent november i don't think i had enough time to go and do something crazy here just 20k and then we go december 27k january 46k february so here it's not a scaling during black friday but i'm going to scale on this black friday the problem always with this ad account is that i they were not letting me to go past the 100k because they had some stock issues that they could uncover the demand and they didn't expect that they could scale that much um i believe they gave me the green light in uh in june i believe no in june still i'm doing that in july yeah in july boom 160k just maintaining the same ROAS that's that's crazy right it's not even happening um most of you that you come to me and you ask me to work on your other account if you tell me to go from 80k to 160k by maintaining the same ROAS i would i would tell you that you are crazy but it happened here it can happen 169k five ROAS and then we go on this month and why i'm showing you this ad account it's very important 4.67 ROAS 145.

i want to spend almost over here 160k 170k because i want to maintain a budget for the next month to go to 250k if possible and then next month go on black friday between not 250k 200k let's say on october and then go for 200 to 300k on a black friday period this ad account hasn't scaled to big numbers in the previous year and um the amount so it started having these high numbers on july um we have july august and now september we can see some resistance so i don't feel like it's the most ideal case scenario here for another account to go super strong like the other one which was built up in the whole year to reach that point to spend half a meal uh on black friday so over here what is important that 160k is there i'm going to maintain it i'm going to try to take it to 200k in the next month and try to do the best that i can on black friday so that the next year i'm going to do my circle and reach the point spending of half a million in the next black friday but the most important again is to maintain your position bad period guys are going to be always here here you can see that the situation was really bad 3.4 in order for me to overcome it i organized the promotion with the owner which worked pretty well and now in the whole month the whole account is recovering just to keep it under perspective this ad account over here it has spent so far from august um 1 million okay with 6.3 million so even if we have some bad months like having 4.5 4.2 on the average the results that we're getting here is 1 million with 6 ROAS which is 2.2 ROAS uh 6.22 2.22 ROAS above the break even which is actually very good and if we go on this at the count we can see that the results are even more crazy uh if we go from august until the september right now we can see that we spend almost 2 million uh with having 6 ROAS average and here you can see that we had some bad months with 5 ROAS 4 ROAS but being consistent there and just keeping your spend and and maintaining and going so the thing is this whenever facebook is not giving you the opportunity you stay there you stay cool maybe you lower a little bit your budget but you try to maintain whenever it's giving you the opportunity like black friday july which was very good month august you are pushing super hard and you are trying to get the best possible results that you can in order for you to try to maintain that after that point and then push again maintain that push again because it's about the fear that some people are going to have and they're going to stop their ads and you need to cover this market by just taking the spend if you do this consistently and if you have good numbers so that you can have a margin of playing between profitability and break even then you're going to be able to scale your ad accounts to a whole new level so that's all i had for black friday guys i hope you will have an amazing black friday i'm sure that i will i will try at least i hope that everything is going to go smoothly i wish you all good profits and until we meet again don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book my free course my paid course my website and until we meet again guys be creative and be consistent
