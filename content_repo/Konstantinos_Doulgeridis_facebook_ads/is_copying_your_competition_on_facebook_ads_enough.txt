Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about the subject that I have seen recently in Appwork. Should you copy your competition or not? First of all, let's start with the messages that I have seen.

Need a Facebook Ads expert to target an ad to the audience of a specific Facebook page. And the next one is, hello Facebook Ads expert, kindly read the entire post then apply I guess it says. I have set up a Shopify store for jewelry, Facebook ad account is also set up and running, I'm not getting enough sales and conversions, my cost per click, cost per thousand impression CPM and cost per result is appearing too much high.

I need someone who can look on my Facebook ad account and recommend changes or can create a new campaign there which can deliver results. Read note that there is no problem in products, my competitor is already selling same products, Shopify theme it is paid and same like my competitor, ad copy, those are winning ads from my competitor. So I'm sure that there is nothing wrong with above all, I'm only lacking in optimization of the Facebook Ads, right Shopify on top of your proposal, blah blah.

I'm not sure about the budget for this job so kindly quote your prices, it could be tempted to a long term, please attach screenshots, this job is not for beginners, I'm only looking for experts. Let's analyze all of that. So first of all, a little bit of general context, a lot of times and there's nothing wrong with it, there are people that they are just not thinking of genuine ideas, they just go and they copy others and they think that they can do it better or whatever, it doesn't matter.

I can tell you that it's working, it doesn't work with everyone but a lot of times I can see people that they do it and it's working. So there's nothing wrong with that because at the end of the day we have also the ad library from Facebook, you can check the creatives that somebody else is using. The point is can you do it better than them?

There you go, we live in a capitalism world and it's all fine. But there are some things that we need to discuss when it comes to Facebook because people think that if they copy everything and they just go they're going to have this kind of results since day one. First of all, about this comment, you cannot go and you cannot take the fan base of someone else into your Facebook page just because you want to.

It's not possible. The fan bases are being built by spending time, money, effort and doing branding and you cannot just go and you can just target this page unless if it's a huge page like Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana over there, whatever that may be, which they can be listed as an interest. If you have a page which is having 10 000, 20 000, 50 000, 100 000 people, most probably you are not going to be able to target them.

The other post that we can see over here, it has a person that doesn't understand how Facebook works and this is why I created this video. You might have one website that's working perfectly, you might go and take the same items in the same template and you run the same ads and it's not going to work. Let me tell you why.

They have a pixel and the pixel maybe it's being built with strong years of effort and so on in another period that it was working better but just because you copied everything it doesn't mean that it's going to work for you. Okay, if it was that easy there were going to be automated bots that they were going to do exactly the same thing, copying everything and then just running them and having a lot of sites working. You need to put your personal touch.

It's not bad to look at your competition of what they do, it's very bad when you copy 100% of what they do and this is what we have in this case. It's not going to work for you. Let me tell you why.

You don't know what they're doing. You don't know if they're doing influencer marketing. You don't know if they're doing other things like Google Ads.

You don't know if they're having a brand ambassador program. You don't know. You don't know how they build up the pixel.

They have already built up the pixel. When you try to sell the same product and they have already been in the business for a long period spending 100,000, 200,000 per month, who are you that you're going to go there and just take this market. They are not going to let you.

They have already established their place into the market. It's not bad to copy your competition. It's bad to copy them 100%.

And in this case, we can see that we have the same ads or maybe similar. And by the way, similar ads doesn't mean that they're going to work as their ads. Maybe their ads, the way that they're made, it's working very well.

And you doing similar ads doesn't mean that necessarily, it's going to work. Another thing which I want to point out. You have a lot of times people saying that I have the product X and this person is doing 500k per month with this product and I'm putting it on my side and it's not working.

Of course, because maybe this person is selling it with another way, with other creatives, with another landing page. And maybe they have a pixel which is strange selling this product while you have nothing. It's very good to look for inspiration because I don't believe there are genuine thoughts.

But most of the times when we think something, most probably, this is what I always think, okay, that I'm not the smartest person on the earth. Even for the crazy method, I don't think that I'm the only one using it. You're not the smartest person on the earth.

Most probably someone else have thought it, have thought about it. And you are one of them that you are using it also. So I don't believe that I'm the only one who's using the crazy method or I'm the only one who thought it first or whatever that may be.

I always think like that and this has helped me a lot into my life because I'm not delusional. Thinking that you will go and you will copy everything, it reminds me on my first steps on e-commerce that I thought that I would go and just take Disney products and try to sell them, for example, without understanding that it falls under the copyright section or whatever. So don't be naive.

Try to copy your competition and take inspiration out of them. But don't try to copy them 100% because it's not going to work. Not just because it's unethical.

Don't care about that. But care about the technical side. The pixel, it's not the same.

The landing pages and stuff, even if they are the same, it doesn't mean that they are using them in the way that you are using them. Maybe they are using them with more brand ambassadors and stuff and they are working and you're trying to make it work with Facebook. If you don't have inside information about these things, you're just speculating things and maybe it's wrong.

Also, the tools that you might use in order to understand how much they are doing or whatever, let me tell you that they are wrong because I have been to brands that I have seen what they were spending with SMRush, for example, and the truth wasn't that. Okay? It's like the tools that they show you how much you make on YouTube.

Let me tell you that they are not accurate. That's all I had for you. I hope that it's going to help you not to just steal ideas but just try to take ideas and make them better.

And don't forget that if you want to learn more, you can check my book, my website and my course. And until we meet again, guys, be creative, take some of these examples and be consistent.
