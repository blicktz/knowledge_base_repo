Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss why working with average results in an ad account in the same way that we're working with average results in a CBO and in the way that we teach CBO optimization, it's really really important. One of the most crucial mistakes that I see when people are trying to scale, they are trying to see each campaign individually and they are not watching the whole ad account as a whole. Okay, if you're here guys and you are just another person that is doing consolidation and all of that, this is not a video for you because here in this channel we're teaching how to scale with multiple campaigns and treat all of them as in one living organism.

A little bit of theory and then we're going to go into my PC where I'm going to show you some big ad accounts and how we operate there because as you can understand in smaller accounts it doesn't matter if you have one or two campaigns, you have to treat them individually and see if they're working or not. But later on when you are stacking a lot of campaigns when you're having like 10, 20 campaigns and of course the reason that we have so many campaigns is not because they are the same, it's because we're just using different creatives, we're targeting different countries, different products over there and we are just working on all of this with an average result which makes sense. If you go and this is the mistake that I see and you touch one campaign just because you don't like the ROAS then you're just creating one gap that you have to fill with something else and eventually you're not able to scale.

I have scaled ad accounts to millions per month on spend and I can tell you that in order for you to do so you need to be a little bit more flexible on that and not just be the person that is watching oh look at this ad set over there it's bad, look at this campaign over there it's bad. You cannot have a perfect image into your ad account. Some campaigns and some ad sets like what we have in CBO campaigns they're going to have better results and some are not.

Some are going to be the volume and they're going to bring you volume of sales and some are going to be the quality and you're going to get better ROAS out of them. What you need to understand is that Meta is not a platform which is all about ROAS, it's a platform which is all about growth and scaling and over there in order for you to be able to do that you need to work with average results, seeing the average results, operating and taking decisions based on the average results so that you are going to be able to scale eventually. So let's go into my PC, I'm going to show you three, four ad accounts and how they operate with average results so that you can understand it visually and let's go.

Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website you are going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have, you can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So let's start from this ad account. This is another account which is operating with 3.5 ROAS, we're on 4.42 and from the start of the year until now we have spent 1.7 million, it's operating on the United States, you know this ad account, you have seen it several times.

We are having some campaigns like this one for example okay, this one is operating with 3.11. I'm not going to close it. Let's go on another campaign, not this one obviously because I closed it but this campaign for example or this, let me show you actually what I mean in the last 14 days let's say.

If we come here on the last 14 days we are having 5 ROAS okay, but here you can see and this is the mistake that most people were going to do. This campaign over here 2.63, they were going to come and they were going to close it okay. 3.68, 3.22, 3.36, these are numbers below our 3.5 breakeven but it doesn't matter because what matters here is that we are having an average result here of all of these campaigns.

Some of those are going to give 6, some of those are going to give 7, some of those are going to give 3.5 or 3.1 or 2.6. It doesn't matter because after the point that you're doing several campaigns with different creatives and all of the things that we're discussing, what we are having over here is just a number of campaigns over here that they are working with an average result which is what we get. If we don't operate like this, what is going to happen is that we are going to end up losing on spend.

Yes, the ROAS is going to improve because you're going to leave only the good campaigns over here but it's going to hurt you a lot in terms of the spend that you have. If you're the type of person that you want to just do Facebook ads in order to hunt ROAS, be my guest and do the smallest spend that you want with the ROAS that you actually want. I'm pretty sure that in this account if I just spent 1k per day only, most probably I'm going to have 10 or 20 ROAS.

But for how long is it going to stay like this? Where is the growth? Where is everything?

So this is a company that started by spending 20k per month and now we are operating just because we have done all of that and worked. I have done all of that and work like this. No, we.

There is a team also behind that is doing creatives, email marketing, SMS. It's a total effort. We have all of this growth which then is helping us go another step further, another step further, another step further.

So another account. This account is operating with 1.5 per Kiver ROAS. We are having a lower spend over here compared to the other one.

We're having 2.10 and as you can see here I'm having 1.71, 1.06. This is a new campaign actually. Let's go a little bit and see what's happening this month in total so far.

1.88 okay and we're on the uptrend. So let's see what kind of campaigns we had running over here. This first campaign is a big gap and then we have other campaigns over here.

1.62, 1.32, 1.87 over here. All of these are campaigns that I was keeping over here and they helped me manage the whole account in order to be able to reach to my point of spending 100k plus for this month for this account. Of course, if I didn't have this campaign, this campaign, this campaign, these campaigns that they are actually having bad ROAS, I wasn't going to be able to spend this amount of money.

I was going to be able to have very much better ROAS. But does it matter? What do we want?

That's the big question. That we have here. Let's go in another account, which I think it's in the same area, but has higher ROAS.

Okay, let's see on this account. This account is having 4.06. In the previous month in April, we have spent 135k pounds.

It's in United Kingdom. So that you are not going to say that I'm showing also USA accounts. And in this account, guys, you can see that we are having bad campaigns over here and other campaigns with 3, other campaigns with 4, other campaigns with 6 and 5 and all of that.

This is how you are scaling ad accounts. And this is how you are able to actually spend more. And this is why a lot of people are failing and they are not scaling because either they work just with one campaign and they just shuffle inside new creatives all the time.

Or the other thing, which is a mistake that they are actually doing, is that they touch individually each campaign just because they think that they are magicians and they can fix everything. You need to have a more holistic way of working by just working with average results. Let me show you one really big ad account.

Just a second. So last month on this ad account, 3.5 million spent over here. 1.87.

Break-even ROAS 1.35. We are having over here a situation that 1.63, 0.68 over here. We want to be always close to 2 ROAS.

That's the truth. But whenever we're on 2 ROAS, we're trying to push more. 0.6 over here.

So this month on May, we have 1.9 ROAS, almost 2.5 million as you can see. And we're operating again with average results. 0.73 over here, 1.6.

Some of those are giving us 3. You can see 1.3, 1.20, 168K spent. It doesn't matter guys, because over here, we do operate with average results as I showed you in the other accounts.

And at the end of the day, the point is spent and having the ROAS that they want. Not only within the Ads Manager, but also in reality. Okay.

Because here we are validating the numbers that we get also in reality. And we are seeing if we get 1.8, what kind of ROAS do we get? In reality, outside we get 2.2 ROAS.

So it's fine. So this is also another thing that you have to do to watch what you're getting inside, but what you're getting also in reality, because the ROAS that you see here, they are never accurate to that level. I hope that this is going to help you.

You're going to understand it more. It's the same principle as the one that we have with CBO campaigns and optimizing with average results. And I hope that you're going to start doing it.

I have more videos, but today I want you to make a video with several big spend accounts so that you can understand that if you don't do that, you will never be able to scale because you are always going to be shooting your feet because you are removing one campaign. You are removing another campaign and this thing was going to happen again and again and again. I hope guys that this video is going to help you.

And I hope that this kind of content is actually helping you because this is what I do and this is what is helping me to scale. This is a theory which is coming basically out of the CBO campaigns and the way that I was operating there. So after me doing many campaigns, I started operating in the same way, working with average results.

So it's something that came out of the CBO optimization and I started implementing it on the account level because it made sense the more campaigns I was actually doing. Don't forget guys, that if you want to learn more, you can check my book, my course, my website, and of course, my mentorship problems. And until we meet again guys, be creative and be consistent.
