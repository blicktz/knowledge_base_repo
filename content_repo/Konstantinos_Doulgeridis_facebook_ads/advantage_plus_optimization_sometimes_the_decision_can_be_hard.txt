Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk once more for Advantage Plus and optimization. I have one very good example and I want to show you why it needs some extra guts in order to optimize them properly. There's no point to do an introduction or anything like what I'm doing now is not an introduction but anyway let's go straight to my PC and show you this not case study but this example that I found maybe it's going to help a lot of you that you're afraid to actually be able to optimize them properly.

So we know that Facebook Advantage Plus campaigns most of the times they focus to one ad as the leading ad and this is the one that you need to manage in order for you to have profitable campaigns or not. Let me show you what happened in this campaign so that we can understand. Here we can see that out of the money that is spending between 2022 and 26 December you can see that we have 2.15 ROAS over here and while it's doing that it's spending all the amount of money with 2.4k spent and the others have just spent a small fraction.

Now as you can see this ad is closed so most probably you have to be prepared for what happened later. After that point and let's start seeing so from 23 to 27 1.89 it's dropping still I'm good on the average I'm not touching it 24 to 28 2.12 1.8 we can see that and you can see that it's coming to the point that it's spending 3k alone and the others are not spending this amount of money not even close to. Then we go from 25 to the first 1.82 2.04 it starts dropping okay and this one's spending more it's taking more time.

Then we can go from 26 to 2.85 2.07 still I'm fine it's profitable for me it's above 2 ROAS for this account this is what we want to get 27 to 3 1.43 not 43 73 1.91 with 4k spent this is the point that I start to feel like this big spender it's actually causing me issues 28 to 4th 1.62 on my leading ad 1.78 then if we go from the point of going from 1 to 5th 1.43 1.56 so it's dropping day by day and this is the point that most people would face what they would do is that they wouldn't have the guts of actually closing the leading ad and what they have done is that I have closed the leading ad and I said okay I'm having all the other ads that they can actually start optimizing it I believe that they closed it at that point maybe on the 5th 5th it doesn't have so much spent so I guess it's 6th 6th it doesn't have so much spent so at that point I started limiting it 1.83 let's see when I close it this is the point that I closed because it spends only 53 that means that I closed it on the 7th now if we watch from here to here for example we can see that the ROAS is 1 on 1.85 clearly our big problem over here is the 1.48 with being the leading ad and spending so much money the first thing for first of all that they have done in this situation is because I didn't want to lose my leading ad immediately I thought that if I lower the budget from 1000 per day to 800 which is what happened I'm going to be able to actually help it recover it didn't happen but what happened in this situation is that it started spending also on other ads without me doing anything to this one now if we watch on the last seven days we're again on the green area and now we have find a new leading ad which is this one okay and as you can see it's again on 1.69 but I don't care because these ads at the ad number five it was actually stealing all of the sales from the others because it was taking all the budget now what happened is that this one is taking a lot of the budget but it's giving also budget to the others and they are actually having sales so in the average I'm fine I don't care if it has 1.69 I'm not going to disturb this balance until I see it failing again and again so if we come here we can see 2.04 everything did moved well after that 2.13 so and you can see that in the last days it has a tendency of dropping so maybe I will have to fix this campaign again yeah it actually does yeah 1.69 when you see your leading card not working and you have a lot of other ads that they are going to be able to follow they show you that they have some sales even with small spend it's okay just abandon it don't expect it to be fixed because it's not going to be fixed no matter how long you're going to leave it there this is the situation over here this is what I wanted to show you that sometimes it takes guts to close your leading card because a lot of times some people feel like they're going to lose the whole campaign but this is not the case of course this is a trained account with a trained pixel and it's behaving in a different way but even if it's going to fail don't forget that you can relance your campaign and optimizing it all over again even with this ad inside if you fail the second time because this ad is getting again all the budget without the rows that you want remove it and relance the campaign with all of the other ads there are solutions over there you just have to be a little bit creative and not get disappointed or super frustrated or have the hope to leave it for a longer period so that it's going to work no you have to intervene you have to do whatever you have to do in order to make it work I hope that this example is going to help you understand a little bit more about how we optimize advantage plus campaigns I know that there are another 1 million cases of advantage plus campaigns and how we optimize them sadly I cannot make videos for each one of these different cases but whenever I see something that it looks interesting in my other accounts I'm trying to make a video so that I can give it to you and maybe it's going to help some people so that's all I had as I said in my last podcast and in previous videos most probably I'm going to create a whole video about advantage plus you can check my book or my free course and don't forget that I also have my paid course and my website that you can check everything and until we meet again guys be creative don't be afraid the advantage plus and optimize them properly and be consistent
