Hello Facebook Catch people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about problematic ad accounts. Is it your false, your strategy, the targeting or is it the numbers of the company? A lot of times people say that I do focus more on scaling and all of that.

I don't agree with that, I have a lot of videos with new pixels. You just have to understand that it's not really interesting for me to take every single person that comes and gives me an ad account with zero sales and all of that. It's easier for me to work and scale ad accounts with my knowledge instead of trying to solve 1 million problems that a new company has and they need a CEO not a guy who's doing Facebook ads.

I have access to some ad accounts which are problematic and I would like to show you that sometimes people feel like it's the targeting or something else but it's the number of the company. I will show you my thought process behind it and how you can spot if this is a problem and maybe it's going to help you with two ad accounts. Even in an ad account that now it's profitable, I'm still not happy with the things that I'm seeing and the numbers there and let's go into my pc and let me show you what I'm seeing, what is worrying me, how I interpret it so that you can also know if it's a problem of strategy or if it's a problem of the numbers of the company, the offer, the landing page, whatever that might be.

Hi guys, I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website, you're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have, you can find the one that's going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. So I'm going to start with an ad account which is having a problem but not in the strategy okay and I will explain you my whole thought process behind it and everything and you can have your own conclusions with it okay. So this one on March it was having just the cost per purchase of with a small spend of 295 and before that I think it wasn't spending yeah it wasn't spending and if we go on April still I'm not running that account here 195 they're doing a lot of stupid things here I'm coming I'm improving the results but still we're far away from where it has to be and let's start analyzing now okay so at the best I'm hitting 88 over here cost per purchase which is 0.49.

I'm testing different things all of this period from broad to interest lookalikes lookalikes with interest the blender method which I'm doing when I'm desperate and in problematic ad accounts it's giving me a little bit better results but still it's not enough and after that point you're saying I'm trying everything all the best practices and everything that they work across accounts am I doing something wrong let me start analyzing my numbers first of all and this is this is for you to understand if in reality you have a problem in your funnel or in the strategy because it's very important for you to have to be realistic of what you're expecting from Facebook so here we have a pixel which is not trained are we expecting from this pixel to get trained and go from 0.5 to 2 rows the answer is no if you want to go from 1.7 and train the pixel and go to 2 rows it's going to happen now first of all we see a very high cpm it could be an indication of of having a pixel which is untrained which we know it's untrained and we try to train it of course we know that from the broad targeting and the results we get from road against interest and stuff but for sure I can tell you that I have tried a lot of interest and stuff it's not going to be don't expect the magic interest to come here and give you cpm of 30 dollars for example okay it's not going to happen give or take all the interests they are communicating with each other so you're going to get kind of the same results some of those are going to be better but it's not going to be one interest which is going to give you crazy good results it doesn't go like this let's start spotting the problems problem number one we are having 88 over here which is something that we have seen in other accounts but the rows over here 0.49 this is a red flag for AOV what's the AOV over here 32 43 40 which means that immediately if we can take this to go to 100 so three times more this one would be 1.5 ROAS now you can tell me how do you do that I'm not an expert on increasing the AOV or fixing funnels but I'm an expert on telling you that nobody invited you to advertise here if you want to have numbers that make sense you need to have friendly numbers also as a company and right now advertising with 40 or 30 AOV in this specific niche and stuff it's not going to work okay so you need to have higher AOV over here in order for you to have better numbers if you make it for example an easy fix to go to two ROAS that this company wants and it's not getting and it will not get with the current situation no matter what it's increasing the AOV for example four times problem solved okay easy to say it difficult to do but you get my point another thing which I'm spotting over here if you come and you see you're going to see that we have 508 136 this is one every 3.5 so 508 divided with 136 every 3.7 okay in this kind of prices and AOV we do see maximum with a conversion rate which means that we have a problem with the conversion rate also here we see maximum uh one to 2.5 every 2.5 checkouts one sale if we had this over here this would be on one ROAS plus already another problem that in order for you to be realistic let's say that you don't want to change anything in order for you to go to two ROAS over here you need to drop this to 22 okay because it's going to be 2 times 0.49 it's going to go to 1 and 2 times 1 it's going to go to two ROAS so you have to divide this two times 88 divided by 244 divided by 222 okay so this is when you're going to have two ROAS what do you think it's more possible to lower just because you need a magic targeting this number from 88 to 22 or to do other things in order to have friendly numbers and maybe get this one to 70 eventually with training pixel and stuff but also on 70 be profitable because you have fixed so many other things like AOV and conversion rate and let's go to the biggest not the biggest to another problem because this ad account doesn't have only one problem it has a lot of problems and it needs a whole re-evaluation of the numbers if we come here we are going to see that the CPM is not only high because of the untrained pixel but it's also high because of the bad creatives i'm not going to call them completely bad but but imagine that lowering this one to two while not even fixing the conversion rate and making it uh having the same conversion rate that would go immediately to one ROAS okay so this one has to drop below two which means that we need more creatives and all of that don't get uh really excited with the CTR because when you have high CPM you have high CTR why because with higher CPM you reach less people okay so if you if you reach 100 people five people to click which is five percent is very easy but if you have high lower CPM and you're reaching a lot of people five percent on one thousand people reach is much more difficult to be achieved but what we can do is to see those that they have similar CPM which ones are better creatives from the others for example this one look like looks like it's a better creative from the others at least in the percentage of people clicking it and it has a good cost per purchase over here is this a problem of the strategy here that we're not getting the two ROAS is it because we are targeting something wrong the answer is no i have showed you so many things from the AOV and all of the other stuff and the experience across accounts that they are working that here we have so many problems which is not the strategy or the targeting it's just the numbers of the company the funnel the offer the AOV all of these kind of things that if they are going to be improved and we keep the same structure over here then we're going to have good results in the platform so this is not the fault of the strategy this is a webcam call for the owner to understand that these numbers don't make sense and he has to fix them and just to prove my point let's go into this account to show you also this so what do we have here we have very high CPM as we said cost per unique click is really high okay but this company is happy if it gets 1.5 ROAS plus and i have campaigns that i have established that okay so uh if we see and let's see also even on the last 30 days 1.58 so i'm hitting the numbers that the company wants but how on the previous one we were having better numbers on the cost per purchase we were having lower CPM we were having lower cost per unique click yes but this company has a very big advantage which is the AOV so you see here that we have much more problematic numbers comparing to the previous ad account but it's working because they have focused a lot in the AOV let me see also the conversion rate conversion rate it's 90 checkouts 60 purchases it's not even uh one to two so over here what we have is good conversion rate we have a good AOV which is helping us to go close to the numbers that the company wants and then we're trying to see if we can improve improve on the previous one we had a problem everywhere so it's a completely different case are we happy with that no we have to improve to the creatives as you have seen with the cost per unique click we have a lot of things to do but we are profitable and we are improving in the previous one nothing is working and nothing is going to work because we have so many problems in everywhere conversion rate AOV and stuff at least here they have fixed the AOV in a way that it's going to be profitable so that we can improve in other places we're not happy with this one either but it's a completely different thing to try to scale improve or whatever instead of having something which is completely broken and try to fix it just because you targeted um one super magic internet store you use the super magic strategy no it's not going to if the numbers are not there and the funnel is not working it's not going to be profitable for you i hope that these visual examples are going to help you to understand if you are profitable or not because of your numbers or the strategy and everything and maybe a wake-up call for all the people that they have funnels and they don't know if it's their fault or they don't know if it's the strategy or the media buyer or whatever and that's all and i will see you for the closing of the video so there is not a magic interest which is going to come and it's going to help you and you're going to have instead of 0.5 ROAS seven ROAS or six ROAS this is it's not going to happen you need to improve numbers when you're when you're doing things that are working across at least on my side i know what is working and what doesn't work i'm doing it i'm getting some numbers these are the numbers that i get in order for me to improve there are several things from creatives to landing page aov and all the things that we discussed in the video you should not just be blaming that okay the targeting if we change it it's going to be fixed if you do that you just keep going to lose money money money in testing because you're going to be blind and you're not going to admit the reality that your offer your product all of that they have a problem don't forget guys that if you want to learn more you can check my book my course my website you can check of course my super new updated course that is coming you can check also my mentorship programs and below people that they have completed them and that dilute again guys be creative and be something
