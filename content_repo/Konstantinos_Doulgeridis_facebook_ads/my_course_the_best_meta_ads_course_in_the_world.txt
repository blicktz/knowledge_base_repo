Hello, Fizik Quest People! I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about my course, the best meta arts course in the world. I have released a podcast where I'm explaining in super detailed way all of the different chapters and stuff that you're going to find inside the course along with more information and stuff so please if you want to see a really more detailed version of it, go and watch the podcast 115.

I'm going to go and talk to you a little bit about the different chapters that we have inside. First of all I need to clarify that I have a free part that you can go and you can watch. In this free part I'm having one video that's all about numbers and how you can interpret if you're having good numbers or not and if you're missing on AOV, CPMs and stuff.

I have another one which is all about how Facebook optimization works which is a very basic thing theory. How to start with a new pixel because I believe a lot of people they need help and they buy a course because they have a new pixel. The crazy method of course in the thing the review cluster analysis which is helping you break down the daily loop theory with the help of AI and such CPT and I'm including also inside one Loom video with cost cap optimization and one Loom video with CBO and ASE optimization.

So in that way because I really believe that I have created the best Facebook ads course in the world you can go, you can check, you can understand it, you can feel how the whole course is going to be and you're going to take the decision if you want to buy it or not. If you don't at least you got some free value out of it. So the course is very big and it's being separated in different chapters.

The first chapter is going to be first of all it's about lead gen and tcom and I have videos at the beginning in the introduction explaining which kind of videos somebody who's going for lead generation has to see and somebody who goes for ecommerce has to see. Then we go into the first green chapter which is all about a little bit of introduction you know what is the iOS 14.5, what is the pixel, how can I understand if my pixel is trained or not. On top of that we have also the free video that I have included know your numbers or don't advertise at all with live examples of how an ad account should look and what kind of numbers you need to see CPM, AOV, conversion rate and all of that with live examples.

Don't forget that all the things that you're going to see in this course it's coming from my ad accounts live ad accounts that I'm using right now more than 30 I believe right now. I spend between 5 to 10 million most of the times closer to 10 million depending also on the cost caps which are part of my strategy and it's also things that I have learned with all of the different students that they have that they are high spending individuals along with my other freelancer friends and all of that. If we go to the red chapter we are going to deeper stuff more theory we go of course to things like how Facebook optimization works which is also included on the free part we have why you should start your ads at 6am why you have better results in the first 24-48 hours what is the statistical modeling why you should not exclude past customers this is a chapter which is mostly done with a whiteboard where I'm explaining things I'm showing you different things then we go to number three which is the orange chapter that we go now to our arsenal the different methods and the different things that we're going to use we have the crazy method stuck lookalikes blender method we have what is a CBO what is an AEC how we do optimize them but of course this is something that we will cover also on the Loom videos we have the rapid fire method flex bloods and if I'm using them and all of that we have the same tools and then after we know our tools that we're going to use and our arsenal our weapons then we go to chapter number four which is the blue chapter which is all about scaling I know all of us were discussing about scaling but how is it done the ad and how it works the Bell theory the concept of the learning phase the 20% the one campaign and if it works the daily loop theory different ways to break the daily loop theory with the help of AI like the review class and analysis and the pain point method working with average results in our account scaling with multiple countries how are you going to test understand if you are failing and where you can scale the Usain Bolt effect and so many other things that we have also seen in the channel over here but here you're going to see it in more detail with more ad accounts more live examples all of the things that I'm going to tell you I'm going to prove it to you on live ad accounts and this is the chapter that we are seeing how and why we're not scaling if we're not scaling or how we can scale even more the next chapter is going to be a little bit of a relaxing chapter with some things that I always wanted to say but I couldn't on my social media or whatever like insiders and uh many other things like shadowbans and stuff with proof and print screens I'm not going to continue you can see a little bit more I'm analyzing it on the podcast why payment failures are bad facebook representatives and what you should expect from them if I use automated rules the ad library incremental attribution and all of that so this is a chapter which is just a bridge because you know you're going to see many ad accounts you're going to see big spends you're going to see live ad accounts you're going to see live proof of what is working and what doesn't work but it's only going to be theory so we have to go to practice we're going to the purple one which is the introduction of course and then it goes to all the settings in one campaign so I create one campaign from the start to the finish campaign level asset level ad level insider all the different settings for example we discussed in the previous chapter uh why we are using seven days click one day view the attribution setting what is the attribution setting we have analyzed in the theory so now we're going to see where it is located why we use seven days click one day view and so on and when can we use one day click one day view and so on after we finish all that and we see also on the events manager what kind of setting we should see on the audiences other general settings how to set up your columns and analyze your results and everything we are going to go and to the next chapter which is all about looms i have several loom videos which are talking about asc cv optimization which is very difficult to master but i'm showing you 20 30 minutes some of them are bigger of how you can optimize with my ad accounts that i'm managing live with loom videos with different examples many examples and of course more than 10 videos on cost of bitcups with actual case studies of how i started what kind of bid i had how i increased my bid how i started spending more there is an asset inside in this that i have scaled and spent 350k spending 2k per day for example in just one asset with cost caps and bitcups and i think it's going to be really valuable for you because it's it's really rare to see on courses a lot of different other accounts with high spends and in all of these different accounts the different things that you're discussing and not only theory most of the people the only thing that they do practical is to create one campaign with you in the courses here we not we don't only create but we have loom videos of optimizing loom videos of doing campaigns loom videos of doing cost caps beat caps and loom videos explaining why something is working or doesn't work how we analyze results and everything on live ad accounts with big spends and with real knowledge of what is working and what doesn't work and not only theory last part as an extra i included inside chosen five sessions from people that they have trusted me with my mentorship programs and we have worked on their ad accounts and you can see their videos of me working with them one-on-one on their ad accounts each session is one hour it's 16 videos that i'm going to keep increasing as the time passes by and i will add more and we have a sneak peek into the inner circle one hour one call of the inner circle what we're discussing there a little bit of more uh inside uh info uh of how these mentorship programs are working and stuff and a lot of things that you can learn also from the case studies of my students or my fellow friend freelancers that they are inside the inner circle i guess that's all i have to tell you about the course it's a course that i'm really proud that i made it took more than six months on editing uh three months of video shooting it's huge i think that i overdid it and it should have been uh smaller but on the other hand is something that i'm proud of and it's the end of a very long road of me learning learning learning i feel that i'm in my prime and in the best possible time for me to create the best facebook ads course in the world for the past four years we're closing the videos with be creative and be consistent just for this one video we're going to say don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my course have a nice day
