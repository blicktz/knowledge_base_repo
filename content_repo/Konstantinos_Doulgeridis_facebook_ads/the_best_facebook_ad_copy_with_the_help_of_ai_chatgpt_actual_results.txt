Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to discuss about the AI that is going to make our lives easier because we can now generate copies for our Facebook Ads. So if you consider it actually the social media and Facebook and stuff it's 20 years old something like that which is actually nothing right and in all of these years it has evolved a lot more and more and more and the technology also and stuff. So now we have the AI we all hear about AI and stuff but when you actually work with AI you see and you you're actually mesmerized by the results that you are going to see.

So basically there is a new AI it's called ChatGPT yeah GPT it's called ChatGPT and basically it's an AI that is helping you to generate copies for emails for Facebook ads for whatever you might think of. It's actually we had AI's so it's not something that is actually new we had many programs that they were paid this is coming from OpenAI it's actually for free for now I guess so and the truth is that it's working much much much better than the others I'm going to go in a little bit on my pc to show you and play a little bit with it so that you can understand it but for sure if you don't have a copywriter I think that you should try to do it with this I have tested it I can tell you that it's winning in terms of results other copywriters and stuff I'm super happy with it I really like it am I going to fire my copywriting team no because I truly believe that the human factor is also important but what if the copywriters now are using this and then they adjust it to whatever they have to do in order to work properly in my opinion if you don't have the budget it's going to help you a lot to have copies good copies for your ads if you have the budget it's going to help your copywriters to have more ideas and so on so let me show you where you can find it how it's working it's very easy it's free first of all you go to openai slash blog slash chat gpt come here and you press try chat gpt it's going to ask you to create one account to openai which is going to be completely free so go and do it and then you're coming to this place over here as you can see it says we're experiencing exceptionally high demand a lot of people are actually know that and they are testing it and it's actually very good so let's discuss a little bit about the the way that this is working so let's say let's refresh it so that we can be sure and let's come here and let's say write a copy for a skin skincare brand we're waiting a little bit of course and you're going to see that it's going to start writing copy so the way that this is working is that it's it's looking on other advertisement it's going to search on different uh sites it's going to you know search all of this kind of stuff and as you can see it's writing already the copy but the point is not that it's writing the copy the copy of course it's good and everything the point is that you can play with it and let me show you what i mean by that okay so here you have your copy now you can say for example make it two paragraph long the brand brand should be appealing to people over 40 years old let's see what it's going to do so it starts writing let's see where it's going to mention about the 40 years old it says anti-aging which it didn't it it wasn't saying before perfect it talks about wrinkles reveals movement so it makes it like this now let's say that we want to make it more so let's say add more proof of concept to increase sales because now we have our thing and we can say okay add emojis add bullet points uh add more proof of concept most probably it's going to add some um let's say review or something like that let's see what it says okay so it's talking about the full refund we're going to remove this because we don't want it okay so we can say here remove the full refund and mention two five star reduce i press start so i don't know what this i don't know if it's going to understand it it's actually very funny because the more you play with it the more you understand that it understands even the mistakes that you're going to make on the text so it actually improved that okay oh it does it okay so it understood so it puts a view from sarah so it's like a view from sarah and another one from zon okay for example here you can say add reviews only from females because you have to give it all the parameters okay you have to tell it that it's a female brand you know you can make a very good explanation write a copy with bullet points emojis for example for a woman's skincare brand that it's more appealing to 40 years old and so on and so on now apart from that i'm going to play a little bit and for example make it to put some bullet points so that you can see how it works and add some emojis because i'm also i i really also like the fact that um so it removed the john and put now emily it's actually pretty fascinating right all the things that it's doing so here let's say that make it shorter and add some emojis let's see what it's going to do okay so it starts with an emoji the emojis that it's actually using it they're very good they're having some um i really like them i really like them in the way that it's it's using them this is a very good copy for facebook okay and now let's say for example make me five versions five different versions when you are ready and you want to have five different versions for all of your uh dynamic ads then it's going to create for you five actual different uh versions of all of it let's see if it's going to understand it i'm also curious okay so it's starting now it says number one and it's putting this one so let's see all the versions that's going to do number two okay so you get my point it's giving different versions of everything and stuff i think that for me the most important thing is to do the introduction of how it's working and explain a little bit of how it's working here but after that i think that you should go and you should play with it uh as i told you in the start of the video it's something that i really enjoy to do for example you can say here add emojis to text two and four so now it's going to add emojis only in text two and four it's actually like you're having a discussion with someone okay and you're telling them to do something for example example let's say that this is your employee and you're telling them i like the copies just do this there let's see if it's going to do it there you go you have immediately doing it for the text two and four it's going to add emojis on the text three it's not going to add an emoji on the text four it's going to so you're getting the point but now i'm going to reset it and i'm going to show you some other things that i find super interesting just you know just for fun okay so the next two or three minutes are not going to be about facebook ads but they're actually super interesting i will see you there so another thing that you can do is that if you if somebody made copies or you had copies from the past and everything you can give the copy over here for example this one and say make it better something like that okay or you can say rewrite it without emojis rewrite it with more emojis whatever you may think you can test it here and of course it's going to start producing now another text it's going to give it another so it's also it's also telling you to make this statement more informative and engaging you could try providing more details about the specific project services offered you could also highlight some of the unique features or benefits additionally you could include some enticing images or examples finally you could consider using more specific okay and what if we tell them okay make the changes let's see what it's going to do let's see if it's actually going to understand that we want the ai to do it oh it does it okay so it's actually pretty nice that you're having such a direct communication with it you know and it understands so it gave the suggestion and then you said okay do the changes i want to see okay another thing now that i find super interesting is this so let's say here that we say make blog news post two paragraph long about the war in ukraine so another thing that i find super interesting here is this that um and this is uh you know about watching blogs and stuff and reading the news sometimes we have the feeling that someone has the one side or the website and they're you know they're not subjective here we have the text over here we say the war in ukraine has been ongoing for several years with fighting so it's actually uh despite attempts at peace violence continues to flare up on eastern ukraine okay so now we say blame ukraine for the war and now it's going to rewrite the whole copy by blaming actually uh ukraine and what i found super interesting when i was playing with it is that i don't know if it's going to do it now because obviously it's not putting the same text it says russia has been accused of supporting the severance okay uh we can say here the thing i was watching that ukraine and airplane flight so the thing that i was watching the other time that i was seeing this is that basically what the ai did is that it found maybe another news thing and stuff and uh you see i put it i put it the that downtown airplane and find it immediately about the malaysia airlines flight 17 but on the other attempt that i was doing on that it was actually uh doing it uh on uh on its own uh which was uh pretty scary uh of how it can write and now you can say for example easily uh blame russia for example or whatever so you can make even uh blog posts and stuff why am i saying that i'm saying that i'm saying that because you can use this ai for example for your site in order to write all the copies for the about page and to write all the copies about the normal page explaining your brand and everything you can even do email sequences for example make an email sequence of three mails about selling marketing facebook ad services for example to e-commerce owners i'm not doing email marketing so you're not going to see this in the second mail mention case studies from previous clients okay let's see what it's going to do because here we are solving also the problem of sms of email marketing i'm talking about people who don't have the money to actually you see it starting immediately boost your e-commerce sales with facebook ads okay and it's writing so we are having this problem of people not having the budget you are having everything here it's for free okay here we go to the second email that it's actually talking about the case studies as you can understand i don't know i can keep doing this for hours so i'm not going to continue i'm just going to close this small session that i showed you how it's working uh with um uh with a funny thing which is uh actually it even writes poems or rap songs so we're going to write uh one rap song for constantinos the best facebook ads master and we're going to do it like this so write a rap song for constantinos the best facebook ads expert that's my alliance i've been in the game for quite some time helping businesses increase their relying sign and now it's going to create my song that i'm going to have uh and sing of course of course we are that idiots that we're going to sing it here so let's see let's see what it's going to write i think that this was the most difficult thing that we asked you to do okay it started i go by the name of constantinos
