Hello Facebook Ads people! I'm Kostantinos and today we are going to explain why dynamic creative ads are always better. If you have ever talked with Facebook Ads experts, you'll know that we are really careful about what we promise.

Facebook is an unstable platform and any professional marketer knows that. This doesn't mean that I have never seen freelancers promising results or even guaranteeing a specific ROAS. Well, they are either clueless or they can predict the future and to be honest with you, I tend to run away from people that claim that they can predict the future.

Why then did I make such a statement at the start of the video? Can I predict the future? Well, the answer is yes.

And let me tell you why. In 2030... And this is the point that we are actually going all of us to ride our unicorns and enter the spaceship, leaving this planet forever.

The actual reason that I made such a statement was not because I can predict the future, which is a fact, but due to the fact that I run ads every day and dynamic creative ads always beat any other form of ads. Okay, so now it's the time to jump on my computer. I would like to show you why dynamic creative ads are so powerful and let's see the reason behind my bold statement.

So, over here we can see one campaign. It's a brand, it's a clothing brand for small girls. Their profit margin is high because it's an apparel brand and their break-even ROAS is on 1.5.

They are always happy if we are above 2 ROAS. We can see that this campaign has served us well for months with 2.64 ROAS in total. 7.2K spent 19.1K on the revenue.

Most probably this campaign will start slowly to die, but at this point our job is done. So, let's see how I like to do campaigns. So, if we go here we can see that I like to do CPO.

Most probably this campaign started with a bigger budget, but I lowered it after I started closing some of the ads that were not working. And I'm left now with some ads that they're working after closing some that they didn't. Why have I closed this even if you see 6.38, 3.48?

I'm explaining more about it in my video about CPO and ABO campaigns. You can go and check it. Most probably there will be a link somewhere.

But other than that, we have also the attribution model which is giving sales even after we close an ad set. When I close the ad set, it was the right decision. Also keep in mind that we are closing an ad set in order to keep our profits, okay?

We don't want to reach the point that we are going to close an ad set when it's actually starts losing money. Because if we do that, then we are running a charity, okay? And we are not keeping the profits.

So, it's good to close an ad set when it has profits and always you have to watch the last 7 days. Maybe it's having 3 ROAS in total, but in the last 7 days it was having 1 ROAS. Which shows the tendency is to actually start losing money on this, so you close it in order to actually protect your profits.

But other than that, I like to have a lot of different interests in the CPO campaign and here very well hidden is this button. The dynamic creative button, okay? And let me tell you what this button is doing.

If we come here in our ad level, what is the traditional way that we are doing ads? We are actually having 1 ad set with several ads, okay? So if you have 4 ads, you are having 4 combinations, okay?

After that point we can put some more copy text and stuff. But other than that, the combinations are not that many. What if I could tell you that you can come here and you can use up to 10 videos or up to 10 images, up to 5 primary texts, as you can see, they are going to appear here and up to 5 headlines that are going to appear here.

And of course your link and different call to action. Like you can put shop now and learn more, okay? If you do that, you are having countless combinations.

And Facebook might end up picking video number 1 with primary text number 2 and with headline number 3. And another combination and another combination and another combination. Facebook is actually picking the best combinations based on engagement.

And the more engagement one of your combination gets, Facebook is spending more money on that. So, let's summarize. We are having CBO campaigns.

That means that we don't just leave our budget to be around a specific budget in each ad set, but we let Facebook decide how it's going to attribute this budget. Then, we are having a lot of ad sets. We are not spending our money in only one ad set.

We are attributing the budget between different options in the targeting and the interests. And then, we have dynamic creative ads, which is a very good combination because again, we are letting Facebook, the only thing that we trust is the algorithm of course. And we let the algorithm actually optimize with different options and create all of these combinations.

And this is a very good combo because at the end of the day, we leave nothing in luck. And even if something is not working, we can come after one day or two days and if it's spent more than that, you can see more of that in my CBO, VSABO campaign and how we optimize, we can close it and that's it. We can let Facebook to continue doing its job properly.

So, when it's going to work, it's going to be okay. If it's not going to work, we're going to close it. But we are actually segmenting our budget so much with different interests and also with different combinations in the creatives.

As I like to say, for me, I don't have a personal opinion when it comes to the creatives and the ads. I just run them and I see which one is working better and which one is not. And let me tell you also another thing which is very important with the dynamic creative ads.

We can come to these two that we can see that they have the most volume on the sales. And we can do even breakdown of results and we can break down by image. And we can see that the majority of the sales is coming from this video on both of the videos.

Is this by luck? Of course not. Facebook understood that this video is actually working very well.

And in both cases, you are going to see this also if you start running dynamic ads, you can see that optimized always this video. Why? Because it was working better.

Okay. And when you are doing campaigns with the traditional way and you are having four ads, you are just trying to, by luck, to put one of these options to work. Here Facebook is doing this job for you.

And we can see that Facebook decided immediately that this one is going to work. Some of the other videos they had also some sales, but it doesn't matter. We know our super winner over here which is that.

And then you can go back to your creative team and you can say, hey, this video has worked very well. Let's create similar content. Okay.

And you can do the same even with your text. Okay. We can see which one actually has worked better.

We can see that this text outperformed everything in both cases. With text, it's a little bit more evenly distributed. We can see which one actually has worked better.

And you can do exactly the same with the headlines. Okay. So this is why dynamic creative ads are very powerful.

You should start using them. You should start using your budget in a more clever way with CPO, segmentation and dynamic ads so that you can spend your money in the best possible way. And I'm sure that if you haven't run them, you should definitely try to.

And one small note, if you're having a local business and you want to do lead generation forms, they also work with lead generation forms and you should definitely try because this is also going to show you which one of your creatives is actually going to work better for them. for your offer. So definitely try them.

Let me know in the comments if you try them, what kind of results you had. And let's go back to wrap up this video. Well, this is what dynamic creative ads are.

And yes, they are super powerful. You can still see which combinations work the best with breakdown of results. But even if they are going to remove it again in the future for some time, like they did on June of 2021, there is a workaround and I have published a video which is called breakdown of results.

And you can see the solution there. The less risk you take with Facebook, the better. I suggest you to run your dynamic creative ads in CPO campaigns with several ad sets and interests and optimize them daily.

If you are not using them already, test them out. Do it! Just do it!

The best part about dynamic creative ads is that they are fast. And if you use many ad sets in a CPO, you can go ahead and optimize them after one day or two. Without having to wait for one to three days like you do with your casual ads.

The only disadvantage of dynamic creative ads is that you can't work on your ads in bulk. When you duplicate a campaign, you will have to edit one by one all of your ads, which is kind of annoying and actually time consuming. In any case, that's all I had for you about the dynamic creative ads.
