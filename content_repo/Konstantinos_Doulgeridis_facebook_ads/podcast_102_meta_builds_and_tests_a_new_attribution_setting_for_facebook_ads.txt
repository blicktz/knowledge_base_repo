Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys, we are in podcast 102. In this podcast we have your questions and we have several of those of course and we're going to talk a little bit about the new attribution setting that we are having and explain a little bit about the attribution setting what it is if you don't know.

Just a small update about the course, yesterday I finished all the video shootings so it's ready of course maybe I will have to add something here and there but I have finished everything, it's huge. We need at least two months of video editing and all of that to fix it so I did my part. I said to myself that you have to finish it until the end of February and I did my part doing three times per week video shootings and stuff while I was posting normally on YouTube and doing the podcast.

So now it's two months away I guess with no pressure video editors. It's two months away. I guess I hope we will be having it live after the Christian Easter.

That's all. When it's going to be out ready I'm going to make one podcast which is going to be just dedicated to the course explaining what we're going to discuss to each one of the different chapters and each one of the videos one by one. The other thing that I'm going to do with the course and you're going to see it in the landing page is that there's going to be small videos for each one of the different sections with a small part of it so even for the people that they don't have to pay it because I get it it's going to be 1.5k but this is the price of this course.

It's having a lot of my experience. It's super updated. It's perfect.

It's having live examples, live accounts. I think it's worth even more but I want to be inside the market with this. You're going to be able even to get some value even if you watch the free parts over there.

Now and of course the YouTube videos are going to continue. It's going to have a little bit more advanced information of course inside the course especially with live ad accounts and even you being able to see some of the videos of the chosen five and it's going to be kept updated forever from now on with new videos coming at least until the point that I will decide and I want to do it forever I guess to keep doing Facebook ads. If I stop, of course it's going to stop.

Now let's talk a little bit about the new attribution setting. First of all I would like to clarify that this is something that you're not going to see on your ad accounts. It's not a setting that you will be able to see.

It's basically this print screen over here. It's going to be another attribution type. It's going to be called incremental attribution and I'm going to explain to you what it is.

It's now on beta. Only specific ad accounts can actually have this option and we are in part of one beta test in one other account and I'm going to test it and see how it's working and I will keep you updated. What is first of all before explaining what is the incremental attribution and what is incremental in general stuff because these are things that you might hear also in other channels or from YouTube meta or from meta reps and stuff.

They're having a lot of buzzwords and a lot of words that they're just you know nuances, incremental and all of these kind of things. Leaf studies, what is a leaf study for example. I'm going to explain to you but first of all let's talk a little bit about attribution setting.

I have it fresh because I was doing the course and I know exactly how I'm going to explain it in a good way. So this is something that also inside the course I'm explaining. Of course I'm doing it in a whiteboard so that it can be visual for everyone but here in the podcast let me explain.

Before iOS we used to have the attribution model and the conversion window. The conversion window was in the place that you see now the attribution setting and basically what was the conversion window the time period that Facebook is going to use in order to optimize an ad set. Okay so if we were having seven days click one day view also back in the day or one day click or one day click one day view still I was using seven days click one day view.

I was using back in the day one day click one day view for bitcaps I remember but we were having much better reporting not delayed reporting and all of that which made the one day click one day view almost impossible to use right now with the delayed reporting statistical modeling and all of that. Back in the day we had very good reporting like the ads were reporting immediately if there was a sale or not. We didn't have 100% but maybe we had 90-95% reporting back in the day.

After iOS all of these things have changed. So the other thing is the attribution model. So the attribution model was 28 days by default.

You could change it to seven days to seven days click one day view. It was 28 days click seven days view back in the day and it was reporting for example somebody was clicking at the first of the month and they were buying on the 25th. It was going to go back and attribute the sale to the first of the month when they clicked or in the day that they viewed whatever.

And at this point I would tell you that you might be watching one of your months for example February and you were seeing that you were having three ROAS and then you were seeing one month later and you would see that it's now 3.5 ROAS. It's because of all of these sales coming from the attribution. It's not delayed reporting in this case.

It's attribution which was coming to the ads and it was showing other kind of results if you watch it later. So we were able to sell more expensive items because the sales were coming back being attributed and all of that which was really good. But still the data that Facebook was using in order to optimize, that's why we were always watching last seven days results and not last 30 days results to optimize, it was the seven days click one day view which was the conversion window.

After the iOS, no not after the iOS, before the iOS on January, before iOS come on the middle of June or July, two years ago or three years ago, I don't even remember, we had the situation that the attribution model changed and by default became seven days click one day view. Super big shock for all of us in the way that we were doing ads. Again you could change it from 28 days to seven days in some ad accounts, but I have done it only in one or two ad accounts I believe at that point.

Everybody was working with the 28 days attribution model and then after that we had the attribution model becoming seven days click one day view which means that from the 28 days it was able to actually report back only to the seven days. So because the conversion window was seven days click one day view attribution model seven days click one day view they merged this to attribution setting and now is attribution setting which is also attribution but also the conversion window using all of this data. If you haven't lived in this period to see the transition of all of that you wouldn't be able to understand 100% attribution setting.

I hope that my explanation helps you to understand it. So it's both of these things now because we don't have any more a place that we can go and see our attribution model. Back in the day there was a special place that you could go and you could see what kind of attribution model you have.

So this one of course after iOS we need more data we have discussed this again and again and we're using the seven days click one day view and now they say that they want to use another one which is called incremental attribution. What is the incremental? The incremental is the extra sales that you would get if you were not going to run if so let me put like this lift study.

What is a lift study? A lift study is when we are having two group of people the one group is going to see our ads and the other group is not going to see our ads it's going to be the control and we will see based on that that with the same ads that the one people the one group hasn't seen and the other one has seen them the group one that hasn't seen the ads maybe it's going to get two sales organic sales that Facebook is stealing and the other one is going to get nine sales. The seven sales the extra sales is the incremental is the extra that you were going to get you were not going to get without ads in other words new clients that you were not going to take and Facebook is not stealing the sales.

Now we are going to test this attribution basically and Facebook is going to find us new customers this is something that a lot of times people want. I'm against of excluding past customers I have case studies explaining that if you exclude past and I have new videos coming for that that if you exclude past customers you're hurting your results and even if you are getting some retargeting data inside your cold traffic ads basically you're having more data so you're getting at the end of the day cheaper cost for new clients comparing to just excluding audiences because it's a game of data right now the platform is missing data we cannot advertise to the same people and the less people that we advertise to the less data they send inside the platform that's why now we like broader audiences because we need more data for that and the thing is that over here we're having now this incremental which is going to try to solve this problem without excluding audiences. I had some questions to the team that we're going to set this test and the question is what kind of data is it going to use because in the attribution setting we have seven days click one day view to me by default it's going to use the attribution model which is inside attribution setting which is seven days click one day view by default but in not bad in the discussion that we had they told me that yes it's going to use seven days but maybe later it's going to use something else you know how they answer in a very vague and not super specific way then I was discussing I was saying how it's going to get this data in order to understand how it's going to target people for the for the incremental attribution and they told me that they have a database of lift studies the one that we explained along with other ways that they don't explain but they said that basically it's going to use the database of the lift studies from all of these clients that they have conducted lift studies to see how many new clients they're getting with their ads and their efficiency and how it's working and by the way you can ask these things from your meta reps if you want to do a lift study and they are going to use this kind of data from the database that's coming from these lift studies and they're going to use that in order to have more sales just for the people that are not native speakers increment meaning an increase or addition especially one of a series on a fixed scale okay so when we talk about increment we talk about the extra sales that you wouldn't get without the ads okay this is what they mean when they talk about increment this is what they mean when they talk about lift studies and this is the new thing that i'm going to test and i'm going to keep you posted for sure maybe it's going to come to you if it's going to come because it's in beta in one or two years i have done several times better tests like this and they take a lot of time to come to the public that's the topics for today there's not many things except from the fact that yesterday i believe something happened with instagram and at least in greece i started seeing only people getting and a lot of different things it was a little bit strange something happened with the algorithm i don't know what it was let me know in the comments if you had this crazy situation so this wednesday this happened um and uh other than that nothing else results how are the results the results are medium medium not good not bad they're just medium and i hope that february wasn't a good month i believe it was a little bit challenging at least january the half first 15 days were good um i do believe that the situation is going to change on march but this is what i want to believe i don't know if it's going to happen we will see let's go into your questions um i don't know how long is going to be this podcast i will try not to make it super long because um i think that it's time guys to rest a little bit and now go to one video shooting per week because i need the time with family and everything um just to just to pass and uh now it's up to the other people to do the video i think i did my part so let's start hey constantinos amazing video i've also watched many of your other videos and gone through the q a in the comment sections thank you very much for the support my friend uh root uh root your buddy oh okay i have two questions that i haven't found an answer to anywhere so i decided to ask directly perfect i recently started implementing cpo for testing creatives and asc for scaling you don't have to do that you can go immediately to asc you can do testing and scaling at the same time one variable rule video how to test while having sales is the title as is not running yet since i'm waiting on winners and i'm currently running a cbo with a 50 daily budget one ad set with six creatives i don't see the point of all of that i think that you should watch my videos about the one variable rule and how you should test while having sales at the same time i think you are losing time to all of this testing if something is good it's going to work on your normal campaign immediately you don't have to do testing to validate something these are things that we were doing five years ago how long should i let the ads run if there are no sales but the metrics seem decent here's what i'm seeing after five days i said that we're not going to do optimization let's see what you see ctr above two percent uh around 50 the fun fact is that i'm telling you we're not going to do optimization but you are asking something else because you want me to do optimization but anyway uh who created 50 percent who 30 50 average um video playtime five to six i'm launching a new brand with a new account and i've spent around 800 in total so far we're seeing the learning phase so the pixel doesn't have much data would you recommend keeping these ads running longer or should i make adjustments now i would make it a little bit dramatic and i was going to tear down the the seed of paper but i have other questions also here all of the metrics that you showed me don't matter if you are not having sales so i wouldn't keep them if they don't get sales in two three four days if they're not i would strongly suggest you to watch my video about how to work with new pixel ad accounts and cpm test different targetings find cpms and targeting that is giving you sales in the most cost efficient way and that's the only thing that you should do anything else beyond that watching other metrics is not going to help you because you don't know if the ctr uh if the ctr or this cpc is happening on an audience which is good for you because you don't have a trained pixel okay so if you have a trained pixel you can trust more the ctr the cpm the cpc and all of that but right now you don't know so you have to do different targetings and it has to be a combination of cpc cpm ctr and all of that along with sales if you don't have sales these numbers say nothing to me question two um with a 50 cpo budget when is the best time to introduce a new batch of creative should we refresh them every 14 days or is it better to do sooner or later thank you a lot for your time i really appreciate your insights best and andre i wouldn't introduce new creatives in a cpo working campaign i would do new one or i would do uh i would try to find something that's giving me sales and normal cpm and then i would just do new campaigns with new creatives trying to get better creatives and compare with my previous results this how i would have done it i think that if you watch the videos that i told you earlier they're going to help you hi constantinos my ad account was completely converted into the new ase style last week guys yeah i forgot to mention about that so there are some other accounts that i have remember that we're discussing about the changes of ase's in the previous one there's one on the account that i have seen that you create a campaign and immediately it's take it takes you to to it doesn't give you the option to check ase or manual even if you took took manual or ase it's giving you it's giving you just an option the moment you click on sale this thing has happened also the previous year in the spring when we were having again the changes for them trying to have multiple ad sets inside an ase campaign it's a little bit of different style right now uh and the thing is that from what i have seen it's forcing you to use um first of all it's forcing you to use advantage plus um budget cpo you can not use it if you click over there and you create a second ad set then you you're going to be able to see that you can use uh also um abo over there so this is one thing in the way that you can overcome it it's needless to say that if we end up having ase campaigns like this my first thought initial thought is that if i want to have an abo ase and it's forcing me to do cpo i can always do two adsets abo the one ad set is going to have a budget of 50 cents just to keep it there so that i can have the option of using abo and the other one is going to be my normal budget abo ase okay so if i want to use it in the traditional way because in the new style that you're saying here it doesn't let you to have one ad set abo ase you need to put two ad sets the one maybe you can put it in a very small budget and the other one you can put it normally with your five to ten creatives in the same way this is what i'm going to try and see if it's working or if they have changed anything it is not working anymore in the way that we have seen ase campaigns working of course all of this means that ase traditionally was working for your ad account and now they have done a change so we try to find a workaround the other thing that i need to tell you is the about the placements you can go and you can change them if you want to do something manually there anyway we're using advanced plus placements in most of my end accounts i do the other thing is the targeting it's a little bit of a hybrid between the old original and the advanced plus audience you're not you are able to use local x and stuff but still you have the option on the top and it's going to expand it so in these other accounts that they have been converted to the new style of ase you are losing your ability of doing interesting lookalikes in the way that we were having it with the original audience i haven't found a workaround yet for that i started three of those campaigns across several countries for this product funnel last year last wednesday fourth day in all stable 2.25 rows consistent and stress free perfect five videos five static divided into separate ad sets optimized down to four and four across campaigns and results just improving maybe we're going to see crazy method ase again who knows i can complain about the new ac style and will test crazy method next week perfect let us know plus add my other good markets the setup took some getting used to and i couldn't duplicate from cbo's or all the acs i know since i got it all running through works like a charm tracking only 80 percent of sales in ad manager but that's normal for me everything looks normal i hope that we're not going to have the same um the same show that we were having the previous year in the spring with all of the things that happened um and maybe again for me it's good we will have crazy method uh and we will go again back talking about cbo optimization or maybe we will find the hybrid between cbo optimization and and see we will see i think i've tapped out next one i think i've tapped out my market spending 100k a month in australia and i want to start selling to the usa 100k selling to australia it's a good it's a it's a good spend well done i know the market is there but i've been running uh on uh real low spend 100 day and i'm um break even result seven days uh in and the cpms are at 110 wow maybe maybe you need to see if you if you want to do some look-alikes interest first and try to see if you can get lower cpm and the results instead of trying broad i'm running advanced plus and i thought the pixel data would help me get sales fast in the usa you have data for uh for australia not for usa all the metrics are really good ctr high hall who create probably yes because you use good creatives but maybe it doesn't know who to target but the cpc is so high because of the cpms is something that will get better uh with time and uh or i and i just need to wait i think you you can wait and just burn money hitting your uh your head to the wall but you can do something about it and you can try to cut corners and go to some other targetings until you go to broad efficiently there just keep running other targetings and see the cpm compare it and if you're getting better results then you can move to that i was just under the impression that because i already have pixel data facebook will be able to find my customers faster when i scale abroad yeah but it's different demographics my friend next one can we duplicate same winning creative multiple times in an asc new age crazy method your thoughts uh maybe we will see guys it's a new thing i would like to test it uh all of you that you're running crazy method i know that you you are going to test it anyway and we're going to be able to compare results together uh next one says do you recommend checking yesterday spend daily to analyze budget distribution within an uh an ad set or campaign with this um help ensure that the single lead ad isn't dominating uh the budget and taking spend away from a profitable one and we have ways of optimizing cbo and tsc campaigns and yes we watch the dominant ads if if there's a problem you have to close it there are so many different cases i'm trying to show case studies inside the course i will have more examples and stuff but for sure every case is completely different but watching only yesterday it's not okay uh you need to watch seven days because this is your attribution setting but at the end of the day watching the tendency of one not that you're afraid if it's trying to become leading ad and this is hurting the campaign and stuff this is something that we do watch on a daily level to see if one not on the last two days is trying to become dominant if it's trying to become dominant it's having good results then we leave it if not and it's hurting the campaign that we kill it just so that we can cut this behavior and all of that but there are so many different cases and my only way for me to teach that is was adding on the course chosen five uh sessions basically this is why i added them so that you can see over there how we treated so many different cases of optimization um or is it better to assess performance over a longer period before making adjustments i think i explained i think when you when you're having a campaign you're saying that something is wrong one one your leading ad set is or ad is losing to another and stuff maybe you need to see if you should keep it because it's taking budget and it's working or if you could cut this behavior so that you can save your campaign from getting ruined guys i hope it was an interesting podcast for you uh we had some pretty interesting uh questions and stuff and i will see you guys on the next one this is the end of the first part of the facebook ads breaking news podcast if you don't want to miss the second half of the podcast where i'm mentioning all the remaining questions of the week visit my pattern page following the link on the description this was the facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is
