Hello Facebook Ads people, I'm Kostantinos and this is the Facebook Ads Breaking News Podcast. Hello guys and Happy New Year, Happy 2025. I hope that all of you, you had a crazy good time.

It was challenging for me because you know everybody was on vacation and stuff and I had to work and everything while having the baby. So I'm a little bit tired and exhausted but 2025 is here and if you're a person like me that has learned to work all the time, this is a period that you have to start pushing again and doing a lot of effort. To be honest with you, I'm going to start now producing the course.

I have some ideas into my head of how I'm going to structure it with a lot of different things explaining the daily loop and all of the other things that I have learned along the way after creating the first course. And the next thing that I'm going to do which I think that you're going to find interesting is that I'm going to make Loom videos inside with me optimizing and showing you for 30 days or not straight, maybe we're going to skip some if there's not good days for optimization or anything important to talk about, but maybe for 30 days or less, maybe 20 days I will see of optimizing different accounts so that you can see a lot of different cases of optimizing for ASC and CBO campaigns. I'm going to include also from the previous course only the CBO optimization, nothing else, everything else is going to be new because of the previous course we had some very good examples of CBO optimization.

And I'm going to also include some videos from one of my students that we did Chosen 5, of course, hiding his identity, his store and everything, just showing the parts that we were optimizing together so that you can get an idea of how the Chosen 5 is working and yeah, all of that. Just because we're in the production of the course, right now I don't think I will take another person for Chosen 5 unless it is a very good project and the ad account is ready to scale, but for now I think I'm going to close all of the spots for the next three months until I finish the course completely. The course is going to have a lot of theory inside because I want to focus also on the theory, understanding why you're doing this or that on Facebook side and it's going to have also a lot of examples with the Loom videos on a daily level and now it's up to me on the next three months to complete it.

The price is going to be between 1.5k to 1k. Most likely if I end up putting a lot of effort and making such a big course that I believe that it's going to be because there's just 44 different topics that are going to have sub topics plus the 30 days videos for the optimization. The 30 days videos I forgot to mention for CostCap and BitCap and 30 or less days of Chosen 5 optimization more with one of my students.

So it's going to be a huge course and most likely I'm going to charge it 1.500 we will see. The people that they have already access to the course you're going to get it for free for supporting the previous course and everything. And yeah I guess that's it with the course so now we just have to ramp up and actually do the best that we can to finish it.

Most likely I'm going to do video shootings every day or every other day in order to be able to finish it and I hope that we're going to be ready in time. Now when it comes to results about January and then we'll go to the main topic for today which is Mark announcing what he announced announced and January results. We had some pretty slow days on...

let me see the dates just so that I can be sure. So the weekend the 4th and the 5th was a little bit slow. The days before that were okay so this weekend the 4th and the 5th was slow.

From 6th to 7th it started bouncing back. Today it's a very good day the 8th that I'm video shooting this. I didn't expect for January to start so slow but I feel like it started slow and I would like to see how this is going to evolve.

About health and wellness guys, I do know that some people are getting banned already on their ad accounts but we don't have any concrete answer from Meta of what's going to happen so we will have to wait on the 15th and see how they're going to address that. Now main topic today we have the news from Mark that he announced basically in a very big video for his standards and it says here it's time to get back to our roots around free expression. Duh!

You realize it now? Let me tell you what he means. In all of my podcasts here and stuff I have to mention the word...

I'm not going to mention it now but I have to mention the word that every state is doing every four years in order to have a chief for the government. Okay and I mentioned these words and for this my videos are getting flagged as being political. Okay maybe they are even going to be flagged now because I said political.

The point is that all of these things with flagging things if you talk about gender, if you talk about ethnicities, if you talk about political, if you talk about Trump, if you talk about this or that or that or that you're getting flagged and basically even the people like me that are not expressing any political opinion or whatever we are getting flagged in our videos for no reason just because there are so many safety features over there so that we are not going to say anything bad about transgender people or we're not going to say anything bad about Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. So we have all of this situation that they are trying to protect it but on the other hand it became a place that you cannot just express yourself because everything you say is wrong you know. It's what I like to say that and this is why you see me that on my videos and everywhere I'm really straightforward.

I don't like this political correctness that sugar coach thinks and everything is okay and all of that. Do you want to say something just say it loud okay of course in some constraints but do you know what I realized that when you're trying to constrain something you end up constraining everything and there are people that they are going to be judged of what they're saying even if they don't have a bad intention and they're going to be cut. So this is happening with the platform okay you cannot talk about this you cannot talk about it reminds me it reminds me of a joke that an anecdote here in Greece which it says that there's a guy that goes to the bar and there's another one next to him sitting and they don't know each other and they say he reads the newspaper he said look at look at this team this guy he cannot score and stuff and the barman comes and says guys do not talk about sports here because I don't want any fight to start on the bar.

The guy says okay then he says look at these guys look at these guys they don't know how to government okay and they're doing this and that and they're all corrupted. The barman comes again and says please guys don't talk about politics here because I don't want to have any fights to the bar and then the guy says to the barman hey can we talk about sexual stuff no you know yeah the barman says yes you can talk about which girl you went out and stuff and the guy says okay then go yourself okay so basically this is this is what is happening right now you cannot talk about anything and whenever whenever you talk about something you're just being flagged because you're not political correct or you're expressing your opinion and what does this mean that means that us people we cannot express our opinion and they they end up having fake profiles and stuff in order to say what they want to say and because they don't care if they get banned over there so that's the situation and that's what he's addressing and of course the one that made them I'm not an Elon fan mask uh I'm not an uh I'm not an Elon Musk fan uh but uh I must admit that in some things he's right for example when he took twitter uh he said that free uh free expression and stuff uh also I'm I'm against of people commenting with fake profiles okay so do you want to come which I don't have these problems on my channel but let's say that I did do you want to come into my face and call me um fat or idiot or whatever do it with your name okay so that you can face the consequences we cannot just address on on the whole internet space like it's a space that it's an asylum for every stupid person that can express whatever they want you can express whatever they want but they need to have consequences in the same way that they have consequences in their lives so what is happening on tiktok and in other platforms where everyone is anonymous or reddit everyone is anonymous speak and say your opinion while you're putting your name next to it okay and then express whatever you want even if you are a racist and you put the name next to it be able to express it because this is democracy but at the end of the day I'm not accepting the fact that there are people that they're just making another profile another profile another profile and some of those are getting banned and the measure in order to control that all of these trolls is just to have crazy safety features that none of us that we have actual profiles we can say nothing so I think that this situation is over and then Elon came he took the ex and he started expressing that okay now we need to let people even express their opinion for example even uh I'm vaccinated okay uh I'm by the way this video is going to to be devastated because I'm covering all the topics that I shouldn't talk about but I I don't give a okay so I'm vaccinated I don't believe that the people that they're not vaccinated they should not express their opinion and they should not say this or that or that okay it does it irritate some yeah it does but I'm not going to uh to stop listening to them just because I'm on the other side and I'm having another opinion and this is what happened exactly with X and all these platforms about vaccinations uh actually silencing people talking for the fact that they don't want to do it okay or they have been called crazy paranoid people or whatever and this is coming from a person who is vaccinated because I believe in the vaccination they believe that it helped me because I got sick and then I got better okay I don't know about the long term what is going to happen okay I do hear this argument but I know that I got benefited from that okay so that's my opinion about it that's what I think that Mark is uh is trying to say that all of this madness of nobody being able to talk because they're being silenced immediately or the post gets down it has to stop um and this is what he expressed of course he did an opening to Donald Trump talking about it and he says that um we as Americans have to do this and that he mentioned China in order to do that so for me this is also an opening from uh Mark to Trump in order to work with him because he knows that his best uh friend uh is now Elon Musk and um he's afraid that his platform is gonna fall behind because maybe he's going to uh to do better uh that's how I see it on the other hand let's discuss how we believe that this one is going to influence us when it comes to Facebook ads I do believe that there are a lot of things like guns for example okay in the united states that um um they're going to be started being able to be advertised or whatever maybe uh and we're going to see some changes um this is irrelevant to the health and wellness which is a legal team decision it's not something which is coming from uh Mark that you have to stop doing health and wellness um and I do believe that we're going to see some new categories coming that we were not able to advertise to be able to advertise and maybe even get less rejected ads for the specific categories that they were actually struggling it's all about discovering all of that but yeah that's my opinion about it and to be honest with you because I have been in these platforms for many years I do have a very clear opinion and I do believe that they have overdone it and to be honest with you I believe that they have overdone it on the uh let's let's go with the with the most intense flag word over here which is going to f*** up completely the video they have overdone it in the COVID period and in the current period because they were hushing down and they were just suppressing whatever it was being told about the ones that they were just having disagreements okay and to be honest with you I think that Facebook did also that and I don't know if this is a genuine remorse or if they are trying now to go inside the new trend which is Donald Trump but we're going to see at the end of the day we're not we're not here just to judge how Facebook is doing things but we are here to do Facebook ads and the only way that I'm seeing these things and these news is from the prism of how they're going to affect us in terms of the ads management and I believe that we're going to have less rejections I believe that we're going to have more categories that we will be able to advertise so it's going to be good and the only loose end over here is what's going to happen on the 15th which is going to explain a lot of the things he didn't mention anything about ads it was about the policy of how this is going to do and that there's going to be more fact check which is he even mentioned it we're going to do it like x okay and we're going to do fact check and he mentioned that in order for us not to say that so he's moving the fact checking team from what I understood to Texas because if you move it to Texas then you're having people working from Texas over there so the culture is not going to be this political correctness of New York you know about the woke movement and all of that this is how I see it at least anyway look at the end of the day mark is going to try to protect his company and it makes total sense the only thing that we need to see is how it's going to influence us on the ads because this is this is a platform that apparently is working and we only want to see it see this platform becoming better I think that this change is for good okay and I think that it's going to change things in the advertising not going back to things like targeting people who are rich or dog owners and very nice interests that we used to have but he mentioned also EU by the way which EU for example right now and I agree with him it's a catastrophic place when you go and you impose again another thing another thing GDPR another thing EU laws this and that beneficiary and this you are ruining the whole innovation thing he's completely right about that but EU imagine EU just like a very slow ship that it's just turning like this you know it takes so much time for them to do a change and and all of that and all of this means that they are just imposing another thing and another thing and another thing which is actually ruining the advertising right now in the European Union and it's not making it easy for us comparing to what we have in the United States that's all let's go to your questions because I can talk about these topics the whole day and we have a lot of questions so let's move to that okay so let's start with your questions I think there are way too many because we haven't talked for a long period oh my god oh my god okay so we'll have to go fast mode guys fast mode on I'm not even going to count the questions but they should be more than 40 50 I guess we will see we don't have liar 45 questions he respected my request of not doing big questions I don't know if you are messaging me from other profiles I don't know for example if you are looks 039 because the questions that this guy is making they are very close to you but I'm not going to research it more let's go hi guys I started using the crazy method this week and the results are starting to come in I'm not sure about the future but right now we are spending 1k a day and yesterday today is earning worth 30k on crazy if anyone is reading this comment and consider the crazy method just do it just go for it haha I turn off ads during optimization but I'm sure whether to turn off the creatives or not I don't want to disturb the algorithm so there's no one I'm putting this I'm putting this because a lot of times people ask me if the crazy method is still relevant the fact that it's an old video it doesn't mean that the crazy method doesn't work the crazy method is always going to work as long as there are hot pockets in inside of the ads being formed now on this topic over here if you have to close ads or ads because the crazy method is a cbo you have to close ad sets when we close ads then you have to optimize on the ad level and on the ad set level which is making it extremely difficult and it's changing a lot of variables so I want you to optimize on the asset level with the ways that we are showing in several videos on how to do so don't go into the ad level if you see in your cbo that on the ad level you have one consistent user suspect that's taking budget is not doing well just go remove it and run the campaign all over again to optimize with the others note the crazy method is a scaling method we use it when we have something working we don't use it for testing experienced people like me use it for testing also but we're not going to start this topic right now because apparently there's some people that nothing is working with their ad account and they think that if they use the crazy method it's going to work no crazy method is the amplifier of something that is already working next one hey when you should use the rapid fire method for testing creatives and to clarify should all 10 creatives in each ad set be the same they should be the same but I have made a change to that I want you to use 5 don't use 10 use 5 10 it's way too much for the rapid fire rapid fire can be used to test creatives but I'm not using it a lot it's just another method that sometimes in some other accounts it works you can use it if you like it I guess if it's in your preferences my preference is not to use it I tested it because it made sense technically and in order to see how it behaves so for example I did changes like initially when the rapid fire came out I was saying that you keep the high budget now I believe that you after the two days that you keep the one asset you lower the budget immediately to the comfort zone budget that you have on the on the accounts for the campaigns instead of 10 you run 5 these are things that I have changed by just testing it and other friends of mine like like Adim for example he he told me that it's working better for me with 5 so I took all of this feedback from you and your tests so it's up to you personal preference I like to test more with things that are working so structures that are working with that account I don't care about having a different structure for testing at a different structure for a broad top of funnel targeting or just top of funnel targeting once the testing phase narrows down to one winning creative would you recommend optimizing like an abo campaign by lowering the budget or should the budget remain the same I already explained this is something that has changed in the strategy back in the day I believed when I created without testing it that we have to keep the same maybe because I thought that it was an opportunity to have a higher spend thing so that we can spend more in scale but the results humiliated me and I got humbled and I started using the budgets I lowered the budgets to the normal one so the increased budget initially is helping you to test faster and find your winner and then you lower to the one that you have there's a question here I thought I thought it has been around for a while but all of a sudden clients are asking for it well made video thanks he's talking about oh he's talking about the value optimization I posted a new video about testing value optimization in ASC campaigns yes value optimization has been here forever it was actually funny because I was talking with a meta rep that it was discussing about the ASC optimization and she told me no this is a new feature it has never been again I said no the value optimization is here forever how do I know it I had some other accounts five years ago that I was getting paid revenue sharing deals and I was using value optimization with manual bidding and I was getting paid like 2k per day because because of the percentage said we're spending 20k 10% of the revenue was getting paid 2k per day so I know it very well that they existed back back in the day at this point I didn't even have a youtube channel okay so I know very well that it existed before because I remember these days and maybe these days have even funded the whole youtube effort who knows the thing is that they have now introduced these value optimization so instead of optimizing for maximum number of conversion optimizing for maximum value is just above the pixel selection into the ad set level you have done it and it's working really well also on several accounts and I'm using it as strategy you can go and you can watch the video about the meta funding test about optimizing for value which is maximum number of value maximum conversion value instead of maximum number of conversions yes so the people started using it because first of all it's working and they start talking about it and secondly meta gave a lot of tests so more and more people tested it that's why we see it also it has been announced that now we're introducing the value optimization to the ac campaign so more people have seen it and they started doing it but for sure test it because it's worth it and it's a very good it's a very good setting I really like it especially for stores that they have aov fluctuations it's very good because it's helping just be careful a little bit with the ratios just don't do all of them with value optimization just do three or four out of the ten the rest you can see them on the video what about using big ac campaign to scale with all the best creatives put in there instead of scaling cbo you can do whatever you want first of all secondly having a very big ac no matter how big is going to be unless if it's 50k per day if you put a lot of ads inside in an ac you are going to spend the majority of the budget so you can get it to uh two three four five okay so it's not something that you're just tossing more creators inside and all of them are taking budget as is working with dominant ads so you cannot do this you can keep scaling it and then seeing how much you can scale with the creators that they are taking the budget yes but if you want to keep scaling more or having coverage results or being able to control other accounts and stuff you need to work with multiple campaigns this is what i believe if you believe something else you feel free to use one campaign and use other things that i'm saying last thing is that i have posted a video with a case study with one one account that it's uh that's having one campaign and how i'm starting transitioning it to many campaigns at account i'm going to make the part two right now of how december went and then i'm going to make the january and february so that i can show you uh how this other account is actually scaling more with multiple campaigns instead of having one campaign which is if you remember in a previous podcast the debate that they had with one person telling to me that if i have one campaign that i'm tossing creatives inside they're going to take the the best one is going to take budget which means that it can scale more in theory it makes sense i do understand it as a concept but i'm proving in this account that the thing that i told him that who who tells to you that if you don't take the other creatives into their own respective campaigns you're not going to be able to scale more because just the budget is being distributed also to other creatives that now they're not working because yes they're not the most strong ones on the campaign that you have but maybe they can even work on their own campaign being the strong ad sets if they have the chance and this is what i'm proving in this case study and it's working very well i must say uh next one how do you negotiate with partnership creators what are your best deal to propose to these creatives most of the times people this is not my field of expertise but from what i know most of the times people are sending them free products and some other times it's paid collaborations with x amount of money i don't know the exact deals but i have something to say and this is why i put this comment here the best thing that you can do is find a creator which is already using your product that's amazing if you find someone let's say for example there's a creator out there and he bought my course and he talked somewhere about my course and i know uh burner glasses for example okay this is a brand that i really like and i also run their ads but uh on the other hand i must say that uh i when i was approached uh i was already a client of theirs so yes in this other account i'm working with even better um you know um i like the brand anyway not because they gave me three glasses which they didn't by the way uh but because of the fact uh that um um you know i like the brand so i like to advertise it and stuff so if you find an influencer that it's already using your product and he likes he or she likes it then they're going to make better videos okay um next one hey do you recommend using asc campaign alongside cbo testing campaign uh i don't recommend using cbo testing campaign i recommend testing with whatever structure is working in your ad account even if it is asc cbo whatever that may be you can just put a structure which is working provenly because you have one campaign working already change the creatives inside so that you can know if the creatives are the problem or your structure is the problem or just one asc campaign and these creatives when needed i replied there's no such conflicting information youtube about oh don't use asc this and that i feel like most of youtubers are saying that to discourage people from finding independence i don't think that youtubers have any need of not of depreciation um of taking away their independence from from you they don't give a the thing that i think that's happening here is that there sometimes youtubers are trying to say things to sound smart or special and stuff and they're not um attacking to uh the point which is that this is how we run ad uh this is why you know all of that so maybe people are getting confused because here here and there there is another person that's going to come and say this like the other thing that i see is a lot of people come and say the facebook pixel is not getting trained and they show their um um the reason that i'm saying that they're showing their cord is because i'm seeing it with many people which means that someone has done it and the people like it so they show their power charging from the mobile phone cord and they say that it's like a cord that is transferring energy or data in that case and the reason that i'm mentioning this is because i have seen for more than five people use this example which means that someone used it as a smart example and they are using it also because they liked it as a content and the truth is that they're completely wrong okay because the pixel does get trained how do we know that it took me months to actually find the answer but um something to answer you know that it's based on data we do know it because when we start running campaigns with a new pixel we do take um when we try to use value optimization which goes with the question before facebook doesn't let us because it says that this pixel doesn't have enough data which means that it's storing data in order for it later to be able to do value optimization in the ad account and so all of these people that they're saying that the pixel is not getting trained do you know what's the funny part when they are changing another account and they change a store or whatever because most of this bullshit are coming from people that they are working with dropshippers or they are dropshippers and they're not going technically um deep to running ads these people they're also changing their pixel well if you don't care about it why do you change your pixel you know out of superstition anyway that's the point with youtubers that they're not for example there are people that they're telling scale with 20 okay and they're talking to people that they're spending 100 or 200 and they talk about scale with 30 why scaling with 20 means that you don't that what is this 20 20 comes from the theory that if you don't if you scale more than 20 you're going to exit the learning phase that you have passed okay not exit the learning phase you're going to go back to the learning phase except from the fact that i don't care about the learning phase and i do believe that it's another system from meta to keep making you spend more so that you can reach the goal to gamify a little bit the way of doing ads so that you can have another task or you can have another milestone to cover and in order for you to do it you need to spend more it's psychology of the advertiser except from that fact why are you proposing to someone that is spending 100 per day and he needs 50 events in the course of seven days if he's using seven days attribution window to pass the learning phase do not increase more than 20 percent when he has never passed the learning phase you see how crazy it is so people are just seeing things without even knowing what the they are talking about so the 20 is coming from the theory about the learning phase if you haven't passed the learning phase why the you need to keep increasing with 20 it makes no sense anyway um hi sir i discovered your channel while i was looking for the hot pockets topic hot pockets i don't know if anyone else is talking about it most probably you come from reddit i guess that people talk about hot pockets there i have a question regarding my situation i'm working on custom delivery lead generation on landing page and selling products i have a question on the testing phase is it better to test multiple creatives or multiple pockets i think it's better initially to test multiple creatives and when you find something working you can always move to the crazy method and test multiple hot pockets because you have this but you have something working at that point you have something working and starting to unravel the different things that are working is very important right now it has five assets each asset having one creative the budget is five usd on every asset this is an abo please give details thanks i cannot give you details i can tell you that i consider this budget small unless if you have a very small cost per purchase or whatever i do understand that maybe it's a budget thing for you but i would prefer for example if i have five assets over here with five it's to run just one with 25 and then see if i can use it on crazy method because i just don't believe in small budget testing i wouldn't run any other account that is spending less than uh 50 or 100 per day and something that would make sense sadly facebook needs more money now if you have smaller numbers like cost per purchase of five dollars be my guest and do that and then move them to the crazy method so guys these are all the questions i have nothing else i really like the podcast to be honest with you i i missed uh this uh it's uh 12 o'clock at the night because now with the baby we have to do different hours video shooting my video editor behind the camera is actually sleeping and she's in a very bad state i can see her face of how much she hates me but we all have to adapt to the baby sorry um the truth is that i missed all of these things with the podcast that's why i kept talking more about things because for me it's a way to express also the things that they have i have also the inner circle but uh this is more public and stuff i know that this video is going to be uh up uh because of all the things that they said in the beginning but i don't care and i will see you guys on the next one with the next news the next one most likely is going to be around the corner of the 15th right so the 15th oh yeah so on the next one we're going to see the mayhem next one is going to show the 15th is on wednesday so the next one is going to be video shooted after the 15th and we're going to see what happened with these changes of the health and wellness i will see you on the next one guys this is the end of the first part of the facebook ads breaking news podcast if you don't want to miss the second half of the podcast where i'm answering all the remaining questions of the week visit my pattern page following the link on the description this was the facebook ads breaking news podcast like it or not it is what it is is
