Hello Facebook Watch people, I'm Kostantinos and today we're going to talk about the Hot Pockets and the randomness of the initial results. If you're here for a very long period of time, you know that we love Hot Pockets and to talk about them. I love it!

I don't know if I have invented this phrase or if I heard it from somewhere and stuff. I don't remember but since I remember talking about Facebook ads, I was talking about Hot Pockets. I don't know if it's mine or whatever.

It doesn't matter. The thing that I want to talk about today is the randomness of the initial results and how the Hot Pockets are being formed. We have discussed in another video where they are being formed on the ad level and how it changed my opinion where I would believe that it was formed on the ad level because we didn't have the AAC campaigns that we had on CBOs.

Hi guys! I would like to interrupt this video in order to talk to you about my new mentorship programs and I would love if you go to the website. You're going to find the link in the description or you can find it in the menu of my website and over there you're going to be able to see the different mentorship programs that I have.

You can find the one that is going to fit better your needs and I will hope to see you there. Today I would like to talk a little bit about the randomness of the initial results because I think that it's very important for after the daily loop theory also. So I know I'm throwing a lot of things and if you're just seeing this video for the first time, you have to go and see my crazy method video, you have to go and see my daily theory video and all of the videos that are explaining how this is working.

So a lot of times I see people that they say that, okay, I'm just going to do one campaign and I'm going to have inside one creative blah blah. I always believe that based on the sale because Facebook is about consistent sales, okay, so the more sales that are coming in, the more it gets data and finds similar people to the previous sales, okay. So that means that it's forming a hot pocket of people that they are actually the ones that they're going to dictate who are the next people that they're going to convert or at least be targeted.

So that's the concept of the hot pocket and then I came up with a crazy method which means that you are duplicating several times this in order to find different hot pockets. Some of those are going to be stronger, some of those are going to be lesser and you are going to try to have an average result of that. After that, I will start thinking that hot pockets can, you can create also hot pockets by just selling the same product but with different usages or different creatives that they explain it in a different way on the daily loop theory and I started thinking that in order for you to do that, you need to have creative from different angles and this is what is going to help you scale because if we are targeting 250 million people in the United States and we show, for example, that you can sell this product also like this or like this or like this with your creatives which is also your targeting in a broad targeting audience.

That means that you can have also different hot pockets being formed from people that they resonate on how to use the product based on the different creatives. I hope that whatever I'm saying makes sense but follow my way of thinking. It's not only that but it's also the randomness of the initial result.

This is one example that I have, maybe I have mentioned it in into the podcast several times but I always wanted to make a video about it explaining. In my daily life I think also as a marketeer okay so what happened with me is that at some point I was, I wasn't a dad at this point of a beautiful young girl and I was just an uncle of another beautiful young girl from my sister. At this point I wanted to buy a dress to her so I bought a dress and then I kept thinking all the evening of how bad data I am for the ad that convinced me to buy this dress.

Let me tell you why. Because I was thinking what if I was the first say of this and basically what happened is that I just created a hot pocket that based on me started finding other uncles that they are not going to buy again because they are not parents or a father for example that wants to buy something for his girl. After the kid knowing how much I want to buy things for my daughter I know how bad lead I was actually because I was just a person that was going to buy something and if based on my data I was going to find similar people like me the randomness of the initial result actually this ad set and the truth is that I was never able to understand why some ads are doing better some ads are doing worse.

If you think of it the randomness of the initial result of the people that are going to come and convert if they are not going to create and be the base of a very good hot pocket which is going to expand then this is an ad set that is never going to work. In my case if I was the first result or one of the first results I created or I made the hot pocket creation even more difficult because I was a person that if I convert I'm not a person that I'm an ideal client to find other parents that are more likely to convert. So it was having a much more difficult thing to do to find angles that they're going to convert but if I convert right now as a parent that I'm buying all the time things for my little daughter then I'm going to be a very good start from a hot pocket which is being formed and this is the randomness of the initial results.

This is something that I was mentioning and I was seeing also when I was doing different campaigns and this is how I came up with the idea of the crazy method. When I was running ads on Monday then on Tuesday then on Wednesday because I have found the concept of relancing campaigns and start to optimize them all over again much much earlier before the crazy method when a campaign was dying I was relancing it. So basically I knew that I could have different results on Monday different results on Tuesday then I started understanding the hot pockets and then I said okay I want to actually have less risk when I'm doing that so I'm going to do several adsets and some of those are going to work and then I started searching more about the hot pockets understanding it seeing this behavior.

The actual fun part is that I see YouTubers analyzing all of these behaviors saying that we have different results here and there and they don't understand about the hot pockets and I hope that eventually they're going to see one of my videos understanding what is the hot pockets. The truth is that with the randomness of the initial results we might have good or bad results this is why we always need to risk less by doing more ad sets which are going to be exactly the same as the crazy method if we run CBO or by putting more creatives on the same angle side in order for us to have better chances of creating a hot pocket. Sometimes if we do believe that we got unlucky and this is not a video in order to tell you that if you got unlucky relance your campaign because maybe it was an angle that converted and as initial result it created a bad hot pocket I'm not saying that but I'm saying that this is also a knowledge that you need to know and you need to start thinking like this when you're doing Facebook ads.

The more you think like this the more you innovate and the more you understand how to use the algorithm. So you are running an ASC campaign that means that all of these 10 creatives of course some of those are going to be stronger than the others all of these based on the randomness of the initial result they can have a good or bad result and yes I know I have done a video about ASC crazy method but I don't like it I feel like it's a desperate solution to run the same ad multiple times in the same ASC campaign. Some people still send me messages and they say that this thing has worked that's why I have a video but I find it a desperate solution.

I think that sometimes if you have the feeling that this ad could work or this ad has worked in the past but it didn't work maybe it's worth to do another relance after five six seven days because maybe one initial result like a bad uncle that is not going to buy again actually your results. That's the discussion that I wanted to make today about the hot pockets and the randomness of the initial result. I hope that you are going to find this video beneficial and it's going to expand a little bit your knowledge about Facebook ads and how you perceive things when it comes to Facebook ads, hot pockets, the crazy method and all the other things and the daily loop theory of course and don't forget that if you want to learn more you can check my book, my course, my website, you can check my mentorship programs where we're doing this kind of deep conversations.

If you like to make them for sure the chosen five program and the inner circle are places for you to be and until you win again be creative and be consistent.
