Ελπίζω Facebook Ads People! Είμαι ο Κωνσταντίνος και εσείς θα μιλήσουμε για τις καμπάνες της CBO και της ABO. Ποιο είναι πιο πιο πιο.

Αυτό που μιλήσουμε για τις καμπάνες της ABO και της CBO. Αν δεν ξέρεις τι είναι ABO και της CBO, μπορείς να γκουγλήσεις το. Δεν ξέρω, γιατί αυτήν την καμπάνηση είναι για ασφαρές.

We just set a budget at the campaign level and Facebook decides how it's going to distribute it among the ad sets in order to get the best possible results.

After 24 hours, for example, you might see an ad set spending 50 out of the 100 and another one just spending 1 USD. Facebook decides on results and engagement how it's going to distribute actually the money. The big question here is, is Facebook a platform that I can trust and I can give all of my money so that they can distribute it in the ad sets as they want?

The answer is no. But we do trust the algorithm. If we had discussed about CBO vs.

ABO one year ago in the spring of 2020, I would have then told you that ABO is better. Like always, when Facebook introduces a new feature, it needs time until this feature starts working properly. And guess what?

CBO is beating ABO always nowadays. it is working. So please start using it.

Okay. Now I think it's time to explain to you some things in my computer because some things like the optimization are a little bit advanced. I will try to do my best and most probably I will do more videos about it.

But just keep in mind that optimization is something that you learn by doing ads and by spending money. You cannot just follow a blueprint. It also needs your instinct.

So let me show you first of all, the basic settings. We can see that we can create one campaign. If it is a conversion campaign or whatever, we can see that if you come here, you see the campaign budget optimization.

This is what I was mentioning before that you decide how much money you're going to spend across your ad sets. Okay. So you're having several ads and you decide the money that you're going to spend.

Facebook is going to spend this amount of money based on engagement and other metrics, understanding how to spend your money in the best possible way in order to have the best possible results. Now, the way that I like to do ads is with CBO campaigns. And of course, if we go on the ad set level with dynamic creatives.

Okay. I love dynamic creatives and I think that they have a very good synergy when they're working together with a CBO campaign. Now, when it comes to my bottom of funnel, like retargeting that you have very small custom audiences that you're going to add here, then I'm not against using ABO because you can have budgets like 20 or 30 dollars and you should not put many ad sets.

And especially if you are running a catalog ads, you can actually use it in a way that you're not going to have competition between your retargeting. Now, when we are talking though about interest, we know that we have very big potential reach. And if we use also the expand button over here, the potential reach for United States for instance is 260 million.

As you can understand, this is huge. And if you have a CBO campaign, most probably you're going to have better distribution of your budget. Another way to run ads if you want to do them is ABO.

If you close this, you can come here inside your ad set and you can actually put your daily budget. The budget that you want to spend per ad set. Now, the difficulty with that is that imagine that you have a very good ad set which is working very well.

The problem is that if you started with 20 and then you want to scale it to 100, you are asking basically 500% of raise. But if you start with a CBO campaign and then your ad set spends immediately $60, $70 because it's working very well and Facebook wants to spend money on something that's working and it's getting results. That means that your ad set is starting from a bigger level of initial budget and then you can scale it more because you are asking less.

Okay. 100% raise for the $70 that it started. As an example, it's going to be $140.

As you can understand, it's easier to scale like this. This is why back in the spring of 2021, as I mentioned, I was using ABO campaigns, but I was scaling with CBO campaigns. Okay.

I was doing ABO campaigns. I was actually finding the ad sets that was working very well. I was spending $20 or $10 per ad set in very big campaigns.

I was finding the interests and the settings that were working very well. and then I was taking my best ad sets, I was putting them in a new CBO campaign with a bigger budget so that I can be able to scale. Because whenever I was trying to scale my ad sets that they were spending $10 or $20 in the ABO campaign, it was impossible and they were just dying.

Now that I showed you the general settings and how to use the ABO or CBO, I can tell you that most probably you should use CBO when you're doing call traffic with interest. This is what I'm doing. This is what a lot of people are doing actually.

Let's discuss a little bit about some individual campaigns so that you can get a feeling of how this is working. Because one of the biggest obstacles when we're talking about CBO campaigns is how much money should I put and how many ad sets. This is the ratio that is the most difficult thing to actually understand and actually implement in your strategies.

And this is one of the questions that I get most of the times. So when you are having a CBO campaign, this is one example, okay? We're having a CBO campaign.

It's having inside 11 ad sets as we can see here. And this campaign started on the July of 2021. On 26, it has nothing.

So on 27 it started. Let me show you how this campaign actually evolved. If we come to this, if you don't know with this clock over here, you can see who has done changes and you can also see how much and the changes that are happening.

Okay? It went from two conversions. We had 100 per day.

You can see all of these settings and who has done it. So sometimes in an account, if you don't know who has done something, this is the way to know and actually confront the people that they have done a mistake maybe. So we started with 100 per day.

This campaign now spends 140, okay? I scaled it a little bit. The campaign started on 27.

And we are going to watch together how it went for 7 days periods, okay? So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So 27 to 2.

Let's see. We have 1.98 on the ROAS. This is a company that is actually very happy with 2 ROAS+.

Okay? I'm getting much higher numbers like 3 and 4 ROAS with them. So they are pretty happy with me.

We have then, if you go from 28 to 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We are going to see 2.11. So we are becoming better and better day by day.

Why? Because I'm watching the amount spent over here and I'm watching the ROAS that I'm getting. Whatever is not working, I'm closing.

As you can see, I'm turning off the assets that are not working and I'm keeping the ones that are working. So let's continue. If we go from 29 to 4, 2.19.

If we go from 30 to 5, 2.42. If we go from 31 to 6, 2.90. And let's see the first week of August 2021, 3.58.

at that point most probably I started scaling a little bit. 3.26. 5.24.

So as you can understand the results were becoming better and better. Why? Because I was optimizing.

Okay? I was turning off the bad assets. I was keeping the good ones.

And I could understand that the balance that I had at that point with 100 spending, it wasn't enough basically. Okay? So I started scaling a little bit and now I'm in the point that I'm spreading 140 with very good results.

Most probably I'm going to scale more and more. When you have campaigns like this, try to scale not more than 20%. Okay?

This is something that we always say when we talk about this kind of scalings. Don't try to go more than 20% each time. Okay?

And leave one or two days period in order for the budget to actually adjust. Now, I'm going to show you one other case which is exactly the opposite. Okay?

So if we come here on the July of 2021, on 21 we can see that there's no spending in this campaign. If we go on 22, no, basically if we go on 23, 23 we can see that this campaign started spending. Now, the previous example was actually an example that we were having one campaign that was working and with a budget that we started, okay?

And then what happened is that we had good results so we started scaling with the budget of the CPO. What is going to happen if one of your campaigns has a very big budget, it's spending and you're closing ad sets but it's not having the average return on ad spend that you want. What you are going to do is that you need to find a balance.

You need to find a balance between the ads that are working and the budget that you can actually spend in order to be profitable. It's not necessary for you to spend 500 and if you're not getting the ROAS that you want. But if you spend 150 and the ROAS that you want, you can do another campaign and another campaign and another campaign.

Or actually you can see my video about relaunches on how to relaunch the same campaign and optimize it all over again. So the point here is for the CPO, if it's working, everything is good. You know, you can scale a little bit and you can close the adsets.

Of course, you can see that one CPO that is working with two ROAS, I managed to bring it to five ROAS. Because if it's working, that means that you can increase the ROAS. If it's not working though immediately with the average ROAS, it means that you need to go in a level that you will find the good ads that's working.

Minimize the budget to the level that is going to spend enough for this return on ad spend to come. And then work with this budget without increasing it so that you can have some stability for the money that you initially spent in order to actually have profits. Now, we have this campaign over here, which as you can see, it started on 22 of July with a budget of 400.

What this campaign is spending right now, if we come here, it's 130. Why? Because it wasn't working with 400, okay?

All of my adsets, they were not good. Some of them were good. I turned off the bad ones.

I kept the good ones and the good ones were able to spend 130 in order to give me the amount of money that I was actually wanting for return on ad spend. Let's see what's happening with this campaign. Let's start gathering again 7 days data.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So from 22 to 28, we can see that this campaign had 1.91. This is a company that is having a break-even return on ad spend on 1.5.

It's a clothing company and they have a lot of profit margins. So we're always aiming for 2 plus rows because they're also spending a lot of money daily. Now, I'm not within my targets with 1.91.

So let's see how we're improving. If we go from 23 to 29, we can see 1.87. It's becoming worse.

If we go from 24 to 30, 1.91. Let's go from 25 to 31, 1.78. Now it's the point that I'm starting to closing adsets and actually managing budgets.

Let's go until the start. We can see that we are starting to see some results. It means that the adsets that I'm closing, they're actually starting to...

The campaign actually start to give the budget to the ones that they are working. So I mean within my goals. 1.99.

I'm still keeping it. 2.01. So you can see that this campaign is actually starting to show some decent results.

1.94. There we go. 1.97.

It's starting to lose results. 1.77. Let's go more.

That means that now I'm in the second phase that I had some results, but it's starting to lose again results. So I need to optimize again. Let's see how that went.

1.50. It's actually dropping. 1.43.

1.57. It's starting to climb up again. 1.60.

Climb up again. 1.81. Let's continue.

This is for August. 1.89. 1.94.

2.10. We reach again the safe numbers. 2.17.

1.84. It dropped again after here. So I'm actually managing again the budget.

Okay. So it's a constant battle. Okay.

What is happening inside here? Now, if we see in the last seven days, okay, we can see that the results is 2.51. What happened is that out of the 39 ad sets as I started my campaign, I'm having...

I'm left now with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Only with 6. And what am I doing in order to define what is the budget that I can actually use is I'm going to pick them, filter them by selection. I see that I'm getting 2.51 with them.

Okay. So I'm fine. The ad sets that they are remaining and I don't want to close, they are fine.

So I'm going to click yesterday. And yesterday I can see that I spent 122. So what my budget is going to be for that?

My budget is actually going to be 130, a little bit more. Okay. So that I can have the space to spend the 122.

I want to be sure that I will spend the 122. Why is this important? Because now I have a balance.

Okay. I have a balance of amount spent and the ad sets that they can spend this amount with profitable results. And as you can see over here, in order to achieve that, I'm leaving also this, the 1.27.

I'm leaving the 1.74. One of the biggest mistakes that I see that people do is this. They don't understand that you need the quality ad sets and the junk ad sets that they are actually going to be the volume.

Okay. So you need to have both of them and you care only about the average result. You don't care about the one ad set that has 1.27 because at the end of the day, it's bringing you the balance that you want.

You need to have this. It's like having more soldiers in the battle. Okay.

Some of them are not going to be very good, but some of them that are going to be very good, they are going to make the difference. So here, it's very important to understand that you should not close all of your bad ad sets. You should keep some of them for volume.

And when you have a very good balance like now, okay, you can actually adjust the budget to what this team of ad set is actually spending so that you can keep spending the same. Another mistake is that when you have a budget of 200, for example, and you close some ad sets, you need to understand that the remaining budget, okay, that from the ad sets that you are actually turned off, the remaining budget is going to go to all the other ad sets that are actually working. This may, might disturb your balance.

That means that you might end up having a campaign, which is having ad sets that are working very well, but now you're giving them more budget because you didn't adjust the budget to your new team of ad sets and what they can spend in order to be profitable. So, in other words, you need, I know that it needs a lot of work and I know that most probably all of this is Chinese to some of you. You need to start understanding how it's working.

It's taking a lot of time. You need to spend a lot of money in order to understand how it's working. I just wanted to show you some examples and I will continue showing you examples because I believe that repeated examples are going to help you understand how this is working.

But at the end of the day, these are two different ways that CBO is actually working. Number one, it's working very well. You're having your ad sets, they're optimizing.

You can increase your ROAS at that point and start increasing a little bit your budget. If it's not working, you are starting to turning off your ad sets and you find the ones that are actually working. Remember, you are keeping also some bad ones for volume.

Okay? Because if you keep only the good ones, you might end up from spending 500 to only 50. Okay?

We want to spend more. This is why you see the average. And then you are actually adjusting the budget by always watching the last seven days in order to optimize and have a group of ad sets and the budget that together they're going to work.

That's it. This is how it's working. And one last thing that I want to mention is the ratio between the budget that you are spending on your CBO campaign and the ratio between your ad sets.

You need to know your cost per acquisition. Okay? If your cost per purchase is...

your average cost per purchase is 20, you need to understand that you need to give enough budget for each of your ad sets in order to get this amount of results. That's all that I want to say about the CBOs and the optimization. I know it's a little bit of difficult and tricky topic, but most probably we will have more videos that we are going to discuss about it.

Last note. It is totally fine to do ABO campaigns for your middle of funnel or bottom of funnel campaigns. There is no reason to push your retargeting ad sets to compete with each other.

To summarize, if you don't use CBO, you should def... You want to acquire the CBO again? Really?

In any case, use CBO at least for your call traffic campaigns. You won't regret it. Hit the like button if you liked the video and subscribe if you want to see more in the future.
