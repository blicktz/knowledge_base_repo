Zoho so Zoho has their own university and the graduates of that make up 15% of their workforce shit which is pretty insane so a hundred they have about a thousand maybe they have more than a thousand people so first follow-up on last time I was talking about corporate universities I'm gonna keep talking about anything education because I just love it I had a lot of people reach out to me about that really okay so I went back to my notes I already had these notes but I just wanted to mention a couple of them so hamburger you that's the McDonald's one 19 full-time professors I thought that was interesting there's I don't know how you say this crotonville that's from General Electric so Kaiser just opened up their own med school which I find really interesting because it's what that's exactly what I was talking about where you want your own pipeline of doctors so you create your own med school then some companies do it more like training Apple University Deloitte University I think those are more like just a training program so you could be a better employee that's that's different bigger another one that I thought was interesting so we talked about Zoho so Zoho has their own University and the graduates of that make up 15% of their work for shit which is pretty insane so a hundred they have about a thousand maybe they have more than a thousand people I'm not sure exactly how many total that is the Google IT support certificate has 75,000 graduated students which is pretty crazy so I think this is gonna be a big trend so where's the opportunity to be a company that can create these education so I think what you can do is so there's these companies that are called what the hell are they called I know one is called to you or something like that that's the name of one of their companies so there's a set of companies that what they're doing is they say hey University hey Berkeley you should have an online degree and for years universities were not so interested in this and then they saw how much money gets made by online degrees and so they're like okay we'll take that money and so they don't want to you know Berkeley doesn't want to have to sit there and build out an online degree portal that has like the technology the service acquire students like Berkeley doesn't know how to do any of that shit right so there's a couple there's three big companies that basically go to these universities and they say hey do you want to offer an online degree we think it brings this much incremental revenue to your University and we will run the whole thing for you so you don't have to lift a finger and here's the but we want you know 30% of the of the tuition revenue and right so what happened is all the university said yes so there's a billion dollar company that's doing this that basically offers this to all the universities so there's if you go look all these you know traditional universities now have a online degree or certificate certificate program that they offer and it's run by these other companies I forgot the name of what these companies are called there's like some generic term but I think you could be that for corporations and so I think you could go to a corporation and say hey would you like to basically have your own you know developer boot camp or university for you know essentially we're gonna pop out people who are like management consultant types and it's good for your brand to get students early and anytime you hire one of them we take essentially recruiter fee and we'll run the whole thing for you and so I think that's one where you could take advantage of this trend
