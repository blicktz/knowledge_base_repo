we were going to talk i was going to talk about this a few weeks ago okay so um when i moved to san francisco i started a book club called the anti-mba and i did it because i didn't go to an an elite ivy league school but i was always envious of those people because when i moved here i didn't know a single soul and i felt i always like stereotyped people as like tall beautiful white teeth with patagonias and they had like lovely networks that's what you saw all around yeah just like these like rich white people who that's how i was like right that's how i imagined it and it kind of was that um and i was always envious of that so what i did was i created a book club meeting where we would meet every week and we would read one book a month and i would convince an expert how'd you convince people to join this where'd you throw it up on your blog i'm just a cold email guy i just learned how to cold email people and i i did it online so each week we would have 30 people show up and i probably had an email list of 5 000 people who would so this was not in person this is all online 30 people in person sieva yeah um all a lot of my best friends i met this way 30 people um my friend had an office and he let me use it and um we would just meet up and i would and i would read a week ahead of time and just make notes and lead the discussion and sometimes we would have an expert okay and then i would send show notes or meeting notes to the list and people loved it i made close to no money off of it or i don't think i made any money off of it i just did it for fun and it was very success successful and a lot of people said that we should make it a thing i think it's a stupid i thought it was a stupid idea but book clubs are actually kind of interesting so there's this uh business called book of the month club it was started and i believe it was started in the 1930s at this point it's owned by uh it was owned by bertelsman which is a large publisher a multi-billion dollar publisher and then recently a private individual bought it for single digit millions of dollars um in in the 40s 50s and 60s this was massive i mean it was uh millions of people paid for it so it's quite a large business hundreds of millions of dollars probably in the 60s and 70s uh it's gone away once amazon came around um a guy bought it a couple years ago and it's quite large still and what they do is uh score down a little bit this is 90 million users what the hell no that's good reads oh that's good reads and so book of the month club now has a hundred thousand active paying customers wow which means they're in the revenue range of 10 to 15 million a year in recurring revenue and they the founder said in an interview he uh his goal is to grow 5x a year for 5x a year nice for the next year not consistently i don't know if that's i think that's bogus but uh book of the month is kind of an interesting thing i suspect i've always thought that it would would not work now my opinion has changed so goodreads has 100 million users there's this thing called the wattpad have you heard of wattpad i've heard of it yeah wattpad a lot of people don't know about it wattpad it's owned by a guy in canada and they have 400 employees it's a multiple hundred million dollar a year business i believe they it's a book club for it's not a book club it's more right on it you you write original stories yeah but it's their category is romantic middle middle america romance novels so if you're uh a 40 year old woman you probably have heard of wattpad you're saying that's the most popular category or yeah but it's pretty much all they do oh really okay it's basically for women who it's like men do video porn romance novels is woman porn i mean that's basically what it is um and so a huge business and now i'm quite bullish now on these book clubs yeah reese witherspoon has a book club my wife uses it my sister so many people have you heard of this no i haven't heard about sunshine some fucking thing but oprah had hers but hers wasn't a paid membership but this is really smart like what you're describing i'm like oh this is good and i think you gotta have um probably not gotta have but it's advantageous here to have a brand like a reese witherspoon or whoever jennifer aniston or gwyneth paltrow or whoever or like the hustle could do a book club you could do a book club like i think that you have to have a a bit of cachet to organize people around to get the energy going that initial energy you need so here's one angle you buy the rights to the book which is expensive yeah why would you do that well because i think the margins in books are quite small i've talked to tim ferris about this he told me that he earns um i he didn't say that he didn't tell me this but he told me i mean i think that he does about a million a month in revenue off his podcast and he told me that he this is what he did tell me he has made 10 times more money off the podcast than all of his books combined right so i i don't think people get paid a lot of money for books the margins so it might be a cheap asset you're saying yeah i think it's quite cheap um so i would want my goal would be to buy the rights to the book and make it popular you know who um have you heard of um there's this company that owns uh the company that owns proactive it's called uh got um i know what you're talking about it's the skincare it's a direct marketing company they the guy who owns it it's a quite large business he got his start because he bought the rights to think and grow rich oh really and he helped make it popular again oh wow through infomercials so that's what i would do is i would want to buy the rights to all the books um and there's another company called mentor box that does this and tai lopez is one of the owners so it's incredibly scammy i mean like you sign up for like 20 and then it rolls into like a 400 a month thing it's like fucking stupid um but book clubs are super interesting to me so would you do this uh like if you were going to do this now how would you attack it what would you do so you'd buy the rights you'd buy the rights to which books if i wanted to bootstrap it no you can't how would you do it so what i would do is i would look at what vinyl me please vinyl me please is my friend's business it's a uh probably a couple million bucks a month subscription thing so what you do is you give them 50 a month and they send you a vinyl once a month right and so i would do that but for a particular type of category so what i would do is i would create a facebook group and i would say it's 30 or 50 a month and we're going to read one book a month i'm going to get one expert to come and talk about the book uh each week or each month we're going to do in a facebook group and i'm going to send you notes about the whole book and what uh category do you think you choose would you do the romance novel or would you do business or would you do well just because i have such a network in business that i could just crush it right off the bat but romance novels i know this from experience because i've invested in these types of things romance novels have the have the highest liquidity uh p as in people consume them the most right so i would like voracious readers five five times the number of books read romance category is probably one of the most it's probably the most popular category on kindle yeah i bet you it is so okay me personally i would start here but if i even slightly was interested in romance novels i would and i like what this guy did uh buying the rights to the book of the month club for you know some a popular asset that's sort of decayed over the last 30 years and uh see if you can revitalize it on the cheap i think these are interesting businesses there's so many books that i love that are written in the 60s and 70s and you try to buy them on amazon and they're hundreds of dollars because they've just been forgotten and they don't reprint them right um i just tried to buy a book the other day for that that someone mentioned on twitter and it was 900 what book it was so i just tweeted about agora that the scammy um company um uh which we can talk about if we want but the it was all about copywriting it was 900 bucks uh let's go you
