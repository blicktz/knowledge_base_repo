all right sam why are we dressed so festive it's casual friday baby it's casual friday and the best stuff is always in the group chat and these are the things that i sent in the group chat that i wouldn't post publicly but decided you know what it's casual friday let's air them out all right can we do the first one the first one here it is okay this is a tweet from dylan dylan says at long last any app can be your alarm app apple has finally introduced alarm kit this is at the the apple announcement that happened this week that lets any app have the same privileges as the clock app this is long overdue dylan you are absolutely right dude i did not understand this is this a joke no this is real so basically you know like apple gives you certain permissions right if you're an app you can send push notifications you could use the camera you could use the gps but for a long time no app could become your alarm app it couldn't access the same features of an alarm app which is like now any app you don't just have to use the apple alarm app anybody could build an app for alarm sounds i don't understand yeah this does sound small so change my mind why is this important so think about it this way there's like two billion people with iphones and you know not every app can address all two billion people but an alarm clock can basically address like a billion or two people who actually have the need for an alarm clock so what happened was two weeks ago or you know a week ago as an app developer you that was not a category you could be in and now it's a category you could be in where there's a billion active users that might want your app and there's been no creativity and no innovation so like the app store has been not been out for you know 15 years now so a lot of stuff is solved right camera apps are pretty good map apps are pretty good with google maps and ways and you know ride sharing apps there's all kinds of apps and there's been tons of innovation but this has been basically artificially blocked wait really quick do you remember the the joke of peter teal where he said you wanted flying cars but you got 190 characters like for twitter this isn't even 140 140 this is the even worse version of that you wanted flying cars now you can make alarm apps you wanted ai instead you got a snooze button by the way i met the guy who wrote that line for uh i didn't meet it but i i i found out who wrote that line for peter teal wait wait wait wait wait you met him okay you you mistakenly said you met him versus you heard about i met a guy who was like that's the guy who wrote that that's peter's guy he he comes up with those and that was his job was basically follow peter around listen to what he's saying and then try to like transform his sentiment into something really punchy and that guy came up with that line which became the basis for like founders fun and like a rally cry that's cool well tell him good job all right so check this out easy idea david goggins would you like a million dollars because david goggins today should pay some kid to make the alarm app that's basically the david goggins skinned alarm app like i want to wake up with david goggins just saying wake up bitch there's miles to run and i just want to hear that when i wake up and not like you know the default alarm sound for the for my phone are there uh when is this going live when when's this alarm kit thing so they did the developer preview that's what wwdc is right they tell you what's possible and you can start building with it but it's not like available yet to customers but it usually i think it's just like a couple months it's like not not very long this is low-hanging fruit my friend it's good idea it's a good idea yeah this fruit that might just be on the ground actually this might be rotting fruit i'm not not entirely sure um all right next one we go by the way we're totally stealing this gimmick from our boys at tbpn shout out to john and jordy part of the brotherhood but i gave them a shout out later on one of my one of my uh photos or tweets is from them which is yeah they basically had the the true innovation in the podcasting industry of printing out the tweets and uh we decided that we too shall now print out tweets um but i've been doing five three tuesday for a lot longer than those guys so i i think i'm okay all right uh this one comes from chris bachy he says this is a chris bachy banger he says in 2022 mckenzie paid 55 million dollars was paid 55 million dollars to advise warner brothers uh when they merged with discovery they charged them 37 million by advising them to change hbo to hbo max then to max then back to hbo max and in 2025 they build them an additional 63 million again to determine that warner brothers and discovery should be separate brands again did you see that mckenzie last week laid off uh 15 of their staff because of ai because now like ai can do half the job or what uh is that why sure yeah for sure this is this is absolutely insane what did you say you're allergic to lack of common sense this is ridiculous this is exactly the sort of lack of common sense i was talking about this tweet has 70 000 likes by the way um i don't know if you totally made up these numbers or if these are true but directionally correct there were some good reactions to this greg greg tweeted don't be the problem be the solution that creates the problem that is my takeaway yeah it is pretty ridiculous have you ever had friends that have worked at mckenzie yeah yeah uh my buddy romaine who i do a bunch of business stuff with he was a former mckenzie guy they're easy to make fun of because you're like what does a 23 year old know about business but like i have a friend that worked there and she had some pretty amazing like basically a pe firm in her case identified like a bunch of dairy farms that they wanted to like roll up and so they bought a bunch of them the pe firm did and then they hired mckenzie folks to come and figure out how to make it more efficient and so she literally would go to iowa every single week for about six months and devise interesting things like for example we're going to change the bucket size that we like use that the workers to use like like really interesting things like have you seen landman yes yeah when like the lawyer shows up on the like on the oil field and she's like got her high heels like stuck in the mud basically that's what i'm imagining the mckenzie consultants showing up at the uh the cattle farm it was kind of great it's like i learned about this whole this whole experience she had and there is value that is created from these consultants even though we like to make fun of them have you did ramin actually work on anything interesting well they deserve to be made fun of because they're incredibly smart they get paid very well so you know that means you're a punching bag right yeah that's basically the criteria for like oh it's free game right it's like what a nerd was in middle school it's like the opposite traits right like the person you could give a swirly to in in sort of junior high would be like somebody who's sort of weak and powerless but when you grow up you can't make fun of the weak and powerless you only make fun of the powerful and yeah so yeah ramin was like this basically he would tell me things that they would do and i'm like oh that's really smart i was kind of hoping you guys were a bunch of idiots but actually that sounds pretty good but what i did come away with was they have huge brains but small balls is generally like the person who stays in consulting and that's like uh which by the way that's the definition of anxiety is when you're uh the definition of anxiety is when your uh brain is a lot bigger than your balls so that's probably why there's a bunch of anxious consultants running around i like how you just i like how you're just saying something is the definition of it's absolutely not the definition of and that's hilarious i'm gonna start doing that well well you know the root word of that and then you just make it up it's not even the root word all right we got a couple more reactions our boy tai lopez comes in comes in hot off the top ropes a good gig you know it's you know it's a good scam when tai lopez is giving you giving you respect oh these are all replies to that original one okay i didn't even i wasn't even following that yeah we're learning that's insane and what about this one this is the consulting uh meme uh consulting if you're not a part of the solution there's really good money to be made in prolonging the problem there's this thing that happens in sports that i've always wanted to be a part of business so you know in the ufc how they have press conferences where they really talk about each other and i've always felt like yeah it's the best part and you know i wish business people would do the same like i wish right now i've got it by the wars they're awesome you've been to the press conferences i've been one time i tried to sneak in when i ran the hustle like i would try to like get i couldn't get credit i was like let me see if i can get credential to this and they didn't give it to me and so i showed up anyway and they kicked me out so i i went like they made me walk to the back and like sit with the crowd and i and i watched it yeah it was great they didn't respect the hustle as a newsletter as a media brand dude the the hustle is the worst name ever when you're trying to hustle someone like i was sure do you know what i mean it was just like some random security guard and she my name is john scam hoping you would tell me your coinbase password it was the worst like the lady like giggled at me and it was like a it was a pathetic laugh it was like it's so no i got kicked out it did not work but if anyone's listening who works at the ufc if you and i could get credentialed to go to a ufc event and ask a question i would do that in a heartbeat and i would take it incredibly seriously arguably too seriously might ruin the whole event all right i read a ton i would say almost a book a week and the reason i read so much is because my philosophy towards reading is i want to see what worked for the winners that i love and what strategies they use and then i want to see what mistakes uh did they all make what were the common flaws that they all had and i just want to avoid that and so hubspot asked me to put together a list of the books that have changed my life so far in 2025 and i did that so i listed out seven books that made a meaningful difference in my life and i explained what the difference is that they had on me or what actions i took because of the book and then also i listed out my very particular ways of reading because i'm pretty strategic about how i read and how i read so much and how i remember what i read and things like that and so i put this together in a very simple guide it's seven books that had a huge impact on my life and you can scan the qr code below if you want to read it or there's a link you guys know what to do there's a link in the description just go ahead and click it and you'll see the guide that i made so it's the seven books that had a massive change in my life this year so far and then also how i'm able to read so much so check it out below all right what what do you have next do the frank sleutman one this is actually related to what i was just talking about so frank sleutman who is the uh the man's man ceos he's the david goggins of the corporate world would you agree yeah i mean he's pretty baller uh he's he kind of says it like it is for people don't know he took over he's been a ceo of a bunch of companies but he took over at snowflake and he has all these famous memos that he wrote on linkedin and it was basically like don't be a work hard like that's like how he summarizes everything yeah but it's a little bit different so he's got this book called amp it up but if you really you could just read his blog post called amp it up and get 80 of the idea it's not even just about working hard it's like pick up the pace pick up the there's his basic point is that in every organization there's an incredible amount of slack that's just built up it's an expectation of timelines of rigor of of effort of everything and then another one of those is common sense and like his approach is just to cut through all the and so he has this quote where he's like talking about the man in the you know that famous like man in the arena quote yeah it's kind of i i kind of think that uh that quote is super lame now it's been hijacked by people i don't like i know chamath is what you're saying yeah yeah was people a singular word all right here we go so here's what frank slutman says he says there's lots of people in this world who are not really in the arena they're either observers consultants or agents or vcs that just provide capital but there are some people who are in the arena they're very special people and then he says he talks about he was asked to speak at a business school where they always ask for his advice he says you all have elite educations you'll have many job offers paying you big bucks your parents and siblings will be incredibly proud of you but they're all consulting jobs for bain mckinsey and companies like that you're going to have an easy path to pretty quick earnings but you'll never know whether you have what it takes to actually build something new in roosevelt's words you will be those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat i had actually never read that part of the of the quote and i thought that part's way colder than the than the the rest of it you know what i mean imagine saying this to a room full of stanford kids it's like that's i wonder what that what do you think the reaction would have been like i think the reaction would have been like god he's so right after i finish up this first four-year tenure at mckenzie then i'm totally gonna do that i think that's the real the true reaction it's like he's so right i'm not actually gonna rescind the i'm not actually withdraw the job offer i'm i'll finish up i'm gonna make sure i get the few years and then i'm gonna go do that thing someday i've hung out with like my friends children or you know people who are like in the applying to college age right now it's way different than when we were younger like when we were younger not going to college for a huge majority of people for anyone that's like a middle class on up it was like that wasn't even a question now it definitely seems like the smart people are saying i'm not sure what my i'm weighing my options i'm trying to look at all that's available have you noticed that no is that like and when you say that they're thinking about like trade school or dropping out or everything's on the table yeah so for people are their parents entrepreneurs or no the people people the people who i know it's just like um it's like let's say cousins and nephews and things like that and um like they're mostly like well to do or at least like have a household income of two hundred thousand dollars and it's basically like this and these are smart kids so typically when we were younger sean the smart kids like always went to college now the smart kids are like i'm not sure you know i i've been in contact with this company about just going getting an insurance internship right away right at 19 years old um other people who are less of the academic like they're they're not like the geniuses they are considering trade school and it's not nearly looked like when i was younger if you said you're going to trade school it was like it was like uh is that like punishment for getting in trouble do you know what i mean oh you're dumb yeah now i think there is a there is 100 a change in sentiment well that's and i wonder i wonder if like this whole mbas are dumb that's a new feeling ish that's like peter teal was the one who popularized that where he said for he goes the valuation of your company take a million dollars off for every mba uh employee you have and so now that's popular and i wonder the mba people who are there now and who would hear something like this how they feel if they acknowledge it or if they don't right that bitter tool quote is like how that's like my parenting style i'm like one more word one more word and we're not going to the pool for two days oh oh three days and i just keep going i'm just like if you say one more thing and you lose a little bit more do you stick with it there's all kinds of retrades dude i'm i'm trump i'm trump in the china deal right now wait you let your kids trade i raise the tariffs and then there's a temporary pause for extenuating circumstances while we negotiate and then we have some really good interactions and then we start thinking and then they come back again and they do something you know they just throw their spaghetti on the floor and then we're back at 125 percent terror what age does punishment work because right now when they do something i say no it's just like they laugh at me they can start to understand like cause and effect or consequences somewhere between two and three years old i think you start to get it at a very basic level but you also have to time it so like if the kid is emotionally upset or is feeling something they're not going to learn the lesson in the moment or they're having to fit whereas like i think as adults we're like well this is why i would try to like explain the thing while they're like you know having their meltdown it's like you have to have let the meltdown happen and then if you want to have a teaching moment it's like gotta come after which is probably true for adults too but it's like very obvious with kids because they're literally melting down i gotta figure this out because i yeah i've been trying to like punish her not punish her be like no you can't do this right and i just get laughed at um all right read the next one so uh this is one of yours so it's a david senra uh tweet and he says charlie munger told me flex charlie munger told me to read les schwab's autobiography i'm glad i did because less says things like this quote success in life is being a good husband a good father and when and you end up being a second father to hundreds of other men and women last night i attended a wedding of a young man from our office and the young man told me that two men had influenced his life his father and me that's worth more than money so this guy les schwab is amazing i haven't completed his book but i'm in the middle of reading it but let me tell you about this guy so go to the dumb dumb question is less so there's charles schwab no relation okay he's he's he he was a hillbilly in oregon basically uh he was like orphaned at the age of like 13 or 14 uh was like a plumber and then started a tire shop at the age of 31 or 32 didn't know anything about tires but started a tiger shop eventually over the course of 50 years it grew into a multi-billion dollar operation and he's famous for being really great at incentivizing employees and he's famous for being very good at managing and leading to the point where warren buffett and charlie munger looked to stories for uh from him on how to properly lead and incentivize and then go to the next slide look at what he looks like so he was a hillbilly uh he was uh he was a he was like a from the streets type of guy i've been thinking about how i can describe these types of people because i love them and i think the best way to describe it is small town grit with big number swagger something like that like these guys that you and i love who are these like blue collar so small town grit with big city swagger no with like big number swagger so it's like these guys big city swagger right but what i mean is is that they're like these kind of hillbillies who build these massive companies and so they can they make like for example one of our friends kevin van trump is one of them where you see this guy and he comes off and he's like um hey what's going on brother i gotta go wrap my newsletter and he like he like talks like this but like turns out he makes like 20 million dollars a year and like the people who read his newsletter um he'll you know kevin's this big guy from um kansas city comes off like like a hillbilly because he talks funny but he his work is read by like you know the world leaders and he makes 20 million dollars a year and in the background of his video zoom call is like a picasso so like i love guys like this and this guy is one of them so les schwab started a tire company he died in his 90s but ran the company up until then grew to a multi-billion dollar organization and i want to go to the next one i want to read he wrote the his own forward to the book and i highlighted my two favorite sentences from the forward read that all right so asar see just says this book is mainly written for the 2 000 families that make their living selling les swab tires and for the thousands of families to follow in the next 20 30 40 years all right so he says this is what you highlighted i wrote this in november and december of 1985. i did write this 100 with my 40 year old typewriter i do think jan nolan my right hand gal lorraine o'hara our word our word processing operator for helping me correct misspelled words and helping me with punctuation i didn't have a gross writer i wanted it in my own words and then it says basically in this i'm going to pass on my theories of business to our people and he says should we fail to follow these policies towards customers and employees going forward i would prefer that my name be taken off the business and then it ends with he basically says if you're not interested in business this book will bore you and if i were you i wouldn't waste my time reading it how great is that how much of a simpleton am i that it's just here's you want to win me here you go push me away that's all it takes oh you think i won't like this book watch me read every word it's called already buying a second copy treat them mean keep them keen yeah that's all you gotta do why am i so easy to manipulate how how beautiful is this guy uh so you read this book is it like i'm in the middle of reading it yeah so far seven out of ten fine and forgettable eight out of ten i'll remember the big idea but that's kind of it i didn't need 300 pages nine out of ten really enjoyed it good book ten out of ten i'm giving this book out as gifts where is it at uh i'm only a quarter of the way through and it's between an eight and a nine yeah an eight and a nine yeah quite what's the big idea so far he just treats people well and if you treat people well you get rewarded in return so it's it's it's it's a very simple thing which is you said there's a lack of common sense he's a very common sense rational person but often rational means cold and he is he is rational warm oh warm rational okay that's cool that's a good insight because your start of your answer was kind of boring but the end of your answer was fire there that was good so it's sort of like his original quote which was uh i went to i i became a father to all these people and i go to their weddings and that makes me feel great that is a rational thing to say and and it is warm versus you know what a mckenzie consultant would say which is it's all just about these numbers on a spreadsheet that is also rational but it's rational cold yes so do you honest question do you think that you're you kind of are doing that do you think that you have that kind of like i'm a a fatherly influence or a man influence on other men uh you know is that something you think is true or take pride in are you like yes i need to double down on that from this podcast because like remember when we were at this dinner or you weren't there but i was at a dinner and i told you about it like this guy came up you know at the end of the dinner he's like hey sorry i wanted to say hi i saw you guys over here i didn't want to bother you but he's like because i always ask people i say what you know what do you really like about the potter like what is it you know what's stood out to you what's helped you and he was like he had basically mentioned he's like me and my girlfriend got pregnant we didn't plan on that but hearing you and sam talk about like kind of how fun it is to have kids and build your business and they're not like either ors like kind of nudged me towards deciding like you know we should keep this we should do this and i remember being like whoa that's like a lot of responsibility a lot of weight on the words that i didn't really sort of think about that's what i was thinking about do you feel like that yeah i do i i think it's hard to feel that way because if people knew how we record this we're just in our rooms like by ourselves talking to each other on a screen so it's hard to like feel a presence but i think that um i view this podcast as well as my company i view it a little bit more as a a very tiny way to decide the life that i want to live with others and just make that reality in my small corner of the world i also think that like i thought about like we are not even remotely like this so it i don't even love saying it but like when lebron james or some famous athlete does something bad and they're like i didn't sign up to be a role model i think about that all the time where i'm like well i used to like tweet some something that was a little bit mean and i'm like well i don't care if this influences me this is just me this is this is just my opinion and then now i'm like uh you know it holds a little bit of weight i want to make sure that i i'm right about it and not hateful right right and you know the best thing that ever like the best thing about a podcast is that it feels like i'm just talking to you and we're just goofing off here and there's only two of us but like you know let's say this episode on average these episodes get like you know 300 000 people listening to them i mean that's bigger than the biggest college football stadiums you know what i mean like if we if we were sitting in the 50 yard line and there was three stadiums stacked on top of it it'd be like almost three or four stadiums of people stacked on top of each other do you know how differently we would do this like it would suck i would i would be so nervous and thinking about every word and the show would honestly suck if it was if it felt that way and so i think one of the real blessings is that that's not the case you don't you don't know it you're blind to it we rarely record in real life and one time that we did there was a uh the studio manager was a woman who was really attractive and i noticed that one time one of us or maybe i forget who said something that made her laugh and i was like oh that felt nice i want to i want to make you laugh again and then and then she didn't laugh and i was like that didn't feel good i started like performing really poorly i'm like i can't stand the the presence of one person let alone uh 300 000 in real life that's crazy all right next uh next story i want to show you did you see this did you see this tweet no here's what it says so this is from at restructuring which is a good it's a good account by the way do you follow this account no is this all about companies that have gone out of business no it's kind of like pe it's like a pe type of account uh they treat private equity type of stuff anyways um oh we talked about this a while ago i believe didn't we so i i think we mentioned it but i didn't i didn't know the story so the headline here is man steals 122 million dollars from facebook and google simply by sending them random bills which they agreed to pay why is that a crime why is that a crime exactly this the tweet here is this remains my favorite path to wealth exploring exploiting the big company inefficiencies should not be illegal uh i agree it all's fair in love and war if you if i send you an invoice and you pay it am i at fault or you hold on what's going on here but there is a little more to the story so have you read about how this actually worked no well uh wasn't he like legitimately a vendor for them no no i think that was a little bit of the problem um okay so here's the story so there's a 50 year old dude the guy who's in cuffs here and he was impersonating a company so there was a company called quanta computer that's a legit company that was a vendor for facebook and google he sets up a company also called quanta computer but bases it out of latvia and so he just copies the same company name the same logo but it's incorporated in a different country and he starts making fake invoices contracts letters corporate stamps corporate seals and he's sending these to facebook and google for over two years and he got paid out 122 million dollars across the two companies so 98 million from facebook and 23 million from google they then find him in latvia extradite him and here's a great quote from the u.s attorney so the guy's name i guess it's rima ramosauskas so ramosauskas thought he could hide behind a computer screen halfway across the world while he conducted his fraudulent scheme but he has learned the arms of the american justice system are long and he now faces time in a u.s prison dude how hard is this guy this u.s attorney that's amazing by the way i think he still made out good he had to give back he had to forfeit 49 million and he had to pay another i think 26 million in restitution that doesn't add up to 122 million so he might have still made a bunch of money what conversation do you have with your wife or you're like so what do you do what do you do uh guy you know what i mean today i kind of want to get him on the pod jail pod a rare category of illegal but impressive no yeah yeah yeah yeah which like it's like the like the bernie madoff scheme not cool and impressive like uh you know what i'm wondering like i want to learn more about it right right and if you judge us for saying impressive and illegal like do you like oceans 11 because that those guys are right here rooting for the guys who are robbing uh anyways all right here we go so uh what else we got oh i have uh something here on chat gpt have you seen this okay so chat gpt's product retention curves is a product manager's wet dream their one month retention has skyrocketed from less uh from less than 60 percent two years ago to an unprecedented 90 percent youtube was best in class with 85 six month retention is trending towards 80 and rapidly rising generational product okay so this little line chart here if for people who don't really recognize this imagine when you're at a hospital and they hook the patient up and you have the heart monitor and you see that heartbeat that line and it's got to keep beeping for the patient to be good right and you have all these these monitors with these little lines well this is the equivalent of that for a company so what this is is a retention curve so the the line at the very bottom here would be like the oldest cohort so that's like people who signed up for chat gpt two years ago and as you can see it starts at 100 of people using it on day zero or month zero but then even by month one it's at 60 by month two only 55 are still using it and by the time you get to a year you know less than it looks like 30 of people are still using the product so that means more than two-thirds of people just stopped using it after they tried it and that's the sign of a product that will never win um because or that won't win as is because you're too the bucket is too leaky you know you're getting too many customers in that are that are churning out they're not finding value in the product and what this curve or the other lines are are the next month the next month the next one as they improve the product you can see that the drop offs are way less so now what he's saying is that basically the one month retention is now 90 percent so people are finding so much value the first month that they use it that a month later 90 of them are still using it and um so this is how this is like the key metric for most businesses is retention that's the thing that tells you if your business is going to be around for a long time or if it's just a leaky bucket and seeing this with chat gpt is pretty stunning and it kind of leads into my next tweet here which is that open ai is now at 10 billion in arr so that's 2x since the end of 2024 so they basically doubled revenue from 5 billion to 10 billion and it's been less than three years since it launched so in less than three years they've grown this product to 10 billion dollars in recurring revenue which is just stunning and it highlighted to me one one very big takeaway from this which is that open ai is the facebook of this current generation maybe more 20 years ago it was google and amazon were the big deal that was that was it 30 years ago it was like microsoft 20 years ago it was like google and amazon maybe 15 years ago or so you know it was that was the facebook era and facebook was the thing that was like oh it's a billion dollar company a fit 10 billion dollar company and now it's a trillion dollar company well the one right now is uh is open ai for the next decade it's gonna we're just gonna me and you are probably gonna look at ourselves and be like how are we doing this podcast how are we looking at these tweets these charts and just like why didn't we go buy open ai stock like how dumb do we have to be like it was on sarah's list three years ago or something like that wait was it really did we talk about it then maybe not three but two for sure like i think i think the very first uh sarah's list episode we probably had them on there and it's like i was like what what kind of doofuses are we that we don't own any of this stock can can you own it yeah you can buy it in secondary i uh i had a buddy of mine about two or three years ago he was at my house you know who this guy is and we were uh talking and he was like yeah i have a job offer from neural link and open ai and i was like wow those are both pretty promising what do you and he was like what should i do and we just had a conversation about it and i didn't know anything i mean though at the time it was really hard like they're both like run by tycoons they're both really interesting they're about the hot startup and he chose open ai and he has made so much money just in and to it like tens of millions of dollars in the in like two and a half or three years just from being like the 1000th employee something like that like like nothing like it it's just astounding at how big this is and what is his job is he uh he's not like he's kind of like the rare ai phd type dudes right is he a pro is he a programmer is he a product person what's this what's the role product person yeah product person uh sorry sorry uh programmer he's a programmer okay massive difference uh yeah i was gonna say if you're a product guy and you made tens of millions of dollars opening eye how's that even possible if you're just like you know random person engineers okay i guess i can see it you know you get a you get a stock package that's worth two million dollars over four years but you got it when opening i was valued at 60 billion and now it's valued at 400 billion right so it's it's up you know 8x or something like that and so your two million dollar stock package has turned out to actually be a 16 million dollar stock package it's crazy that that's a normal thing that happens that's happened to like a thousand people right now or more in uh like in a in a like 30 mile radius of where i live this was sort of an on we kind of like glazed over this but basically uh harley from shopify was on the pod and he at one point they were worth 250 i think when we recorded with them they were with 150 billion dollars and it's basically like the hundredth largest company in the world right now which means it's like the like the hundredth largest company probably ever ever created it's like around the like so every business ever created it is the 100th most valuable which is which is astounding right that's an astounding number to think that open ai is a lesson it's a it's a decade old or something like that company and it is already like the 50th or 25th largest company ever created isn't that astounding not even from like a product or the technology but literally how do you organize that like organize the people who work there organize the investors just the organizational you know they say like uh just the idea of like you know you have heard the stories about china building like a a fast railroad in like you know six months like it's it's it's it's sort of fascinating like that it's definitely the number one most valuable non-profit ever is it still really a non-profit uh i think so and he said they're not gonna he also said they're not gonna make a profit until they hit uh what did he say he goes we can't make a profit until we get to 10 billion in revenue or something remember my thing earlier about like just push me away their investor thing which is like listen we have to put a cap a hundred x cap on your returns because this is gonna get bananas so dude that pitch the balls it takes to have that as your pitch which is like um instead of promising upside saying listen we're gonna need to cap your upside because it's gonna be so insane how much value we create um so i just need to make sure you're okay with that i'm gonna start using that just like i'm gonna start using that formal formula in my life skip to the this elon one yeah all right why don't you frame this one up all right so uh the uh breaking news president trump comments on elon musk's apology i thought it was very nice that he said that trump says and elon musk has a tweet that says i regret some of the posts about president trump last week they went too far insane this is insane you can't do that and apologize right there is you don't apologize like dude if i called you a a a pedophile or a rapist in front of literally the entire world right i can't say i'm sorry there's no there's no sorry big enough you're saying dude when genghis con doesn't apologize like when you do like can you imagine napoleon being like hey that one it went a little far do you want to like shake it out like oh you're saying conquerors can't apologize that's the take that was a uh such a crazy thing to do and say and he tweeted it out uh very casually where he said have a nice day donald trump like you know what i mean like it was so it was it was such a a dagger you can't apologize for that i i don't see how you can come back from that and i don't see why you would even try right well i could see why you would try which is like you know you well there's no winners at war basically is what what's gonna happen here with these guys fighting but uh and then look at the next one dude the the elon knows i love him no no hold on i'm open to rick reconciling with elon after seeing his latest post elon knows i love him jd knows this too that's just hilarious by the the way i don't even know why that's in there jd knows this too i give the best and biggest reconciliations everybody knows this that is incredible i don't even know if this is fake by there this could totally be a fake truth post because there's nothing easier to fake than a truth social post because nobody has nobody i know has an account on there and so you can just write anything and make me tell me that he tweeted that and plus he's he might say he might he could totally have said this uh but dude how funny is this elon knows i love him jd knows this too what's that i don't know i think it's because uh jd was on uh theo von's podcast talking about it i mean are they not talking day to day and then he goes i give the biggest and best reconciliations dude it's insane melania knows this it's insane man it's just crazy this is a reality show this is by the way we need to clip in you calling this on the podcast that they would break up you were like how long do you give this and it was like a couple months or something and i was like well i don't know they're both like pretty all in on each other it seems like it's gonna be really hard to it'd be really messy if they try to break this off and you're like rule number one from the 48 laws of power right is that what you were quoting you were like never outshine the master yeah and i also said they're gonna break up in june i said it's gonna only last until june wow frankly like what a waste of an incredible prediction yeah i mean it's like being the tallest midget like it's not that interesting but like it was a very easy prediction this was i we knew that it was gonna have they were gonna have a falling out and i had you know a eight percent chance of guessing the month it was very predictable but i this was sort of one of those moments where like i remember where i was when it happened when i saw that when i saw that tweet we were my company had a meeting and everyone said oh my god it it it was pretty crazy how elon and trump fighting it brought down the stock market did you see that yeah it was absolutely ridiculous that my finances were impacted by this spat and i thought that that i thought it was kind of funny it was a it was a wild day the memes that day were incredible i think i tweeted that out i was like listen this is a sad day for america but the content is outstanding right now let's talk self-driving real quick so self-driving cars are on fire in uh la they're the rioters are beating up the self-driving cars not sure exactly why but i like this one from andrew ackerman nodded at the waymo in downtown dc so it would know i'm one of the good ones have you developed a relationship with your ai i mean i don't like to say that but yeah like my voice changed on my chat gpt like the talking voice and i had to like i was like i felt uncomfortable talking to her because i had gotten close to the other one so i had i had so i had to change it back and so he's joking but not really right i mean this is kind of like the uh sometimes i pray to god even though i don't believe but just in case uh there's definitely an element of that with ai where i'm like i'm gonna say please and thank you you know just in case just in case things get a little crazy have you taken away mo yeah they're amazing have you no they don't have them in uh in connecticut it's not exactly uh like the best place to try it out but no i i i think they're amazing everyone says they're amazing go to that one go to the uh the eric one i think this is like an inspirational one so check this out so uh i i met eric so eric eric's the ceo of a company called ramp which like has grown to like a six billion dollar valuation in like four or five years and he was telling me about uh tp what is it what's it called tbpn what's it what stand for the tech bros podcast network i don't know what that actually stands they tried to change it so it's not bro technology brothers i think it's called like the business podcast i think that's what they changed it but it'll always be technology brothers to me go on so it's this guy named um jordy and john coogan uh they're fantastic they have this new podcast um it's more like a it's more like a like a daily news show not even a podcast but like a video show it's not even a show it's basically they they do do stuff but you don't even need to watch the show it's all clips for twitter so it's like twitter is like short shorts and clips is what they what they make they're hilarious and uh they had i was at eric's office and i said what's this and it was a little booklet and apparently they had made like a 20 page book that they sent to potential sponsors people they're according to like you know be their sponsor and they wanted to get like a big check and i turned the page and on one of them uh there was this this piece of copy uh in the deck and it said our hope is that this partnership is the domino that bankrupts your competitors and grants you a monopoly so powerful that you are dragged in front of congress and i read that line and i was like that is the greatest opening line for a pitch deck that i've ever read it was fantastic yeah and i read that line and uh i was joking with eric i'm like this is the greatest thing i've ever read and and he was he it made him giggle so i guess he shared that and it's wonderful how good is that dude they're so good i love those guys also i have a funny eric story i met eric when i was in college and um we both got picked for this trip to go go to the alibaba headquarters so it was like a free all expenses paid trip to china courtesy of jack ma for 50 of the top college entrepreneurs and i was on this bus and eric was right next to me nice guy he's kind of a baby-faced guy at the time i don't know if he still is you said you met him in person but yeah he's like he's like he doesn't come off like a tycoon like he comes off very kind and warm yeah he's lovely and uh at the time i think he was literally in an mlm i'm not 100 sure but i'm pretty sure he was selling products that were part of a like a like an mlm sort of scheme or or he was i don't remember exactly like essential oils it was like as creams or something like that and um i i'm vaguely remembering this so i could totally be wrong sorry eric if i got some of the details wrong but i swear if it's not that it's in the zip code and um i just remember thinking like oh this guy's kind of cool he's a hustler really nice guy uh i don't know what he's doing with these you know whatever it was creams or whatever he was doing at the time and then i've seen him build ramp and i'm like is that the dude from the bus in china who was trying to sell me creams and uh it just goes to show anything is possible dude when i talked to him it was him and his part it was like me david senra eric and then eric's partner all in a room and we were just riffing and then hanging out i was wanting to meet up with david because david's a buddy of mine he goes hey i'm going to be hanging out at ramp's office if you just want to come and see me it's right down the street from your office so i go to see him and i walk in it's and it's and it's these guys and it's so it's pretty cool and the partner of uh co-founder of ramp kareem i think his name was he told me this story he was like yeah like we had this idea and our goal was to get to become a um we wanted to get to a billion dollar valuation in 12 months that was the goal and we did the math and we thought that was possible and i was flabbergasted i was like what i was like did you hit it he goes no man we didn't hit it it took like 18 months and uh and it was just really cool to be in a room of people who thought like craziness like that and it actually worked well you know what's crazy you know uh i think they were a massive underdog when they started so if you remember back when they were early brex was already out and early as well and brex was the san francisco based company ramp is in new york brex had the yc network and connection they went through yc and they were all the yc companies were kind of like you know yc is kind of like this network effect this little mafia that they have that can kind of king make certain companies if you get enough momentum and i just remember i would have bet like the odds bet the betting odds were that brex given those advantages given that they're the sf the tech tech focus one like really was is the new york startup going to beat the the silicon valley startup it didn't really seem like that was usually the case and they had ads everywhere brex did they were advertising everywhere they were a hot name they were nyc like they had a lot of things that would have made you think they would be the winner here and ramp has thoroughly kicked the out of brex uh they are worth way more and have done a much better job i use ramp it's a great great product um so you know that is very impressive to me i think that that was that is not how i would have guessed that that would have played out 100 i agree with you apparently the story is that they ran a company called paribus which is something like uh you get rebates online so you buy something and you can get like uh they help you find a deal and you get a little bit of money and the brand saves a little bit of money something like that like you know something it's 100 you pay 90 bucks and they give you a little bit of cash back whatever they sold the company after three years for 40 or 50 million dollars and he was like it was nice like we like but we got a lot wrong and when we sold it we sold it to capital one and in capital one we learned about the demand for all these things and uh like the the demand for like a good bank account system a demand for all these business services that people needed and we ran the math because we saw like how big capital one was and we thought that we could build a billion dollar company in the first year if we did one or two things right and it was amazing to hear that story that's pretty cool we should get eric on that would be well he should come on and i'm working i'm working with them on it um they have this like huge like event they're basically what they're doing doesn't sound like it would work but it's working so they're like doing all this goodwill stuff sponsoring podcasts they have this huge office that seats 300 people and they just host events there like these things where like people are like oh but like what's the attribution to that and it's like i don't know but it somehow it still works right okay we got to do one uh here this is uh oh no hold on my my text is gone here but i have a uh new segment sam rich guy house alert what happened all right i saw this tweet about some event it was like a event i think for like san francisco like kind of like paul like set policy maybe and i was like okay cool whatever hundreds of people went to this like san francisco policy thing and then somebody goes but the tweet said uh overwhelmed with the standing room only crowd at gary tan's house and i just remember thinking gary tan's house and i see this tweet that says this is gary tan's house big ass house dude gary tan told us he lived in a neighborhood of the city of san francisco yeah so we're gonna try to try not to dox him although he said he came in and he goes hell yeah it is my house and this is the house so have you seen this it is a old church i remember that yeah across the street from dollars park yeah exactly so so he lives at something here he owns this thing called the lighthouse it's a townhouse condo at a hundred year old restored church right across from dolores four beds three baths but it's got 30 foot ceilings crazy so look at this house dude wait he lives there or is that like an event space he owns it i don't know if he full-time lives there i you know i don't want to don't want to comment on that but like how insane is this i've always by the way i've always dreamed of doing this buying an old church because old churches have like sometimes amazing locations and really like unique bones and structure i didn't know you could convert them to housing so this is kind of interesting here um but dude how crazy is this house i remember when this was for sale in san francisco it was i still live there and i remember it being for sale and i remember there was a another person living there not living there it was like a rich it was another rich guy who was using it for events and they put it for sale and uh i'm amazed that he bought this this looks awesome oh my god look at this bedroom dude i don't want to in a steel cage i don't want that's pretty sick yeah i don't i don't want that you know if i was like brock lesner or someone like really hardcore like that looks cool but like when you watch too much wwe you're like okay hell in the cell bedroom look i'm not a tough guy i'm not brock lesner i mean how hardcore is this bedroom dude this is amazing i love how he's got like the plush carpet right outside like a like a waiting room lobby before you enter the the bed the bed zone um all right do we want to do any more are we uh we out oh yeah two more i want to show you guys my my oldest bookmark from the year 2018. all right here we go all right so in preparation for this podcast sam's like cool let me just go look at my twitter bookmarks and see what good tweets i have and you found this your first ever bookmark is this in 2018.

yeah what is this so it's is this group of kenyan men uh the samburu men are describe this like you know because there's people who listen to this only on audio by the way if you've been listening to this on audio the whole time please get to youtube please go to youtube and watch this because this is that this whole thing works if you see the tweets do you remember that movie with kevin bank uh bacon where he went to africa to play basketball and he found this like tribe of like really tall guys and they would jump up and they would wear like like very traditional what you would think of like an african tribes person wearing right they have they're shirtless and they have like amazing beads and and whatever and they have the red hair just like the guy in the movie that's what this is it's a group of guys in kenya and the tweet says that these men are often considered to be the most stylish men on the planet and uh it's a photo of these guys and so look honestly agreed first of all the account is called at kenya pics is that an account you just follow yeah i love kenya because uh i've i like i like runners and so my goal has always been to go to the rift valley which is this area of kenya and see uh kenyan runners i've always admired like running and uh particularly there's like this group uh there's like imagine like a small town um imagine like um your town uh like a suburb uh and like something like 90 of the distance gold medals have been won by this group of like 10 000 people in kenya this and that's always fascinates me and so i've always wanted to go and see these guys and uh this is like nearby in that tribe and so then and then it just says hashtag international men's day so that was cool back when hashtags were a thing and then there's also a picture of the guy jumping and he's guys easily five feet off the ground i don't know how this is this photo this is incredible what is this no i don't i don't know what that is i don't know i i don't know that much about kenya but it looks dope to me yeah yeah uh what about the theo von one let's see the last one so it's a picture of theo von uh smiling like how my son does when we try to get him to take a picture he's with ivanka trump and uh who's that jared right yeah jared kushner and ivanka trump and he says uh y'all's posture is so good what the hell are y'all are y'all in spine club or something i'm built like a damn raccoon thanks for the hospitality had a blast it's pretty amazing dude you and i okay so when sean and i started this podcast uh sean started it and then i joined a little bit later and i said do you like fighter and the kid and sean was like i love fighter and the kid and firing the kid is a not so much popular podcast anymore but it was two guys bernan schaub and brian callen who would talk about ufc fighting and their friend theo von would occasionally come on the pod he was just a guy he was a he was a character on the pod and that slowly has developed into they had another pod together called king it and sting it and he rose further and further and further dude look at him now he's like he's talking to the president the vice president he's hanging out with these guys how crazy of a career has theo had in the last decade it's amazing it's his rise is pretty crazy i actually knew him from when he was on like road rules 20 years ago like because i like real world road rules and the challenge and stuff like that and so yeah it's pretty wild to see kind of the the crazy growth but even more wild is this is what i appreciate about this because this tweet it's funny but do you know how hard it is as a man to put up like a kind of like a thank you post or a congratulatory post but not be lame and theo did it you know what i mean like think about what this post is this post is basically like had such a good time at brunch but if you just posted that dude you know that's the lamest thing that you could possibly do but to go with this y'all's posture is so good what the hell are y'all in spine club or something it's just that's how it's done and so i'm studying the art of how how men can express themselves while still being still being cool about it you know what i mean dude he's the best he's one of the few podcasts that i listen to i listen to him and tim dylan have you listened to him and tim dylan i'm not a huge tim dylan guy but it's an acquired taste yeah yeah it's very much an acquired taste it took me about two years to get into him he's uh it's pretty raunchy uh it's he's these guys are like uh my two favorite podcasters right now it's pretty amazing how good they are by the way on the same subject i have a father's day post idea for you i think we should close out with this one um may have to present this with no comment but i thought this might be a good one for you to to post this uh this weekend yeah that's gonna be no for me dog all right that's it that's the pod no yeah yeah
