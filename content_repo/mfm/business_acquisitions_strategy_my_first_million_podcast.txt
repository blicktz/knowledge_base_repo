When you buy a company, what is the first three months, six months? Are you hands on with that? Do you have an operating partner who does that?

How do you guys make sure that when you buy an asset, you don't A, destabilize it and B, you actually start to grow it, which is I assume why you bought it in the first place. Yeah. So our philosophy, there's a lot of private equity firms out there that have these 30 day, 90 day, 120 day plans.

We don't do that. What we try to do is take a humble attitude towards it and say, look, we know some things, we have some talents, but we want to learn and come alongside them. They're the experts.

They've been doing it for a long time. So there's a team of 16 of us. So it's not certainly, I don't get the impression this is just me.

There's people far more talented than I am on staff. And there we have a dual hook and structure post close. So our financial team hooks into their financial team and creates feedback loops.

And then we have a, we call it a portfolio partner. They're kind of a board of directors in a box that is overseeing kind of the executive leadership, helping make very high level decisions. I mean, these are autonomous operating units.

I mean, so there's, these are, these are not, we're not injecting these people into the companies to run them, but they're in touch with the leadership teams all the time. Doing, you know, a variety of different types of calls and meetings throughout the year. And how many companies are there?

There's nine. That you guys own. Yeah.

Got it. So that seems manageable. Yeah.

I mean, it's, so for every kind of three to five companies we, we acquire, we got to hire one high level financial person in one portfolio partner. And that's kind of their, their grouping of companies that they're kind of running. So we're almost creating like a fractal.

If you want to think about it that way down into the organization so that it scales as sort of linearly in that way.
