all right let's do some topics what do you got i got i got a couple dude i got a bunch of good stuff all right let's pick one of yours let's do the satoshi and the paul la rue thing because they're both really interesting um do you know let's do let's do which one do you want to do first i don't know who paul la rue is you don't know who paul la rue is okay fucking great name though dude listen to this how much more would i be worth if i was sean la rue at least right and how much respect would i get he's also african he's from uh south africa i think uh so ben you're nodding a little bit like you know who this is is that true uh yeah i know paul la rue is he's kind of like um uh who's the guy we were talking about that you knew um he's kind of like if if ross had been as crazy as everyone thought but actually like 10 times crazier that's paul la rue paul whoa yeah yeah i don't know all right let me fill me in who's this guy all right so he's basically all right so paul la rue he's this big old fat disgusting guy he's like like imagine like yeah imagine like have you seen south park where they're like playing video games there's that fat guy on the computer who's like eating cheetos and like yeah he kind of looks like that he's just a total slob but he's this computer whiz yeah google him um he's like disgusting and that kind of fits the personality of of the whole story and there's this great book uh that i'm reading uh it's called mastermind it's about him and basically this guy always like kind of wanted to take over the world and in around like 2002 2003 2004 he started this company called rx limited which basically sold viagra and a couple other like schedule two drugs so like no like um he was able to sell some opioids but not like the famous ones things that are considered schedule two which is just one below between schedule one and he created this company called rx limited and in like three or four years it netted him hundreds of millions of dollars in profit and the do you remember years ago when you would get an email and it said like hey we sell prescriptions click here do you remember that like years and years ago when you're in high school and grade school not really but go on let's let's say let me say yes go ahead well basically and then like maybe you remember like going to like these websites where like just showed tons of drugs and like you'd get text that says like buy drugs online well basically he created this website rx limited and then eventually he started like creating so many domain names that he created his own domain registration system and then eventually his network got so big he created his own email system because he didn't want anyone to uh hack into his stuff and at one point he had like two or three thousand employees working at this place mostly filipinos mostly working call centers and he had in philippines and in israel because he said the israeli guys were the hardest working for the cheapest you know the cheap the the cheap rate and he uh it was it was wild and he had basically hundreds of different stores selling drugs and the way it worked is he would somehow convince a doctor that he was like doing everything by the book and technically he kind of was doing everything by the book but it just really quickly warped and did not but basically he had all these doctors in america in like minnesota kentucky florida like these relatively small doctors and like hey we're a telemedicine service can you fill some of the prescriptions that we're doing um it's all legal and we'll just send you the uh the prescriptions that we need and you just sign off and we're going to send it to a pharmacy so he would send it to a pharmacy and these local mom and pop pharmacies would be like oh okay dr x is um just called in this prescription i'm gonna ship it to the patient no big deal and so both the doctors and the patient uh doctors and the pharmacists they all thought that they were mostly following the law they're like this is kind of weird that i'm now shipping out i'm like a mom and pop pharmacist and i'm shipping out like 2 000 orders a week like that's weird but i have no reason to believe this is illegal and eventually it did become highly illegal where like he it was just like you you didn't need to see any doctor to get in these prescriptions and at one point he was selling like 80 of all online drugs in america it was something large ben am i missing anything and throughout doing this this is where things get even crazier so like this story in itself is already interesting literally uh it made i believe 400 million dollars in profit in four years one employee went to his apartment in manila in the philippines and he said that he saw 100 million dollars in cash in the house and he this guy like didn't want the irs to see anything so he would just transfer it into gold because this was before bitcoin was really around he lived in the philippines he was uh an african guy so i believe he was born in like cambodia and then moved to south africa and then moved to the philippines or maybe he was like zimbabwe uh something like that but this guy had this like grandiose thinking where he thought that he like he's like i owe it to the world to run the world very grandiose thinking and so he hires these ex-israeli guys to run the call centers eventually he hires these ex-israeli army guys to be his bodyguards and in doing that he starts learning a little bit about like arms dealing and so eventually he buys thousands of acres of land in zimbabwe and somalia and he was like i'm gonna raid an african nation and i'm gonna set up like a country and i'm gonna have my own i'm gonna be the leader of of a small african nation and hopefully eventually uh a much larger nation like some crazy shit and it expands to the point where he's now an arms dealer so he's selling guns to different parts of africa he gets in trouble for selling missiles to iran like this guy gets into some crazy stuff he's killing people along the way he makes relationships with columbia drug lords and trades drugs uh pills for cocaine and he starts selling 100 millions of dollars worth of cocaine and he was doing all of it almost almost all of it behind a computer and eventually he gets caught now he's got he recently in like three or four years ago was sentenced to 25 years in prison uh and that doesn't include what he's uh convicted for in the philippines so after he gets out if he gets out he's gonna go straight to the philippines in the u.s or he's in the u.s but because he's like basically a drug lord they won't say where he is and so you could own online you can barely find any pictures of him other than one picture of his mugshot and that's the only pictures that you the one where he looks like really big that's his mugshot that's the only picture that i've really seen of him recently and uh the guy it's just this is it's one of the craziest books i've ever read and what i i started talking to you about satoshi because a lot of people think they're like well we don't i don't i don't really there's not a ton of evidence that he uh invented bitcoin but he was talking about like creating a digital currency early on when he was arrested satoshi quit blogging and you could read a lot of this guy's emails and that's really interesting and that's kind of how i got to the other topic of satoshi where you can like read all his old blog posts but this guy it's incredibly fascinating he would have been an awesome business person had it not been for you know going the wrong route but it's a crazy book what was in the emails you just see him commenting with people so he was actually like a really good writer for a little while and he even uh this guy is so interesting he wrote guest posts i believe for the washington post under a pseudonym talking about like the future of money and like all these weird economic stuff but he uh he was somewhat eloquent and but in person he was uh brutish he was an asshole he was disgusting he would just they would go to mcdonald's and he wouldn't even talk to his employees he would kind of tell him to f off he wasn't very pleasant to be around and uh but in the emails he wrote pretty pretty nicely actually what are you gonna say ben they found 500 pounds of cocaine on his yacht when it crashed which was worth like 100 million dollars and he also owned a logging business in somalia at one point he was like i'm gonna create a business that will fend off so basically all the western countries driving through somalia if they want the pirates not to talk to them i'm gonna be the go-between and i'm gonna get money from them and i'm gonna pay the pirates off and take a little bit of profit he owned uh he owned that business he also was in the mining this guy did like at one point the da the district attorney of i believe new york said we think this is the most dangerous and powerful man in the world and all of it was done on the computer and he he his his he was very early in all this like he's very kind of in the same ballpark as a lot of the crypto guys and like some of his ideas even though he was a criminal were like totally on point with the bitcoin stuff so it's super fascinating yeah there's an article that says how the case for why he might be satoshi i haven't read it yet but when you're talking i just pulled it up you say he did it all behind a computer but and my research on this is old i i was looking at this story like a year ago um but didn't don't i remember a story about him like throwing someone off his yacht and having people shoot them in the water or something like that yeah but in that particular story he wasn't there but he did kill a lot of people think that he did kill one so throughout the sean he had his hitmen he had hitmen that are now arrested and they like kind of are spilling the beans he had hitmen that would kill people and there are a few occasions where they think he actually is the one who fired the bullet so he and he did travel so he would go to africa he would go here but he the guy had like 3 000 employees and most of the employees had no idea who he was and even there'd be times where he'd be managing um so basically he had two israeli brothers running this call center in israel with like 300 employees and they had never met paul and paul would talk to them via email uh you know as employees and it's kind of like interesting because like anonymous work is something we've talked about but that's pretty much how it was so some of his employees had no idea who he was so in a sense it wasn't all behind a computer but a lot of it was behind a computer this uh this article i pulled up about him it says uh he's the jeff bezos of of organized crime and it says he's the uh he's the digital el chapo uh because he was moving so much weight he was he was given up for adoption by his birth parents that rejection haunted him and then it says um he was you know transformed himself to a programming genius who developed encryption software like e4m in the 90s he founded rx limited which was the black market for pharmaceuticals he was raking in 250 million dollars a year selling drugs weapons and murder for hire on the dark web yeah well that i think that actually the dark web thing is actually confusing because a lot of the stuff that he was doing was before tor was even around so a lot of stuff he would do it wasn't even on the dark web and like this whole thing about spamming email he was actually one of the originators of that and so he uh somehow hacked into a farm uh a pharmaceutical company and stole something like hundreds of millions of email addresses and he would spam these guys like crazy and the reason why he bought all these domain names is a domain would get banned then he would switch a domain so it was a incredibly complex what he did and he uh before he turned to the dark side he founded a uh or he built like a small open source product that helped encrypt things and uh it eventually turned into this thing called true crypt which i actually think that thing is big but uh so like the guy was pretty genius he was amazing it says his first murder was he took his head of security he said hey come to my house in the philippines and dig a hole i'm gonna bury a safe filled with millions of dollars and then the guy dug the hole and then he shot him with the machine gun right after that that was the first his first taste of murder and then there's another there's another story where they they took a guy out into the ocean and they go wait let's just have a talk on our yacht and they throw the guy in the ocean and they drive away so he gets he freaks out and then he comes back and he shoots all next to the guy and he goes oh no no just so you know i didn't miss i'm just trying to keep the sharks away because i want to talk to you and i need to know are you stealing from me and if you tell me quickly i'll kill you now if you don't tell me i'm just gonna shoot you in your leg and i'm gonna drive off and so like you the guy was really hardcore yeah he makes you know whatever the wolf of wall street look like a small puppy um this guy's insane okay wow never heard of this guy either how'd you hear about him how'd you how'd you find out so when i i tweeted out that i love like crime books and i i think i i just finished uh i forget what i just finished but someone suggested this book called mastermind and it's by this journalist that worked at wired magazine and i've been reading this book and it's freaking crazy and even though this guy what he did was wrong it does like actually inspire me to like live a more adventurous life well i'm like reading this and i'm like why i'm the same way i'm like why am i so fascinated by this like this is why i don't like watching wolf of wall street i'm like why does this excite me so much like i i'm beginning to normalize this in my head and think this is okay i can't watch this anymore but i do think that there is a thing where like i can i need to have a little bit more adventure you know you could use it for good but you know i read it and i'm like intoxicated by it do you get that way yeah i think that's why people love movies about you know prison you know prison breaks or they love it about bank heists and like why people play you know video games that have violence in them it's like there's definitely like a part of us that you know this stuff appeals to and like you know if you can get that outlet by just reading the book or watching the movie or playing a video game like good because you know you didn't it didn't translate in that that kind of deep-rooted desire for like you know either adventure thrill power um you know you know whatever it is doesn't have to like spill into your your normal life then yeah and it it like inspires me a little bit in the sense of like man living life on the edge is crazy i don't want to go to prison but you should just add that to your bio you know top inspirations pablo escobar paul la rue ross all right yeah so but your heroes and one of the reasons why it's interesting is the the cool thing about criminals online is that you can read their correspondence so like they got they when they arrested him he had his computer open and so they were able to like see a bunch of stuff and that's i really love that this era about criminals and uh how you can like see it happening and that got me interested in the satoshi post so basically if you go to like uh if you just google like satoshi you know the guys created bitcoin if you go to satoshi blog post you can i was reading all of his blog posts and the what what i found to be really fun is you go to his first blog post where he talks about introducing bitcoin and you can go to the the forum is still up and you i spent about an hour looking at all the people commenting on it and googling all of them and seeing what they're doing and what they're up to and you could see them like reply like hey satoshi you know this is actually a really good idea i've been tinkering with this i went ahead and purchased 500 bitcoins just to try it out you know what i mean it's really fascinating the first few comments i think weren't uh like i think if i remember correctly the original comments like it's not like this thread blew up and people were instantly like genius you know this is a breakthrough this is a genius idea right like that's not what no it was like this is cute right and so like like literally the first comment so um so you know there's you know sep haulsberger says great stuff this is the first real innovation so this guy recognized it for what it is this is the first real innovation uh in money since the bank of england started to issue promissory notes for gold in the vaults which became bank notes i believe an open source currency has great potential a bit like google has become the default search engine for many of us and then like there's some people who are like you know i have questions about how it works and then there's like hal finney who i think hal finney got the first transaction like um satoshi sent it to him and i think he had the most questions about it which is why some people think hal finney was satoshi nakamoto um and i think he was also the first one to like write out the like the total addressable market for it i remember reading that one time where he's like well if this got adopted like you know each one of these coins is going to be worth like over a million dollars right and he like broke down why which is like you know it's hard to even discuss that now today that sounds weird imagine 2009 you're on a forum and you know somebody posts this thing about how they're creating you know the new world money and you're like well you know that means this little random thing that i could go mine on my computer you could just send me 5 000 of these right now like yeah that each one of those could be worth a million dollars and to me that was really impressive the people who saw it for what it is which is like you know a true innovation something that's great something that could catch on i'm pretty blown away by that me too i think it's amazing when i read it i feel inspired and i think that's why i got obsessed a little bit with paul larue is like just these people who just have the self-belief and vision even if it's like a horrible vision and go out and like do it it's in there in the depths of the internet it's really interesting in this and i've been reading all of the uh satoshi's forum posts and just seeing these just like you can click and see these guys profiles like they're wearing fedoras and like crocodile dundee hats like they're the nerdy the nerdy the nerd the guys who like i would dismiss and be like oh what do you like okay nerd like you're smart but like you're just outlandish i can't believe anything uh that you're doing you read this and they're incredibly thoughtful and they like are taking it seriously right off the bat and i admire that and uh it's a really really fun thing to read yeah i think it's on the you know i think it was like a forum it was called the p2p foundation or something like that was the the original forum that this was on it was like a ning forum or something like that and so you know the people who hang out in these types of forums right they're obviously like pretty hardcore either into peer-to-peer into cryptography into these different subjects and so you know um hanging out at the fringes hanging out i gave a talk recently for um a bunch of people in the midwest they like zoomed me in and they were like we just want you to talk to our group and one of them asked they go you know you said something about like surrounding yourself with interested you know like interesting people how do you do that like what do you actually do to do that and i basically told him i go um i'm a pretty like normal person like i like catchy songs by katie perry i don't have like great music dates i like if something's in the top 40 i'm like oh that's pretty good you know like it's not like i have this like this nose for the next big thing but there are people who who have that that's their superpower and so i used to make fun of those people because every time they would do something weird i would be like oh weird and then i'd point out how weird it is and i would kind of laugh at it and they didn't really care because they weren't trying to be cool anyways um like i remember my in college the guy who lived next door to me uh this guy tofiq he was i walked in he was like playing a video game like starcraft or something like that and he like turned to talk to me and the game kept going and i was like are you even playing like are you just are you just this is a computer and he was like he's like yeah i'm just he's like no i'm watching uh the match from last night in korea i'm like what you're watching somebody else play video games is back in you know it must have been 2006 or something like that and he's like yeah i'm watching a recording of his game this match that happened in the korean server and i'm like dude say five more lame things and like you know than that like i'll give you a hundred dollars if you can say tell me you're a virgin without telling me you're a virgin yeah exactly i was just like oh okay like never coming in this room again and then later like you know fast forward 10 years or whatever sell sell our company gets acquired by twitch and all of a sudden my title is like director of esports or something like that and he calls me he's like you motherfucker he's like oh mr esports now huh and i was like yeah dude it's a big thing you know yeah you you were on top of it and like i sort of you know i was embarrassed because like it was so true i was making fun of that behavior and then sure enough that becomes like such a you know like a billion it was a multi-billion dollar idea i was watching other poop video games and so i've kind of learned the hard way many times of making myself making a fool out of myself on that where like now when i hear something weird i'm just immediately like let me pull up a chair so tell me like why do you do this do other people do this how often do you do this like and the weirder it is the more i want to lean into that phenomenon because i know like it's just a matter of time until i discover that this is a like a totally normal behavior it's like oh you only drink soylent for all your meals like oh interesting are there is there a community of people who do this yeah we're called you know whatever biohackers there's a subreddit with like tens of thousands of us like oh interesting you know you can start to see that the you know the future is is already here it's just not everywhere and like how do you how do you get closer to the future you just find people who already live in the future do weird stuff and then you don't judge them in fact you just like complete have the opposite reaction i used to have and this exercise of reading these old blog posts and all the commenters is i think you just kind of put it in a little more eloquent eloquent way but that's exactly what's happening is like you're seeing like i'm trying to pattern recognition is kind of a stupid buzzword but like you're trying to like see like well i know for sure that a this sounds silly at first and b it worked so like what does this like pattern of like people dismissing and like coming up with like like and how do i not make that same mistake the guy that you talked about uh what was the form called the p uh peer to peer to peer yeah i i so i on the very bottom of the forum it says like about and you could like read who the owner is and he's just a professor in berlin or something like he's just a guy and uh it's pretty fascinating i'm like man like all these people were it's it's it's like you know they they they this kind of weird to say but they're like they they were around when jesus was around like you know like they like saw this like thing that like potentially changes what the next thousand years or the next 500 years of history and they like saw it and i think that's really fascinating so dude uh i put this in the milk road i don't know if you saw this thing about like so peter the big bitcoin conference just happened in miami yeah yeah that was really that was really good uh on friday you did that right yeah i did that one on friday that was the highest rated one yeah that killed it that was so good but did you i don't know if you saw the clip i think i had linked to the clip in there of so peter thiel goes he gives his talk at the bitcoin conference in 2022 just happened and he it before he comes out they played on the on the big screen this video that i had seen before i think i even talked about it on here once but there's this video i've watched a ton of old peter thiel videos there's a video of him giving a talk in 1999 and he's talking about the idea of a currency not owned by uh by the government and basically there's like this two minute clip of peter thiel basically describing bitcoin without saying the word bitcoin and he didn't know how it would work but he's like you know the world needs a currency that's not controlled by you know the central banks of different countries blah blah blah and i think paypal originally that was their vision was to create they used to have shirts that said one currency to rule them all or something like that it was like this original idea of paypal was to create one global virtual currency and they shifted away from that later like and he said he at this talk he goes yeah we went to something that was more practical and it kind of worked but like it was less ambitious and like you could tell he kind of regretted it which is like we before we wanted to create our own financial system and then like we settled on really hard and we settled on oh paypal it's a payments network that like it works with your existing bank with the existing dollar currency and with your to send to somebody else's existing bank so we're just like a funnel to like funnel money through and like yeah that was cool but like um man this other thing was the big idea and bitcoin kind of proved that that was the big idea you know later on but him giving that talk in 1999 to me is so crazy like that's one of the greatest like calls i've ever seen of just calling it what's going to happen why it's going to happen and in that talk he's like he's like uh you know the this currency will live on your cell phone outside of a bank um you know smartphones are going to be a thing and you think about it's like oh 1999 man iphone came out in 2007 so he's predicting smartphone he's like we're already seeing the adoption of smartphones in finland and he also said he gave a five-year term and you're like he it was 10 but he got it right yeah he's like a billion he's like there will be a billion smartphone devices in the next five years it took 10 years but like a billion devices like there was never a there was never a billion user product like there weren't a billion people who had computers ever um there weren't a billion people i don't even think that used televisions i think the cell phone was the first thing where it was like a smartphone was like the first thing where a billion people had this product so of course if you launch an app that works your addressable market is a billion people who could download your app like immediately like it's kind of an overlooked fact about why mobile was so big it's just like well there wasn't ever a billion people who could have used your product before this like your restaurant could never serve a billion people your store could never serve a billion people like mcdonald's couldn't even serve a billion people no matter how many locations they open like the cell phone was really the first thing that was able to do that you know that quickly and um and so he's you know when he was talking about like smartphone adoption is rising in finland i'm like who even pays attention to what's going on in finland dude like if i asked you right now if i said point to finland on a map could you think you can point to finland on a map right now like me neither and so to me like finland denmark and like holland and sweden are all the same thing yeah exactly yeah like i don't know dude it's like that's where white people are clean and you're nice i get it like and so like i thought about that i'm like oh no wonder the people who were hanging out with peter teal went on to do like some wait sorry hold on what hey ma sorry there's some right my bad there's some like random guy like knocking on my window all right sorry go ahead so i was saying that you know it's no wonder that people hanging out with peter teal ended up going on to do amazing things right like if you've ever heard of the paypal mafia it's like yeah like people who worked at paypal went on to create youtube and linkedin and tesla and spacex and yelp and affirm and like i think there's like over 10 billion dollar companies that came out of the paypal mafia and um like kiva like one of the best non-profits came out of that and so it's like dude why is that it's because you're hanging out with a bunch of people who are already thinking about the future living in the future they're all weird nerds and i remember that one of the co-founders of paypal max lefgen he had this thing where he's like he was interviewing somebody and the guy started like talking about how like he's like yeah i love to play pick up hoops he's like we're not hiring this guy he's like oh my god he's like he's like no no great programmer i know plays pick up basketball he's like dude well that's what we said about the guys who were doing icos we're like dude if your teeth are really white and you got abs and if you have a ferrari and if your last name is also a first name that's four out of four you out like like if your last name is tucker or john like you're out like no st john's exactly and so you know these things like i mean you get canceled today for being like i'm not gonna hire someone who plays pick up hoops um but like and i think they even said something back then they go your goal as a startup is to basically build a cult and they're like the more cult like you can make your company the better and like that's not popular i think they've all they don't say that stuff in public anymore because now they're like you know bigger public figures but like i think that startup advice is actually fantastic startup advice now the cult doesn't need to be all people of the same race or gender or anything like that it's like people who are all believe like religiously in the mission and then people who kind of behave in a way that's like they're willing to work way harder sleep in the office like you know they're willing to go to bat for this thing because you know they're like members of a cult they sort of have lost their own personal identity to the greater identity of the group that is like a pretty hard force to bet against and beat dude this gets me inspired how how do you think this was actually a third topic i was going to ask you how do you think guys like peter teal who i don't know his background but i think it was pretty modest uh how do people like him how are they right so often or i mean do they just make a ton of guesses and they're only right a couple times but it i don't understand like that idea of thinking i think i think big and then i like talk to or i listen to him i'm like oh i'm like i'm i'm nobody yeah uh dude when you hear him talk it's like when you're in a plane that takes off and all of a sudden the houses start to look like little toys and the people start to look like ants the cars look like you know a little flex it's like that's how that's how my brain feels when i hear peter teal talk i'm like oh i am a small simpleton you know i'm a single cell organism compared to this guy in terms of just like where where my brain goes how how much conviction i have around my own original thoughts because like that's his thing right like he's all about being a contrarian and um you know i think jeff bezos said this about peter teal he goes yeah that's the thing about contrarians they're usually wrong you know and uh somebody else said like you know peter's constantly predicting sort of like the end of the world in the market crash and like you just remember it the two times he was right in the 20 years and like the four times he was wrong it just seemed like he was a little bit late on his prediction and um so so i think there's definitely something to like you know being wrong a bunch but it's like when you're it's more like when you're right you're right in a major major way and i think he was right about paypal in a major way i think he was right about facebook in a major way right he was the first investor in facebook he bought a 500 about a 10 stake in facebook for 500 grand all right so like that was the best investment of the decade i think you know like at that time and so you know he was right in a major way about that um you know the last time he kind of went on tour he was right about two very contrarian things one was trump where all of a sudden like he was the only guy in silicon valley that was like publicly supporting trump went spoke at the at the convention was like we need donald trump to be president and at the time it was sort of like donald trump was the underdog he was not supposed to win and like peter teal picked that horse pretty early i thought that was kind of impressive and like also he gets off on it being contrarian you could tell uh and then the other one that he was right about was uh when he created the teal fellowship so he basically went on which was laughable at first and he had he had this talk where he goes and he goes uh university you know college education is a bubble it's the greatest bubble since the housing crisis this is right after the the housing bubble popped he's like the next bubble is college education people like who goes against education like go ask a hundred out of a hundred politicians parents anybody who's not pro education and like he was the first guy to be like college education is a complete bubble and he explained why it was a bubble that like you know people go for basically this like certificate this he goes it's a he goes it's an insurance product partially he goes uh you know it's an insurance for you know parents buy for their kids so that they don't fall through the cracks of society he said it's like a a certification product you know you don't go there to learn you go there to get your certificate um and so he's he's was calling out college and then he created the teal fellowship which was kind of a genius move because he put up i think at the beginning two million dollars but that two million dollars was like 200 million dollars of free publicity for himself because he he made it bold where he's like not just like here's an alternative to college for people who don't want to go he's like well explain what it is it was he came out he goes i will pay you a hundred thousand dollars to drop out of college and it's like oh shit you know like keep this man away from my children like you know it was like a seem like a not good thing to do and then he explained why he's like college is you know a complete bubble but then how did he get his money back from that again i think he invested in the projects i'm not sure well for example ethereum came out of that which is a 300 billion dollar product uh which is kind of ironic because he doesn't he never claims victory on it and in fact at the bitcoin conference he kind of shit on ethereum which is a bit weird um so you know i don't know why he's i i would think he'd be taking a victory lap because like vitalik being a teal fellow was like the total validation of the teal fellowship but i think figma i invested in uh owner.com you know owner.com do you ever see that company i know about it yeah he's a he's one of those guys i and about two or three more i've invested in about three of them maybe yeah um yeah i heard kind of mixed things about the project the program itself but like there's no doubt like good stuff came of it like if if just figma came out of it the program was like a win you know like i'd say 10 billion dollar came out of it yeah and so you know and there's many others there's a bunch of other winners that have come out of it too but like so this guy's like been uh you know contrarian and right many many times it's very impressive to me it's more impressive to me than people like obviously he's very successful so it's not even like that or success but if you just showed me one person who's very successful and another person who is like an original thinker who's right when they go against the grain damn i'm more i have a lot more respect and admiration for the person who was like when it gets the grain it had an original thought that was right yeah and uh it's inspiring i um i was reading today and it said that uh this is like kind of a weird a weird tangent but jared kushner all right you know jared kushner uh yeah so so who is he he's he's married to to the trump or his brother is married to the trump uh so there's jared and josh josh is the younger one i think he's like 35 he's married to a model and he runs thrive which is a vc thing that's like immensely successful his brother is jared who i forget his title in the white house but he was like trump's right hand man and he's married to ivanka right yeah and like a lot of people think he's evil he probably is a little bit he kind of has like a skeleton vibe to him like a skeletor the the villain and he man or whatever it was so he's like kind of has like a vibe to him but he just announced that uh like a few months after leaving the white house uh he he founded a three billion dollar private equity fund and like regardless you put politics aside um like it crazy that that's just like your thing like you you ended that you you ended what like like when i end a job i take like a lot of people take like a three-week vacation and they go start another job that's like 20 percent higher in salary and a little bit better title and like he just like was like oh you know i'm like i've got some free time now i'm gonna like you know beep bop boop just do this thing it's a three billion dollar fund and like i find that to be it's the same thing of like i feel like an ant and you are not that you know what i mean yeah exactly um i i know exactly what you mean it does beg the question of like you know why why do i not go bigger and also um you know is there a reason that i don't go bigger like is there a reason sam that you don't go create a three billion dollar private equity fund there's there's two reasons the first is fear so like it is scary to do that to like raise like for to raise outside failure yeah to raise outside money and fuck it up that's bad but number two i do think that there is i don't know if peter teal has this but elon musk for sure has this did you read that article in the new yorker or new york times where he describes his life he's like basically he was talking to the interviewer and he was starting to cry in the interview and he's like he's like you don't want to be me yeah he basically said he's like i miss my brother's wedding i or he was like i was about to miss it but i flew in at the last minute i saw it immediately got on the plane he was like there was like a time a few weeks ago where for five days i didn't leave the factory i didn't see the sunshine i don't see my children uh i had a birthday but no friends came and said happy birthday to me because i was running around uh the factory and like i'm lonely and i'm pretty sad to be honest and frankly death i look forward to it as a way of relief that's like what he said he said all that yes and uh like the whole death thing bro yeah take a nap just do it just try it a little advice one brother to another well and it's like so i think there's one aspect where it's like well i don't want to like be this like the slave to this computer in the machine like f that um and i want to live life but i i do think that there and i i haven't formulated this entire this thought entirely i do think there's a world where you can go big and have some work-life balance so actually so do you think that's true yeah of course of course it's true uh you just got to decide your terms right like um and as soon as you decide those terms watch you'll figure out a way to make it happen or you'll find people who make it happen i i am so anti there's one way to win or there's even one definition of winning like that's if i if i could just be the anti one thing that's the thing i'd be most anti because i used to fall into a trap i'd see somebody doing something one way or i'd hear advice that makes sense and then i'd kind of like and it's like later in life i found the counterfactual it's like wait but this guy doesn't do that wait this this this that lady did both right like so hold on if both is an option then i'm taking both every day of the week it's only when i accept that both is not an option i fall into this trap of misery of around picking one or the other right of like lifestyle and uh and like you know ambition so um so i definitely think you can do both i play this game though so i have two games that i play about any project that i'm doing this is kind of like my i kind of exec coach myself and i really always ask two questions i go i go for the first question is if and i asked this other founders too which is if i was to meet up with you you know if we hung out 12 months from now we're grabbing a beer and i'm like hey what happened with that thing man what happened with trends that was such a cool idea like what went wrong what do you think is the most likely thing you're gonna say in that moment where you're like ah dude here's what you know here's where we we messed up or here's what we turned out here's what we thought that we turned out we were turns out was wrong um so it helps you identify the riskiest part of your business either the riskiest assumption you're making the thing you need to go validate or the risky path that you're going on where you're cutting off other options or you're not you know you're really leaving yourself you know one move away from failure so i always ask that question and the way i don't know why like if you just ask somebody straight up like what's the biggest risk in your business they answer it one way it's like well there's other way with i think people can relate to which is like if i see you a year from now we're just grabbing a beer hanging out it's like i just let's just presume already it's gone wrong what was the cause of death you know like what do you think was the reason that so that's one the second one the game we played yesterday with the milk road um it was it's called the the why the fuck aren't you game and it's basically it's like it's like either why the fuck are you or aren't you which is like what part if i was just an objective person looking at what we're doing would i say why the fuck are you guys doing this like why aren't you hiring somebody to do that it's taking you five hours a day and like you should totally you could could you not find somebody to do that part or like why aren't you like why aren't you at this bitcoin conference like aren't you building a crypto product like shouldn't you be at this event um like there's just like this series of like why are you or why aren't you's and it's like why the f aren't you which kind of distills it down into like what's the obvious good idea or bad idea like good idea we're not doing or bad idea that we are doing um that i would criticize about ourselves and we both came up with a list of like three things and it became like oh wow we should just correct those now uh rather like so then what's your answer why aren't you going bigger assuming that you're not going big which is not a fair a fair assumption but for the sake of discussion yeah um so i i wouldn't say why am i not going bigger like the jared kushner question you mean or the questions i was asking just now the jared kushner question um because i want to have you know enough meaning i want to have a i want to be able to know what is enough and i want my vision of success to be bigger than just what's going on in my business so it's like to me if you said paint a picture of what winning looks like it's not just a number in an account right or a number in my sales dashboard it's like a like i talk about this all the time it's this perfect tuesday it's like my normal day is perfect for what i want and that includes like just like right after this i'm gonna go work out with my trainer in my home gym like that's a part of my perfect tuesday and if my business then requires me to not have time to do that and i'm like getting fat or whatever or it doesn't provide me enough money to be able to afford that then it's not winning right um it's like you know being able to like take my daughter to swim class like things like that like those are part of what winning looks like to me and so i'm just not gonna like deviate from that i'm only gonna the only thing i question is not why don't i go bigger it's is this picture the picture i really want or is this outdated and do i need to update it you know and like that's the thing i find myself being like oh man i haven't updated this picture in a while or there's just like a gap over here where i don't know what i want what would it feel like to know what i want okay let me get let me figure that out ben wilson tweeted out uh it's a superpower to know what you really want right ben and that was that the tweet uh yeah uh i really think that's what what did you see or hear that made you tweet that um so what i saw is that i i've had a bunch of people reaching out to me recently and the people who are like hey i'd love to connect i get so annoyed with i'm like you just dumped something on my plate for me to like figure out which i just don't want to do whereas the people who are like hey i really love what you do i'm also a podcaster my podcast is this size i want to get it to this size i'm having trouble in these two areas and i'd love to talk to you about it i'm like great you know exactly what you want i will i will gladly give you that um and uh it's just it applies almost everywhere in life like the guy who comes up to you and is like hey do you have any spare change no i don't have any spare change hey i need two dollars and fifty cents to get a ride home on the bus do you have two dollars and fifty cents all right i guess i got two dollars and fifty cents like it's a superpower in every way so uh so i like that you said that there's a tweet that my cousin put out yesterday my cousin he's on twitter dude who uh great guy according to twitter he's killing it i don't know i haven't talked to him in forever but like his updates he's killing it at looking like he's killing it i don't know if he's actually i haven't caught up no i don't i'm not disrespecting him at all i'm saying like his like his updates are amazing he just bought like 20 000 square feet of something like he's on top of the game yeah and actually he did a good job of figuring out what he wants bro you just called out your cousin you should take that back what i love my cousin no he's great but i actually meant that as a compliment there's a skill there's a skill especially in his line of business which is real estate there's a skill to putting forward your like putting your either your brain on brain forward like sharing ideas like he put out a thing of like how i do diligence on properties it's like a great checklist it's like oh you're just putting out great on-point information it makes me trust you makes me think this guy knows what he's talking about or if it's like like our friend nick huber does this too it's like he'll send us a picture of him smoking a cigar you know playing golf at you know 1 p.m it's like wow this guy must be killing it like you don't you don't get to go out smoke a cigar and play golf you know 1 p.m regularly unless you're doing really well it makes me more likely to invest in nick huber's storage company that i know that he's doing well in life like some people take it as an anti-signal like oh why isn't he working hard to me i'm like no if you're if you're able to like do well in life that means you're doing something right and like your cousin tweet though so he tweeted something out he goes i'm looking for like a car like a new suv it's like kind of a general vague thing and somebody got any then he like defined it right afterwards so specifically he goes the experience you know the user experience of a tesla the size of an escalade the um he goes with enough room for three car seats and a pair of golf clubs and i was like first of all isn't it just a more fun way to look for a car like just to kind of imagine really what you want and like sink into the vividness of like just having it and not like worrying about the world tesla doesn't make a big car like an escalade no fuck that i'm not i'm not grounded in reality i'm living over here in my reality of what i want and he's only he's got one kid so i'm like you know three car seats all right he's planning ahead like that's good and um and i just thought it was a great example of like specificity so to me a lot of people are vague in general when they should really be being specific and then the opposite is also true sometimes people are like man i don't know what i want specifically and they get tied up in a knot because of that and my trainer had a great framework for that he goes you got to know when to be general and when to be specific he goes if you uh like sometimes you will tell you you need to be more specific with what you want that means like the type of description my cousin gave about like you know the lifestyle that what he described as a car is not just a car it's a lifestyle and um and then the second thing is like when do you be when do you be general so he so my trainer i was like well what if i don't know what i want right like if he said what you know what's your body goal right his personal trainer i'd be like well i don't really have a picture of like i don't know if i want to like i could say oh i just want to have like a 12 pack but i don't even know if that's true right i'm like i don't know exactly what i want and he's like cool just imagine satisfaction he goes just just first get to a place of feeling satisfied about it where you don't stress you're not stressed about it anymore he goes he goes you know relief is a very powerful emotion satisfaction is a powerful emotion he goes most people feel relieved one time a day and it's when they poop he goes and now people bring their phone in they're not even paying attention they miss it they miss out on the one moment of relief they were going to have that day he goes so i get good at feeling relief i want to practice feeling relieved and satisfied because once you get good at feeling relieved and satisfied you know what things you want you're you're faster to figure out what things you want that will lead back to that emotion and like you're just better at being satisfied from a meal or a workout or whatever it is these daily things in your life he goes let's he goes and so we made a deal it's like i'm i'm gonna be relieved more times than i poop today and it's like that's the goal that's the first hilarious this is all from your trainer yeah what a smart ass dude by the way to talk about the real what your cousin's doing on real estate i've talked to a bunch of these real estate guys so and i'm friends with a lot of them keith wasserman um uh chris uh fort is that his name that's for i think so uh nick huber moses kagan your cousin's getting in there the strip mall guy so there's like 10 of them that are like really popular maybe 20 and i see the returns they're really good and the fees that they charge are crazy high or but like you know who cares it's uh i'm in nick's hoover thing it's a huge fee but like i'm getting a good return so i don't care it this is one of the coolest things that's happening on twitter right now is these real estate people are just crushing it all through twitter it's pretty amazing i think some of them have shared that they bring in like tens of millions of dollars of investor money just off of people who are like i'm a fan of your twitter yes uh which is like that means if you're in real estate like do what my cousin's doing do what these guys are doing like up your twitter game because it is going to lead to more deals and it's going to lead to more investors in your fund that you don't have to go knock on doors for it's way easier to just tweet out stuff than it is to go like do one hour calls and seminars webinars and in-person meetups trying to like schmooze for a buck well i have no idea how big nick huber this is nick huber from sweaty startup i have no idea how big his portfolio is but i wouldn't actually be surprised if it was over nine figures and i bet you if it is most of it came via twitter yeah yeah i i i don't know i don't know if that's i don't know exactly but i agree with where you're headed there and also um that's also the one reason i haven't invested in a lot of these guys is because the fee structure like which might be to my detriment but like one thing i don't fundamentally like about real estate fees is that they all make this like two three percent like acquisition fee yeah which like you know you go buy like a 50 million dollar thing and it's like wow so you just banked a million dollars in your pocket just for buying the thing which leads you to an incentive which is go buy more shit instead of being like really um discerning between like a great property and a good property it's like just go accumulate and like i think nick has a little bit of a different strategy because he's got like a kind of like a template now of like he buys the self-storage thing he cuts out a bunch of the labor he adds in these automations and so he like has a playbook of how to add value that i think not every investor says they have i don't think they really have it um i think nick actually does a great job of that but like in general i would say one reason i've shied away is because i dislike this incentive this this incentive mismatch where like you're you're incentivized to take my money and go buy something because you get money today that's guaranteed that doesn't it does not linked to your returns it's only linked to your returns over a long period of time and by then you've already banked these acquisition fees 15 times over by the time we figure out if these were good deals or not and i have no idea if they're killing it because they're skilled although many of the all the people i had named i i've talked to they appear skilled but i'm a novice but also they just happen to be in the game like starting six years ago and we're going to like the greatest like boom in real estate yeah so like of course they're killing it uh but uh the numbers are i mean i i'm investor of nick and i see the returns i'm like oh yeah dude i'll give you more of but by the way if i was nick i would i would do exactly what he's doing i charge the highest fees i can and be like you're still getting a great return correct all right fantastic if you can go beat that return somewhere else i invite you to do it um which is like you know he's not as upfront about that but like that's how i would do exactly what he's doing so i don't knock him for that i think that's a it's what i would do if i was in that position where i know i can generate great returns um but like on my side i just i hesitate as an investor in that sort of thing but maybe that's to my detriment do you want to do more topics or do you want to save yours for wednesday let's do let's do a couple ideas i think people people like ideas if you made it to the end of the episode congratulations all right so let me pitch you two ideas real quick one is called what i'm calling copy my trip okay so i'm booking a vacation right now taking the family on a vacation great idea i great name thank you came up with it myself yeah oh you made the business idea i thought you were the idea of a family vacation um so so i'm like i'm like googling i'm like okay unless i want to go to hawaii for example so i'm like all right i want to go to hawaii all right which island i don't fucking know okay uh which resort oh god here we go gotta figure out which resort and like it matters like it's gonna change my experience if i go to the wrong place or the right place but like and then i'm like and then all the details in between like okay so if i take my kids what do i do do i rent a car do i get car seats do i take the shuttle uh do we go on this activity is that age appropriate and so what i want is my wife follows all these influencers on instagram that are like mommy influencers and when they buy something she's like that's a good thing i'm gonna buy that thing too and like because she's like look we have the same taste and like these people they're not like they kind of are promoting things that they're like they have a good track record like so she's like bought a couple of things that look good and they paid off so she's like now it's more trust in them i don't get why they can't or maybe they do this i don't know but like i don't get why they're not just saying copy my trip you want to go to disneyland literally click this and like here's the like full itinerary of like we fly into this airport we take this transportation to this hotel because it's great for families for these reasons we buy this thing this thing whatever and like i just get their whole trip that i can copy and that they have basically like a tiktok or like instagram story version that i can just browse it to be like oh yeah this looks fun i want to do this like well i went on expedia and i'm like this is awful experience overwhelming here's an overwhelming list of 100 options ranked in five different ways that i clicked the fucking thing i don't know if the reviews are real or not i'm looking at the photos they don't have all the photos it's like a photo it's a static photo from like a fucking airplane above the resort it's like dude i just want to see like someone walk into the room and be like oh this is really nice the bed's good the you know there's space over here and like oh this is cool they give you breakfast every morning like check this out you know like like an instagram story right so i just think that there should be an instant a thing called copy my trip that anyone could do it'll create a profession of basically professional travelers like people who they go find the best path of how to have a trip to you know bali or whatever and like sam you might follow somebody who's got like a fitness oriented angle right like oh yeah they want to like go they this person likes air bbs versus hotels so i like aligned with them and then it's like they went and trained at this gym and got muay thai classes when they went to thailand like that's awesome that's the type of trip i want to have so i'm going to just copy their trip dude i'm on board with that springboard we could do it we do it for trips and weddings whenever i like saw my wife like working so hard at this wedding i'm like dude just find someone else and just do the exact same thing no one will know who cares or her younger sister's getting married and i'm like dude just do exactly what we did it was great it was an awesome wedding and of course obviously they don't like that but i'm like yeah just do the exact same thing it was we all had a great time right uh bachelor parties yeah birthday parties i want to copy or i want to copy your work which is like it's pinterest but just like the whole thing strung together so how and like and you would just you would just do it where like uh someone uploads an itinerary and then you and then you people rate it and you pay them money and buy it yeah exactly so um so you you don't even have to buy the trip like just by doing the trip those people get paid mad money from affiliates like if i book that resort because this person said this resort is awesome i'm gonna get a kickback of like all the things that they recommend now it's pretty some perverse incentive but like everybody kind of offers a kickback so i think you can basically through affiliates you could monetize this pretty heavily for the for the creator themselves which which is what you can do is you could say it's not about like creator you just recommend what you genuinely recommend we're going to take the entire pool of affiliate fees and then pay it out based on whose trip got copied even if that hotel doesn't have to pay you to like right them you know what i mean i would do something like that where are you going hawaii oh that's cool and you haven't found this is not a fictional example this is a real example and you haven't been able to find uh a no i'm like so first i went on whatever expedia and i was like oh god miserable don't want to do this okay what else can i do okay i could tweet this out then i'm gonna get a bunch of recommendations all right that might work but that only works for me because i got a big following all right i was like how do people do this and i was like okay let me go to i was like let me go look at like you know an instagram person i follow but like they're not gonna happen to post about it that day so like it needs to be saved somewhere like a link in the bio of like or like you know one of their instagram story highlights which is like take one of our trips and it's like you know they always do this like uh they do this with fashion it's called like um i like i buy like or some shit like that it's like if you like my outfits you can go here and like you can buy any of the items for my outfit and they get a kickback it's basically like that for trips um and then i went on youtube and i was watching like okay you know watch this like family vlog at a at one of the resorts and i'm like and they're okay but it's like this eight minute video and it's just that one aspect it doesn't tell me about all the other shit that i could go do when i'm there and all that stuff so anyways i just think that's baller i'm on board elements of this happening it's just somebody should make this like an explicit thing i think i uh jack smith uses uh uh vas to do stuff constantly and he he's like at one point he even had some vas going into hotels into different countries and like taking pictures and sending it to him to let him know what it was but on a lighter for real on a lighter level it's crazy and on a lighter wait did he pay for them to go on vacation like he found a local va yeah he's like he would find a local person he's like hey can you go to these three hotels and take pictures and let me know and then he would like show them to his wife like all right which ones do you want uh it was pretty i'm calling him jack larue from now on that's so crazy he's kind of similar to that dude he just sent me a picture uh and it was him and andrew wilkinson and he's like look i'm with andrew and they have their ted talk badge on and so they're clearly at ted together and i was like oh how funny and uh uh jack's awesome yeah and anyway he uh does this all the time and it's actually really interesting and there's this company called tr flight fox do you know what flight fox is it's is that like where you'll just is it like somebody will book it for it's like is it a travel agent or is it the one where you're like i just want something give me like the best deal like no it's amazing so i have no idea how they make this work so basically you go to flight fox and you always have to click the button that says you're traveling for business and then a person you select like i want to go around this i want to go this day and i want to come back on this time or you can even say i want to go around this time um and then you like leave like notes like i've got a budget a blank or i only want first class or uh i have to be back for a wedding so i have to make sure there's backup flights and someone on the other end pops up goes hey what's going on i'm whatever i'm here to help you and it's a real person and they go and they find five to ten different flights that fit what you want and then you finally say all right this itinerary looks good or you could even reply and be like uh this one actually i had a change of plans i've got to change this this and this and they'll go and find flights for you and they find the cheapest ones and they know where to search for them and they only get paid until after you book the flight and they just take a 50 fee i have no idea how they make money and then like when i was in portugal my flight got canceled so i just logged on i go hey the flight you booked was canceled can you you know address it please and they call for you and they wait on hold for you and then you just pay them 50 bucks it's amazing i have no idea how this makes money or how they can make that work yeah get it while it lasts it's awesome that's amazing um that's like i i think i told you about this thing i did once mo points mo points.com it's our it's our but it's our good buddy ramon's good buddy oh yeah yeah yeah yeah this was like one of the best things uh i did it's like i booked this call with them and so you go to mo mo points.com just like mo points.com and basically it solves the problem of like what credit card should i get and so you just call this guy and he's like all right look like again you could just google what credit card should i get guess what you're gonna get like the most seo optimized blog posts in the world because they can make so much money off referring credit cards and you don't know if you're really getting the real deal and so i just called this guy 30 minutes and he was like all right tell me about what you spend on and tell me what you want do you want to travel like a baller like he's like look i travel first class worldwide just off this he's like i'm not rich i just but i use points to do it here's how i was like yeah i want that and so he's like cool get the amex gold he's like you're gonna get 4x points on all your facebook ads for your e-commerce thing you're gonna get one for you one for your wife so now you're gonna get like 2 million points or whatever like in the next year he's like then to travel you just do this you transfer points like don't book within their points portal because that's what i used to do i used to go to my points thing and be like uh rewards flights oh man i get like half a flight for all my chase points like no you need to transfer to travel partners and then there you need to like check this out you use like klm to fly you know here here and here and he's like just call me when you want to book he's like for now buy the amex gold start racking up your points when you want to book first class worldwide just call me again and i was like dude i feel so taken care of this was like the best money i've ever spent um just in terms of the again the relief of like ah i'm in good hands right like the real all state i'm in good hands is fucking mo from mo points dude i'm so i'm a fan i like these businesses i and i like the model of these things are typically monetized through affiliates but instead you're just gonna pay and i'll give you a more honest answer i actually i like that idea a lot yeah exactly uh me too i think it's great and um and uh yeah people should go sign up for that thing because if you spend a significant amount on like for your business it's like i mean it just makes financial sense to like optimize that so you're either going to get the best cash back like you know i found out oh if i use this bank of america platinum honors cash back card i get 2.6 percent back cash back which is like way higher than anybody else gives you does that mean it basically adds two percent to your bottom line yeah exactly like i take 2.6 percent yeah so so you know if you're spending you know uh 100 grand a month on ads which is like very common for e-commerce just use a round round number here you're getting 2600 a month back um just straight to your bottom line right like that just makes sense or you can reinvest that a 5 000 person company or like bcg who sends people all around the world do they just have like a bank full of like points i don't know what they do i actually asked my previous startup this i'll go i go what do we do with all the points we collect who gets to use those and i think they said that they just cash them they just do the cash back basically or they just convert them to cash which is like not the most efficient way to use it but like you know for simply a fair way to do it and they just like you know keep it uh i was like who keeps it where is this money i kept i used our points at the hustle and i i flew first class like twice a month it was sick and then when i sold the company i didn't have that perk anymore i was like damn i gotta pay for a flight for the first time in four years it sucks yeah so you gotta negotiate that in i well i kept them i got to keep all the points we had like a million points but i didn't get to uh i didn't get future points gotcha all right uh that's it i'll save my other ideas for the next one and you got a crime baby yeah i know um all right thank you you
