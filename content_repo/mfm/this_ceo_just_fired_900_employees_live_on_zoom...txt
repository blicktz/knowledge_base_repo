uh emergency emergency podcast uh had to do this saw this video the other day i was scrolling tiktok late into the night as i do saw this tiktok couldn't believe it i almost got out of bed right then to come record this uh but we're doing it now okay this is the one of the most ridiculous things i've ever seen this guy is going to be skewered for this that's my prediction this guy is going to get he might get fired for this uh but he is definitely going to get wrecked on all of social media for this um let's just let's listen to this so this is the ceo of a company called better.com they've raised like i don't know 750 million dollars a big company they do i don't know mortgages or some shit like that on the internet so uh here's the ceo let's just let's just take a listen no what's this take a listen hi everyone um thank you for joining um already looks like a funeral i come to you with not great news um the market has changed as you know and uh we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and okay the market has moved the market has moved what are you talking about uh you have all your employees on a zoom call right now obviously you have some quote not great news to share lesson number one and by the way how does this guy become a ceo of such a big company and not know rule number one if you're letting someone go or you're laying them off and you go into the meeting you gotta rip the band-aid off in the first minute the first three things you say one of them has to be we're gonna be letting you go today and then you start to explain everything when you do this you do this long-winded build up people are a confused and b they get really pissed off and it's just self-serving you're trying to buffer the blow you're trying to prevent the the blow from hitting you you can't even say it you're not even you're not even willing to say it so uh ridiculous okay let's so the market has moved and we have to move with it so we can survive what what is it is you shutting down the company what's going on deliver on a mission a mission what mission this is the news that you're going to want to hear uh but ultimately it was my decision and i wanted you to hear from me looks at his notes dude you still haven't said it it's been a really really challenging decision to make oh are you okay are you is it been hard for you i'm this is the second time in my career i'm doing this and i do not do not want to do this the last time i did it i cried um this time i hope to be stronger oh my god what are you thinking dude i get what he's thinking he's thinking i want them to know that this is hard for me but dude you don't understand what people are feeling right now they don't first of all they don't know what you're saying you haven't said it secondly you're talking about how hard this is for you and last time i cried no one gives a flying fuck if you cry or not um because you still haven't said it that's also that's the main problem the second problem is you're talking about yourself and no one cares about you in this moment laying off about 15 of the company laying off 50 the market you can hear a guy the guy who's okay the guy who's recording this by the way this is not the screen this is a guy pointing his camera at the phone and you heard him are you effing serious efficiency and performances and productivity and peanut butter market market performances efficiency and peanut butter what is this guy doing first of all he said we're laying off 15 of the company he didn't say which 15 yet now everybody is just thinking is it me is it not me they have no idea because he hasn't brought the sledgehammer yet and look this is the scroll bar all right this down here is where he should have said it we're now over here we're almost at intermission of the movie and uh you know he still hasn't said it so i can't believe what he just said why did he say performances by the way he's talking about the market has turned so oh is it my performance or is it the market and productivity and peanut butter if you're on this call you are part of the unlucky group fuck you dude i can't even help but laugh fuck you dude that is yeah see that guy is saying what he's supposed to say in this moment because of this fucked up hype trailer teaser strategy that the ceo took if you're on this call you are you're not a game show he thinks he's jeff probst he thinks he's a game show host and he's setting up this cliffhanger that actually is pushing them off the cliff and then they're they're falling down to their death so he comes in with you are one of the unlucky bunch unlike i thought you said his performance is it performance or is it unlucky or is it the market or is it peanut butter which one is it we don't know yet your employment here is terminated effective immediately are you fucking kidding me what does this mean for what's next you're gonna get an email from hr askhr at better.com to
