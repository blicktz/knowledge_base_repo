um what's your favorite interview question when you're interviewing somebody for a job uh on a scale one to ten how lucky do you think you are nice where'd you get that from uh when i interviewed at airbnb the founder asked me it it's the jeff bezos question he was the i think the originator of it or made it popular at least uh they asked jeff bezos what's your favorite question he said this and now a bunch of us have stole this joe gebby asked me it and i told him a nine or a ten and he said why and i explained to him why and i go why did you ask me that he goes people who uh say they're really lucky are the people i want to be around i was like why do you think that and he goes well if you're lucky if you think you're lucky you must be talented and things just fall in your place or you actually are lucky and i want to surround myself with lucky people i don't want to be around lucky people yeah the specifically question is uh how lucky of your person do you think you are one to ten one two three is like uh i'm not very lucky i don't consider myself a lucky person um four five six is i think i'm pretty i think i'm you know decently lucky average and i you know i think i know why or sorry i don't know why just that's just how it is and then this uh the sort of eight nine tens are um i consider myself a very lucky person and here's why and uh you want people who are either you know if luck is a thing you want them around you just like he said or if they're not you want people who are optimistic and uh you know when you're building a young business you need optimistic people and then the the why part is interesting too because some people know how to earn uh engineer serendipity they know how to engineer lucky situations for themselves or they're looking out for situations where they may be getting lucky and pounce on those opportunities and that's again somebody you want in an early business and then i'm going to ask you the same question and i think i know what yours is but i'm going to say another one that is deadly i love this question and this is when you back channel on someone and you want to ask about so let's say i'm interviewing henry and you're his old boss and i'll reference check i'll go i'll go sean what would you give henry out of 10 just say a number uh i'll give henry a seven okay and you're going to give him a seven because you want to you don't want to completely shit on him and you but you also want to be realistic and so i would then i would say okay well what what can i what can he do to get the remaining three points what can make him a perfect 10 that is the only way i've ever found to get critical feedback on a person other than saying what are they bad at uh well you know they're pretty good or like that's that's what they'll always say yeah for sure because people like you said want to be polite and then people also don't want to like lie based on their own experience that is the best way i've ever found to get it love it okay good reference check question for that specific thing yeah i know what it is and you should tell it i don't remember what because i've told a story once but i don't even remember what it was the founder of second life told me once who you are who you want to be or oh this one yeah this is a good one uh yeah you know i love questions like this uh i asked this in job interviews um but i also just asked this in social situations to be awkward uh fill in i say hey we're gonna play a little game uh i want you to fill in the blank first thing that comes to mind first answer best answer um i'm gonna say the first part you finish it and i'll say um life is all right let's alan let's play all right sorry henry you have the mic so let's play first answer best answer answer as you go uh life is people are i am oh okay the middle one was the only good one yeah so and then you use it to sort of have a little bit of conversation you try not to judge people too much off the top of the mind but um i actually just think this is useful for yourself so this is like your core outlook it's like what's life and you said life is great cool uh optimistic sort of grateful person um then you said people are tough that's interesting why do you say people are tough uh are you do you have you have a girlfriend yeah are you guys at a good spot you're dealing with some right now you are yeah that's what i what's a situation where people have been tough tough to deal with i don't know right now i'm trying to like like figure out where i'm going and like figure out what job i've like and ultimately going to career i'm going to do and it's just like tough like meeting with other people and like getting them to realize what like you want and like making them like people are tough to persuade or tough to to get on your on your page that's a great question you totally have you like you can see what he struggles with and values yeah and then the last one which is i am and you went with henry which is a very literal answer if you were going to do another one what would it be i am okay uh and then the second question i'll kind of ask is uh so so i've usually paused there i do the psychoanalysis and then uh a couple things happen people are like oh okay they just like want to leave because they feel so uncomfortable or they'll be like what are yours cool i like that that's a good sign when you ask what are yours um and then i'll tell them mine and then they'll do the same thing back to me and the last question is like um i tell them i said you know one thing i did was i i did those answers top of mind and i didn't really like what i said and then i just reassessed it i was like what do i think the answer should be for me like what do i want my answers to be what do i want my outlook of life people and myself to be right what do i want my mental model to be and then i revised it and then the best people come back a few days later and they're like hey by the way i uh you know i came up with my own and uh here's mine and those are the people i'm like i'm gonna be friends with you for a long long time because you're like me you like to do this stuff you
