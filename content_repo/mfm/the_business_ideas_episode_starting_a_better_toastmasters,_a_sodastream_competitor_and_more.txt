I think you could reinvent Toastmasters. I'm like, I feel like this is a business I could start if I wanted to, which is like Toastmasters, I think can be modernized. Like you don't have to have the oversized suit.

You don't need the like in-person meetups. Like I wrote Discord Toastmasters. Like I think you could do this whole thing in Zoom or Discord.

Like I think you just have people get into little chapters, practice this stuff, make, you know, they kind of meet people that kind of learn some techniques and they kind of get over their stage fright around public speaking. And the local ones ladder up into like the state ones. They ladder up into like the national ones.

And some people compete at it. And you get your certificate after going through the program. And it's like kind of a course.

It's kind of a church. And it's kind of like a self-help seminar that I think could be recreated in a modern way using Discord. That's my idea.

React to that. All right. What up?

My first million. It's a podcast that will change your goddamn life. If you like your life, unsubscribe right now because it ain't staying the same by the end of this.

Listen to that again. That's a good tagline. All right.

By the way, I think of all these amazing intros when we're not here on the pod and then I totally forget to do them. Like last night I was like, I was doing this little train sound to my daughter and I was like, dude, I'm freakishly good at making this train sound. I am like the best at doing this fake train.

I was like, I got to show Sam. I'm just going to start the podcast. But like Sam, you want to hear a train sound?

And then I'm going to do it. Ready? Hold on.

That's not good. I'm going to do it. This is the stupidest shit ever.

So why did anyone listen to this? Great cold open. All right, dude.

Talk to me about this dude who emailed us this guy. Who's this guy? So so Jonathan was like, hey, you guys got to announce the winners for the clip contest hey you guys got to announce the winners for the clip contest and i don't know who they are but he's going to help us do it is it jonathan is it this guy dylan or can i tell a separate story about this guy i i don't know who dylan is okay all right so this guy is a winner in my heart he may not have won the contest but i'm gonna find a way to like employ this person because he's amazing so this guy reaches out um i'm just gonna read you the cold email because it was too good he goes it's like a ransom letter yeah yeah i felt a little unsafe when i read this it goes i've clipped every mfm youtube pod that has been released just all business straight to the end then he goes hey sam and sean then again and all bold i've clipped every mfm podcast episode you've ever released i'm 22 unemployed i'm moving to israel next month and i have nothing to lose just kidding he didn't have that nothing to lose part but that would have been a little dangerous um he says i have nothing but 7k in savings to avoid getting a job in israel i figured i'd clip a clip all of your podcasts and either a you'll you'll buy my clips channel or b you'll hire me to do this for you full time you keep saying that you want to grow your youtube channel but you're not you're simply not putting on enough content let me explain youtube shorts short viewers are addicted to crack cocaine youtube wants to give viewers as much crack cocaine as possible to keep them addicted to youtube your content is the crack cocaine and crack cocaine addicts don't care about quality they care about quantity the amount of crack and then he goes uh here's what you're gonna do you're gonna use youtube shorts to drive people to your main channel your main content is is quality your shorts are going to be quality hire a dog parentheses me which is just incredible just an incredible way to start a sentence hire a dog parentheses me to pump out 100 shorts a day get an average of 600 000 new monthly viewers that will come from the youtube discovery feed what's and then he goes this is the ransom letter party he goes what's 600 000 new monthly viewers worth to you question mark your dog dylan that's right dylan you are my dog man this is amazing this is an amazing email spoke straight to my heart i emailed them i did you i replied separately did you no i just forwarded it to everybody i forwarded it to my whole team i was like this guy's a dog and then we and then he put a clip in there he goes here's an unlisted video from the account to prove it's me and then you watch it and he's talking and he sounds normal and he's cool and he's interesting and i was like i freaking love this guy i know i emailed them i was like hey um i i'm gonna send your stuff to hubspot and they could decide what they want to do with this but like can i hire you to do stuff because you told me you hired this content person i was like i probably need i've kind of been sucking to my personal shit maybe i should hire this guy and i emailed them so i'm definitely going to talk to him uh he this was a really good email i ignore just about every single email but this one i replied and i was like so bill and i haven't replied yet but you're going to get something from both of us or one of us i don't know um jonathan you had some more logistical things to say about who actually won the contest who who won the contest so we do it this guy not win by the way wait and well let's say so we do a contest where we give 5 000 so basically we have like these full episodes on youtube people go there they clop uh clip them up and they post them on tiktok and instagram whatever these are hashtag and we just are going to select people and we give them five grand but go ahead jonathan yeah so you select we select one person who has the most views period and then the other one is just the person of our choosing so dylan you are the lucky winner it sounds like uh but the actual winner was just some dude who created a tiktok with neil patel and it said like this billionaire spends 180k which is not even true because he's not a billionaire uh so that is the other winner that person's channel is called how many views did that get that thing has over a million views i think two million views yeah my first my first mil clip how do these like there's so many kids that are doing this they put on tiktok how how do they get so many views well this guy is a genius because he took he took the right clip right so he took a clip of some guy saying how much he spends which is gonna go viral because people get mad about it um people get mad when they hear somebody spending so much money and talking about it so casually because he also says in the clip you know i'm not rich but blah blah blah and then people are like yeah you're not rich bro you spent 180k a month and they like go off and so that little thing is like a trigger and then it's like oh watch this i'll trigger everybody right now with this one little clip so i think that's what worked also in the comments he was smart because somebody would comment be like who is this guy or the and he'd reply founder of google question mark question like the the the guy so he's intensely replying the wrong thing and everyone's like dude that's not the founder of google so all of a sudden the algorithm's like yes comments comments and so he would just reply like um like nonsense to people's comments and people would be like you're wrong dude you're so wrong he's like yes but i'm about to win this five grand off this two million view clip so you know congrats but also guys i feel like we should right now they're all making their own handles like mfm clip you know million clip boys and like they all have their own little handle like shouldn't we get these people it's only like i don't know 10 people who are really good at this like could we get them behind like our actual clips channel and be like whoever within this channel gets the most views gets the bounty for the month how do you do that you just you're going to give the password and log in to 10 different people and just say like fight yeah it's like you just like we're it's like uh we're just gonna throw like one sword you ever seen a cock fighting uh event i'm down i'm can we is that able to be pulled off like can you how do you know whose is whose but they put them in a slack and give them all the login and then when they post it's like they have to say i posted x and then you're like all right cool jump up put it in the spreadsheet which one you posted and then we'll keep track can we do that that actually that's great let's just do that it'll also make it easier for all of them because then that account will have more content so then all of them will benefit from the additional algorithm juice the followers that builds up will all be aggregated and we will own the channel in the end which is helpful to us and so i feel like that's a better way to go sounds like dylan's the dog so we just put dylan to work and he should be able to oh dylan you know like in any good uh you know like cockfight uh you know two chickens or roosters or whatever fighting each other it's like there's the one who's got like one eye he's been through like a hundred fights and he's still here so that's dylan the dog and every new challenger kind of comes in and he kind of wrangles them and then you know keeps them all together that's how i'm viewing this i'm i'm about it anyone that calls himself a dog i think is pretty cool uh so i'm a simple man with simple tastes yeah yeah like well i only know like dog the bounty hunter but he's cool to me so this guy dylan the dog is is the we're two for two for cool dogs your name's got an alliteration sweet man say no more where do we go from here all right um well let's talk about this content remixer thing so i posted this on twitter i think this is kind of what you were talking about i was like hey man i produce a bunch of content but like i'm kind of lazy with the follow-up so you know i'll produce the content of this podcast but as soon as we like literally the podcast ends with usually you say all right we're done that's the episode and then literally it's usually like one second later i'm like i realize how hungry i am i'm like i'm gonna go eat bye and then we like don't talk again until the next you know dude i don't even know i just i had like you and i recorded today's wednesday recorded on monday i like messaged ben on tuesday i'm like why aren't the episodes out and he goes like uh because we release it like next week i'm like we do since when it's like always last february yeah like uh i don't know how this podcast goes on the internet so yeah or even when i almost never or like the other day i like clicked it in the in the app and i was like oh man like this description is horribly out of date and this title and this intro and i like sent ben all these notes and he's probably like dude we've been doing it this way for like if you had a problem with this why did you say anything for the last nine months and it's like i don't know i never listen i never click it like yeah i'm here for the live show i don't i don't go to it after the fact uh it takes up a lot of space on my phone in fact i delete all the episodes so you know i'm not really the right listener but anyways long story short i put out this tweet i said hey i want to hire a content remixer basically i put out content on a podcast or my our newsletter for milk road but that's content that could live that could be turned into tweets turned into linkedin posts and like it seems like that's what smart people do they like cross post their shit at other places like we're we're doing contests so that somebody else will take our clips and put it on tick tock um so this is this idea of content remixing and i got a bunch of people interested which was great i hired one guy this guy brandon and he started with me this week and he's already putting out like already this week i'm going to put out more content than i did like the last six months because he's like all he's doing is taking the best stuff we've already done and just like packaging it into smaller nuggets that can go on all these different places channel so like for example i'm adding a newsletter send once a week that's just going to take the three best ideas or topics we talked about on the pod i'm just going to compile them into that uh because i know those people like people who are on my newsletter they would like this content summarized um and maybe even fleshed out right because the podcast is very off the cuff so sometimes you could kind of trim the fat and do a little extra research add a little data um and make it even better and so just take the three best things we talked about so he's doing that for milk road he's putting we put it on linkedin we put on twitter it's like okay cool so there's this idea of content remixing and as i was doing it i saw a bunch of other people were like hey if you find anyone good i would happily pay for this i'm you know i'm i'm already like you know up to my ears and like how much content i'm willing to create and like i would love it if somebody just took my stuff and repurposed it for other platforms who's an example of someone who reached out so um oh god who's their names so i'll show you uh actually the guy who used to work for you alex garcia i think is his name yeah yeah um so he had tweeted out something very similar he's like you gotta recycle your content um and a bunch of people had replied into that as well um so that's that's where i had seen oh wow there's like i'm not just getting emails about it but like people publicly were also like i would uh i would pay for this if you had this uh here we go so uh this guy i don't know how you say his name kai kai hi i don't know he's got this famous blog radreads.co yeah yeah yeah yeah how do you say the guy's name i don't know it's one of those words that i have only read on paper and i'm too embarrassed to say it out loud so he's probably got like you know i don't know tens of thousands 100 000 subscribers he goes he goes man how would i find train to manage this person like let me know if you find it another guy kp says dude this is so true i need one for my newsletter another person comes in and they're like um i forgot who it was like somebody who's into like kind of buying businesses space and they were like yeah i would kill for one of these and so i started thinking like actually i've been noticing there's these like niche agencies that people create that are like this like productized service so it's a service that they turn into like hey you need an exec assistant like just come to us we have vetted trained exec assistants that we will assign to you and we'll kind of manage that relationship and make sure that you you learn how to use them and they provide great service to you and you're not like you don't have to find them you don't have to train them you don't have to worry about quality control and so like i think athena is one of those that's it's like bacon they're like tech circles uh our buddy jack i think uses one of theirs we talked about the and we have like our french uh marshall does shepherd is it called shepherd shepherd support yeah and they like scale pretty quickly um it's just a service based business it's very straightforward my buddy jesse pugie he did one called growth assistant it's pretty dope basically it's like hey there's people like in the philippines that are really good at like managing your facebook ads reporting data in excel like every day um you know like going and updating your seo tags and like that like all these like little things that help your business grow so he took the idea of like a va or a an executive assistant he just rebranded it as a growth assistant and specifically they know how to do tasks that are related to growth um like oh i'll go get a transcript made and then i'll format it i'll post it on your blog or i'll i'll do what i'll look up your analytics and post it to you in slack every morning you and i have a friend and they make a million dollars a year eighty thousand dollars a month ghostwriting tweets for other for like popular people not popular people but like business people uh writing other people's tweets and using his uh handle to click like on the tweets that they write so it gets traction and amazing he was this person was telling me about this and i was like a that's awesome and b like if you wanted to and actually scale this into something that could potentially make like four or five six million dollars a year i think you could do i mean it's just it's just a boring agency it's not like that cool but i think you could just do like a twitter ghostwriting service i don't actually know how you would do it because um this person who i mentioned they do have some help overseas and i don't actually know how would you do it how do you teach how do you teach someone in the philippines to do this i think you could teach it but the hard part is like if you're gross writing for somebody else like again you need the source content from somewhere right like that the thought has to be somewhere so anybody could write the tweet once you have the thought like for example you did this with that what's his name the hockey player you helped like go super viral like five times uh chris so chris pronger he had but dude that was like the easiest thing because i'm like well you're like you've made over 100 million dollars in the nhl like this is the easiest thing ever it's like you it's like you said it's like this is an interesting story yeah well it's like a hot chick asking like for dating advice it's like oh i mean this is like like this is the easiest game on earth right you know anybody got instagram tips for me and say yeah um like move the camera down three inches yeah it was like the easiest you know what i mean like they he he had the goods you know like yeah it was easy that's that's an easy game i don't know how you would do that though for someone who's just a computer nerd well i think people do it for companies right i think that's where he that's where that that friend is doing it they basically take companies i think that they invest in and then they upsell them this service for their company content i think that's for the for the uh like the ceos yeah yeah exactly and so they they kind of whatever i don't know but i'm interested in these like productized service agencies i think they can do well i bet you said i i'm i don't want to do this so like you know feel free to steal my idea of like content remixers um there's all this already exists for like you know we cut clips of your youtube videos i'm not saying this doesn't exist i'm just saying dude a lot of people this could be successful a lot of people are doing this right now for clips so you and i know a couple people like that guy michael who uh you met with the other day and then uh what was the guy's names who we hired like two years ago to do it and henry yeah yes uh and that's like fine i think text is way easier like way easier like right and the market is better because podcasters are not a good market to sell to they don't have this type of stuff they're not making any money off this right um so you need to go for somebody who already has money and just has a shortage of time and for them words that bring them attention becomes uh you know becomes more money right like that's that's the trick how much did you pay this guy uh you probably don't want to say i don't want to say i already said his name but you know whatever it's a reasonable amount so uh but but i would say if you want to see kind of how these work that guy jesse um jesse pugie on twitter he tweets out the numbers behind his agency every like month or two and so like they're now up to 500 i think 500 000 a month in monthly recurring revenue um 400 or 500 000 there's a woman named adrian who actually runs the company so he had the idea he had a friend or somebody had worked with in the past named adrian she start actually like is the ceo of that company and it's called growth assistant and growth assistant basically just means like they fill out they just they fill out like spreadsheets it's kind of like all the little junior growth hacky assistant stuff so like i'll tell you how we use it for e-comm right uh or like we don't use them but like here's what i would you i i kind of like this is this is for somebody who's not as experienced maybe because like i already had people like this set up so i didn't need to pay the additional like fee that you you know you have to pay this management company right but uh basically i'm like hey every day you go put you go take all the uh these five kpis from our facebook ads google ads and shopify you put them in this spreadsheet you color code it then you take a screenshot you put that in slack because i want to wake up in the morning and i want to see our numbers color coded and i want to be able to comment on it and take action i don't want to spend the hour right like digging through and updating this dashboard and then secondly it's like oh okay cool every week i want you to go take the top sellers i want you to reorganize the store based on these rules and it's like i'm sure there's some software app that can kind of do this but like for for every business there's all these little nuanced you know like sort of like duct tape together things that you do that just make it work a little better but anything that's repetitive and anything you don't enjoy you want to delegate and so you delegate that to a growth assistant you teach them how to do this like we do it with influencer outreach too like go on go to this tool find influencers who who match this criteria reach out with this pitch here's the follow-up sequence i help craft with you and then like every time they they post something put it in this google drive photo so that my ads team can use it right like it's like super it's like a pipeline you know of of organization can you tell me about this d2c soda stream competitor thing yeah i think it's a great idea so i got a soda stream you probably already have one or have seen dude so listen listen listen what i have i have a soda stream okay and then as a gift i was gifted this thing so a soda stream is basically uh a canvas it's this thing whatever but you buy like the you have to buy like a 30 canister at the rate i was going like every uh two or three weeks because i use it at a time that's like all i drink it's like 30 bucks so what i did was i went to a scuba store and i bought a huge a scuba tank and it's you can if you go to my tick tock you can see it i bought this huge scuba tank and that cost uh like 30 dollars uh and i filled it up with uh co2 or whatever it is and that's what i've been using to to drink uh for my soda stream and it's the greatest thing ever you like i just bought this like this like this like attachment so i could uh uh use it it's pretty amazing that's hilarious dude yeah so i just got one um and i used to laugh and be like oh nice homebrew you're doing for your water like geez you know like like could you pick a more boring hobby than like bubbling your own like water at home dude check check the link that i sent you in the slack or in the um in the in the riverside chat okay let's see is this your okay it's a tick tock of your uh oh my god this is hilarious it's a giant scuba tank on the ground hooked up wired to your soda stream is this not going to be like too high powered it's makes it's very high powered i like i like what i say at home is i want my bubbles to be aggressive i want i want i want i really thought your quote there was going to be cooler yeah you're like that i say at home i i always tell people i like my water bubbly bro i needed something more epic yeah but i do like aggressive bubbles like you know topo chico i want it like how it burns so good that's what i want and yeah yeah there you go and and that's what i want so anyway i did that i bought like a piece for it for like ten dollars like it converts a scuba tank into a canister for toe uh for these soda streams this soda stream business do you know that it's like a multi-billion dollar product yeah that's what i was going to bring up so i when i bought this i was like i was like this is a great idea you know i'm buying tons of lacroix and stuff like that it's kind of annoying go lug these heavy can things i was like actually this does make sense to do at home and the product is slick you don't plug it like i thought oh i'm gonna have to like connect this to my water line or something like that it's like no it's like just sits on your counter no attachments it's like hands-free wireless bluetooth got it it's like an airpod basically and you put the bottle in you pump it three times you feel like you feel like you did it so you get this like sense of accomplishment and then you get the fresh sparkling water and it's awesome and it's not even flavored but it's fine and my daughter loves making it with me it's like a whole activity i can like if she's crying i'm like you want to go make some spicy water and she's like yes and so then we go and do it and so i'm like all right this is an amazing thing i go look it up i'm like you know i think this soda stream could be big and then like of course on the edit i go google it's like it's sold for three billion dollars like i don't know five years ago or something like that like it's owned by pepsi i think they probably do a billion in revenue like i'm pretty sure right before they sold they were at 900 something million in annual revenue and then they sold and like you haven't heard numbers since and like i'm sure it's over a billion dollars now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm pretty sure so there's two businesses in this space that i was shocked at how big they are and one was soda stream i think it's an israeli company correct like i'm just this is off memory i don't remember yes i believe so it's an israeli company that has been around for a bit and they killed it them and you know what else is just a behemoth is keurig keurig coffee i think keurig coffee makes uh like five or ten or something crazy billion dollars a year in revenue and it's been parlayed into a holding company uh that they buy all types of other stuff right oh wow um yeah the other one that's like this that i thought you were gonna say is what's the name of the one that was in offices and i think this is a i think it's bevy yeah bv wire i i'm not sure exactly which one um that was a multi-hundred million maybe a billion dollar company also and basically it was like hey fancy water fountain for your office like you can bring your water bottle to this you can uh just take a cup it could do bubbling it could do flat it could do warm and it's like all right that's cool that's better than like and i think they give you the machine for free and then you got to like just pay for the canisters over time right so same like razor blade model i'm like a big soda guy like to the point of sometimes i go when i lived in san francisco i used to go to this movie theater nearby because they had a freestyle coke machine that you could use without buying a ticket to the movie so i would i would always walk there just to get a cherry vanilla coke zero out of the soda machine the freestyle machine you know those machines of course of course they're the best so i try to buy one and you can't you can't buy uh you can't buy one of those machines you have to lease it and their terms it's like a lifetime lease so you have to spend like i think like 200 a month and you have to be willing to sign like this crazy agreement and then they have to come every month to refill the thing it was a pain in the ass i was like dude i just want like a like i want like a coke fountain like this seems like pretty easy just let me give you money and have it it and you you couldn't you couldn't do it so these bevy machines i'm all about i think they're amazing and the soda the soda stream i think is also amazing i i have one and i use it all the time too but i hate going to bed bath and beyond and buying those stupid ass containers right and so i think that there there are but i think that they're i'm sure some of these are successful but basically i saw it i was like this would make for a really interesting ddc product because i think you could this has the makings of what would make a really good ddc product and then i found one that was like really well design i can't find the name of it right now it's like cell neck or so cell deck or something i don't know what it was something like that but basically soda stream competitor but you just say all right these guys are selling through target and whatever how can i do the normal ddc playbook right get the logo lowercase pastel fonts send it to some influencers create a juicy offer that's like you know you can get the machine for like just pay for shipping and i'll send you the machine and then like now you're on the hook for the subscription of like cartridges uh someone's been reading alex or mosey book make it small make it big do something to like make it add a twist to it but damn this thing could uh this thing could work this thing could pop off so i don't know ddc soda stream super competitor i think that's like a 100 million dollar plus idea yeah that's an easy one what else do you want to do um all right let me give you another thing that i think is kind of cool so i started teaching my course this week and um how'd it go is it bigger you know i make it i make it look easy bro i make it look easy i heard people showed up shirtless yeah there's multiple people who just come to the class without the shirt on and i'm like bold bold choice um make yourself at home and uh you know they're all like ripped so like you know it's not like like we do have a line and the line is if you're not ripped if you're not adding to the visual appeal you're taking away from the visual appeal and that's my rule with my course my class and my rules where the sale where the sales uh how do they compare to the is digital revenue dropping off highest sales ever really for me i thought it would be slower because like the economy's going down i don't know why maybe uh maybe i sold it better maybe people just were like oh you know what like yeah life is changing you got pandemic you got layoffs you got all kinds of stuff like what if you know basically can i use a skill set here to like to like win in this like what do i need to change given that the world is like not the same as it was i think there's an element of that like it's sort of a new year's resolution effect where when the world changes a bunch people like assess like what's what matters and they realize like oh wow if i invested a little bit of money here could i unlock more potential in this new path because my current path is being shaken up and you did it on maven what the reason doing on maven they've been like they went overboard for me it has been awesome to they're like they're like managing my course for me and like doing a bunch of awesome help helpful stuff the first session i was like oh okay i gotta like dust off the cobwebs i gotta go perform and right before i was like okay i'm gonna go on and i always work myself into a state a state of mind and i'm like i'm gonna i don't i don't show up to these like cold or i don't rely on the slide deck or the material like i gotta perform so i'm like but but i'm sorry like it's 10 minutes before and i'm like oh i'm not in state right now i gotta get in state so i'm like okay what do i do and i'm like i gotta like you know like in nascar or whatever where you pull over and like they do like the pit stop it's like like take off all four wheels put new wheels on to like paint again slap the driver in the face like go like that's basically what i did to myself i like jumped in a cold shower and i like i like immediately uh turned on this thing i was like i like this like youtube video and i was like all right what do i need i was like i was like i think if i come out hot with a story like i think in that first two minutes if i just come in strong people are going to be like oh this is going to be an like this is going to be different like oh this is going to be good because you know like the first impression is going to really matter so i googled this like um i was like amazed i don't know what i wrote but i was like amazing uh start of a speech i put that in youtube or something and it pops out this video from a guy who won like the toastmasters challenge and the guy does this he goes this is good for the youtube viewers uh maybe podcast you're not gonna know what the hell's going on so the guy walks out on stage not not a great looking guy some you know looks like my indian cousin from somewhere so he he walks out and he's like doesn't say a word stands in front of the stage he's digging into his pocket you don't know what he's reaching for pulls out a cigarette puts it in his taste gets a lighter kind of like the cigarette and and you can just hear the crowd like murmuring like some people are laughing nervously some people are like no like you're indoors like don't don't do this and like other people are just like they don't know what to make of it so already has to settle word and he's commanding the room just by doing a pattern interrupt right so he comes out here and he's like and he looks at the crowd because they're all reacting at this point and he was like in his own world and he didn't come out there hi i'm sean i'm here to talk about but no no he didn't go out there and grovel to the audience he's he's trying to like this right then he looks like oh you're there and he looks and he goes what this no and i was like what i was like what is he doing this is incredible this is mind-blowing he's so he's like in just his facial expression he was like oh what what am i doing something this no he goes you think this is gonna kill me let me tell you something you know how many people die from cigarettes every year and i was like he's and nobody does the answer he's like whatever four million people die from cigarettes every year he's like you know how many people die from like obesity from sugar if i had brought out a cupcake and he's like you know nobody would have spat an eye but i like this one little cigarette statistically shows that you know like actually the biggest variable in me getting lung cancer is my genetics and not the fact that i smoke blah blah he goes and also i made all those facts up so and then he said that he's like but then he's got him like in the palm of his hand they're laughing they're like they're intrigued everybody's paying attention then he goes into his talk and whatever he like starts his thing and i was like this is the fire i need i turn off the video i run out the shower i put on a shirt and i start my my course and i'm like i don't do that i do like a completely different thing but that just sort of like set the mood for what did you do anyways so what did i do oh i go um i so i first told the story i go i go you know i'm here but i normally don't do this and they're like what do you like you're you're teaching this course i just paid you money what do you mean you don't do this so i'm like i don't want to do this you know i um i once i wanted to watch what amazing what what does the best public speaker do so i watched a video of tony robbins talking at the dreamforce conference who here is from san francisco you know if you're you know the dreamforce conference if you're from san francisco because it shuts the whole fucking city down and you're like why why can't i drive because salesforce is having a conference like they shut down the roads and people are like yeah yeah in the chat and then i'm like all right and mark benioff ceo of salesforce goes all right guys we got a special treat the final speaker of the event this guy's one of the best but here's the deal he doesn't come out to a cold room this guy will not come out if this room is cold he won't and not temperature wise he's like you need to have some energy you need to be i know it's the end of the day but this guy won't walk out to a cold room so get let's get the clap going and people start clapping and he comes out and like it's basically like he got a standing ovation before he even entered the stage and i was like i was like i saw that and i was like hmm new thing for me i don't come out to a cold room and i so i like demanded that they give me a little energy and i was like i was like how about we start with a story he was down for a story and they're like yeah yeah give me a story i go and i told a story i i've told it on the podcast before the the dmv story and basically my my message to them was like look let's all be honest uh 98 of courses end in what and everybody in the chat's like waste of money waste of time blah blah i'm like it's a good decision you dropped a thousand dollars on this course and you know that the stats say 98 of you are going to end up with a waste of money no results no progress waste of time and i was like okay but we don't we don't you know we're not part of that we don't want to be a statistic so like what's the right way to do this and i told the story about like how my trainer how he goes to the dmv and normally the dmv is like this horrible experience and he's like i want a five-star experience so he decided to show up he's like if i want them to be a five-star hospitality experience like the ritz carlton of dmvs i'm going to show up as a five-star customer so i'm going to walk in with a different energy into that and then like and then a bunch of good things happened he got to skip the lines lady gave him the thing he didn't have to take the test blah blah blah i tell her i told the full story of that that version and i was basically telling them like you're going to get out what you put in if you show up to this like yeah half of you are right now in the zoom you slouched over low energy half checking your phone uh you know not sure if this is going to be good or bad like you know not convinced you know you're coming in with a two-star attitude and a two-star effort you're going to get a two-star result and so i'm going to show you in this first session literally how to attend a course it has nothing to do with writing but i'm going to teach you how to show up to a course we don't learn this in school i'm going to show you how to actually do this right and i like go through a couple of like methods that's actually amazing so you let's talk about this course thing for a second because it seems like you are getting a lot of energy from doing it right in the moment yes i enjoy teaching it i hate selling it fair okay great i mean i don't think anyone really enjoys selling it but i i think you you you enjoy the the act of teaching which is good this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated whoa i can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better so let's listen to this what i did today is i uh so i've been doing this thing i i i'm also going to be a little vague i'm starting in this new thing that i'm working on and i found a company in the space that recently sold for 2.5 ish million dollars to a pe firm and um i found the the partner at the pe firm who bought it and today i just called them i just picked the phone and called them and i go hi uh what's going on uh my name's sam um sorry this is weird but do you have like two minutes to talk do you listen to podcasts by chance well he goes he was like well you're sam par right from my first million i was like hey what's up uh you know who i am but but the reason i'm calling is basically i'm starting a uh business that's a competitor to the one that you just bought last week and i wanted to know why you bought that company and what made it great and uh what what like what sucked about it uh he's like whoa you're really like coming forward you're you know you're being pretty forward i was like yeah well like here's the deal like um this is going to play out a few ways i'm going to start this thing and it's going to fail so you know you don't have to worry about that uh the second thing is i'm going to start something and i'm just going to like crush you guys um and the third way i start something and you eventually buy us um but like you know either way like i'm happy to share what i'm doing and and and hopefully you can share what you're doing and maybe somehow we can figure out a way to help us and i was like i know that sounds cocky i'm sorry but i this is out of respect i think you guys are actually amazing and uh it was so productive it i like i like i like i'm sorry but um me and dylan were both dogs and so this is a dog like me coming to a dog like you but this guy he was like uh he said um he's like yeah you know like i gotta go tell the team that like uh you know someone who's launched businesses in the before who has some capital is going into our space and i was in my head i was like i i don't want to do this but i was like dude i bet you i could sell this company to this guy right now now yeah on the spot yeah i was like i think i think brother you ever heard of addition by subtraction because i can tell you a little something about how to get rid of competition right now if you could do some addition on that calculator of yours take that back boy out let's come up with a number yeah i was like i was thinking about it i'm like am i can i just threaten you and maybe no i would never do that but if i i was like i this might be an option and so but the but this tactic of calling these people it's been very helpful so i'll give another i'm going to say two things one on the thing we're talking about earlier all right so this is my uh why it's okay to be douchey disclaimer when we're when me and sam are like oh we're doing this thing it's actually been easier like we did this and it just worked and i did five things that worked and sam's like yeah you could do something easier i'm like i make it look easy i say that for three reasons number one it's honest if something is easy i'll tell you it's easy if something's hard i'll tell you it's hard i'm not gonna like say what it's not just because it sounds better or worse and also when we say easy it can mean simple like it's not actually easy but it's like straightforward intellectually i know how to do it i just have to put the effort in it's also like for my personal trainer if he sits down on a bench and there's like i don't know whatever 200 pounds and he could he could bench it it's easy for him because he's put in 15 years of hard work so that that is now easy for him and similarly i got my ass kicked for like nine straight years from the age of like 20 to 29 with a startup failing over and over and over again nothing could have felt harder during that period of time and so that now things are like relatively feel much easier because i'm better now than i was three four or five years ago uh when i kind of sucked um so that's the that's the first part the second reason uh that we say it's easy is because this is a podcast and we're trying to be entertaining the third reason that we say it or at least that i say it is i am tired of everybody telling everybody that like is so hard and like if you go anywhere on the internet right like we joke about the the multi-trillionaire mindset like all of the like entrepreneurship content is like how hard it is you know uh elon musk says starting a company is like chewing glass and looking into the abyss some companies maybe yeah maybe for you bro but like you know i do a power writing course it's fine uh yeah it's like chewing bubble gum and looking at the pool like you know it's not the same thing so so it's not if if you always hear how hard it is you kind of have to question the source why do they say that hey it makes them look more heroic b it keeps other people from doing it c it kind of justifies why i got like why i get to be successful and rich because i'm paying this huge cost and like i actually subscribe to a different version of entrepreneurship which is the way that me and a lot of our friends do things which is like we do it because it's fun it's just like it's genuinely fun to do so it's not like this painful slog um that doesn't mean it's like no effort no it's pretty high effort just like playing a game or playing like pick up basketball you're gonna end up really sweaty and tired by the end but nobody confuses pick up basketball with like digging in a sand mine to like you know provide for your kids so it's like you know there's a difference between like uh enjoyable effort and painful effort and i would say that for us what we do is enjoyable effort and so i think it's important for people to hear that not everything has to be hard and slow and painful like there is a version of doing a business that is fun and faster and um and you know enjoyable and i just want to present both like that both exist so that you don't like pretend you don't create this fictional story in your mind that like everything has to be hard okay that's my disclaimer did we uh cross the douche line hard for sure well whatever i'm a habitual uh line step right so yeah it's gonna be that line it's gonna be okay so i the thing i forgot to say by the way the reason the whole reason i went on that tangent about i make it look easy with the with the talking public speaking thing was the video i watched was from toastmasters which i find to be a very fascinating business um and so i don't know if you know much about toastmasters i only know a tiny bit like i don't even entirely know what it is it's like a it's an entity it's like a group of meetups what is it ben jonathan have you guys ever gone to toastmasters do you have any experience with this do you know anything about toastmasters i i know what it is but no i've never been i have no experience how would you explain in your words if sam doesn't really fully know uh i think of it as a public speaking group where people who maybe don't feel comfortable public speaking go and they give little speeches to each other so they can get comfortable with it and learn more about public speaking and jonathan did you have something yeah i would say it's like people who wear oversized suits who've been doing it for years or people like me who probably went when i was like you know 15 and was just like trying to like get better at talking to girls or whatever the oversight suit thing is so spot on like you you can't watch a video of this and be like ah 36 long you sure you sure that was the right number i'm shocked you know what that means i mean you don't even own a suit i don't but i just like you know i watch tv or something so um so toastmasters is old school thing it gets around like the the one of the biggest fears people have which is public speaking one of the biggest desires is to be able to be a good public speaker or be comfortable speaking to strangers and so toastmasters these like look it's like alcoholics anonymous in a way it's like these local franchises local meetups run by local chairs and you go to the actual place i think this is at least how how this is the picture i have in my mind my mind but you go to the place and they kind of like teach you things but then you also get practice in this kind of safe space with a bunch of other people who are trying to get good at this it's very very useful it's been around for like 20 years and there's like there's like a whole like ecosystem of people who really care about toastmasters i think you could reinvent toastmasters um like i feel like this is a business i could start if i wanted to which is like toastmasters i think can be modernized like you don't have to have the oversized suit you don't need the like in person meetups like i wrote discord toastmasters like i think you could do this whole thing in zoom or discord like i think you just have people get into little chapters practice this stuff make you know they kind of meet people they kind of learn some techniques and they kind of get over their stage fright around public speaking and the local ones ladder up into like the state ones and they ladder up into like the national ones and some people compete at it um and you get your certificate after going through the program and it's like kind of a course it's kind of a church and it's kind of like a self-help seminar um that i think could be recreated in a modern way using discord that's my idea react to that do you want to know something interesting so toastmasters is a non-profit so all their revenue is public guess how much revenue they do um i'm gonna say 20 million a year wow not far 36 it looks like 36 million dollars a year in revenue um and it's from membership dues and fees so it's like a subscription revenue wow what do they charge and they've got 63 million dollars in the bank it looks like wow let me manage that for you um i could uh would you like to walk away with half that but with a great story to tell because i do have some crypto investments for you i agree with you i think that it i think it could work um how many members do you think they have i bet it's a huge number that pay a tiny amount i feel like they have like lifetime like 30 000 or 50 000 members of toastmasters is that real or is that overkill i can't find it on their thing but uh i can't find it on their on their my favorite type of pop quiz i don't know i don't know how many members they have but uh i i'm on board i think this is really interesting it's dude google have you seen their logo if you think if you think of a villain from batman that's what their logo looks like it's like a really old school yeah like corporate international yeah what the name should be headquarters inc it uh it's a clip art globe with like a blue clip art globe with like you know the the corporate name wrapped around the globe wow this is this is an this is interesting i hadn't looked at this in a minute um yeah i mean i'm a board i when i've gone i've gone to these before they are pretty life changing i think learning how to public speak i always tell people this is the only class i took in college that had an impact on my life was uh like debate or speech class or something whatever it was called but that's like the only class i think that actually matters that i took in college so i think it's i think these things are life-changing yeah if somebody's working on this reach out to me uh i just want to know about it uh specifically do not reach out to me if you're like i'd love to talk to you about potentially i might work on this don't do that if you do it tell me and just show me a link to your thing and then let's not do a call but i'll check it out and then let's talk more that's my uh that's how i'd like to do this going forward because i get a bunch of inbound every time i say that and it's like not the right type i'll give you the right type i talked about oh it'd be fun to create a company like pixar like maybe that's what i'll do i feel like i could that would be amazing and it'd be so much fun darmesh like that yeah i like what you're about to say got all hot and bothered is that where you're going i was about to say all hot and bothered did you remember you got a boss did you see uh someone goes uh damn darmesh came on the pod and talked about like how he's not worried about losing 500 million dollars that's some real big dick energy and he replied i forget what he said he goes that's very nice of you to say that i've got bde but i i really think it's more like uh i've got i i i try to have that energy but i try to have sev small ego what was it vibes small ego vibes and i replied uh that's such a big dick energy thing to say and he loved it and sarah was like uh sarah was like man darmesh is such a great guy but does he know that he's like he needs to tell you to shut the fuck up because uh he needs to like put you down right now because he's so nice and he just like puts up with all this bullshit no it's it's great in fact your um hubspot experience is i feel like the opposite of my twitch experience like you got acquired and i feel like they're like go on cowboy do your thing out there and they're like you know they love it and they're like oh sam you know vaguely you know offended you know one tenth of the population today ah what a guy you know it's all good just you know he's doing his thing like and they like engage they like the podcast all the stuff where i was like i feel like when i was doing this stuff at twitch they were like um does this guy work here like why is he just on twitter and like he just leaves in the middle of the day and goes and records at a studio and like what does that have to do with anything that we do here and i feel like my twitter personality was like a constant source of annoyance for like 70 of like the management team there and 30 i think liked it or appreciated it like the secure people they were just like oh it's cool yeah do your thing man it's cool i like it uh or like the thing you said was stupid here's why it was stupid and we get into a debate about it and it was all good but i feel like 70 of people were just like silently like f this guy this guy is no good well what would you have done with you it depends you know um that's a great question that's a really great question because my honest answer is i would have been like look man i get it uh i like what you do i'm like basically i like what you're doing but i also feel like it's just kind of selfish like you know you're doing your thing it doesn't really have to do with this so there's kind of like two ways that this can go number one if you're one foot out the door let's maybe go two feet out the door like maybe it'll save us both some pain like if that's actually what you want to do let's do it and like then i won't feel like you know i don't want to ever feel like you're not like kicking ass for us um while that was the agreement let's change the agreement if the agreement needs to be changed the second would be the second way i'd approach it is look i get it and this is what emmett did tell me he goes i get it you're not going to be here forever i went i wish that you stayed forever but i i know your future is not going to be here um so let's be honest about that that's fine uh he goes he said to me he goes when you do start your next thing i would love to invest in it like because i know you're not gonna be here forever but i like i really like seeing how you work i would invest you so that that made me feel awesome it made me really respect the guy it made me like put down my guard in terms of that like okay i can just be honest with this person which i think is just a great way to like manage somebody and then the last part i think that i would have kind of tweaked is just like um let's agree that while you're here you're going to kick ass in these ways and here's my deal to you you kick ass in these ways um you do all these things but as soon as you stop kicking ass then let's have a conversation about why that happened because i know that if you tried you would do well that means if you're not doing well that means you've stopped trying and i'm not cool with stopping trying like i'm cool if you're going to spend x percent of your energy doing this other stuff and kind of paving your future but i need to know that at least you're going to kick ass when you're when you are here i need you to be fully plugged in when you are here i mean part of the reason was also that your like company had nothing to do with necessarily the stuff that intrigued you and interested you uh my company and my job after the sale was to create content and that's what i'm doing and for the most part i do it consistently like we're incredibly consistent and mostly rarely offend people and also darmesh is cool as shit so of course i'm gonna give him a hard like like because i'm gonna mess around with them but everything we say is like flattering for for him i at least i think it is it's supposed to be but uh yeah that's that's the big difference your job is to build this podcast my job was to do something else i was building the podcast as a side thing like basically i would what i would do is we record these at noon because that's when everybody else at twitch goes to the cafeteria to eat lunch that's when the cafeteria opens and i would just walk outside your office was right across the street and we built the studio there and i would just walk across the street and instead of eating lunch i would go do the podcast and then when i got back i would grab a bite and like take it to my desk and like so that's how i kind of like did it on the side whereas your job is to do this thing which is quite different ben um are is the audience going to get any types of value from this total meandering um 12 year old discussion no don't do that you're just fishing for him to say uh we sucked right ben or maybe we do maybe it's okay no ben give us the full the full honest take don't don't don't compliment sam because he put himself down so i'll give you i'll give you a backhanded compliment here's the backhand i love those um this was a good episode it was a good episode because the show is about business ideas and the show is like very fun and great but sometimes we like get away from that too much and this had numerous good business ideas so like the toastmasters uh of the future the whatever discord meets toastmasters like there's like an actually good business idea that someone could run with or like ddc d2c soda stream like again it's like a good business idea so um remixer agency that's another one remixer agency um kind of uh tweets uh as a service is not like a business idea for someone else but like kind of could spark some thoughts so it had a ton as packed of business ideas so i think it was a good episode ben you also said it was backhanded but then you just gave us a normal like a little bit of a good episode because i was saying like sometimes on recent episodes we don't talk a lot about business ideas okay that's why this one's good yeah okay like we're getting back to it if you got three interesting business ideas out of this podcast i will put that up against any other podcast you listen to how many podcasts are giving you one good business idea uh per hour i'm dropping three with at least four to five jokes solid chuckles that will make you know the person next to you on the bus be like what are you listening to what is that so i mean this podcast was phenomenal as far as i'm concerned hey before we go we did like a whole deep dive on my dm history with uh mr beast sean are we going to talk about uh yours at all yeah you know i was going to start the pod with this but i didn't want to you know like i don't know what the etiquette is on is there a dialogue going on outing sam parr as the only person on this podcast that is not friends with mr b beast and like you know i know that for some people it's like it's your choice it's your body your choice you want to disclose that sam now that we're here after we recorded the pod about ben getting a call from a dm and call from mr beast that episode is not even out yet i checked my dms yesterday oh look who's here mr beast and he's talking about something else and i just thought to myself i was pretty happy that it was mr beast but i was only more happy that i thought oh my god this means sam is the only one of us that didn't get one and i got i was over the moon so um did uh is there is there a dialogue going on there's the dialogue bro this i'm saying words he's saying words i'm sending memes he's sending beams actually it's just me sending the memes but i'm trying to get a laugh and uh yeah it's happening we are full-fledged hot and heavy conversation i hate you mr beast good i don't want to talk to you and ben don't tell me if you told him to dm me like just don't tell me that i need to feel like i did this but i'm gonna put earmuffs on and you say if you told him well bent bent i i told him listen there's these cool guys that i mentor who i help out every now and then and uh you should i think they would really like it it would like make their lives if you could reach out and like maybe tell him happy birthday or something like that i think that's why he reached out like a make-a-wish foundation yeah i deal with these two guys they're a little off but like my kid brother the world to you to them if you would just accidentally you know send them a word and do you uh can we get him on here you think i brought it up he didn't bite the first time i brought it up but now that sean's the yemming with him i bet i bet it does happen at some point well ben you got a little kid you know when you feed a kid they don't always bite but if they don't spit it out either we say okay tomorrow the airplane's coming in again with the mac and cheese and we'll try again tomorrow okay i don't know where we go but all right i guess that's it you
