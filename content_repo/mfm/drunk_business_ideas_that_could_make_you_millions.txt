i got my drunk ideas should we do some drunk ideas yeah let's do it all right so again to frame this these are ideas that i had that i don't think are good but i still want to say them so i call it drunk ideas even though i didn't have them while i was drunk i was stone cold sober but that's my cover story all right so drunk idea number one is called and you got every you got to tell me i think i did this before and by the way one gem came out of it which was my lucky water brand uh that i do intend to create so you know some gems do come out of out of this so ben you're a participant in this one i need you both to give me your your idea your reaction what's what should the scale be on the reaction is it like you know uh you know on a scale of sober to piss drunk or like on a scale of like you know horrible to good idea how do you want to rate these let's do one in ten one in ten all right first idea is called very long distance girlfriend okay so i had this idea because i realized like i'm sitting there and me and my wife we like to watch all these dating shows right so we watch love is blind we watch the bachelor and you watch these shows and it's sort of like it's like the honeymoon period and i like i would say most people's homes are like ours it's like the scene is this on screen you see like two usually beautiful people living some kind of fairy tale date um and then like one person's kind of like you know there's some drama one person's being dramatic or one person's unsure and the other person's really good or whatever and then you and then if you if you zoomed out off the tv you'd see a couch with usually a couple sitting like six feet apart from each other because they're so sick of each other uh you know there's like you know in their sweats not dressed up with their you know double chin eating their popcorn and cheetos and being like pointing at the screen and be like ah she's not even that hot or like you know oh he's you know he's such a jerk and it's like judging these relationships right but like there's something to this of why we like it right we like seeing these other relationships but i also think it's like when we do that we do that with ufc it'd be like oh he shouldn't have tapped out yeah dude he's such a pussy he's so weak he looks scared yeah dude he's so scared that's why i don't like him because he's scared it's like yeah it's not confident oh my god there's a spider in my room you know like so so so yeah there's definitely like a judgy there's a fun in judging it but i would also say there's a fun in the sort of fairy tale like i think everybody when you're watching these shows you sort of put yourself in the shoes of either the person pursuing or the person being pursued you know you're the you're the damsel or you're the prince whatever it is so the idea behind very long distance girlfriend is as follows it's a service or app i think it's just a service i think it's just a text message this is a phone number you put in your address book and we give you the perfect boyfriend or girlfriend you're never going to meet with this person it's not even the intention it's just somebody who's going to treat you perfectly because they're paid to do it and so so it's like prostitution it's like what's a prostitute a prostitute is somebody who's paid to love to love you right to make love to you but that's a lot i don't want to cross that line that's a lot of work so this is like you know how tinder made dating easier because you don't have to like go date everybody you just sort of swipe left and right easily on your phone it kind of gave you this like flirting hit but you didn't have to go out put in a lot of effort so here's what you would get if you if you sign up for very long very long distance girlfriend there's there's gonna be a person that pretends to be your girlfriend they're gonna text you they're gonna ask how you're doing they're gonna be emotionally there for you they're gonna text you baby photos of themselves they're gonna say that they want you you're gonna be like oh my god i'm this person wants me they're never gonna nag you they're never gonna get mad at you they're never gonna get jealous they're never gonna do any of the things that real human beings do when that are the downsides of relationships only the upside none of the downside so for girls you're gonna get prince charming on the other side he's gonna be complimentary he's gonna be thoughtful he's gonna be there for you uh and for for guys you're gonna get sort of what you want as the perfect girlfriend and we're just gonna hire call centers of of just dudes and they're gonna behave as your very long distance boyfriend or girlfriend all right give me your give me your ratings i'm gonna start with sam i give that a 10 i i think that uh i i think that's great to be honest i think that surely that like if we went to adult friend finder.com or something like that is that what they do what is adult friend finder what is that like like webcam or you're asking the wrong guy i don't follow these trick questions i have no idea um yeah i mean this is brilliant how many friends do you have who you've only met via texting and you've like i've got like a bunch of friends who i've only ever texted yeah exactly i have now most of my life is people i only text with maybe i knew them before there's a bunch of people that like i don't know just through twitter or through you know the podcast or through friends of friends we get in a group chat together i know their personality they're cool like that's my actual friend even though i never met them so why not even heard their voice or talk to them like through voice and in fact i have no desire to really meet them like i don't want to go out of my way to go like hang out with them i'm getting all the benefits that i want out of just the text yeah so anyway i have a lot of friends like that and i consider them to be really close friends i i i can't tell you how tall they are what their voice sounds like but i love them and so because of that i'm in what do you think ben i give it a one it sounds diabolical it sounds a one zero or oh just a one zero a big slow roll for a 10 there's this genre of idea of sean business idea that essentially is i went and watched an episode of black mirror and said actually that's a good idea and this is one of those but that's a great idea are good ideas yeah that's where do you think they're getting their ideas they go to the great idea pile and then they take a great idea and they say okay let's put this to its logical extreme where it actually turns bad like have you remember that remember that tv show on disney called smart home where uh the the the it's like a smart home it's like alexa before alexa basically yeah yeah it's a great idea yeah and the smart home ended up being the mom and the wife so it kind of is like what we're describing now so i think that like yeah i haven't watched her i think her is something like this it's like a voice assistant that he kind of falls in love with i haven't seen that but again it's not even about falling in love it's just dude it's fun to get certain types of text messages right it's fun to get a funny chat text from a friend it's fun to get something interesting texted to you that's kind of what the hustle does the hustle just sends me some interesting stuff every morning the milk road tries to do that here's some interesting crypto stuff right we're your friend but i'm not really your friend i'm just sending you some cool stuff you like getting that message but that's for the work part of our life what about the personal side ben are you telling me you would i mean i know what you're gonna say you're gonna say no but let me just put it out there anyways you're telling me you would not want to be getting texts from a woman who's so into you and it's not cheating you're never going to do anything it's not even a real person you're never going to see him nothing like that especially if you're single right like i'm not talking about like we're all i think we're all married men right so so it's not for us this is for 25 year old me not 30 i don't know how old i am 34 year old me yeah i uh obviously we're not the target demographic all of us because we're all married yeah um but having said that like even if it was just like a as a as a a friend type of thing i like i already have actual friends that i don't text back the last thing i need is another thing that's literally just a person to not text back i don't need another one of those in my life but fair enough maybe it's a bad idea but no no as a as a business idea of course it's a good idea of course it's like this has money making potential as a thing that is good for humans you know that's that's why i gave it a one oh i'm not i'm not in the i know i know i just felt like i had to be the conscience here i had that one person had to be like sean you know this is okay okay it's good you know i'm the devil you're the angel on the shoulders we have to be there yin and yang that's how it works that's good uh yeah you know if you want good things you should uh you know go eat your vegetables work out you know wake up and pray do all the things right like that's cool don't invest in russian companies yeah don't invest in russian companies don't have the very long distance girlfriend service for $19.99 a month don't um you know don't use tiktok don't do any of the things that you do probably all right next idea it sounds related but it's not it's the huge beds company you kind of alluded to this earlier i've been thinking about the luxuries of life that i care about we all we all know what i do private chef personal trainer at my house i live like a king the one thing i don't live like a king with is my bed is only king sized but a true king would not have it a king size bed true kings have what's called a emperor size bed have you ever heard of these no so athletes have these i saw these because there's a woman who has this business it's already a great business there's a woman who makes beds for nba athletes and so shack has a 24 foot bed i believe of like 24 foot like in diameter and um you know a whole bunch of players do this they have 12 foot diameter beds 18 foot things like that the room it's like it looks ridiculous but the whole family can sleep on there and still have their space uh like you know just to get to your spot on the bed you kind of have to crawl there like a small child just to your pillow like because there was such a long runway and so i've always saw these and i thought these look super comfortable and i've decided i want a very huge bed and i realized i wouldn't know where to go buy it so my idea is a ddc brand called huge beds name tbd we need a we need a better name no no keep it it's like it's like the it's like uh the company big ass fans yeah it should be big ass beds okay that's the name big ass beds for badass people marketing slogan included with my drunk ideas all right so so big ass beds and basically it's just a ddc brand that sells you this right like these are very expensive so these these run for like 20 20 000 on average i think is like the cost of these like humongous oversized beds and that's why athletes buy them because they're a the nba players are already very tall plus they got a lot of money so it's like the sweet spot for them and this woman who they buy it from it's this one woman and she just sells it all through her instagram basically it's like some player posts a picture of his bed tags the woman people go look at hers she has like an instagram full of huge beds people go buy from her um so i think that's just like a niche that somebody could go own big ass beds and i think you know okay athletes is one but we need to find a new niche we may need to go into a new sport or maybe maybe it's business nerds who are trying to optimize their sleep and it's like you know you make up some mojo jumbo about this having a big bed it's not gonna make you sleep better unless you're like eight feet tall have you tried it well maybe it's like a free-range chicken maybe when you're not confined by this you know like maybe you have anxiety all night you might fall off the bed right maybe just being able to stretch out is nice right maybe maybe not being so cramped is nice i don't know seems like there's some benefits there definitely maybe is but definitely probably isn't i mean haven't you been in a cal haven't you been in a california uh king-sized bed before i have a california king-sized bed yeah you have a california you have a california king and by the way a california king is like the same size as a king it's just longer instead of wider it's the same overall size it's just longer so it's not the same overall size but yeah no no it's the same size but it's like less wide more long are the other ones more wide less long you have a california king-sized with baby that's a huge bed if you ask me that i think that's big is that not is is it just you and your wife in the bed or do your kids stay there sometimes my kids stay there and my dog so it's like you know we got a full house in the bed most nights i think that likely there's another thing that should be addressed than making a bed bigger yeah like don't let i would call it i would create it how about we call it uh i thought we create a little kid bed company or a dog bed yeah or we'll call it a crib or we can make like a dog bed business also a good idea i think maybe those are the solutions to your problem instead of making a 20 by 20 a 400 square foot bed ben what do you got here it seems like you might be on my side sam is so wrong on this but i i have a king size bed it is a good size uh i don't want to be good enough for you no i don't want to be anywhere near my wife when i sleep i want to have to shout for here to hear me like there's always like just some little toe poking me in the middle of the night and if you could just offer me i never have to worry about that a b you're right sam is it going to actually give me better sleep probably not is it going to be an amazing experience to just like crawl onto this massive piece of luxury that is 20 feet long yes it sounds like an amazing experience and i want it i want to feel that and you're spending a third of your day on this bed right you're spending eight hours on this bed why not just the second that you said like a 20 foot wide bed i just knew i wanted it my heart knows that i want to see the pictures when you see the picture you're like ah this looks like lavish as fuck all right so uh do you guys one question do you guys sleep with a pillow in between your legs of course i sleep with a maternity pillow same so i i have a body i have a body pillow and so i like basically spoon the pillow because i need my my knees to be i can't have well that's just straight ergonomics that's just like that's proven that's not even like us being weird that's us being scientists so the reason i use my wife's pregnancy pillow is science do you really you use her what does she i bought two so i so i bought her i bought her one because my buddy my buddy told me this my buddy goes congrats you guys are pregnant fantastic so happy for you hey get your phone out and go to this website you're gonna buy this swedish pillow it's 200 but trust me best pillow ever and i was like oh my god like never been so intrigued by a sales pitch took out my phone ordered it right there i'll never forget where i was i was in an uber in las vegas when this happened and i thought all right and it's like it says like five weeks to ship i was like oh my god this must be fantastic if it's like such a shitty experience and so uh it arrives it's amazing my wife uses it she's like it's good and i was like oh only good he really built it up let me try it out i try it for a nap so good i ordered myself one and now she never just used she never uses any of them i use both of them actually and i it's fantastic what's it called uh i'll have to look it up it's uh it's like some swedish name that i don't really know yeah i'm a big fan of those i'll buy one i i just had like a really long pillow that i just kind of spoon but maybe i should buy one of these it is called oh here it is bb hug me.com so the two letters bb then hug me.com bb hug me uh and it's designed in scandinavia so that's not sweet a scandinavian and uh just look at it it just looks like it's gonna be good and then it is good it's really it's really great really great pillow all right i'm gonna buy one of these wow this looks huge yeah it's not that big uh but it's like kind of like it's like got like beads inside or whatever so it's sort of like forms to your body it's great all right i'm on board with this i bet these guys crush it by the way yeah i can imagine the thing's really i think it's pretty expensive it's like two hundred dollars for one pillow which is great site a lot um all right so here's my next drunk idea i got two more for you hoa court okay so do you guys have an hoa where you live no i'm no you one time if i remember correctly sean you had an hoa just for a duplex didn't you yeah yeah me and me and our other person we had a hoa with an hoa fee but we both as soon as we bought the place we were like yo we're not gonna put four hundred dollars into this every every day right like and we're both just agreeing we're not putting four hundred dollars a month into this you have an hoa ben yeah and i kind of hate it so my hoa has been harassing me lately i've been getting letters so i rent i rent my current place and uh we live in this neighborhood and there's some karen in this neighborhood that just hates me and she's like oh i don't like that you you know leave the trash bins out a little you know an extra day i don't like that you work out on the like street in the driveway like you no exercise no exercise equipment is allowed i'm like what is that are you exaggerating really no no there's three complaints there's that there's that and then there's another one which is um we get like water delivered like you know like the kind of like a water dispenser so you get these jugs five gallon jugs and so they're like kind of like they're like the guy delivers it to our door but he tucks it behind this pillar so if you're looking at our house you can't even see it you'd have to like walk up to our like walk halfway up our thing to go see the thing and so somebody just keeps complaining to and our landlord's like dude what's going on is it look and he lives in another state so he's like what is this like can you just are you like fucking up things i'm like no i don't do anything wrong okay the trash i do leave out a little bit um but you know besides that it's not a big deal like when you're working out in the street is it like just you and your trainer and what do you do just throw in a medicine ball or something no we're doing lunges it's like dude i can lunge in the street there's nothing or like we have a battle rope that we'll put on a you know art but that's my driveway dude i can do what i want in my driveway um and so in my neighborhood it's like mostly really old people that like don't really do it do much so you know i get it but i'm not disruptive anyway so so this hoa thing and so i first was like i was like okay i have two choices i can either just quietly resolve the issues just listen just move the trash cans in put the battle rope inside the garage only move it out when i want and uh water jugs like i guess i could pull them inside the door it kind of takes up space but you know no no harm done no you cannot do those no no no no number one is not happening right right this is war and so i went to war so i was like you know what i'm gonna waste my time and energy fighting this hoa who is this hoa after all i demanded names i demanded to speak to somebody i said they can call me direct next time they have a problem i said here's my number i put it out there i started to um i said i started to go take photos of other houses i said i'd like to file some complaints myself oh what is this children's swing at the front yard this person has violation why is this person's garbage cans outside violation why is this person riding their bicycle exercise equipment on the street violation and so i started fighting back and i started saying is it because i'm the only brown guy in the neighborhood of course i was waiting for the race that you had to do that you had to i can only wonder what's so different because again i see violations all around me now and so i'm i am basic but there's no my complaints are falling on deaf ears and i'm wasting a bunch of time i need hoa court it's a judge judy like show streamed onto netflix and or youtube where i can go present my case and it's a place for petty people to do their thing and that's that's my pitch is it's actually a show it's a tv show hoa court or petty court petty yeah maybe petty court maybe petty is the right way to do it i think that's beautiful but isn't this do hoa people not have a what's that called where um before you go to court you can hire a um arbitration meet arbitrage uh an arbitration mediation yeah uh is there what do you do with hoa how do you know who wins you can't win that's the problem hoa is this like you know ambiguous force that just controls you even though you you you know you pay your hard-earned american money to uh to live in this place to buy this land to live free but the freedom's not there and that's why we need petty court to bring back our freedoms and to put put these petty people back in their place do you do you um like do you just like reply all to an email well no it's like they they use these agents like cowards there's like a there's like a random hoa email address with like one person behind it's like no who's complaining is the majority of the neighborhood complaining maybe it's a democracy maybe we need 51 complaints for me to change the way i do things why does one person get to change my way of living right that sounds a little crazy to me so i just feel like there's no justice and then when there's no justice i can't sleep and that's so but i i i want to dig deeper on this because i actually think that it's totally not worth your time to fight this this is this is a fight this fight oh it's certainly not worth my time no it is definitely these fights are worth our this is what living is for i love doing this stuff i love fighting with neighbors and like trying to win and like rub their face in it like a dog who pees inside i love this and so is there a way i don't believe that's considered the best practice anymore by the way for dogs for dog training i don't deal with hoa i don't want pita coming after us is there is there a way that you can set a trap and figure out who it is i don't know how i would do that um oh i know i put a unique letter under the doorstep of everybody in the neighborhood i say listen i heard about the complaint and i understand in fact i'm sorry that i did what i did um you know i would just love to make it up to you what's your favorite flavor chocolate or vanilla i'll send you a treat because you were right and i was wrong and i just need you to know that you were so right with your hoa complaint um so just shoot me your uh hey just text me your favorite flavor honey pot gotcha that's actually pretty brilliant and you could do one of two things you could either say this person's a flavor this person it's a what size t-shirt you are or you could just get a bunch of different google numbers and see which one oh no no even better google i say hey have you guys seen this asshole who lives over here guy keeps putting his he keeps doing lunges in the street am i right like violent violence in our neighborhood um i think we should escalate this he's not listening uh i believe it was you who made the complaint but maybe i have that wrong if it was you i'd like to discuss steps of how we might escalate this issue to make sure that jerk goes down you bring them in bring them close before i put them put them away i i i would love for you to do this how many people live in the neighborhood it's everybody's defaulted in there's probably i don't know like 100 maybe 60 houses 100 houses something like that it's a lot of a lot of time and energy you don't have to like shut down one of my businesses just to do this you don't think you know who's doing this i have no idea really it hurts me because i know there's somebody who walks by smiling at me while i'm working out in my garage i just work out in my garage with the group with the door open just have some air right like it's no big deal i'm allowed to do that in my home gym you can't change your behavior you have to continue doing it well i've already bent but uh you know i've brought the water bottles inside and i move the trash cans but you should buy lawn chairs and put them in your front lawn and just hang out there without a shirt consistently i think that's what the move has to be that's a gift to the neighborhood all right um last idea last idea all right the nba all-star game just happened and um and every sport has this and baseball has the home run derby football has the pro bowl nba has the dunk contest and the all-star game why doesn't this exist for business is that a thought that's ever crossed your mind why don't we have the tech all-star game why don't we have the business the business all-stars i feel like there's there's an opportunity here to bring together the who's who i'm just going to use tech for now so bring together the who's who of tech just the all-stars honor them get them to compete for our entertainment and uh just make a weekend out of it right why aren't we why are we treating this like the sport that it is so here's here's how this might work tech all-star game is basically a hackathon and i get zuck and i get larry page and sergey sergey and i go get founders of different mega companies and they're going to perform it's going to be live streamed onto youtube and they're going to have to build something they get 24 hours to build something so you have an all-star designer you got johnny ive working with mark zuckerberg all of a sudden you got brian chesky working with you know uh whoever you know sundar or whatever you get you pair these guys up into random combinations and they're going to have to do a hackathon they're going to have to build something and demo it and somebody wins the trophy for building something cool because you've seen that like dharmesh loves to hack and build little projects i remember when covid happened kevin system the guy from instagram he built this dashboard that was measuring the viral coefficient the spread because he's like hey these politicians are just like making statements and we have no source of truth no dashboard that tells us how this thing's spreading and how it's not per city and that's what we need to look at and so he built this dashboard there and i just thought huh i wonder what would happen if you unleashed these types of brains the all-stars in a in a little competition of their own a little hackathon of their own what do you think of this idea i think if you can if it's if the if the idea is like an award thing then i think that's the worst idea you've ever had i think that's a horrible idea if you think if it's like a hackathon no one will ever do that but i think it's an interesting exercise and that and here's my question to you if you took let's say mark zuckerberg jeff bezos um uh the google guys and the ceo and you had them do a hackathon do you think any of them are actually still capable of making anything something like making it but but it wouldn't be them on their own so you'd pair them with like every team is the all-star an all-star engineer so all-star technology person an all-star designer and then an all-star ceo product visionary no that's bullshit you want one-on-one if it's just that like for example i can't probably build anything he might you know he's gonna go build like a blog well like if it was if it was like you and me it's like you guys like you got to go make like a business in the next like week i'm i'm very confident that just me on my own i could build something that makes money right do you think that uh one of the google guys sergey and larry page do you think that they're capable of actually making anything maybe like i know zuck can so zuck when when snapchat came out i remember that uh he recognized the threat that was snapchat so early on and created facebook poke he literally wrote code into the facebook poke like they're their competitor that they they i think they released it in nine days or like 19 days or something ridiculous and he was one of the lead engineers actually writing code in the project now he doesn't normally do that but that was like the story at least do you think i think he could i think very few others could i remember so mike mike birch who who built bebo he was a programmer right he's a programmer programmer he built four or five startups that were all interesting and successful and we did a hack week and i invited michael i was like michael come hang out don't just be mr investor you know far away like come hang with us live in our like we're staying in your cabin so like just come hang with us and he came and i was like you want to you want to build something we're all building these little like you know apps and uh he's like well um don't exactly know javascript like the languages i know aren't really used anymore and i don't really remember a lot of it and i haven't coded in years my machine is not even set up to do it so uh you know i don't even know what i could build at this point and so he cooked us dinner instead and then later he got back into programming he's like oh yeah like okay now i got my machine set up i'm you know i'm using python i'm learning the new languages instead of the old stuff but he like ramped up over time and now he loves to code he codes all the time but i think when i put him on the spot when he hasn't been doing it no he was it was tough for him to just like go build something even though he's an engineer let me tell you something real quick this this isn't that shocking because i didn't exactly own a tech company but i made a i owned a company that made tens of millions of dollars on the internet when you use words like python and javascript or whatever you said i have literally no idea what those are like for real i don't know how programming works try to guess what is python well it's like a language but i don't know like i don't know what you use it for i don't know what it does when people talk about like ruby on rails i'm like so there's like a java on rails like how like is there like i i literally don't know what the word of these rails you speak of yeah or they'll be like well this is css and this is html and this is i'm like i don't know like is one of those like the outdoor sighting of the home and like like i do like an analogy i i still to this day i have no idea what they mean this is like when i told you i you know i go into home improvement they're like okay so is it a drywall or and i'm like it's not wet like what do you mean like can you give me four or five types of walls with some photos and i can tell you which one it looks most like can we do like a prison lineup here and i'll point to the wall that looks most like my wall like when people talk about this stuff so the way that we worked at my company was i would sit with the engineer and i would just draw i'm like the website it probably should look something like this and i'll write the words that it should say and once you click this button let me draw the second thing that you should see and i would give that i would give that to them and it would work somehow and i and i to this day i have no idea how any of those things work yeah and who who needs to i used to i used to be like oh i wish i knew how to code i'd be so much better if i knew how to code and i would love to learn how to code i'm still actually i'm still like kind of at night i'm taking this like you know udemy course on python or something like that and then our buddy sully was like he's like yeah people say that and he's like i used to know how to code he's like uh he's like dumbest thing ever who cares how to code he's like you could pay somebody here here's a guy in india he can code whatever you want you just tell him he'll do it he's like why are you so obsessed with knowing why i actually totally disagree with him i think that the the key is at least you knew how to do it so then um and if you don't want to do it anymore that's fine but i actually think that when there's been times where i've talked to my developer and in my head i'm like well you just got to click this button and you see this and they're like well you don't even have to click the button you know like this technology the way it works is you can i'm like that that works that's a possibility like i don't even know i i wish i knew how to code so i knew what frameworks i could like work within because when as someone who doesn't know how to code i'm like how do you how did you i don't even know that's possible like you know what i mean it's like asking someone in 1800 to like explain to them how text messages work it's like whoa whoa what the hell is a phone let alone you know what i mean and that's how i feel sometimes when we're talking about coding so i think that's true i i actually agree and disagree with what he said so i agree in the sense that i used to think i used to have this story in my head that if i if i knew that then i'd be able to be do so much more and i don't believe that that's true i think that anything i wanted to do i could do by just you know hiring one of many many programmers out there or using a no code tool it is actually not holding me back and i can get the same result whether i do it or not the part i disagree with is i think it's really awesome to be able to have an idea in your head and be able to make it happen yourself because there's a huge lossiness in trying to explain to something else explain something that's in your head that's kind of fuzzy to somebody else having them download your fuzzy picture then they output it in an even fuzzier way it's like i came a telephone and it comes out very different a lot of times like when i write something or like like if somebody says all right uh can you help me with this email i'm like yeah but you got to give me the keyboard and they're like well no like i'll type it and i'm like no you don't understand like i don't just think of the email i write the email and while i'm writing it i think of what to say like i i can't create content in a in my head i create it while i'm doing it and i think most great things that get created are like that you're building it and while you're building it you're sort of like figuring out what you want to build and like playing with the idea live and that's what gets separated when you're not the builder yourself and so i i am jealous that i don't get to do that when it comes to building apps and let me ask you one more question so let's just say that we took um some of the big folks i i actually i won't use elon because he's proven it but like you take the guy who started snapchat evan i think evan spiegel yeah zuck the google folks bezos maybe not bezos because he's also proven it but you take them and you strip away like what they've done and they're the same age but you know they've just been like an insurance agent their whole life um do you think in one scenario do you think that they could still accomplish something great and then on the other side let's just say that they decided at the same time when they were young 19 and starting facebook let's just say that like you know instead of facebook i'm going to focus on like music or or this like music app like still tech but just like a slightly different version do you think that they would be even remotely as big and successful as they as they are so the second question i think is much easier to answer which is i think all of those people would be very successful by any like kind of objective measure but would they be people that we know their name we talk about them and they're you know 100 billionaire you know status no you know i do not think that's true i think luck plays a part in the magnitude of the success but not the probability of success so i think all of them the probability of success for them is all 90 plus percent they would all be good at what they do positive impact you know make millions of dollars over their career and be like considered top of their field in whatever field they go to the magnitude of success the fact that they end you know basis ends up being worth hundreds of billions of dollars that i think is um much more luck of the bounce on which opportunity you took versus others um um so yeah so that's kind of my answer to the second what would you say i agree i think that so for example there's this guy named david carp you know who david carp is he's the tumblr guy right he invented tumblr and tumblr basically sold to yahoo i think for a billion was it was it a billion it's sold for a lot of money but he's totally then they shut it down tumblr's totally non-existent anymore and he uh he doesn't i don't even know what he does he just he's not relevant and i think that a guy like him who i've seen talk and i've heard and i've read his writing he's pretty brilliant and i'm like man if tumblr had not sold or if you were working on something else i think you could have been way better another one is the guy who created meetup um scott i think his name is yeah uh he is amazing too but meetup is not that big of a it wasn't that big it wasn't that interesting i think if that guy would have worked on something else it actually would have he would have been significantly more successful and and some of these guys it's kind of like they're lance armstrong and they're riding the tour de france in a mountain bike or with a flat tire it's like man you that was needlessly hard if you could have been way better if if you if you just picked that's the level 10 hustle level 10 skill level six opportunity right meetup to me is like a level six opportunity it was just like a really hard space to go into he did the best of anybody who went into that space we all know the name because of that reason but meetup just wasn't as big as not meeting your friends in real life and only talking to them online through facebook right like facebook was just a far larger opportunity and i don't think it was that zuck knew that so i don't think it's that they're so kind of like um big brain that they just they filter out bad idea like best idea i think you know like there's a lot of text messages i get leaked from zuck early on and he was he thought wirehog was going to be the the real thing he was like you know still debating i don't know if i should do facebook when facebook was like already a thing and working and he's like he's like i think you know this is this stuff that we're doing right now is going to really help us when we do wirehog which is like a file transfer protocol that he just thought might be bigger and um you know obviously at some point he recognized no this is the opportunity let me do this but like it's not like up front he just said i analyzed 100 opportunities and i've identified the one that's going to be this app that has like billions of users i don't believe that that's true at all i think you sort of look into the size of the opportunity and the era that you were born you know these guys if they were born before the tech wave they might have just been the best blacksmith in town and not had like any of the tools that let you become a hundred billionaire because there was no leverage available to you you know 100 years ago or whatever yeah i uh by the way michael chandler and justin gaethje they uh they fought like uh three months ago these are two ufc guys and they're both known for kind of being like big meatheads who just stand in the middle and bang and hit each other really hard and they don't there's they're just kind of crazy and justin gaethje at the end said something amazing he goes i love that he had just suffered this like three-round war where they're banging each other in the head as hard as they can and you feel sad because you're like this guy is gonna brain damage and at the end he goes what just happened i love it he goes i feel like i was born in the wrong era i should have been a roman gladiator because i would have love to fight to the death in front of all you people and i and i heard that it gave me chills i was like i believe you i you're you and i are not the same you're you're crazy like you are built to be a warrior and sometimes i think about that i'm like who today like or i i think like who was like like alexander the great if we put him in like today's era like would he just be like too brutish and we'd be like dude you're an idiot bounce like get out of here you dumb idiot or like if napoleon came into play nowadays like we just kind of like a dating app yeah like what would like what would like the gladiators of then be working on now like would they just like well let's ask our historian ben you study these guys what do you think if you transplanted alexander the great or napoleon into this era or edison would he be like what are you a dating app really that's so stupid or would he think that that's the coolest thing ever and he goes i wish i could have done this i doubt edison would be into dating apps but i like i was on my alexander the great episode one of the points i made is i was just reading this book about alexander the great and it talked about a contract that he negotiated with one of his contractors one of his suppliers to move their baggage train from one area to another and i was just like oh this is like not that different like he had contracts that he had to negotiate and he had suppliers who provided his weapons and like logistics and he just contracted them out and he had people in charge of the contracts and like had basically kind of the same organization that ceos have so i think like yeah so alexander the great i think he'd be a his personality he'd probably be like a ceo uh edison would be like a entrepreneur kind of technical but moves out of it like a zuck like yeah yeah that's interesting i think about that all the time uh about like what like the the you know people who dominated from hundreds of years ago what would they be like today and vice versa i'm like dude if if zuck didn't learn how to use a computer like would that guy have just been a dork like in the 1800s like what could he even have survived the plague like you know what i mean and so i think about that all the time um cool guys i got to run all right end episode you
