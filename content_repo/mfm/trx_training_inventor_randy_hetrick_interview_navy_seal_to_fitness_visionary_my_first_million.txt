this is very casual so i don't even care we could record right now it's recording now and we'll put that up so this is very casual and i'm gonna ask you a lot of questions and uh if you don't want to answer something just say it but uh oh i will yeah it's very casual what's going on you're uh randy right yeah that's me so i um i'm a fan of your guys product and typically i i own it i have my own my own gym downstairs i uh i do research on the businesses that we talk to and the people we talk to but in this case i didn't do too much research on purpose because i only have the product as a fan of the products perspective and i wanted to come from that point of view but do you know do you know what this podcast is and who we are or anything like that well give me a little more background because i mean i've been doing a fair number of these since this crazy making period took off and it's hard to keep up with them it was funny because and i i love to support right because i do so much in the entrepreneurial community i love to support young entrepreneurs so i'm i'm basically you know taking pods that i normally wouldn't take just because it's you know we're here we're home and if i can support other guys that are getting stuff going then i'm all about it and what you said you've been doing a lot since the making what what what are you talking about no i said since this mayhem right oh corona thing yeah i mean i i do a quite a lot of stuff in the press normally just to promote you know to promote my brand but um since we've all been locked at home there's a massive proliferation of digital content in the form you know sometimes in the form of uh of video blogs and podcasts and so i in fact i just got off another another one with a with a investment bank an industry panel basically but it was just a call so i i uh i didn't have to be as pretty as i am now for you sam good well you look great so let me we're gonna i'm gonna give you a the the 20 second or the two minute background and then we're gonna make this all about you but so i'm sam parr i own this company called the hustle um and what we do is i started it we just turned four years uh like a like two weeks ago so typically we uh have these conferences that where we host trade shows conferences where we host tens of thousands of people each year but we also have the hustle and the hustle is our daily email that goes out to millions of people so millions of people log in and they get our news from us in their email inbox each morning um and it's a great business it's a eight figure wonderful business that we've bootstrapped and then we also have trends and trends.co it's our subscription product so we uh it's just premium content community which is also a great business so awesome and uh and we do this podcast as a that i think i forget how many listeners we have but uh we've had millions millions of listens over a million listens um and uh what this podcast kind of started as was me and sean my co-host who uh isn't here right now but we both have started companies and we always had these interesting brainstorms with people like you who were our friends and we would just riff on interesting ideas and on cool insights and most people don't have access to those types of people and so we just do this publicly and so that's what we're gonna do today and so what i want to do right now is uh i want to learn a little bit about your background and kind of how you came to be where you are now and where you are now well uh where i am right now is in my house in mill valley i'm sort of like uh i i feel like rapunzel i spend all my time up in the tower above my garage right it's uh become my sort of everything from the sports marketing department or sponsorship marketing department of trx to the you know production studio for every one of our sort of uh you know blog interactions and that kind of thing but um you know i i so i'm the founder of trx uh i i live in in uh you know marin county um prior to trx i was a navy seal for 14 years and actually created the first harness while i was at the special missions unit and then just decided you know after i left the seal teams i went to business school at stanford and decided while i was there uh that this was a viable business concept um you know which i think at the time i massively over overestimated how easy it would be because the product was so great but um but i used stanford as basically an incubator second year as an incubator for this concept and trx is uh i guess this is our 15th year in the market um and uh you know we're doing pretty well we're we're one of the the only truly global fitness brands um and we you know we've we've put uh close to 350 000 training pros through our our trx coach qualification courses and we're in about i don't know somewhere between 50 and 70 000 gyms and studios around the world most of which are closed right now which is an interesting you know experience but fortunately for trx we we we were for 10 years all b2b just serving athletes training centers clubs trainers uh and and boutique studios and then about four or five years ago now we decided all right we're ready to start to expand into the consumer the true b2c consumer space and you know it's good that we did that because obviously that side of our business uh in the covet 19 environment is absolutely off the charts the con commercial side of our business is really struggling because all the all the gyms and all the trainers are all out of work so uh it's been a little bit of a tale of two cities over the last couple months uh but that's basically the snapshot of you know what trx is and uh and i'm today i'm co-chairman uh and really promoter in chief of the of the brand do you own the company or have you guys been acquired or anything like that well the the company is we have you know i raised a long time ago i mean i raised a bunch of rounds of of angel money when i started and then uh and then took on private equity uh back in 2012 and then recently recapped the business to exit those initial partners and bring in some new partners because that's one of the you know the dirty little secrets about institutional capital is once you take it it's very difficult to get rid of so uh so it's uh you know it's a private company but it's co-owned by by a bunch of us including the capital partners that that came in uh in 20 at the end of 2018 beginning of 2019. how much did you raise from the angel folks well in the way back uh i think i raised about oh i have to think back to my around five million bucks from you know in several rounds of of angel money um and uh and that's great capital right for i don't know i don't know what the complexion of your viewership is but the first thing about raising don't use uh you can use jargon it's a very uh it's a very highly intelligent not beginner audience so go ahead yeah well i mean the by far the highest i mean look the cheapest source of of money to grow a business is always what they call non-dilutive capital right and and that mostly in the form of sales but um if you're gonna take on dilutive capital the i think by far the best source is uh angel investors for a couple reasons i mean if presuming you pick your angels the right way um because what you get in an angel investor if you've chosen well is you get somebody who has uh a lot of domain relevant domain expertise because angels tend to invest in things that they know and think that one way or another they can contribute value to uh if you pick the right angel you'll get somebody who not only has domain expertise but super passionate about your venture generally angels are willing to to invest on a common stock basis which you know uh i strongly recommend to entrepreneurs that they stay away from preferred structures uh up until they're ready to to sell a significant piece of their of their equity or exit all together um because once you once you you know once you bring in a preferred layer of equity into the cap stack everything's different uh in terms of the solidarity that you once had right across the team and the investors because that changes and and it's a you know it's it's a tough change uh in the experience of most people that i know to manage so uh so i'm a big fan of of angel investors uh in which you get not only capital right but you end up getting pro bono experts effectively who are excited to be involved in in your venture how uh how big was the company when you sold it to pe or so parts to pe well it's been you know two rounds of that now right so so the first the first uh money we took i think we're around i don't know you know 30 million something like that annual revenue annual revenue yeah and and uh you know and and who knows you know we'll be we'll be north of uh you know probably north of 60 somewhere who knows how far because covet is a uh interesting experience but and we don't you know we don't really get into specifics because we're a privately held company so if you're heading that way i'm just to redirect you well so you already said it's the ballpark is 60 million it could be way higher but that's a number that's been said um a company like trx you guys so we talked to a lot of like these direct-to-consumer folks which you didn't start out as but you are definitely are now but when i think of trx i think that you guys are in the same category as as a crossfit or um and this isn't an insult but like tony horton like you guys are like a brand right like you're not just some amazon you don't rank on amazon and that's how you win trx is something that people know and uh it's a brand do you think that your valuation is significant like will your multiples be significantly higher because of that you think or um is it still rough to get a high valuation on products like this well i mean so for starters i mean we are we are in it we're the number one selling fitness item on amazon yeah but but i didn't mean like your way your path of success has not been like well we're just going to rank higher like it was just like people love and know us no yeah we built i mean look from day one uh this was never intended to to be a get get rich quick scheme right it wasn't a it wasn't a trend i mean it's funny because when i first started the business there were no predecessors to the product that i brought to market right our initial hero product which was the suspension trainer uh the the idea there seemed kind of crazy to bring this strap into the club landscape full of machines and think that you were going to be successful um but one of the things that we did that was that was a really great choice and i made plenty of less than great choices but one one of them that was a great choice was really finding this sweet spot in helping training pros of all kinds right from from chiropractors and physical therapists on one end out to to mma coaches and powerlifting coaches on the other end and then obviously you know and under the under the bell curve you know tons of personal trainers and group fitness instructors um we decided we were going to become the part the business partner of them and that we were going to give them this great tool that had it's like i was described the suspension trainer like a magic wand right if if you if you know the magic you can really make you can become a magician to your to your clients and your athletes and deliver them unbelievable results that always you know you look at a 12 feet of nylon webbing and go yeah what can that do with the right pro and the right knowledge in that pro's head you end up going oh my god this thing i've never seen anything like this right and that's that's a unique characteristic that not many products or services ever have which is you have people that come in with a very low expectation and leave with a very high level of astonishment um and so that's been a a powerful um benefit to us and then we diversified the the the company's scope of operations we became you know the largest provider of professional education to trainers um and then we broaden the product line significantly all the while focusing on this premium brand that you alluded to um which i do believe brings you know an enhanced multiple the reality though is that long term if if all a company wants to be is a product company right that delivers durable goods because our stuff lasts for freaking ever um you know way too long from no no i've had the same one i've had the same one for four years i think i got it was gifted on christmas and uh i've had the same one for four years now yeah i mean and that's and you're in four years is nothing for a one-on-one right i i talk to people that are that are still traveling around using our like first gen strap from 2005 in their bag you know and it's i mean on one hand it's a compliment on another it's a nightmare right because you need uh what's it called plan planned obsolescence yeah yeah you need a break after like you know 5 000 push-ups we never we never planned that because i i really wanted to be and i look i i i came at this whole thing you know i started my entrepreneurial career at 39 so after a career as a as a navy seal so i you know i had a set of premium level delivery and if i was going to be associated with this brand then that's what we were going to do so we built everything that way the unintended consequence is the one that you and i are beating around right now is your stuff lasts forever and that which means that you know you either have to create more products to serve your existing customers which is expensive right because r d is not cheap um or you have to constantly be in search of new customers which is not cheap and so you know it's it's i think that's why pure product codes get uh what i would say you know unfair valuations relevant or relative to some of these fake or more fake companies that are you know tech based uh companies that have the potential not the promise but the potential to scale infinitely right and so those kinds of companies tend to get higher valuations than gear companies and that's that's just one of those realities and it's part of what you know we've never planned to be just the gear company we we have always planned to expand our services into subscription services and content and and that's what we've done so let's talk about that in a second but first um right now you guys make what are your revenue streams your revenue streams are coming straight from your revenue streams are purchases from coaches and things like that or um well coaches and chiropractors and who are like you know b2b people servicing clients right we make well we're an omni channel distributor so you know on the on the commercial side of the business uh which is the b2b side yeah we sell the gym we sell gear to gyms services and um education to gyms and trainers yeah and that's what i want to ask about what is education so you sell yeah so we do so we we became early on i mean if you think back nobody knew how to use a strap that didn't stretch and didn't have any weight attached to it so if i was with you or one-on-one i had almost a hundred percent close rate in the in the earliest days problem was i can't be everywhere right so and if i wasn't with you and you were just looking at a picture of it say on the website the conversion would drop to you know five percent so that was something that i realized very early all right well i have to be able to scale my knowledge on how to use this thing and so i brought in uh a guy who was introduced to me very very early in the company's history a guy named frazier quelch who had been a career trainer and had written a lot of education in the form of courses for other pros right to teach other pros the various skills i mean how's a trainer or coach learn his or her craft they usually get a basic certification from a entry-level certification body like american council on exercise or or nasm or nsca and then they go out into practice and they start developing practical skills and along the way they want to learn more about you know a particular tool or a methodology or and so they they do they have continuing education requirements right just like a doctor or a lawyer they have to they have to do so many uh continuing education units per year to maintain their basic certification we became one of the leading providers of those cc courses that that help help a new trainer or coach move toward mastery so do you charge them for i'm on your website now uh i don't and that costs money yeah yeah our normal our normal we have about 10 courses of different kinds and and are all b2b and the oh cheap not 89 well no traditionally they were 295 right so 295 bucks for a one day qualification course and it was eight hours live in person what you're probably seeing now is we've done some some pretty incredible pivots with covid 19 hitting and changing the landscape um and so one of the things we did early on was try to figure out hey all right number one we're not going to be able to provide education right as long as this thing lasts because you can't get people together number two most of the people who come to our courses are out of work and so what what what can we do to support them was sort of idea number one and then number two was how do we take this moment which is really a bunch of lemons being thrown at us and make lemonade out of it and we decided that well we can take our courses we can make them free figure out how to how to deliver them through zoom instead of uh live and we'll do that as long as as this you know crisis continues and we'll just try to fill our bucket with a whole bunch of new pros of all kinds of stripes right who on the other side of this will then appreciate that that we helped them out when they were down and also just grows the community grows the trx community and so that's what we've been doing so then you guys have revenue from selling the the the the main product the tr the main trx which it looks like you have a few varieties but i imagine most is from the main one and then you make um revenue from these 100 to 200 100 to 300 dollar b2b digital products what what's the breakdown is is is like is is the actual product 80 of sales oh it's you know it's falling pretty pretty fast as our as the education and now the what what's the big epiphany and the big unlock uh that's gone on uh over the last two months is that we massively accelerated our what already was a migration toward digital delivery and subscription models and so you know we've also got an app that uh that we make money off of that's a 4.95 a month app that supports the end user um and and we we have turned off the paywall on that during covid but that will go back on once everybody gets back to work you know we're really using covid19 as an opportunity to develop new to solidify the relationships with our existing customers and and bring new customers into the tribe through a free door that eventually obviously everybody knows that no business can keep their services free forever but in the meantime we're using it as as a big opportunity to you know to build new relationships so the the mix is is really changing the other thing that that i think you know well what was the mix pre-covid uh you know i mean it's probably probably 70 30 between you know uh equipment but you're defining equipment way too narrowly right you're looking at our hero products which are the suspension trainers we do the entire ecosystem of functional training so from we have you know steel ecosystems that you built the infrastructure you know that not only you hang straps on but you fill with kettlebells bands balls you do pull-ups on right everything you would see in a gym yeah you're right yeah which i which i i've used um do you have a sales team to handle that like have did you have to do like hand-to-hand combat for that or uh is is a lot of it inbound and you're just fulfilling orders um it's some of both right i mean no i don't think any business it certainly doesn't exist for very long as as all inbound flow right generally you have to be out there knocking down the you know the targets and so yeah i mean but are you like running paid ads to them or do you actually have to have a sales force who's hitting the phones and making it happen both yeah both we advertise into the commercial landscape through the traditional you know means to reach gym owners and trainers but then we also have a pretty significant direct sales force uh inside and outside that that does uh account development and service sales i'm looking at um i use this tool that guesses website traffic i if i looking at this tool i would imagine that your sales are like 4x in april what they were in february um it looks like you guys are just like like you your web traffic has gone through the roof yeah well it certainly has and the reason is i think less to do with anything we've changed uh in our marketing than with the reality that you know as a 10-year b2b business we we've put you know we we serve tens of millions of people around the world who identify themselves as trxers but ironically had never bought a product for their home right because they use us in the gym and i run into people constantly some of my best friends you know will tell me like oh i've never bought you know they'll call me and be like hey can you give me a friends and family you know discount and i'll be like you don't have one of our straps these are people that i know are die hard trxers and then they'll be like no man i do it three times a week in the gym you know and so that that was that was a reality that comes with being a b2b business for 10 years but what happened with the virus was when all the gym doors got shut all of a sudden all of those installed that installed base of trxers went well how the hell am i going to do my do my workouts and so they turned to our amazon site and our website and you know that's that's been i believe the the big source of of the the growth the explosive growth you um have a unique advantage of seeing uh like consumer goods or well hard hard goods and digital products so you're able to see uh how they both work and my from my perspective and i've been an investor and i have friends who sell direct-to-consumer hard goods and then i also have a digital company and i've invested in them as well what my perspective is that the d2c guys can grow their revenue from zero to not zero very quickly but there's massive supply chain headaches whereas digital it's often the opposite where it's maybe a little more challenging to get started but the margins are way better and you never have a supply chain issue what uh knowing both sides of the business which do you prefer well i mean i i think that which do i prefer i prefer the one that's easier and makes more money um you know which one's that yeah well the reality is that i think i think creating a digital uh company pure digital is is hard because it's a very cluttered field right it's a uh it's there's especially now i mean this this virus has unleashed the digital universe right and so now just like any other marketplace there's going to be this explosion of of would-be uh you know participants and then there will be a consolidation and and some of the you know they'll separate sort of the wheat from the chaff and i think that um we're in a really unique position because we started as a physical products company company then we became an education company education and content right because we made i mean hell we probably did 35 dvds prior to dvds becoming disintermediated by digital delivery we've obviously taken all that content and repurposed it into our digital ecosystems but then we we became a brand like a really significant premium brand in the space and then we stretch that brand around the world so now we're in a really unique position because we have the best of both worlds right we have a large customer base that bought our physical gear and that then came to group classes in clubs around the world that we helped develop and and educate the instructors who are delivering those so they got comfortable and identified with our brand and then as we've done more and more consumer branding we've extended that brand from the the pro space which is great from a credibility standpoint because if trainers and physical therapists love you the consumer at home tends to go oh well these guys must be you know a quality operation and so now we're in a really unique position now we're turning on some new digital engines some subscription uh engines that give us the best of it all right we're we will have our products which you're right you stock out of i mean we're you know we've stocked out over and over and over during this thing because no one plans for a you know multi-time step function change in the demand curve right and you you you scramble to try to catch up to it and i think a lot of us will find ourselves just about the time we're we're caught up and we've got this you know a whole new uh stockyard full of product maybe the demand will settle down a little bit and we'll end up with more scary yeah and it's but that's just that's part of being a physical product you know uh just supplier is so well that's my question which one do you find which one do you personally enjoy more both in terms of working on and the results i'm a uh i mean i'm an inventor you know so so that is part of my like it's it's a it's probably what made me want to go into the navy seal teams i have a macgyver bent to me and i came up with an old man that can fix literally anything with almost nothing and so i i sort of grew up you know out in the garage until you know the middle of the night holding a flashlight for my old man while he was you know jerry rigging some kind of a uh of a fix to to an old motor or to what whatever it could be anything so i really enjoy a lot of time and energy at trx developing our next products i also though appreciate and enjoy creating great content whether it's in the form of pro education or whether it's in the form of of end user content your workout content um and so i i would say i like both i like the economics of the digital side of the equation for the reasons that you've pointed out right you don't stock out of it and you don't uh it scales infinitely but i don't think that it's an easy business to just say oh i'm gonna become a digital content publisher and i'm gonna you know make a billion dollars yeah like you and the other billion would be digital content producers that are out there are all right on the same path and so so i i i i like them both um i like the multiples on digital content and subscriptions though i'll tell you that so i'm gonna ask you about some i'm gonna ask you about that in a second and i'm gonna ask you about um interesting ideas that you're seeing in new opportunities but first you said something that you're the chairman right so does that mean you're not the ceo yeah i'm what we brought in a a president um you know i've tried a number of times to get out of the day day in day out uh management of the organization because a couple reasons one at this point you know i mean number one there's one founder right and so you've got a certain amount of of founder cache that is really valuable in working with the press in working with key accounts right in in generating love around the brand that there aren't others who can do that um there are others who can manage the steady state sort of linear growth of a you know of a mid-size and and growing company in fact there's those that can do that better than me because i'm more of a startup guy so i've tried you know several times over the last call it six years to to get more out into the market and less in the conference room um and you know we hired a president uh about eight months ago who uh he and i've been doing a transition where i can you know basically hand most of the day in day out over to him and to you know to the to the team and then with our new partners uh they're very good at the financial engineering side of the equation so i'm not right that ain't i mean that is just not something that turns me on i i like the outcome but the process is just not something that you know floats my boat and everybody's everybody's cut of different cloth so what i'm really focusing my energy on is uh promoting the brand developing new products and and looking at new initiatives right that's something that i'm i'm very good at and passionate about is sort of trying to see around the corner and what what the next opportunity is going to be for the brand we're very similar so i've done the same thing i have a president um who handles a lot of stuff and i do the exact same thing where i can lead vision but i also come at the very bottom and i can just change pixels and and invent i do it digitally but the same exact crap where i'm just i have my computer up late at night i'm just making stuff and most of it sucks but every once in a while i'll show to someone and they're like oh yeah let's go make that that's the product creation dilemma right most of it most of it goes nowhere but but about every 10 you know every every 10th effort you go oh wait a minute there's something to this one right and that's you know and that's you got to be wired to not get frustrated by that just like you know just like folks who like to manage at that mid-level they don't like the the scariness and the ambiguity and the you know the vagaries of of the startup uh or creator they like the the consistent predictability of you know weekly staff meetings and a checklist and all the things that make me sort of you know make the hair stand up on the back of my neck because i feel like man this is not where i want to be so this is and this is a consistent pattern that we've seen i don't know if you know this woman named sophia amoroso but she had this company called nasty gal and it scaled to i forget the exact number one or two hundred million a year in sales and had multiple offers around half a billion and it they they she screwed it up for a bunch of reasons one of the biggest ones that she was like i'm a i'm brilliant at creating i'm horrible at operating and um i uh i too am like that where i'm brilliant at creating uh but operating i just don't find it to be exciting and i think that most people who start stuff are the same way but i think there's actually a huge issue in your in silicon valley although you may or may not run in the silicon valley crew particularly amongst that group of people i've noticed there's a huge problem of people starting stuff who are afraid to hire people to actually run the thing um and what i've really embraced and it took years to learn this is that there's actually people who like creating the car from scratch and designing it and then there's people who love modding it out and making it better um and having both is really important how did you hire your president and what was that like going through that process and also how many mistakes have you made in hiring their own people because that sucks too yeah plenty i mean i mean look first of all so i i i operated the company you know every single day for its first 10 years that's a long time right and at that point when you're when the the engine of both creation activation and management that's like dog's years well why did you do that earlier well i think uh i think a couple of reasons one i did try a couple of times right starting around maybe around year eight to to bring in you know a president my idea was always i'll bring in a president and i never had i never took a cco title for years because i just thought it was sort of ostentatious for a little company to have a cco that was my personal opinion so i was the president so when i brought in a president um and uh the first one that i brought in it really cool aligned with bringing in private equity right so maybe it was maybe it was yeah about year 10. why do you think eight years why not in year three i mean well because we were still very much evolving right and i think that one of the challenges with bringing in somebody to take over the the daily management is you have to be pretty well defined about where you're headed um as an entrepreneur before you can now hand the wheel to somebody right if you're wheeling right wheeling left that's not exactly the moment to be like hey buddy here take this right because then the guy's like where do i drive man so so i think that's the answer the short answer is i wasn't ready yet in terms of our our definition to uh and and the enough certainty to the general direction of our course to want to hand that over but at about year eight i was and i said okay so i handed over the first probably the first two uh presidents that i hired which were both great guys but the mistake that that i made uh largely from being from listening to my then private equity partners that you know had had sort of their their business school 101 playbook they were trying to run which is go hire a a quote-unquote best practice president well okay kill me kill me yeah i'm sure i was just gonna say i'm sure you're gonna you're you're gonna be hearing something familiar here right which is that a lot of the institutional capital investors they they they haven't run businesses themselves so they want to execute what they learned in business school which is you know the idea of best practice well what is best practice that's the problem right and and generally they will say oh it's someone from the upper mid levels of a great big successful company that we've all heard of what i've learned and it took me two two go rounds to learn this by the way is that that is almost a disqualifier to be a good president of a small company i need a i need a guy with an mba telling me what to do like i need a hole in the head i don't like right like what like oh my god i so i i've had a i got lucky i've had a lot of great success we have a guy uh adam ryan who's our president and i've known him since high school i'm from missouri so i'm not from like this fancy san francisco stuff like i live now and that was awesome because adam has wonderful at being scrappy and things like this but he also can be like a big company suit if you wanted to and what i found is and i've hired some mbas and it didn't work out what i found is these gray hair they're not actually gray hair but it's more figurative these best practices this they just these people can't roll with the punches and i i've never had success with that type of i've hired i have a few businesses on this like little investments i've made and we've hired ceos who were like this and it just man it never works and but you think that it should yeah well it's it's a little bit akin to trying to get a cat to bark exactly a cat's meow dogs bark so saying that well you know either one of them should be able to to do this thing is just not right and you wouldn't do it because it would be preposterous and yet what people do all the time especially institutional investors make this mistake they assume that because somebody operated at a scale right and at a successful brand that well that person clearly can this will be easy for one person and it's it's almost the reciprocal because what what they don't realize or haven't thought through is those people are are playing a different game like michael jordan was you know arguably the best basketball player in history when he went over to the major league baseball right he hit with a thud why he's a great athlete he's playing a different sport so so what worked for him on the basketball court you know doesn't work when you're on the mound of a baseball diamond and and so i think it's a very similar thing big company big company leaders have large staffs generally a lot of certainty in the direction that they're heading you know uh kind of single digit uh management objectives right up or down it's it's it's a in a very long patient bureaucratic decision making process yeah you're almost more like a politician you're a politician a little bit you're not yeah and that's the emphasis of a small company right a small company and by that i mean anything south of 100 million bucks is it's constantly pivoting and and the the the windows to make those pivots are not you know years they're not even quarters you know you're lucky if they're months and so though i think the difference in the operating cadence and style is profound and just going to a big company a successful big company manager and thinking they're going to be successful as a small company president um it almost never works out yeah i think that look if once once my business becomes a financial arbitrage machine and i need someone to figure out how to milk out three percent off the bottom line by using less materials then i'm going to get one of those nerds but until then i need innovative people who understand how to beat it's a perfect balance of art and science who understand like financial analysis and things like that but who also can understand what motivates buyers and who can think of widgets that uh you know make people feel good and want to purchase and be it's just i've been to this um i so i i empathize um you uh are you investing in anything at the moment or is 100 of your time on this or like on saturdays and sundays are you tinkering with anything totally outside of uh this field perpetually yes yeah what interests you right now well i mean there's a lot of different things that interest me i'm you know i i'm an angel investor in a bunch of different uh enterprises both inside and outside of health and fitness um and i because i'm a super you know i'm a startup nerd so i i live and breathe you know that and i teach i teach classes at both my alma maters at at the marshall school at usc and at the graduate school business at stanford so i get to see a ton of young you're badass so you're a fitness guy a navy seal and an academic yeah i'd have to put that in quotes sam i'm not sure that i would that i would put academic uh technically i'm right though i mean you hey you dude you teach at stanford okay yeah but i'm a but i'm a lecturer right not a professor so so that means that all you had to do all you had to do is have gone there and then have done something that didn't suck subsequently right and made a lot of mistakes you're just an eclectic dude you'll like you can kick someone's ass but then also like you know talk to them about aristotle and like britain's economic policy and how it impacted imperialism in the 1960s i'm an eclectic dude you got that part right right i'm an eclectic dude and i'm i'm a super geeky inventor you know which which i love i mean i've got like 40 patents that i didn't i care less about the patents what i cared about was the thing right like bringing the thing to life and then once you do particularly in today's digital economy right you got to protect it because if you don't you'll be knocked off and blown out of you know blown into oblivion uh almost immediately with factory direct stores out of china that have fba shops on amazon now so you know so that's why i became you know like i i joke about having a minor phd in intellectual property law that i never wanted um but i had to learn and so all of that like all the nuts and bolts of creating and then you know articulating a vision and and wrangling a team to to to share that vision and then moving that thing forward that's the stuff that that makes my you know my heart pound what are your best um angel investments well i mean i i suppose we'll wait and see until they uh until they they pan out but you know i've got out yet uh no not yet i i'm sort of a equity investor right i'm i'm you know i i make a good living now and and uh so i'm not you know i'm not i'm not in any of these for a quick turn but i think that they all will um and you know most of them are in areas that i that i i tend to to both invest and advise only in things that i think i can make a difference in i've taken a couple of of different flyers on on things that you know buddies that i trust and are domain experts in other areas have said hey man you should get in on this you know but i'm a and and also let's just qualify this i'm a small you know investor i'll i'm not i'm not placing six figure investments one after another but i but i i tend to invest um in things where i can help the the operating team based on my own experience try it and really experience is just the sum of all your mistakes as much as anything else and so i you know i can help uh early stage businesses set up their their partnership arrangements right figure out what makes a good partner figure out what capital sources that make the most sense for them are because i know both the pros and the cons of all of them at this point um and then you know team selection that's i mean i've been leading teams since i was you know 22 year old frogman and um led all the way up to you know the national level and so i i've got a lot of experience whether i've done it all right i certainly haven't but i haven't done all wrong either um but i've got a lot of experience in in helping you know build culture uh create team dynamics that are that are durable and and um performance oriented and build brands so if it's in those categories that's kind of my wheelhouse um i have to pause real quick i gotta run the restroom really quick go we'll edit this part out uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh sorry about that no no worries man uh uh yeah big time so i'm a huge mma fan and i uh this quarantine thing i've gotten very healthy much health like i've done iron man's and things like that but i've like actually started using my trx by the way and there you go there you go it's wrong but i uh i have a weight loss challenge and i have five hundred dollars on on the line and i have to hit it by saturday and i have i'm gonna crush it just through diet and exercise but i began just i'm drinking like crazy amounts of water because i want to do like a mma weight cut and just like destroy the the the the benchmark yeah and so i'm uh i'm currently drinking three gallons of water a day and then tomorrow and the next day i'm going to taper down i just i just my goal is just to crush everyone um that's great yeah well yeah i've been an mma fan since before there was mma because you know coming up in the seal teams right you do a it was very eclectic in terms of the the the coaches that we would bring in so i i was a you know i've been the the full gamut i was i was an mma guy before mma was termed right everybody was still purists in their arts but because i had this bedouin lifestyle of constantly deploying and coming back i didn't have that luxury so i became you know i'd been a kickboxer and a wrestler in high school kickboxer through college then uh then i got into jiu-jitsu at the end of college and and lean into that you know hard in as a seal but it was never i never had the luxury of being in one place for more than a couple years at a time and um and so but i've been a huge fan of of uh we did a ton of sponsorship actually of the fighters in the ufc prior to reebok buying the you know the global rights uh to to uh the sponsorship placements um so yeah i i in fact mike dolce could could help you with your with your weight cut right he's a freaking master at that stuff well so we um do you know uh do you know who ben askrin is sure i've become friends with ben through this podcast and media and so he's been helping me out and i'm name dropping a little but i'm i was a huge fan of his and then i started talking to him like that's awesome i'm friends with someone i looked up to and then i think we're having michael bisping come on and do a podcast as well yeah you're great man i mean askrin's a stud wrestler and bisping's just you know you talk about one of the veterans of the of the sport i was so happy when you know when he finally got to the mountaintop after all those years of fighting everybody that you know that was that was there to be fought and he just kept sort of somehow falling just short but he finally got there before retirement so i was stoked for him so you um you know about all this stuff and it's sometimes whenever i talk about like mma and ufc i'm like i think i'm being too niche right now no one cares i think it's way bigger than i actually realize um but when you were in the seals this the seal thing interests me for two reasons one jaco will is it willick yeah sure willing willing that guy's everywhere right now so and he's always fun he's got good clips that are fun to watch and then i'm also reading david goggins book can't hurt me yeah um it randomly came up on my audible thing and uh i started listening to it it's it's emotional it's sad it's hard to listen to have you have you heard it or i haven't no i mean i know i know david um you know i did never work together but i you know you cross past same thing with jaco those guys are those guys are both way behind me in terms of age but the and so in the seal teams you know if if somebody's more than a couple of years ahead or behind you the the likelihood of you knowing him is possible but not high unless you worked at the same places right in which case then you then you transcend the age barriers because you're all you know at a command together and you you you work together and i never worked with either one of those guys in fact i think as i was getting out they were both coming in um but i certainly know you know of both of them and i i like what what they've both done with their brands and you know uh jaco's done some really really cool stuff uh with his podcast and his other appearances in fact he popped up the other day on on uh billions which i i was laughing about he oh i haven't watched the season premiere does he show up so this new the new season he's he popped up in that and i i was like yeah man that's what i love it when i see other frogs doing doing good stuff um versus stupid where they're out there you know telling and selling secrets that are gonna you know put other guys at risk which i do not admire but i but i really love when i see guys out there doing great things post-career because that's what the whole country is supposed to be predicated on right it's the citizen soldier you come in you serve for however long you try to serve as well as you can and then you go on and do something uh something else cool out in the civilian community and be able to share some of the things you learned and i i love that jocko does that and i love that dave's doing that as well so when i started my business i i was like like you or i'm just like i like to invent things and i like selling them and i like making money um what i didn't was what i i always did track and field and running and weightlifting and swimming and those are all individual sports and what i really struggled with early on was how to be a leader um it's super hard because you like for a lot of people they start stuff because uh it's like i said it's fun and it makes money and it's cool they don't but then they like if it was successful then they're like oh i gotta be like a leader of men and women not necessarily a creator of products what do you think do you think that i mean i know the answer the answer is definitely yes but what specifically helped being in the seals in terms of business leadership and managing a team and by the way how many people do you have oh we've got about a hundred full timers and then we we uh you know we use another 350 master instructors to deliver our education courses so they're 1099s um but you know so it 100 full-time plus or minus and you know another several hundred that we that we employ as contractors do you think people would say you're a good manager and or or a good leader i think they'd probably say i'm a better leader than i am a manager right that's that would be my guess because it maps to uh i mean i can manage and i the distinction between that to me is uh quite a wide gap right there are there are people i think who can do both at a very high level but not many because the the the i believe that most of the characteristics that make someone really good at one or the other almost uh prevent you from being good at both i mean there are some extraordinary people i think out there that can do both but but management requires just a a different level of you know attention to to to minutia i won't just say detail because i'm very detail oriented but ongoing minutia which is important in making a business go um you know i don't have the patience for it and i also you know i never i i never really liked corporate management i i like leadership a lot and leadership's about storytelling being authentic right motivating and communicating um and and you think you think you're good at that i mean you seem very charismatic do you think you're a good leader yeah i i think that's one of the strengths that i have developed largely as as a result of my experience in the seal teams um what are some things i can learn from you then through your seals experience uh and that our listeners can learn you think well i mean we do you know so i do i do a key i do a keynote that is pretty massively oversubscribed frankly called lessons of a frogman and it's leadership lessons i business leadership lessons that i learned as a seal which turns out almost all of the key lessons that i know i actually learned as a seal the leadership lessons not necessarily the tactical business lessons but um and and you know you would think and i actually had one of the assistant deans at stanford business school when i was out interviewing for to to be accepted there you know give me this sort of patronizing put his shoulder hand on my shoulder and basically said well then you know why do you want to why do you think we should take you randy and i talked about you know my leadership experience uh you know i was at that point i was at the special missions unit as a as a troop commander and had been in the seal teams for you know i don't know 10 years or so and you know then he put his hand on my shoulder and said well then uh it's it's a bit different leading in the real world than it is in the military you don't don't don't don't you think because out here you can't just tug on your collar device and have everyone snap to and do what you say and i'll never i was so astonished man i was like is this guy for real right now or is he baiting me and and i basically said to him you know uh dean if that's your view on military leadership then i think it says a lot more about how little you know than it does about the subject of leadership and you know not surprising that i didn't get in that time but uh but but you know i think that if you're talking about people and groups of people there are many many more commonalities to how to lead and motivate the group than there are differences depending on you know like irrespective of domain because you're talking about anthropological behavior and that changes very slowly over millennia you know and whether you're a you know a baker or a freaking frontline soldier or a software developer if you're dealing with other people humans behave you know largely the same way they have different micro cultures but but we're all part of the homo sapien species and we we've evolved our behaviors uh over you know hundreds of thousands if not millions of years so the commonalities are that people want to be inspired they want to be they want to associate with something they believe in and other people who share that belief system they want to feel important right like they're contributing everyone wants approval and and reinforcement that what we're doing is is good um and so figuring out how in in in a context to provide those basic human needs is what leadership's all about and and i i think that it's it's not actually very domain specific uh whereas management arguably is much more domain specific right depending on the industry and and i think that requires you know a different set of skills and very often the things that make someone a good manager prevent them from wanting to be on the podium prevent them from wanting to take risks right and and those are things that you know you can't lead anybody if you're not willing to get on point and and so i think that you know leading and managing are are related but not the same thing and it's just lessons of a frogman is that available publicly if i google that can i watch it i hope not because it's one of the uh it's it's one of the you know the side hustles that that i enjoy doing um i actually it's you know obviously i haven't been doing them during covid 19 but um but i'm i'm working on a couple of books in the early stages one of them is is going to be that it's going to be the a deeper look into the substance of my you know keynotes that i do for corporations um the other is is going to be an entrepreneur survival guide because what i discovered right is that the gap between what i learned at stanford business school and the stuff i actually needed the day i launched this scrappy little strap startup couldn't have been wider right and and that's at one of the best business schools in the world but what it what those business schools really prepare you to do is enter as a mid-level manager into a large organization very few of them prepare you to be a boot scrape entrepreneur right that needs to walk out and figure out how to how to find some space how to get pesky little things like insurance you know when you're when you start thinking about somebody you're going to partner with what's that all about you know how do you go about the the nuts and bolts of raising money without screwing yourself you know there and ever after all that stuff you don't really get in business school you you get that by getting out there and doing it you know and hopefully so no i agree and we're going to be wrapping up soon so i want to um ask you just i i wanted to wrap up the questions on angel investing any companies that you've written checks to that we would know about well i mean i can tell you a couple of ones that i'm super excited about right now um there's there's one of my ironically one of my board members um uh started a company called basil street cafe which is a really cool automated pizza kitchen concept that i think uh covet 19 has has actually now made more viable even than before but it's a a really sophisticated combination of technology branding and distribution to create a uh nationwide initially and then global um uh automated pizza kitchen and and that produces some of the most kick-ass pizza that i've ever had in my life which is really astonishing because your expectations out of a machine are very low and it turns out it's every bit as good or better than blaze or any restaurant quality pizza so that's one of the soft bank backed one of those automated pizza companies hopefully you guys have a better uh a better run at it than those guys i think sometimes you know like there were things that that you know were a great idea but were ahead of their time and i think some of the some of the plays that have attempted to do this before uh had an interesting idea but the technology they didn't get right and you know and it's largely a distribution business as well because you have to make great great pizza and be able to you know keep the keep the machine stocked with it and so it's a but i'm excited about that one um you know i've got another buddy that that i'm helping that uh has a company called everence which i think is a really cool um you know opposite end of the spectrum in a lot of in a lot of respects it's it's basically a very unique way to to collect capture and then encapsulate uh can be anything but the idea is hair ash could be any kind of material you know from a flower from you know the mountaintop where you got married or buried your grandmother or whatever and then enables that to then be put into either jewelry right that that you now have for instance i'm having some stuff done right now that i'll have my boys you know locks of their hair encapsulated and put into a bracelet right that i'll have them with me always and so uh it's like when uh it's like when billy bob thornton and angelina jolie had vials of blood did you ever read about that they're weirdos yeah that's a little creepier than i then i you know that i mean but the other thing they do that's really interesting you either choose uh to put it into jewelry or into tattoos so for everybody who has tattoos and wants to ascribe a little more meaning to them right it's it's kind of a cool thing to be able to create to cut a lock of you know everything from your dog's hair to your kid's hair or a cheek swab and you send it off to them and they've got this patented unique process what's it called into what what you know a keepsake basically a permanent keepsake whether it's jewelry or a tattoo how do you spell it uh evrance e-v-e-r-e-n-c-e and uh they're cool their website is evrance.life but yeah there's a couple you know and and then i'm i'm involved in a in a technology company and lidar radar called luminar which is a cool a cool company and that's one of the example of one of those that all right not exactly in my wheelhouse right not an area that i can necessarily add value to but uh you know very exciting and another friend who pays a lot closer attention to that space you know put it in front of me and it just made sense it's it's uh you know one of the companies that's out there uh vying for supremacy in the self-driven automobile uh category and i feel like if you if you tell me that category and that you're starting a company in there i would just invest in there just because it's like yeah probably maybe right it's kind of in that category and then you look at that you look at the you know the leaders and go well those people are really smart people this is a this is a sector someone's going to win in probably more than one so you know reasonable and again as i said you know i'm i'm a i'm a you know 20 to 50k investor in any given one thing i'm not taking huge exposed positions usually i like to invest in things where you know i can help based on my experience as a brander as an entrepreneur you know some government stuff that i've got involved with because obviously i spent a long time and you know in the government space um but uh and then just some cool companies right there's cool companies that i'm trying to help right now like indy.com is an awesome new platform to help influencers monetize their followings right with content and um i'm a big believer in that space and it's and it's an area where i can help them by exposing them to our large installed base of trainers um who all of whom are influencers in their own right and trying to figure out how to scale themselves right and create new sort of passive streams of income so you know it's a smattering right and and there's you know there's a handful of others that are kind of in the same same categories were you able to get some liquidity from the first pe event in order to make these investments the first one no i i should have right and that's one of the i mean one of the big lessons for anybody who's listening and i really believe this unfortunately i didn't i didn't hear it or or if i heard it i didn't listen the first time i heard it um but i really think for entrepreneurs you really should not with in i'm speaking generally because there are exceptions to every you know every generality but in general i don't think entrepreneurs should take institutional capital without pulling a significant uh piece off the table it just you know from the time that you do and you introduce a preferred class of shares into your cap stack things change right and what what was your what would be your definition of significant a million five million five hundred thousand well i think it depends on the venture i i i would view um i would view it from where i sit now as you know if you were building and then running a successful company that and you thought that the only option for financing was to go raise it from institutions i'd sell at least a third you know of of my holding um to to bring those people in enough basically enough to be okay if things go differently than you expected that that would be sort of the you know the rule of thumb and answer um so that you had a way but you had to wait for the second round and to make that happen yeah yeah and and um you know i probably could have sold more at the first stop but i i was very bullish and very um you know as entrepreneurs need to be and i thought hey this is you know i'm not selling anything right now um and that you know that was a big mistake that when i look back on it later on you don't realize hey you could be locked up with these guys for a long time right and once they're in front of you then getting any kind of liquidity becomes really problematic so you know that's just something that entrepreneurs need to keep in mind and you know you could you could lose control obviously if you sell control but there are other ways where you know through the preferences that institutional investors tend to get into term sheets where your autonomy and your ability to drive the bus at the very least get impaired in ways that you didn't expect and you didn't have the ability and we'll wrap this up in a second you didn't have the ability to take a couple million bucks take a million dollars off the profit each year to pay yourself i mean so like you were just strictly earning a a low salary as the company grew or were you able to like because if you raise five million bucks right out the gate i would imagine you wouldn't even have had the ability to say like well this year we made three million in profit i'm going to write myself a seven hundred thousand dollar check no of course not and and you don't you know and that's not frankly that's i mean that's that's a tough way for an early stage entrepreneur to even think because if you're starting to think about trying to extract stuff out of an early stage business chances are you're going to impair that business's growth and so my my view was never of that i mean i wanted to start making money right because the first if you count you know two years of business school where i was where i was working on this idea i went the first that those two years plus the next three without any pay right so i was five years you know into a no pay environment basically right and that's why i'm saying like but you were like 10 years in before you raised the first round i think right or yeah we were we were maybe a little less time maybe we're nine years in so it's like by that point like all right look if we're doing okay like i could definitely i can definitely i should have taken money off the table then that was one of the mistakes right because what what i focused on instead was hey i want you know to up my up my my salary right and my bonus structure to a point at which i can start making you know a good living on an annual basis um but i should have i should have done both right because that that was possible and i chose to just focus on all right let's get my cash comp up to a up to a level that feels right for you know what i've built in the 100 hours a week that i'm working and not worry so much about you know extracting value right now right oh wait you're saying you should have it just increase your salary and bonuses not i should have done both is what i said i i did increase my salary and bonus structure i did not pull money out of the business right and that was a mistake what were you paying yourself that to where i mean we paid 50 grand a year well i mean no probably more than that by by then but early on yeah i mean for the first three years i was paying myself nothing then i think i started paying myself 50 grand you know and it just sort of if you if you dollar cost average back you know it would have been a a very bad financial decision right on a on an hourly basis um but you know you get there and and uh and i make you know a good living today that's that's that's plenty um so you know it all evens out but if you dollar cost average the first 10 years i probably made 50 grand a year you know which which after 14 years as a navy seal with a stanford mba right ain't killing it and living in mill valley where and living in san francisco at the time i i fled the middle valley like everyone does eventually or to marin you know but but uh yeah i was living in you know living in the city paying a mortgage up on twin peaks and uh oh no i'm in glenn parks oh well that's that's where i was so i was right behind tower market awesome park was my glenn park was my my my regular you know the chennery restaurant i was still down there but that was my my regular jammed i live in down the hill and you know i used to run glen every day yep i live in downtown glenn park i uh rambling canyon today and i have a house here with like a garage and a gym with my trx um this is awesome man you're cool as shit i appreciate you taking the time um what's your preferred method of right on what's your preferred method of uh uh chatting with people to twitter that randy hetrick right instagram instagram and uh and facebook at trx training is is the brand um and trxtraining.com is is obviously our website i'm working on a randy hetrick.com website right now where where some of my stuff that you know my next big big vision is to to take a page out of richard branson's you know handbook and and basically figure out ways to grow my my brand that can help the brand that i gave birth to do things that maybe it can't do and vice versa right you ladder yourselves up just like he's done with virgin and the richard branson brand that's that's you know sort of a goal that i have maybe you know i'd be wildly fortunate to get to his scale but i could i could be happy with a lot less than that scale as long as i'm still contributing value to the mothership and it's giving me opportunities to do cool stuff well i i i think you uh you you look you you have the the story you have the look you have the charisma navy seal who's fit and also went to stanford i mean you know it a about every time and and i house you have the charisma based on the crypto game for the royalty of two, barbans and thisökast GEORGE !

check the drew that names for your Touchdown and tells me that i was just one week i've actually got the tip of deserve to make you remember how i took that track
