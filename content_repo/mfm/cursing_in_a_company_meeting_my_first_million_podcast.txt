whatever you want to give i had this uh blog post i used to try to blog about business back in the day when we were doing our very first startup right out of college and none of my posts got read by anybody nobody cared but one post went semi-viral and it was called the first curse advantage and basically i was saying how in a meeting the first person who uh who uses a curse word sort of establishes himself as the person who just doesn't give a fuck about the um they put themselves in a position of power and it also builds a different level of rapport because you're obviously using informal language with somebody else and uh you're demonstrating that you're not seeking their approval in a way uh and so i always in meetings i do this i try to be the first to curse uh in a meeting but can i say i don't love that and i'm like because you don't like cursing in general or no i mean i actually when i hear myself curse i'm like man i sound kind of trashy i agree i don't like when i hear myself do it and i think i do it too much but i've noticed in meetings it changes the dynamic like instantly and for better or for worse but i've but i think there's a difference between being crude and for cursing actually so like saying bitch i i fucking hate right oh my god you just hear that that wasn't on purpose so i don't like when people say that uh i don't quick quick story before we get into this i went i got married in september yeah and i had to go i got married a catholic church and you got to go meet with the priest ahead of time and i was really nervous because i don't i don't i'm not practicing i don't go to church and but i wanted i the whole wedding was they had to approve it and the whole wedding was on the line right so i had to like be a good catholic or at least appear like one and i remember i was sitting there and the guy was asking the priest was asking me and my wife my future wife about like so do you guys agree on children what do you think about birth control all this stuff or whatever he was asking and i would just say whatever i thought had to be the right answer i was very nervous i was like uh yes sir yes we go to church uh three times like i just said all everything and then my phone rings and i was so nervous i go uh i go oh fuck sorry it went really loud and then he looked at me and i was like shit my bad i didn't be to cuss and uh i i was so embarrassed and mortified that's amazing yeah but he let it go he let it go good guy yeah he let it go and then i made a joke about how i was asking what school he went to and he said he had a lot of student debt and he said uh uh he's like yeah but the young guy or young like in his 30s or maybe late 30s and he said uh but the church pays for it and i made like a joke like ah so that's why you joined and he didn't he didn't appreciate that he didn't like that you
