What's your favorite ways for monetizing content? For me right now, I don't think I've ever really monetized content the way I would like to. Subscription, but let me answer your question.

Subscription is the best way to monetize most content. But again, you have to plan for that in advance. So you have to say, I'm going to make a subscription product called The Hustle with new ideas and trends every week made by my great analysts.

And people are willing to pay $1 a month or whatever, $10, whatever it is. And subscription is a great way to monetize because you're not always chasing advertisers. It's this annuity that comes in and helps you even survive in a recessionary environment like right now.

So I think subscription, whether it's an online newsletter or an online course or a subscription community, like let's say the Trends Facebook community. I think subscription is my favorite way to monetize, but it doesn't solve the problem of monetizing when you're not already in the top one-third of content. Like you guys are in the top one-tenth of one percent of content.

You're going to monetize and do very well no matter what model you choose. Whereas someone who makes a newsletter about, I don't know, some obscure kind of Taekwondo or whatever, they're not going to be able to monetize a newsletter necessarily. Or someone who's going to monetize how to mow the lawn better is not going to be able to monetize, but might have one piece of content that really stands out.
