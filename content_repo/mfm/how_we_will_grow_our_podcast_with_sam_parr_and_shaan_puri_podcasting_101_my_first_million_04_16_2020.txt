we're on we're back what's up uh me and sam are here sam you wrote something at the top of this i want to hear what you have to say which is people's reply about what we talked about last time thrasio let's jump in with that all right you want to i'm going to read just word for word i have it pulled up on my twitter okay you ready i'm not going to read the guy's name he goes i'm a modest size mid seven figure amazon seller in a network of guys that range from one to two million to probably 50 million plus we have a few guys in our network that actually sold their company to throt how do you call it thrasio thrasio i'm happy to chat about amazon e-commerce sometime okay so i'm going to read his replies now for those of you listening the background is is that on tuesday sean and i talked about thrasio it's a company that raised money they raised uh 100 200 million at a 750 valuation i don't remember yeah close to 100 million at a 750 million dollar valuation a big company you can um they're only two years old they're and what they're doing is buying amazon fulfillment and filled by amazon company fulfilled by amazon companies and they are uh making the brands better and just owning them they're doing a bunch of stuff um and so i had a guy reach out to me and he's i go that's great tell me what's the i asked him what's the cash flow situation like for most guys sub 10 million dollars they're probably working with zero to a handful of u.s employees still actively involved in the day-to-day large team in the philippines and in cheap locations and are probably netting between 10 to 20 percent a year um and and so the typical size for three to five million the typical size is three to five million in revenue and they're probably pulling in 500 to a million dollars a year for themselves but the problem is is that uh it's getting harder and harder in 2013 you could sell almost anything and scale a seven-figure business now there are a lot more dominant more sophisticated players and it's incredibly hard to enter in the business the amazon algorithm is much smarter and it makes ranking incredibly expensive and difficult also amazon treats their sellers like trash so it's kind of a mixed bag uh i could take a month and do nothing and let my team run it and it can go perfect or i can get an email tomorrow saying my account has been suspended or killed and i need a lawyer to reinstate everything or i'm just crushed so anyway sean i wanted to uh fill you in on this because i thought it was cool insight i didn't know about that yeah that's that's a good insight um so a couple thoughts on that so the first is uh i think he's right you know back 2013 2014 it was a lot easier to do it than it is today that seems consistent with what i've heard uh in fact it seems like the formula is build a successful amazon business in 2013 14 15 then start teaching other people how to do it because it's too hard to do anymore and so now you start giving away the sort of secrets and uh you become a teacher for the for the next three years um so i think that's the the career path right now the other thing that comes to mind we were talking i was talking to andrew wilkinson about this and he was saying he used the uh i think it's a i think it's a charlie munger quote um which is or no no it's a nasim talib quote which is it's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller so you know there's a high probability you can make a little bit of money um you know consistently every single time you reach down you pick it up and then there's you know a low probability of complete death and that's what he's talking about when he says you can get a letter tomorrow that says your account is suspended goodbye um and and that's it or amazon cuts the rates of your category like i have a friend who was doing millions of dollars of book sales as a third-party bookseller on amazon and then amazon was like you know what now our take rate on books has you know not 10 we're gonna do 25 thanks and that like killed that happened to me that happened to me the other day so in our we uh in the trends group someone was like uh just so you know amazon changed the fee so basically i have various blogs like my personal blog or something like that and it makes just like small amounts of money like three to five thousand dollars a month off amazon affiliates and i don't even check it it just runs because because i've just written a lot of content over the years they changed their rate and someone told me in the group i think that i forget what i was earning i don't even check it i think i was earning six percent to nine percent for uh affiliate revenue and then they changed it to they like halved it so that money just halved and it's no big deal because it wasn't it it wasn't like a big income stream for me but if you're a wire cutter or if you're buzzfeed and you made a hundred million dollars from this it's a huge deal right yeah that 20 that 20 cut uh makes it makes a really big difference no no no no it wasn't it wasn't a 20 cut it was way bigger than that it was like half half ouch and what what category are your links mostly in is it electronics is it some cat is it one category or just across the board um they rate they lowered it across categories but across the board it's close to half um my categories were probably personal care and electronics i mean just anyone who yeah or books a lot of books right okay um i want to know another topic so we're good on thrasio you want to add anything else no do you not want to um no i think it's it's consistent with what we thought you know i like when people fill in the gaps with information that we don't have right i'm not an fba seller i don't know the ins and outs of that market i just think it's interesting we talk a little bit about it and then people fill in the gaps in the next episode we come back a little smarter that's a nice little formula we have going so i appreciate that if we ever talk about stuff you know tell us tell us more about what you know that we don't before we go deep into serious stuff do you want to talk about i want to give you feedback that i got from from listeners sean you ready am i prepared for this is this harsh critical feedback i need to okay great no okay so what i'm noticing with this podcast is we have a similar amount of views each week and i think it's the same people over and over i think we're like part of people's routine which is cool um and the i think that one of the secrets to growing a podcast is you have to have guests so when we had andrew he shared it so all the people who like him came and listened and i hope we've got them hooked and they're going to listen from now on and so the way that we're going to do this is we're just going to get more guests but here's what people keep telling me and this they weren't saying this about andrew but they like it when it's just you and i riffing it and just making shit up on the fly yeah yeah i i've felt that and i think it's even more on these zoom calls because the zoom call pace is a little slower when we're in person it's a little bit better i think to have that third guest on the seat and uh it definitely depends the third guest got to bring that bring the energy you can't just be successful and smart that is not enough you have to bring energy you got to know what people want to hear about and get to the point and so you know that's the the rubric for guests which is hard when you're also trying to find famous guests because they help the show grow and just for the record sean and i have recorded with i think we've done a bunch of times i personally have done it a bunch of times and it was wonderful people who i like and it just turned out to be bad and we just don't publish yeah we throw it away and we don't even tell them we just throw it away yeah and i've done it a couple times like for throughout the years for whatever i don't even remember what i was recording stuff for i've interviewed someone who was like an amazing operator and the content was whack and i'm like no trash um exactly and so anyway the feedback that we're getting son is that people like us because they say that i'm more optimist and you're more uh like down to earth and uh that we riff and they love that and that they can't get that anywhere but you and i are like let's go get more guests and people don't like the guests but unfortunately that helps us grow yeah well we'll keep mixing it in uh dude i had a call yesterday that i was like if i had just recorded this this would have been like one of the dopest podcasts ever it was just me and furcon we have a call every once a week now that's just called cool shit and he lives in like the edge of like technology he's like in the dark web basically not in a legal way but sort of like he's on the forefront of what's interesting just like a he's just a nerd he's just like a very typical silicon valley engineer just yeah he knows how to touch a reality in a good way he knows me well enough and also he loves money enough where he knows how to take that stuff and bubble up the the bits that are interesting the bits that are relevant and not just get lost in the weeds of technology so uh that combo was amazing but unfortunately didn't record the other thing i was going to say about the guests is um being guests on other people's podcasts is the other way to grow so i had ishan let yesterday reach out to like 50 podcasts and just be like hey i'll go on and talk about it right like i'll go on i just sold my company i can go on and talk about that hey we built a podcast that did a million downloads in the first six months we could talk about how we did that and um so i think guesting on other people's podcasts might be a good way you did this with gary v with pomp uh yeah i've probably so there's a caveat there i've i've probably been a guest a hundred times and uh there was a period like over the trailing six months i have it set on my calendar from three o'clock to five o'clock that's only guessing on podcasts and um i would do it and some of the small ones just drove nothing right like it was total hit or miss and so i would spend like three weeks doing it and it's almost like and you probably like this it's like being a comedian you just say the same shit over and over and you kind of figure out what hits and it's fun it's almost like therapy you just talk about yourself it's cool but uh it definitely gets a little repetitive and it the results are not always there but they are sometimes yeah and you know the thing you said at the beginning which is um for podcasting you get this base and it's the sticky sticky base of people who want to who listen to it all the time it becomes a part of their routine they start to really love you that sort of thing it's very different than other products i built where i'm like all right i want to get millions of users to just visit this page or like just use this once a week or subscribe to this and kind of forget about it like that's been a lot of the products i built this is the opposite it's like an army of a hundred thousand people who will like go to war for you i think there's people in this group that would if i said hey i need you to beat this person up they would go beat that person up like there's people who really have your back and when i started this i remember i was talking to sully who's the very first guest on the pod and he was like you know what are you thinking next you just sold the company and i was like you know i really like this podcast thing he goes okay like is that a business like in some ways it's a step down right it's like i'm gonna make way less doing this than i did my last business or any other business i want to do and i was like look i want to just be in like a million people's ear balls every morning if i did that i just know that that's a good thing and i don't know how to get there but i'm going to do that i'm going to get into a million people's ear balls every morning on their way to work and the way to work i think that's powerful yeah i mean it it may or may not be a business but it definitely will lead to way more opportunity i've had a lot of i mean i've been doing the content thing a little bit like before the podcast so i kind of understand it but the podcast definitely is different um i remember i went to new york sean and i just tweeted i was like i'm we're gonna be over i'm gonna be over here because i was there for uh uh hustle advertising crap and i just tweeted i was like yeah i want to be here i had 200 people want to come and so we only let maybe 20 come and because we're in people's ears dude like these people this kid ryan said something to me and he's like yeah you know because you said how much you like this thing and i was like i don't remember what you're talking about and like they think they know you and it's funny and you know the other thing i like is that people are the people who listen to this are actually pretty they're really smart and successful you know i think a lot of podcasts that are about business they cater to kind of lowest common denominator so it's like oh the wantrepreneur is their core market and you know in our facebook group for this podcast i posted something saying hey i'm doing something cool for people who have a business that does over a million dollars a year and there's like a hundred plus replies just in that facebook group people who have businesses doing over a million dollars a year right so these are not like kind of like the wantrepreneur who's you know at their nine-to-five job or a college kid or something like that like of course there are people like that but the audience also is mixed with a lot of interesting successful people there's a bunch of vcs that listen to this it's crazy um so anyways enough about the podcast let's give people some uh some other topics or ideas alan says my video looks good now i i know one other thing you have you kind of have the mic to the side of your mouth and when you turn so your voice goes in and out so just keep it like just talk directly into the mic let's talk one more thing about the podcast which is i my house looks like is crazy right now i've i had to go and buy this mic i've had to like set this all up dude it's been so hard to set up like a zoom thing and it's hard i hate this yeah i know you want you want that business to exist which is push a button and give me like a dope podcast like turnkey yes oh and for anyone who's listening this is podcast related a little bit i promise i'll finish up with this but this is awesome so my friend neville badora he sponsored the last podcast copywritingcourse.com i'll plug him he um i did like a happy hour with him i mean i don't know a dinner where we just we're just shooting the shit because we haven't been able to see each other because of this stuff he used a dslr as his webcam and it was awesome it looks so amazing it looks amazing it made him look like a greek god it looks like he's like it's all like it's like does that i don't know about cameras where it does like you're blurry in the background it's called like bouquet or something like that so so i saw on youtube uh there's this guy gary tan he's an investor in silicon valley he's like um you know one of the wise accommodator partners and he did this youtube video that was like how to look like a fucking amazing on zoom and i was like dude this makes sense this is the new like this is the equivalent of wearing a suit to work now right like yeah sitting on zoom and not looking like shit with your room looking like shit and so this video only had 1500 views but he's like look this is the camera i used this is the mount this is the lens here's how you get the that that blurred background look and like he looks amazing and then when i saw that photo you the screenshot you had of neville i was like i bet you he watched that video and there was only 1500 views but i was like anybody who's watching this and that the other guy who who did it was uh neve drawer who's the the founder uh he was at product.net now he had a shrug capital and he does it too and it really does look amazing and when i saw that i was like i should do this i should so i'm gonna do it i didn't know about this video so last night i bought 700 for the stuff i bought um so i already have these phillips hue light bulbs you know what those are yep yep uh where you i just say alexa turn the lights on right they're like smart yeah it's gonna turn the lights on um so i bought those but you see back here behind the couch i'm gonna put them there and so it's gonna like shoot up and it's gonna i hope it's so like i i we have like our room oh wait i forgot i'm not using the camera we have a room clean anyway you'll see it so i'm into i'm in on this i like it so this guy reached out from twitter who um he's done a couple of e-commerce things that are kind of interesting and so i was talking to him and he that's his new thing so he he's basically he initially was targeting twitch streamers because he's like look um when you're a streamer you're basically broadcasting from your bedroom and streamers invest in all this like artwork cool lights wall panels smart speakers all this stuff um to make the room look good and he's like i'm gonna make an e-com store that's like just gonna do that uh what's it called uh i'll find the name of it i don't know if he wants me to kind of out on him so we may have to believe this if uh if he's not into it but i'll say it right here it's called visual candy and uh this guy's smart i like this guy a lot and so um so anyways but now with the room you know work from home i think this extends a lot past where his initial market was which is youtubers and twitch stars and now it's you know any professional who's going to spend some amount of time in a home office and just think about the amount of home offices that are being built out right now um because people are needed infrastructure for this but that's going to stick around once covet goes away yeah i i i have loved i i'm really into it um i've like gone to amazon and i've tried buying like all the stuff and it's it's kind of complicated because i didn't know which batteries do this i was like how do i just i was like where does the camera need to be so i'm doing this there's another thing called a cam link i just looked this up um it's called elgato makes it el elgato yeah and it i i went and looked at it and it was they built this entire thing for streaming for gamers and uh it looks awesome i'm gonna i definitely am gonna start buying this stuff i'm probably gonna drop two grand on all this crap um i think we'll turn our uh we have a i have another bedroom i'll turn that into an office so i'm i like all this crap dude i love buying shit when you buy and when i just get on a buy streak and i'm like yeah you know what i deserve this i need that and like you know what's the problem here and and actually buying stuff is not um i don't know there's something like cathartic about it like just the act of buying it feels great and i love it yeah but for me i've been having to call 1-800-GOT-JUNK and having to spend like if i buy like a new desk the boxes are so big i gotta pay a hundred dollars just the box problem is insane especially here in san francisco the box problem is insane i hate it i hate it it's one of the reasons why i moved i live in a house now i used to live in a building and one of the reasons was is because i didn't have to worry about the trash right well but no matter how much space i have because i thought oh i got this new house i was like now i have a garage i got this like tradesman alley i got this extra closet but it's that same principle i think it's i forgot like the parkinson's law or whatever which is uh time will work will expand to fill the time you give it so let's say you have a week to do the project guess what it's going to take you a week if you had a day to do that same project it would have only taken you a day and um in the same way like junk your will expand to fill the space you have and so here let me let i've thought about this a lot let me get wise here okay i'm a amateur beekeeper so i have bees do you know this no you didn't know this okay at your house i don't know you have bees the right now so they actually uh went away but uh since 2013 i've kept bees so i've always for the most part so listen i'll tell you all about this for the most part in my life or in my san francisco life for 10 years i've lived in uh glenn park it's a nice neighborhood in san francisco it's like residential though and i've always had a backyard and i wanted a hobby that was uh not expensive and i didn't want it to turn into a business and i just wanted something fun that i could be outside and like i made a list of hobbies that i could pick and pick the lamest one and no beekeeping came up on top because it doesn't cost a lot of money to start if you want to you can just leave it alone and not do anything or if you wanted to you could poke around with it and like be active with it so low maintenance low maintenance it does it only costs three to five hundred dollars to get into the hobby you don't have to buy a bunch of shit to keep up with it um and it was allowed me to be outside and so i i became a beekeeper in 2013 i think and so how long do bees live like do you still got a bee that's around from them no no no no they uh they i think they might only live for like a few months they cycle through and so i bought about 10 000 bees and i get honey from them and i just give it away and i uh i call it southern sam sticky icky and uh and uh so i've had bees for years um and when i lived in soma i only lived in soma for a year and then i went back to glenn park and i just kept it on the roof at my office so you can have bees i i would have 10 uh 10 000 bees just on the roof of our office and no one would know they stay themselves mostly and they go out and get honey or get uh pollen and they turn it to nectar and it turns into uh uh honey and anyway but here's the interesting thing that i learned see this has been like this is my where the wisdom comes like here's the interesting things that i've learned with bees is bees fill the space that they are given with honey so if you give them a lot of space they will always fill it if you don't give them a lot of space then they just won't make it right so it's the rule of the sticky icky and so i've learned this through bees that humans are the same way if you give them a lot of space then they will fill it with a ton of stuff if you give them not a lot of space they just won't buy stuff you just won't you just won't get stuff and so that's the important thing so when you think of like i'm gonna get this huge house so i'll have a ton of room and i'll have more space you're gonna fill it to the brim with crap and you will no longer have space it always works that way okay that's amazing i love that story didn't know you were a beekeeper i've known you for like six years i had no idea by the way we both studied abroad in sydney and i took a class because when you study abroad you're trying to have a good time you're not trying to learn and so i took the easiest class i could find which was a bee a bee class and so i learned all this about bees and bees have some crazy things like just two quick bee facts um if i remember correctly from 10 years ago i learned that when a when the queen bee goes to mate she leaves on an expedition and she will mate with as many male bees as she can along the way and she basically has sex with them and then kills them right afterwards breaks their back and they die and then she she sort of gets impregnated by all these bees and then there's this other thing which is really interesting that that people have learned from bees which is like a big evolutionary learning which was in a beehive many of the bees could be fertile but they choose to be sterile and they choose to just take care of the queen bee's kids because they're all related by like some 25 they're all like quarter sisters or something like that they're all like 25 related and uh it turns out like in a darwinian sense you are better your genes are better off surviving if you just tend to these half sisters and quarter sisters that you have rather than trying to have your own kids and survive and so that's the crazy thing about bees bees are awesome man it's a great hobby you can get into it for 250 dollars all you got to do is go to amazon and you type in uh beekeeping kit and someone will send you the kit and then you go on your local craigslist you might even be able to buy them online but that might take like a few weeks but if you go on your local craigslist you type in bees there's a farmer nearby who you can pay a hundred dollars and they'll give you ten thousand bees and they'll set it up for you it's so it's super easy to get into and it is so fun bees uh uh you could eat i get fuck i mean i'll get like i gotta think about this like probably five to eight gallon milk jugs like what's the how big is a uh is that a gallon of milk yeah like that that worth of honey maybe five to eight a year they're producing okay cool i want some honey um also related to this idea of like people buy stuff uh and people love stuff and people will fill their space with stuff and bees will fill their space with stuff um if you want a good five minutes go on youtube and type chris delia girls love things and uh you will have a great time for five minutes okay and now that brings me to a random startup idea so i don't think this would work so let me start with that but there's something interesting here where so netflix recently you know netflix in the last few years started going heavy into comedy so comedy used to be like hbo kind of owned the space uh where they would do you know hbo specials um and then that kind of dried up and comics are like cockroaches they'll always survive it's like okay we'll go play in the dingiest room we'll go on stage we'll get a netflix special we'll get a hbo special okay we're back to the dark room again like they won't quit because they're like degenerates and now podcasting has been a huge boom for them um so chris delia who also just had a netflix special come out um these guys make tons of money right so netflix started cutting like 10 20 million dollar checks i believe to these comedians because they know that comedians have these like rabid followings and uh the content is good it's unique sort of proprietary content but i think that there's a product out there sort of like a crunchy what crunchy roll did for anime i think somebody could do for the mid-tier comedians i think you could make a sort of five dollar a month seven dollar a month subscription to uh the the head the comedians that are not going to get netflix specials right so not chris rock and not seinfeld and chapelle and and all those guys but like the next tier down like uh even you know one level below like the whitney cummings of the world right because they are still getting netflix specials and i think you could add them up and it doesn't even have to be the hour-long special it could be like a 10 minute set uh set or a 20 minute set or something like that and i think you could get i think each of them have a few thousand fans that would pay to be able to access that exclusive comedy content and um and so you would if you just aggregate all the comedians then it's a sort of all you can eat pass where as a viewer i can discover other comedians too so anyways i think that there's a business potentially for a mid-level netflix for comedians where you aggregate them what do you think great i'm looking up information so i can i i my brain's rolling and i'm gonna let me let me tell you what i think so uh first of all quibi i imagine is trying to do something like that so quibi um is that even fucking how you say it yeah that is it's pretty stupid uh i mean look i think with quibi um it actually can be great because the people who are running it are like super smart but it it does not look like a good bet now but it still might be um anyway they're trying to do something like that second i think that that is a great idea and i think the way that i would find out how to do it is i would look up quello q e l l o have you heard of quello i never heard of it okay quello's cool so what quello is is it's a it it's i think it was started way before its time it's an app on apple tv and all they have is live concerts and so it was started in 2010 and it's available on it's like a it's a app for your phone but i think it's best on apple tv and you could download it and you pay ten thousand or um is it maybe ten dollars a month ten sometimes ten thousand dollars a month uh i think it's ten dollars a month and you just get access to a library of live concerts have you ever wanted to do that or is that just me uh i kind of do this on youtube but youtube like has enough free like i listen to a bunch of like red rocks concerts right because there's a concert venue called red rocks which is awesome and like anytime a musician goes there they film it in like epic with epic cameras and sound and they're just like available on youtube for free but this is cool i like this it's awesome and the it's it's it's better than youtube but youtube is great and the reason it's better is because like if you buy like a concert dvd the camera works a little bit better and the sound is a lot better and i love live music and so i am a big fan of this and they have 70 000 paying subscribers they were recently acquired by stingray communications which is a publicly traded company in canada it's a cable company so if i were you sean and i wanted to launch this or if i was a listener and wanted to launch this i would look up stingray communication and i would go and read the the filing for that company and i would figure out exactly what quello does that's what i would do um and i would learn about how they did it because it's a relatively niche thing they only have 70 000 um subscribers it's not huge and they've been at it for 10 years so it's not a big number and i think it is incredibly viable business uh and i think it's great another thing another thing that i would do is i would look up discovery channel and then national geographic are you familiar you're familiar with national geographic obviously right okay national geographic is still a huge company and it uh uh disney recently bought into it at a billion dollar valuation and they still make they still make hundreds of thousands or um hundreds of millions of dollars a year from their magazine subscription is that crazy that's insane and so i would figure but they but here national geographic was a non-profit and uh and so the good thing about non-profits is you can go and see all their numbers and so what i would go and look at i would look at discovery and i would look at national geographic and i would look at coelo and i would see what they are doing because those are relatively niche um subscription companies that crush so long story short great idea okay cool uh all right what else we got you wanted to talk about this card thing yeah so um i am a user card i i think the product's only okay it's still quite frustrating to use but card laid off a bunch of people the other day like 167 people yeah and they raised money um and their ceo henry wrote this message that he made public uh and he said something like it was not your manager's fault for laying you off it was 100 my fault in fact it was the opposite your manager tried to help you and i'm the one who reviewed every list and i said we're gonna fire this person so blame me and i think that was great i thought it was a great message so so high level he was basically saying hey we laid a bunch of people off and i'm going to um publish the announcement i made to the company so that you know presumably other ceos and other companies can kind of learn from this use this or take solace in the fact that i did this too i don't know whatever the purpose yeah content marketing and he published this and i typically am fall into the category of all presses good press go ahead and do it i thought this was kind of lame did you do you agree and i and i tweeted at henry and i want him to come here and i'll say this to his face i think he seems like a cool guy this move i think was kind of lame right i would agree i've kind of followed this guy for a little while like i've read some of his other stuff or seen some interviews seems like a good guy seems like a smart guy and i think carter's a good product um and i like some of the other stuff they've done like they have a next chapter program basically to help people who want to people want to leave the company they don't make it this like awkward exit they like celebrate it and whatever you know in theory so i thought this was lame mostly because um i thought two things i thought it was tone deaf and um secondly i didn't think the actual statement was very good so i thought just the the premise of what he was trying to do like what is the upside and what is the downside um it to me it looked like he was trying to pat himself on the back and i know he would never he would say that's not what i was trying to do blah blah i think he's trying to pat himself on the back and um also like you know give a little bit of sort of you know put card his name out there again like just by it's kind of like the buffer way of like publish everything and uh the good the bad the ugly and you get attention uh but i just thought it was tone deaf and also it seemed like what he wanted people's reaction to be was like wow great leadership way to take responsibility great ceo ship and he got that and both not from me when i read this i was like this was a pretty horrible way to do the announcement uh and i'll tell you why he started okay so here's like i'm just gonna bullet point the the the summary so he goes um over the last few weeks we're talking about recession planning i said layoffs were likely and today is the day i can't delay it any longer okay weird start but all right then he says i'm sorry if i apologize uh if i sound robotic i'm reading off a script because i don't know if i can get through this without something to lean on okay you're not the victim don't say that that's also kind of yeah that's that's pretty lame yeah lame as fuck uh then he says okay let me start with the details we're gonna lay off 161 employees that's 16 of our company it's gonna be different across the company all right whatever then this was weird i thought it was just like if you are one of those affected you'll receive an invitation from your manager if you do not receive a meeting invitation you are safe and i was like okay hunger games a little odd uh way to do it but you know in a zoom world i don't know if there is a better way to really like kind of mass do this where you can't have the information come out until it needs to come out but i just thought like it's anxiety that's a very like anxious feeling thing and also you gotta know if you're the ceo and you say that people's minds just start racing in that direction they're just imagining what the next hour of their life is going to be they're not even going to hear the next three paragraphs you say like their mind is gone they checked out it's thinking about themselves and so whatever the next three paragraphs are ignore it so then he goes all right um the moral conflict this is the part i thought was whack so he's like in a couple of town halls ago i said there was two perspectives around layoffs the first is the shareholder perspective we're reducing costs and protecting cash or what matters the second is the employee perspective but nothing matters more than saving jobs and helping employees employees in a you know in a time where it's like unemployment at levels of the great depression so each of these are clear they're unambiguous and they're correct from their perspective but they are diametrically opposed this creates a conundrum for ceos ceos sit between shareholders employees and wish that they could do both for every ceo they have to deal with this conflict i chose to manage this conflict by taking the shareholder perspective and deciding who should leave and taking the employees perspective on how to help to me i was like what is this paragraph like dude yeah what the fuck dude it's all the same like you're just trying to build a company that makes profit and does work with good people that's the same thing yeah and like think about you have to think about your audience do you think your audience gives a shit about the shareholder perspective and the dilemma you have as a ceo and how you've chose to straddle this as a ceo it's not even about you so i just thought this was the part that was really odd to me that like see it seemed like he i don't know i wouldn't have included this in the statement and i thought that this made it look quite bad and i i would not want other ceos emulating this part of the statement because what matters is your audience is your employees and you need to know hey this is really hard for us uh we we tried to analyze every situation cut every other dollar we could before we cut anyone's jobs and we did that but this is the this is the path we have to go you know this is i'm terribly sorry like i did not manage the company in a way where we had enough buffer um this is a failing on my part this is the worst you know the worst day in my my my time as a company and it is for all of us um and so like here's what this means for you and like all you have to say is like this sucks uh we tried everything we could do this was the last resort and you know here's how we're gonna make it right by you and not like this theory about how shareholder value matters and the ceo has to like straddle these things it's like yeah i i think that and i think that that's not only does nobody care i think that that is just a silly way to look at it which is when you're building a company like step one is uh create something that people want and get it and get it into the hands get it into their hands in a profitable way okay that's step one like that that is just the the not that's the basics of a company which is you make something that someone wants to give you money or you make something and you make a profit off of it right and if i was i don't think that's step one but that is the fundamental premise that's the fundamental that's the fundamental premise is what i mean and so if i was him i'd be like look here's the deal like we expect we expected to grow a lot faster and we're investing in this and the plan would have worked but this thing slowed everything down and so we just have to cut things that are not profitable right and that sucks and i'm sorry that that sucks but that's what's going to happen and i think that if you just say that in a more straightforward way instead of all this shareholder value shit like people already know that people already know they're all adults in the room they understand this crazy virus is happening in companies across the board are having trouble some companies have no revenue now like people get that that that's happening and it's just like okay so what's going to happen at our company oh at our company we they tried everything they could they're making the the sort of this is what he needed to say was this was our last resort um we did this in a way where we're not going to have another round of layoffs because that creates you know i wouldn't say that i would i would say we're going to try not to yeah like you know that is our goal and how we did this but even then that's speaking to the people who are staying you know really at this point you just have to speak to the total group and just say some of you are going to be affected here's how it works here's how we're doing our best to to make it right to do right by everybody who's done right by us this is no fault of your own this is a fault of ours in running a company that was not um did not have the margin of error uh to deal yeah i think that like what i would just say if i had to do this which i hope i never have to but i probably really will have to one day not like i'm saying at our company but um well i'm not implying anything i'm just saying one day if i have a if i have a long career which i will um that you gotta say look i have a hundred percent of the flock that i have to manage and take care of and sometimes that might mean that i have to fire 30 of the flock in order to take care of the other 60 and that is just how life works and this just sucks and i'm trying to make this in such a way that the 40 are not completely hung out to dry but this is just what i have to do and i'm sorry that this is is the situation and if you want to blame someone blame me and that's that and that's pretty much all you have to say yeah exactly like you don't need the epic speech and you know right now we're kind of like look i think we're we're clear that hey personally for us this didn't like come across great and we weren't like oh wow that was epic um on the other side uh you know we're just kind of off the cuff coming up with what a what a better speech might be but the reality is that in this case like you basically have a speech writer you have a multi-billion you have a billion dollar company and you have time to think about this and this is the what what we're reading is his output after thinking about it and so that's the part that i thought was also i wouldn't have published it i wouldn't have published this because it's like do you take this fucking take this on the chin like and by the way i know i'm criticizing this guy i don't know him he i and i will tell us to i'll say this to his face and i'm sure he's actually a good good dude this is just a big miss but uh i would say like dude you got to take this one on the chin and just like this is a loss and and say be a man and say what you want to say to your people which uh that's your your fault that's wonderful i wouldn't publish this agreed i didn't understand that and also um i'm not yeah i'm not sure what the what the sort of upside of was of that was now on the other hand i think they did some things great right so like the actual actions that they were taking for people i thought were great they're like look we're going to extend the cobra health insurance till the end of the year because health insurance is super important especially right now and so they didn't have to do that but they did uh they removed people's cliff and they invested their shares they didn't have to do that but they did um you know they uh they give them i think a bit of severance didn't have to do that but they did and then they have this sort of alumni network where they're trying to help people get jobs cool i like all of that like i liked all of that action i just didn't like the preamble and i didn't like the sort of pat on seemed a little bit like pat me on the back please can i show you my leadership during this adverse time so you could like tell me i did a good job and that's the part i didn't like i liked a lot of the action yeah and i'm like you i don't know this guy so you know there's not no no personal thing against i've i've i have friends who work with them and i've heard a lot of positive stuff um i just think that like and i i i value i applaud carta for raising this money and going big and trying to make something happen and i applaud them from over for over hiring in hopes of like it working like i i applaud the risk-taking and i want people who are listening that just because sean and i are criticizing this guy you got to take risks still and you got to try this big and it's not going to work all the time good i mean not good but like whatever that's just you gotta it comes with the territory and i just wish you would have took it on the chin a little bit more right okay i got another i got one more topic that's on a a more positive note okay so uh um i gotta wash i feel like i gotta i had some hater aids spilled on me there i gotta wash that off uh yeah and by the way sean you and i typically are i'm rarely a hater exactly we're rarely haters so i and i yeah so i want to add this by saying i hope these guys crush it i hope they do wonderful i believe and think they actually will um i just think that this one move was a stupid move and a probably a very long and positive journey right um and and look you know there's a big difference of of uh criticizing a person versus criticizing an action or criticizing a you know something that was done and this is definitely like just didn't like the message not the don't know don't even know the messenger can we just say by the the way that a lot of people um in media like in who have these podcasts and newsletters and they're all haters of the people they're covering is that not the craziest thing ever yeah well i think it's like um it's like a fair trade uh so so so there's a guy uh eric weinstein have you heard this guy's podcast yeah i like him it's called the portal smart guy i don't know too much about him he he runs like peter teal's uh fund and so he's been talking about this concept lately that's called kayfabe have you heard him talk about this no okay so he's like hey there's this wrestling term called kayfabe k-a-y-f-a-b-e and he's like what kayfabe is is like you know in wrestling it's basically wrestling is a fake fight right wwe it's like a pre-arranged sort of agreed upon fake fight where i'm the hero and you're the heel or i'm the good and you're the bad whatever and um and it it's like the dialogue is sort of an agreed fight um for both of our betterment like the more we feud the more popular we both become and um the fight itself like okay we agree we sort of agree to do this and so he talks about how this happens in the real world too like right now i see this whenever trump goes and does his briefing and then there's that one guy from cnn jim alcosta i think is his name yeah and he's always there and he trump's like okay yeah you're next and then he asks his question and trump like rips him and then that becomes like the seven minute youtube clip and cnn talks about it all day and um like you know on one hand it's like why doesn't trump just kick this guy out or like you know remove revoke his press you know credentials here on the other hand why doesn't this other guy you know either you know fight back or start uh or like take some other action every day the same sort of thing plays out and i think in reality it serves them both extremely well where cnn gets awesome content that people want to watch because it's juicy to see the president fight with somebody and trump also loves the attention on the left on the right good and bad and then he drums it up as dude those liberals are always trying to say this and then the right supports him more because he has an enemy that's attacking right and so there's like this dance that they're doing so i get that i get that but here's what i don't get so i'll give you a very specific example this pissed me off so much there's this woman named the natasha t i forget what her natasha i don't know how to pronounce the last name i forget it though it's like uh anyway she was a blogger for valley wag which valley wag was pretty funny and all but they took it too far all they did was make fun of silicon valley um and then she worked at buzzfeed and then wired magazine and now she's at washington post and she had this article that says silicon valley now deems luxury housing and essentials an essential good uh good and so people are still building multi-million dollar condos and in the first line of the article it says the mayor has deemed luxury housing as well as all other types of housing including including housing projects and this other stuff as essential and it was in the technology section of the washington post yeah here it is natasha to tiku yeah tiku t-i-k-u and i've met her before and uh and i was like what the that's like saying like i'm gonna write an article in tech crunch and be like can you believe this billionaires are able to buy one million dollar cars and then in the article and be like but also anyone can buy any car including a one thousand dollar mazda including a twenty thousand dollar honda civic including a fifty thousand dollar mercedes it's like what and then why is it in the tech section of of washington post oh my god this pisses me off and so i looked this woman up and she's very educated she went to uh nyu and then like columbia journalism or like uh just like ivy league just really smart woman and i'm like why would you study for eight years or however long it took and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars when you're just gonna to do this hey you're just gonna hate the people who you write about right i don't understand it why not just go and write about something that like who you want to celebrate of course they'll say we don't hate them we're just you know we're reporting on that we're reporting the stories we don't we don't hate them um so there was a really interesting thing uh that happened recently where before coronavirus um there's this guy balaji who's on twitter pretty popular guy he was at andreason horowitz and a bunch of stuff uh he's at coinbase and things like that so he's kind of one of those like on the forefront of things guys so back in january he showed up at a crypto meetup and he was wearing gloves and a mask and this was january when nobody in the us was really worried about this and everyone's kind of laughing like what are you doing he's like well you know i think that there's a you know you know maybe small probability but that this coronavirus thing that's happening in wuhan is going to be like a major you know global pandemic and people are like okay biology all right thanks and so this writer came out and about box uh the vox a recode writer yeah so recode recode oh my god this infuriates me so the quick story here is the recode writer reaches out topology and says like hey uh i want to get your comment on a story we're doing about you know silicon valley's uh reaction to the coronavirus this was again early on and he was like yeah i'm not interested why don't you report on like who cares about silicon valley's what the silicon valley elite think about coronavirus like you should report on the state of testing the state of the the you know the spread of the virus and all these other like kind of like important facts that should be reported on and he tweeted out that he that that happened he screenshotted her dm and tweeted it and then all the journalists were like dude she was just asking for comment why are you putting on blast this is why people hate silicon valley and he was like no no no no i know this game and he so he talked about this he's like uh this is a strategy called befriend and betray where the journalist comes to you says hey biology you're an expert i would love to get your take on this thing and all they're trying to do is write the story and what the headline of the story came out was something along the lines of like you know why silicon valley's not doing handshakes anymore and it was like laughing at silicon valley sort of for overreacting to the coronavirus this was early on before all the lockdown and he said he goes i promise you the headline's gonna be right silicon valley nerds refuse to shake hands and that's what it was pretty much what it was now the body of the article i went back and read it was actually you know somewhat fair it was just reporting what was going on how you know whatever uh but he was right about the the headline and the headline's often written not by the journalist but by the editor because the editor needs to drive clicks blah blah anyway so this is a pretty interesting feud if you want to hear more that jason calacanis did a podcast of biology that i thought was pretty awesome so i can't i can't stand that particularly given like me like people always like oh you're a tech bro and that like a lot of some journalists will say that i'm like you work at vox if i'm tech so are you like what does that mean tech like like i had a so a journalist from the new york times come and interview me she's like so what are you and your like tech bro friends talking about yeah i was gonna ask you to do this so tell the story your new york times story this is an amazing story you've told me before yeah so first of all like i i made sure i recorded it and i had because i knew so i knew that this person was going to take me out of context so what was the context you went to new york or how did you know she came here she goes hey you seem like an insider i want to come and learn all the things that people are going to are talking about befriend and yeah and i go okay fine come i know what you're doing come on and uh but maybe it could be positive like maybe we'll become like we can exchange cool information maybe you'll write something positive about me maybe i'll just whatever and maybe it'll turn out good and she comes she goes can i record this i go yeah i'm going to record it too and uh and uh because i i didn't want anything to be taken out of context and she goes so like you're like a tech bro like what do you and your tech friends talk about and your bro friends and i was like first of all why are you calling me a bro like what are you and your tech chick friends talk like why would you ever say that to me you don't know me and that's just rude to say anyway and i and she i go well i don't know you i go you're in tech you tell me she goes no i work at new york times i was like you guys just announced that most of your revenue comes from digital like you're why am i tech and you're not tech like you are tech and she goes well it's just different i was like well you tell me what you you you and your tech friends talk about and she goes well we're not whatever she like tried to dismiss it i was i was like anyway i go well we talk about uh just like you know sports and i was like i don't know we just talk about normal stuff like cool diets or like cool food like all types of weird stuff and uh it was just so odd she was just so trying to like it was so much like an other like i am an other from you and i'm like i don't i don't understand this this this this uh dichotomy here like we are actually in the same industry i work in publishing so do you uh we both make most of our most of our money from the internet uh like why are you calling me this tech bro i you don't even know me and she's like what you don't listen to joe rogan do you i'm like well yeah i do i listen to a lot of cool stuff i uh i read and this is true every morning i go to cnn and then i go to fox news and then i go to huff poe and then i go to bright part because those are all like the kind of the opposites i read all types of stuff i like joe rogan i like oprah i do all types of stuff why are you trying to like set me up for this gotcha moment right and it was horrible i hated it and so to sum this up the headline by the way we have it multi-million dollar mansions high-rise waterfront condos and a stately victorian all deemed quote essential under public health orders in san francisco and silicon valley that was the headline and then in the first paragraph it said it said it restated the headline and then it added as well as housing projects and low-income housing all deemed essential right oh my god i can't stand it i'm like why would you i remember we bought uh when we bought bebo back so we had bought bebo for a million dollars out of an auction and um we were gonna relaunch it as something and so nobody knew that we had bought it back it was like done in a courtroom it was like kind of on the low and um there was i knew a reporter and you know we were kind of friendly i guess we had friends of friends that were mutual and so i was like okay hey um you know i want to give you a scoop and you know on the embargo and like come do an interview and whatever so she was like great comes over does an interview explain the whole thing we talk about what we're doing blah blah blah next day uh the article comes out and this is the person we gave the scoop to we could have given it to anyone next day article comes out headline was remember bebo yeah that bebo it was like it was something like um you know uh remember bebo yeah it's dead but maybe you know it was like something like bebo is dead remember bebo literally it was like lol was like in the headline it was like making fun of it and then the whole article was our conversation we talked about was like legit and so i texted her i was like what the uh what is this headline and she was like i'm sorry like i don't get to do the headlines my editor does the headlines and he just like you know he's gonna do what's gonna drive the most clicks and like he decided the thing that would drive the most clicks is um talking about the buyback and like yeah right like it's like buying myspace back and trying to relaunch it and so i was like you know that's that's fair but um wow what a shitty move to pull when you're sort of given a embargo you and you have all these other elements of the story that you could have like used as the lead sean i but i don't blame i don't blame her or him because like um i think that if you just because you gave her an embargo like she should be still say the truth and say her opinion like and she shouldn't hold back if she thinks you're stupid and what you're doing is stupid she just because you gave her that she should say that's that's true the two things that i thought were weird were uh number one the headline and the story were so disconnected the story was what she actually thought and the content of our interview which is positive that's frustrating and then the headline was just something completely different that was written by a completely different person and just shows kind of like the way the inside of those organizations work the second thing i thought was just kind of whack was like um no heads up like there's a sort of a human connection to this too right like if i've uh done you a favor by giving you an exclusive piece of news even if you're going to write something that you know i'm not going to like when you're like lol this thing is dead yeah right it's not going to come back then um you know to surprise the person i think is an unnecessary extra slap versus oh i just i so disagree with you i i totally agree with your first point but i don't agree with your second point which is um if i'm going to say something negative about you i'm not going to give you a heads up i'm just going to say it but that's dumb dumb business right you you cut yourself out then going forward right like we had a bunch of other stories that came out in the coming years and guess who like never got a word right her she just cut herself out for no reason yeah i mean i think it's a it's definitely it's a hard thing to balance and this is why some people like for example if someone says that they're a conservative news site well the reason one of the reasons why they probably could keep giving conservative people a good look is so they can get positive they can yeah so it's definitely hard but me personally if you if like if someone comes on this podcast and they go like i'll like will you make me look good i'm like no i'm not going to make you look good i'm not going to make you look bad like we'll talk and if i think you say something dumb i'm going to just going to tell you that's stupid right like i'm not so i i i think that um i think that if i agree with that game i've got to suffer the the both the positive and the negative consequences and the positive consequences is maybe they're going to think i'm great and they'll tell the truth and also as a quote journalist or i don't know what you want to call me or both of us we're going to like find the truth but also if someone thinks that about us and it's negative we got to live by that yeah i don't mind getting negative press i did mind the sort of dissonance and also uh i don't know like i just think like it is again bad business for that person because you burn your own bridge whereas if you're like hey look um like just want to let you know like the article is going to talk about this and it's going to mention this right it's going to be there's going to be some negative parts which are skeptical about and the disease cool could have kept that relationship didn't lost the relationship that maybe doesn't affect me it affected them maybe telling you ahead of time is going to be negative is not bad but like if i think that what you say is bullshit i'm going to say it no matter what yeah that nobody wants the other side right otherwise nobody will read the shit if you're not telling it like it is if you're not telling your actual opinion then the you know the whole ecosystem doesn't work but all right anyways do we have any other ones we want to talk about i don't know we want more thought on that well i was gonna say didn't someone come on the show and i was like i'm going to tell this person i think there's that that that what they're doing is really stupid and uh it's definitely awkward what did that happen do you remember that um i don't remember that no oh man i think henry was here oh oh i know what it was it was the the woman from everly well i think she came on with the the tests oh i know i i was like i think nutritional testing is bullshit right and you said it straight to her face and then she kind of like answered i'm not trying to pat myself on the back i'm trying to say like literally i don't even remember like did we call her out you literally said it to her i kind of facilitated i kind of stirred the pot oh yeah you did why don't you tell her what you think about yeah like laughed and you told her tell her what you were saying like you know just go ahead and say it yeah definitely set it up it's definitely awkward like before and after you're like i'm being nice to you but like i'm definitely gonna roast you right now it's super awkward but i think if you do it in a certain way it's not that bad it's because and they should understand okay one last thing we we totally went off the rails here go ahead one last thing but yeah we did go off the rails this podcast was about like beekeeping and like all kinds of other shit but whatever um so i'm gonna take my hat off and so i clearly need a haircut um my friend greg uh launched this company or it's not a company he just created a website called you probably need a haircut.com and uh basically surfing quickly off the the um the quarantine stuff where people are locked at home everyone's hair is growing out nobody can go get a haircut you shaved a mohawk uh what he's doing is he's barbers who are also out of work they're at home they can do a zoom consultation and basically help you cut your own hair and so that's awesome if you need a haircut you probably your hair looks good did you cut it no i'm gonna cut it dude it's awful it's yeah it looks good right now i agree actually it does look good right now but i looked at it before this hat was on it and it looked awful so i'm gonna cut my hair i've been cutting my own hair for 10 years now i have i've had the clippers i can tell you all about i know how to do a fade the other day i did shave it completely bald because i wanted to feel how do you do the back um sarah my wife will help me but for years i would do it on my own and admittedly it probably didn't look great but i watched videos on how to like give a fade right and i it's not that hard but uh i i've been doing it for years just because for a long time i was poor and i didn't want to pay money but now i do it because i'm like oh i don't want to like drive there yeah it's annoying to go and plus they always make me take my headphones out and i'm like well now i'm bored like you don't understand i constantly have information going in through my eyes or my ears and now you're making me just sit here like yeah and also i just don't want to talk to them and i'm like i don't know like so so what i do is i close my eyes and that's like a sign for not not talk but i but i wish that there was like an app like for out of certain barbers where it's like click like do not talk to me or talk to me right because like for weird like people like me i'm like i'm just super i don't like the confrontation i just don't want to i don't want to talk just leave me alone i i'm like that conversation dude i'm like that at grocery stores you know jack jack smith he he we're like the same way we go to grocery stores and i'm like if i don't see what i don't want to if i don't see what i want to buy even though they probably have it but a different section i just won't buy it i just won't buy it instead of ask or if i'm with sarah i'd be like sarah will you go ask for this i like i don't even want to talk to anyone right i think a lot of people are like that yeah i think did they add this into uber where you could get in and be like yo let's not let's not do that thing where we talk yes yes uh and it's awesome i just don't i'm just like uncomfortable and i don't want to do it but more barbers you know the last thing they know what they need at barbers is they just need like six different haircuts for men and you just feel like give me the four but they do have that a lot of a lot don't and you say the same thing like short on the side a little bit off the top like everyone says the same thing it's like it's like dude just like show me a picture of like five people and i'll just point um a lot of barbers don't have that yet or dude it could be unspoken because everybody just wants short on the side a little less short on top but shorter than it is currently and you should only have to say anything if you want some other shit like oh i'm going for this other look i want to do a look okay then it's on me to tell you about the look but if not i just want to sit down no words just do the short on the sides a little short on top same just like give me like three options like completely bald uh like just whatever the three are and i'll just point at one of them and by the way just don't talk to me once i initiate conversation and do my eyebrows because they're getting a little long i got long eyebrows everyone knows that don't make me ask you don't make me ask you that's the number four right and also they say like do you want your you want the back of your neck rounded or squared i'm like right i don't know i don't care yeah like i don't see it you you be the judge right exactly and i've i one time i asked him i was like what's the deal with this question because i don't know and like is there a difference what's the deal and then someone told me actually one of the barbers actually taught me they were like look if you do square when it starts to grow back out it's going to look shitty so it looks good initially but then it looks it'll look obviously not square after it starts to grow out he's like do the round because then even as it grows back it's uh like blends in it's not so bad dude this sounds like a larry david episode like uh like so what's the rounded square what's the difference like i mean we try we try so um this one went off the
