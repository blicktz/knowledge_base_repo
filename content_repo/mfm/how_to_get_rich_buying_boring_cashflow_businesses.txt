they are buying like can we talk about what they bought they've come on the pod before uh and they're pretty public about stuff so they're buying companies like cool uh pool construction companies so it's like uh you know pools are this like amazing business that you could you could do and they bought one in like i think it's called dolphin pools or something like that they bought it in arizona it crushes it they hired this one operator who's like really good who took it over from the the original owner the the boomer owner and basically it's grown like crazy and that's like one of their cash cows now and i uh and they also bought a internet web like um i got in the country like they don't have like at&t or time warner or whatever they they have like local providers and they bought one of those and it's doing well and i have family members so my dad's an entrepreneur they bought like five kids they bought five different yeah a bunch of internet service providers and they're all doing i think pretty good um and so my dad owns a small business that none of his family is taking over my father-in-law owns a small business who and it is a really it's a killer business i mean um and they uh he somehow the the our new brother-in-law is now going to take it over and seeing the turmoil that he had to go through in order to he was like well i spent 40 years building this thing and i guess if no one that i love wants it i'm just going to shut it down and and it was like kind of tragic and it's like i'm literally willing to give this to a family member and they can make many millions of dollars a year if they wanted to do this it's just it's free you could have it and uh people didn't want to do it and so i've seen this process and it is like an emotional it's it's a really it's a huge challenge and this is very a very interesting market there's some stats about how many do you know how many boomers are retiring and like some absurd number it's it's absurd it's like it's like it's like a quarter of the the country like or or a third of the country biggest wealth transfers of all time is about to happen it's the like that that group of people when they pass down their inheritance it's gonna it's like many trillions of dollars i think i don't know if that's that might be hyperbole but i think it's something like that some ridiculous number and then that's like a lot of people that are just not gonna have to work but also don't know what to do with it and similarly there's many many businesses that was when enduring first pitched it they were like they just showed me the stats they were like there are this many boomer businesses where they want to retire they don't want to run their business anymore and their kids don't want to take it over and like those businesses are up for grabs and they're like too small like they're not sexy as a startup and they're too small for big private equity and so we're gonna be like basically like permanent equity where they're gonna be they're just gonna buy it and hold these amazing businesses for a very long time and they keep doing that one after another uh like i think civa and xaver they've rolled up like almost a hundred million dollars of business equity off of a two million dollars starting equity amount like we yeah we it is crazy i i invest i did what i didn't have a lot of money when i first invested in so but at the time it was like 10 or 15 000 or something like that that i invested it was like that was a big deal for me did i tell you what happened with my investment in it it's just been like it's just been growing and growing and growing no so they so they were like they're like sean like you've helped us like think through this idea and like they knew like i like this stuff i'll be helpful along the way so they're like you know we want to offer you like if you invest we'll also offer you like an invest uh an advisor or like uh like an advisory grant that'll just match your investment and uh and i think they thought i was gonna do like you forgot to file the paperwork no no no no i think they thought i was gonna put in like 25k or like max or like 20k something like that so they're like okay cool you got like 20k of equity we'll give you 20k worth of advisory shares but i was like a big believer in what they were doing so i put in 200 000 and then they were like they're like oh and i was like look you don't have to like i get it you don't have to give me 200 000 of advisory shares but xavier was like nope a deal's a deal and um like i was like we didn't sign anything and like dude i'm totally okay with it but he's like no like like we will we'll honor that and also like i know you'll like you'll deliver and so since then i've had this like immense desire to deliver on that it was actually the best thing he ever did because he got me to basically work for him for free uh for this one like for this act of goodwill i am like i will i see your goodwill and i raise you 10 times goodwill on my own side it's gonna that's gonna end up being a great one of your better investments i would think depending i don't know when you got in were you with very big both were you both yes then that's gonna i think it's gonna crush exactly like i think already let's say conservatively that's probably up 20x you know like something like that in valuation you think that's up 20x because if they go raise now they basically have i don't know exact numbers but like somewhere between 25 to 50 million of revenue the closer to 50 million in revenue from these businesses now um that they've acquired off of 2 million in equity yeah that's crazy you
