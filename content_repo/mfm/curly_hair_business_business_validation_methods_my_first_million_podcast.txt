okay let's start with an idea um curly girl hair so you guys in trends did a uh post about the natural hair movement yeah that's a big big thing and um um mixed race mixed race and black women and so talk a little bit about what was in the report and then i'll tell you sort of what i've seen separate from that it sounds like you're more interested in it you tell me what okay all right so so i'll start with uh so my sister-in-law got has super curly hair and if you've never seen sean he's indian i'm indian and she's indian and she's got super curly hair and um curly hair takes a lot of maintenance right like it's humid boom it's frizzy and you have like there's this episode of friends where monica's hair is like an afro uh that that happens or it's flat or you want to straighten it or whatever it's a lot of maintenance of curly hair and so um she was telling me she's like yeah i downloaded this like i joined this thing i bought this pdf that's called the curly girl um guide or something like that and um it's this method to like taming your hair and getting because i told her i was like your hair looks great nowadays like what have you been doing and i just thought she would say like oh i use this other product she's like no there's like a 12-step process i'm doing every night anybody with curly hair black women anywhere else so my wife if you're uh well i guess they wouldn't be able to see this my wife's black she's half white she's also not here even if they're watching yeah so she's half white and half black and she buys a lot of this stuff as well right and so like there's a whole thing of like you know when you go to sleep you need to wrap your hair in a certain way to sort of like whatever the oils blah blah blah and so then uh and like some basics that you just don't do so like she you know she had curly hair her whole life but didn't know oh i'm not supposed to use shampoo in the same way that most people use shampoo and so she was telling me about some of these differences anyways opportunity i was like i like these businesses where you could put out content and information that just helps people and then and then sort of on the back end sell the kit um that's like oh by the way like if you just want to push a button and get the solution i have the kit that has all the shit you need because she spent hours researching all the different products that like what is the best version of this oil i'm supposed to have what is the best version of the shampoo for me and um and so anyways i think there's an opportunity to do this curly girl hair kit because uh there's this huge number of women that have curly hair the spend is in the multi billions per year in the u.s for uh how this gets treated and there is this natural hair movement where it's less about doing these really damaging things like permanently straightening your hair or um you know weaves and whatnot like now there's a sort of a natural hair movement and so people need uh content like education plus the tools um this sort of the hair care kit um to take care of the hair okay i love that henry can you do me a favor on a new tab type in reddit curly hair so there's a whole subreddit one of the ways i like to look at validation and ideas for different companies is i like to look at the engagement and size of a particular subreddit how many subscribers does this subreddit have i can't read that from here use that use that mic you got henry what are you doing that's pretty good i think actually for a curly hair and particularly because reddit is uh mostly men right and this is a woman's focused curly hair subreddit with exactly so great way to sort of validate the demand and the community uh aspect to this where people are sharing information recommending products to each other the other side of this is it photographs great so you know before and after i believe is the best ad that you can do before which is a photo after which is a better photo and um you don't even need to show your product you just need to show whatever i took gave me this outcome i was here now i'm there so my wife loves this subreddit okay so here's further validation um okay so particularly so i think that the the angle here is you have to go ethnicity or race specific yeah uh so whether it's indian i have no idea if asian women suffer from this but if they do go do that i know from firsthand experience that mixed race women or uh whether they're white and black or any other combination suffer from this as well right and further validation is fenty rihanna has that brand uh that sold to uh the louis vuitton company or what's it called l lvmh lvmh uh they and you could read about the deal i think it was valued at 800 million dollars and her a lot of her thing is towards uh yeah of course mixed races um and then another idea here and everyone knows about this woman but kayla it's new it seems it's it seems what's her thing called it's sweat or something yeah sweat's her app this is where i sound like your wife does it my wife does it yeah i sound like an idiot because i'm a guy and i don't pay attention yeah this whole segment is like bros trying to talk about you know products they don't understand but i'm fascinated i'm interested i'm trying and everyone loves to try it so kayla's thing i heard that's a hundred million dollar a year company it is the fitness app itself which is like crazy and it was just built off her instagram following so that's crazy i'm into this started with she started with the same thing beach uh the bikini body guide i think was her content that she put out yeah and then it was pdf and the pdf got circulated everywhere and basically she allowed the like paid pdf to get bootlegged and just shared everywhere and what that did was it just gave her tons of awareness tons of marketing and um and then she launched the app which you couldn't bootleg and you had to pay for and then boom and the most interesting part about her thing was she so she's like mainstream popular and typically when things are mainstream popular maybe sometimes like people who think they're cool can think it's kind of lame and sarah's a ivy league educated new yorker and she was like oh i love this pdf right and so she has access to all types of interesting things and she still uses it and i and i thought that was amazing that people really respected and liked it yeah she comes across very well if you've ever seen her content she's not like um she's not hateable like she doesn't come across as hateable i thought that's cool um oh and last thing diva curl have you heard of diva curl not no uh another mixed race shampoo maybe it's for black women but or maybe i don't know what the i forget if it's black women or mixed race women uh that's what we use for shampoo and uh it was quiet for acquired for a quarter of a billion nice and there's some things on the opposite side like tristan walker who was i think either the co-founder or first employee of foursquare left to start his own uh african here african american men's skincare uh product company walker brands walker brands where it was like you know shaving stuff because you know the hair is different it's coarse it's gonna the traditional shaving gear was causing problems and uh didn't work out went under and that kind of brings me to i don't know why it went under exactly i don't know if it was well i can tell you why they just raised too much money and fucked everything up you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
