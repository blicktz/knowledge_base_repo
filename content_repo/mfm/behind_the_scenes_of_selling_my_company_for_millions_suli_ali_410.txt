every time i've had a company sale when we sold bebo to twitch when we just sold the milk road you have been our we would call the deal doula you help us you know go through that labor process and come out the other side with you know the happy ending i guess sully welcome to my first million uh you're subbing in for for sampar today and like every substitute teacher it's always the best when they're there um we we're gonna do a bunch of things we're gonna talk about some of your the companies you started the companies you've invested in things are you know some ideas you have you were the first ever episode of the podcast if people want to hear your life story that's the place to go episode number one um we've come a long way from there did you think this is what would happen uh i always knew the podcast was going to be big and uh i think from the very beginning you were like let's do barstool except for business and that's what it's become and it's huge and i actually think it's going to be way bigger in a year than it is today like three times the size a year from now than it is today uh yeah i hope so that's the uh that's the goal uh we did the kind of barstool thing except without hiring anybody it was like okay we will just be the jackasses and then like let it go from there um all right so i got you sent me this doc which is great because there's a bunch of topics on here that i kind of want to jump into you uh i guess we should set the the the like groundwork here so i'll give you a very short life story so people understand who you are you um you worked at a job for like a couple years you did like the traditional path you worked at microsoft you quit you decided to start your own company this is right when the facebook app platform comes out so you start building like silly facebook apps that go viral so uh think things like superlatives which was um like which of your friends most likely to do x and uh it would invite those friends to like do it too and it grew like crazy but it was like a silly facebook app so you didn't have to do with it but you ended up selling it so you got that was your kind of my first million moment so you sell it um you're how old at that time like 24 25 ish 26 maybe uh yeah 26 26 take that and you go on the next big wave which is uh mobile apps are gonna be a thing you are creating games i think maybe first on facebook and then on the iphone when when the iphone app store comes out you're like oh this is gonna be big you create a company called tiny uh or tiny co and um end up somehow you raise money from andreason horowitz you're living the dream things go south as the economics of that business change and then you go all in in this hail mary strategy which again episode one for the whole story you go all in on this hail mary strategy of like we're gonna get the rights to family guy and you end up somehow as a startup that nobody's ever heard of getting the rights to the license to to make the family guy mobile game you did it for harry potter and a couple other big ip things sell that company um and then that i met you after that so i met you kind of when you were selling that thing we met at a dinner that sam was throwing because you were speaking at hustlecon and immediately we hit it off we were we made some big plans we were like you know you were talking about tony robbins i was like oh i'm a tony robbins guy you're like really i don't even know about tony robbins tell me and i started gushing about my experience there whatever and i was like yeah we should do that here in san francisco like let's do it tomorrow morning let's have a yeah our own power session with people like us who are just you know electric and uh yeah we were like uh tony robbins is amazing nobody is doing this um in this kind of modern way let's put up some facebook ads today um and then tomorrow let's have 50 people in here and try our hand at like being tony robbins for a day we did the thing where you spent 20 minutes being like this is great this is a great idea this is this is a no-brainer and we just keep talking about how much it's a no-brainer how much it's a slam dunk we're gonna do it we're using all these terms never did it 10 years later we still never did it but we became good friends along the way i still think it's a great idea yeah it would be the most fun weekend ever yeah i think i still think we should do it we uh but then we we kind of got uh i guess from there you you did a couple things so your brother started native deodorant you kind of helped him with that you started another company which we don't really talk too much about then i was starting my e-commerce brand you have helped me out a lot with that and are kind of a shareholder in that business um and when we were every time i've had a company sale when we sold bebo to twitch when we just sold the milk road you have been our and we would call the deal doula you help us you know go through that labor process and come out the other side with you know the happy ending i guess um so that that's kind of like how our interactions have been like on a business side and then become great friends uh since then so that's my intro did i miss anything um i love being the deal doula by the way uh when we sold tinyco we had this banker named dick filipini and he uh ran he was our banker ran the transaction for us and i told him that i loved what he did so much that i just wanted to work for him for free for six months after this so i could see all of the deals that he was doing and uh he did not accept my offer and said no you you can't do this dick is great he helped us for free when because bibo was the bibo deal was going to be too small he does bigger deals like i think like 100 million plus type deals um it was too small but he got on the phone with me several times throughout the process talked me off a ledge multiple times when i was like i'm just gonna say this he's like no well you should probably just wait see what they say um and his advice was basically just like don't f this up you know son and he was totally right he helped me a ton and actually i still feel the guilt that i didn't like send him a gift afterwards i think i even texted you like a year later i was like what's dick's address i didn't send him a gift i can't believe i didn't and here i am still four years later have not sent that gift dick i'm so sorry you were so helpful and i think i will say the deal another deal that dick did that i thought was super interesting was he sold apple oven to a chinese company for uh one billion and the trump administration blocked the deal or the ftc blocked the deal and uh instead of it being a billion dollar sale the chinese company invested a hundred million dollars into apple oven and then a couple years later apple oven so everyone i thought would be devastated like the founders were like we're going to become so rich overnight as we sell this company for a billion bucks transaction doesn't happen i assume founders are sad and upset then a couple years later the company goes public and at some point it was worth 30 billion dollars as a publicly traded company yeah so such an amazing transaction to not have uh closed well they got the best of both because they whatever the company was putting i think it was 1.6 was the original 1.4 was the original purchase price and they were going to put in a few hundred million dollars to own 70 or 80 percent of it and then instead it was like the year went by nothing happens and so with that anxiety came this big payoff because the business grew like crazy in that time so they're like hey okay same deal but now you own like 20 or 30 percent and so they got the money they got liquid on that but they only had to give up a tiny fraction and then they sold it and then they went public um you know later for for way more so that turned out you know pretty much as good as it could go right yeah they got both uh just had to wait a year um speaking of kind of like acquisitions i gotta i have a milk road related question for you first which is um you saw you saw both the acquisitions that i did uh from like sort of start to end and i shared you know it's like in high school when it's like the boy texted me this should i reply this should i say this like no no that looks too needy say that like change the period to a comma and then just you know cut that last line like it's that level of help that that you were doing with me um what's your i've given kind of my debrief of the acquisition i'm just curious what's your uh what was your takeaway or what was your what are some nuggets that that you would you would share from uh from watching that go down um i love the deal structure that uh milk road ended up with which was a bunch of cash up front and then um a bunch of equity in the new company where those two guys are wanting to grind it out for years and build a giant business and uh those guys in my head you know some percentage of the work that they do is just creating value for you and ben and that's awesome so i love that deal structure uh the in my head uh kind of having been through this a couple times i feel like a lot of the um you know texts the nuance of words that you care about when you're trying to sell your business the buyer doesn't care about that much um and it's more of a emotional thing than a practical thing where practically the buyer is like i want to buy this business because of the strategic reason and the revenue and the profit and a lot of the things that um you can be squeamish about or uncomfortable to say or not sure how to say things um i think a lot of that stuff doesn't matter one of the things that i learned uh actually when i was trying to sell tinyco was um we ran a sales process where i was trying to sell the business and we talked to a bunch of uh acquirers and we got pretty far along with one um and then the deal didn't happen uh and then a year later we went and sold the company um successfully and the um there was a bunch of stuff that i was trying to keep close to the chest and i was like oh people aren't going to want to hear this people aren't going to want to hear that and what was great about a banker and some somebody like dick was uh he was like no actually this isn't a big deal just tell these guys this and uh they're not going to care about that so it took uh this kind of un discomfort i had around like things i thought were secrets that i needed to take to the grave with me and he just made me comfortable telling them about right sam sam did something for me in this process so as we were selling the milk red i was like yo any kind of tips or advice you've had and when he sold to hubspot he goes oh on that same note he goes just do uh just tell them up front all the shitty things about your business that they that might scare them away because guess what they're gonna find those anyways when it comes to due diligence and you're just gonna be you know four weeks in or six weeks in emotionally invested and it's gonna get ugly later and they're gonna feel like they just found some like you know big wart on the deal at that point in time um and he goes just tell them all the skeletons your closet now and be like here's all the reasons you shouldn't buy this company if these bother you you now know them and you can decide for yourself you know if that's a deal breaker for you this was like not the very first thing but shortly after like we went to a dinner and everybody was interested we hadn't even fully negotiated the deal but i just said they're like you know any questions you guys have or you know any any concerns i said well you know i want to make sure like you fully understand this business um and you know i've been through this a couple times and i just i know like um it's better to just be fully transparent so i said you know here's all i made a list of the reasons why you know you shouldn't buy this here's all the skeletons in our closet and you can look at these today and you could you could decide if this is too um too concerning for you you know let's talk through these now and we did it and later after the deal was closed we did a debrief and they they basically this is how you know they're smart they're like what could we have done better in the acquisition process like um you know from your point of view and we asked the same amazing they asked that it's like how was that for you uh was that good for you it was good for me and it was like we we told them uh they told they gave me that feedback they were like you know you said something at this dinner where you were just like here's all the ugly parts of our business and like let me just tell you about them and we could talk through them they go that built so much trust because we didn't know you very well and immediately we were like oh okay we feel we felt at ease and um we felt like we could trust you guys going forward and so that turned out to be a big win and that's the exact opposite my you know i think the entrepreneur's instinct is hide that you know as far put it behind your back you know if they if they if they ask for you show them but like don't scare them away and and in fact what you want to do is like find out as quickly as possible if there's a real match here or not and use that as a tool to build trust uh versus to build distrust by not disclosing it up front the other thing i've seen entrepreneurs do that i i um think is also kind of uh the wrong common sense out there is uh when you ask an entrepreneur if they want to sell their business entrepreneurs are told to say no i do not want to sell my business and they expect that the buyer is going to come over the top and say even if you don't want to sell your business we're super interested in buying it we'll do anything it takes uh please come talk to us and in practice that's not at all how it works uh oftentimes a buyer is looking at a bunch of different businesses to buy at that point in time and so they'll reach out or talk to 10 different businesses five of them will say no we're not for sale and they'll say okay great we're knocking these five off we're going to focus on the five that have said yeah we are for sale right and so what's the way to say yes without seeming desperate there or seeming too too eager to sell because you don't want to do that either i think the way i've done it before is um one when i was ready to sell a business i would uh find somebody that i knew was interested but wouldn't have a good offer and get them to make an offer and then say cool uh go that enables you to reach out to other people and say hey we have an offer to sell the business and we're thinking about uh whether or not to do that and you are somebody that we think there's a great strategic fit with so we thought to talk to you before we did something else yeah yeah so that's kind of one way to do it if they come inbound it's sort of like um you know we have had interest and nothing you know nothing felt felt right you know we really like our business um but you know we respect you guys and if that's something you you know we obviously be open to listening uh you know we we owe ourselves that right and so so you kind of you just say we like our business we had interest it hasn't we we didn't really nothing went too far because we weren't very you know weren't too keen on it but you know really like you if you want to talk like we're open to talking there's nothing you know that's fine yeah um yeah i think that's a good setup and uh i think buyers who are experienced can kind of read between the lines pretty quickly uh because what you just said is like i'm wide open somebody please ask me out for a date i'll i'm ready uh you know and i'll be a cheap date exactly but like it's the signal it's the signal that i'm interested without like um without begging you uh but it's like to be clear i'm interested yeah yeah it's perfect it's like looking at somebody across the bar for and catching their eyes um their eyes for one second and then smiling and looking away there was a another meeting we won't talk we won't name the name but you were a part of a few of the meetings as we talked to different people from milk road and it was the first meeting with one of the buyers and you you immediately called me afterwards and you were like wow yeah and then you said uh there's this phrase a fool and his money are easily parted and you immediately sniffed out that this person was sort of an idiot um and like you know would would would be and sure enough they made the by far the largest offer um and you know turned out to be you know they turned out to be not not exactly who we we didn't go with them because of that but of of the three or four people that we talked to this was one of them but you sniffed that out immediately what what tipped that off for you and uh what can you say without getting us in too much trouble um you know there's a lot of people who are charlatans nowadays and uh they'll often lead with a lot of like flattery and not substance um like it's very easy for me to tell when somebody is like hey this is who i am i've done x y i started this company i sold it i started this company it didn't work out they're just like honest about their resume and there isn't tremendous amounts of puffery that with a couple google searches you can be like actually that's all not true right and that's what happened with that you said a lot of words but you haven't said anything yet okay that is uh you know either i'm not understanding what you're trying to say or you have nothing to say basically yeah that's right and they don't lead with like numbers and information they lead with uh like flowery language that doesn't go anywhere so i'm curious um what are some business ideas that uh you think somebody could start that would be successful either at the smaller scale like i think this can be you know like a clear business that'll make a few million bucks and i just think you know if somebody out there's looking for a way to get financial freedom this is a way to here's a big idea somebody who is willing to grind that out should go do this um the big idea that i like the most right now is um robin hood for real estate so uh you know robin hood makes it easy to invest in uh the stock market um and the way i've thought about this is i've got a ton of friends who are you know in their 20s that work at uh facebook or google and they make a ton of money but uh what they do with it is they just stick it in their uh bank account or in a savings account or a cd uh sometimes they'll invest in the stock market um i think it's so hard to be able to invest in real estate and if there was a turnkey way through a mobile app to be able to invest in real estate uh i think that would be huge and i think it's really different you you did this um investment and i followed you uh in a company called jar in india and so they make it super easy to invest in gold in india and so you can invest with a dollar or fifty dollars or five thousand dollars and just buy gold there's no choice like a one click it's just if you believe that gold is a good thing to invest in we'll make it easy for you to do that thing that you already think is a good idea exactly and so it's a one click thing of like how much money do i want to invest today and then uh they the best way to do it is to kind of set up a subscription where every month you're like cool i'm buying 200 of gold every month and 10 years from now it's going to be worth millions of dollars uh i think the same should happen with real estate there's a bunch of companies that are like cadra and um like fund rise or crowd street yeah whatever those are like but you have to look at the individual deals you have to they're targeted towards um people like me who like investing in real estate and who are sophisticated about it and want to know what what the cap rate is and the location and the year of construction and all this stuff um i think there should be a one click way to be able to go buy equity in rental properties that generate income and uh it should be marketed to um people in their 20s it should be marketed through facebook it should be set up so that every you basically log in and are like cool you want to invest in real estate how much do you want to invest every month 200 great 200 is now happening in real estate you're now investing 200 in real estate every month and boom it does an ach from your account every month um on the customer side and invest in that real estate and the income that gets generated goes back and reinvests in more real estate and that's it and so it shows uh this is how much you've invested so far and here's how much it's worth boom okay love it give me more what else you got uh what else do you got hey hey hey whoa whoa whoa what's going on here this is uh you're the you're the guest of honor here i got uh i'm doping ideas every week here i'll give you one that like i think is i'll give you one that i get asked a lot which is not actually what's a big idea but what's the easiest way to get to like a million dollars um and i always think that like the easiest way to get to a million dollars if i need to get to a million dollars right now here's here's what i would do i would um i would create an agency that's going to target a really specific part of a business that makes money already and just figure out how to make more of it so for example email marketing for uh e-commerce brands or conversion rate optimization cro for for companies so you basically say hey visitors come to your site we can help you convert more of that traffic into sales and i think there's such an easy play where you basically just create content so you create content that basically just says like here's the before and here's the after look i changed these three things because i call this my you know my hot cold hot method and um we boost the revenue by 32 percent by the way if you want somebody to boost your revenue by 32 percent work with me and i think that this is like a such a bootstrappable easy way to get to 100k a month in revenue right like you get 10 clients paying you 10k a month it is not hard to get 10 customers to pay you 10k a month when it's um a part of their business that's already going to produce like already producing hundreds of thousands or if not millions of dollars of revenue and you're going to provide you know the turnkey service so you take it off you take the headache off their plate but you do it better than they're doing it because you're you get seen as a thought leader by putting out like 10 of these case studies and this happens all the time with ad agencies um email agencies conversion rate optimization agencies but you can do this with anything you could do this with site speed you could do this with like any number of things so i would just go and you could start with start at zero and become a quote-unquote thought leader expert just by publishing like very simple before and after like kind of case studies um and you start by not even having a client you say hey if i was this brand here's what i would do look when they do this it sucks uh you know they this is a dead end for them or you know they should steal this good idea from this other company and so you could put together case studies without even having clients and so to me this is like the easiest like if you are willing to work hard and you feel stuck at a job that maybe pays you 100k a year and you're looking how do i go from 100k to 900k how do i go from 100k to you know 750k a year this is the like all it takes is hustle uh approach to that side of the type of business and then those businesses can be sold so like your job you can't be you can't sell your job right like if i write a book i might write that that might be the title you can't sell your job just like my one line case for why you should start a business instead of have a job and if you get a business like this to 900k and you know 60 profit you could sell that agency or that consulting business for maybe two or three times you know even uh and so you could sell that you could make 600 to 800k a year and then sell it for two or three million um you know after a couple years and so that's a very easy pathway to financial freedom easy meaning it's simple not not that it's no effort but easy that like anybody can do it and it doesn't take being the genius with the one idea who beats all the competitors in the space yeah i totally agree with that i think there's a bunch of other examples in my head like um just setting up a facebook pixel and doing it in a way that's actually optimized um and perfect and following all the facebook guidelines i think that's super hard and i think there should be some guy who's like i'm the expert at this right um and i take care of that for you and i gave a brand of e-commerce but like you can also do this for just hey every legal practice every dentist you need websites i make websites for dentists right so it doesn't even need to be like you're the best at doing growth for d2c brands it could be like hey in minneapolis minnesota i make the best websites for restaurants in minneapolis minnesota or legal practices whatever and just through cold email or you know some combination cold email linkedin referrals you can like get 10 customers to pay 10k a month yeah i think you could pick any of these um big sectors of the economy like accounting law medicine dental um be anything senior living and be like whatever you know yeah yeah and i'm just gonna go and build a online thing that um makes their life easier through marketing to them making it easy to make a website uh it's insane how many of those old world businesses are still like don't have a good website right don't do any google ads um so i think there's some stuff like opportunity our friend nick huber does this thing where he's like he basically has a playbook to make a self-storage unit run better and so his thing is like i'll buy it at some multiple but i know i can run it at 30 more efficiently or 40 more efficiently so i'm getting value i know within nine months i have a turnkey process to make this thing generate 30 40 more ebida and so he does that buying the properties but you could also just take that playbook and say hey self-storage owner i will do this for you i'll do it risk-free for you meaning you pay me nothing unless i deliver this outcome if i increased your revenue by 30 or your your net profit by 30 percent that would be you know that would be great right and here's my playbook i do these three things you would agree that you're not doing those three things today very well right okay fantastic how about i deliver those to you risk-free and when i do i get to keep you know half the value for the first year and then it drops down to 10 after that and you could do this for senior living you could do this for self-storage you could do this for any business that's like out there once you find a good like whatever best practice is this is what alex hermosi did with his gym launch thing he's like hey gym owner you want more customers like he used to own his own gym developed best practices and then realized the the value was not in his gym being run with best practices but taking the best practice and selling it to all gym owners and so that's what he that's what he did and i think you could do that with like pretty much any any niche business what do you think about niche content creators and kind of trying to build the same thing by creating content in a specific niche like um you know eco-friendly sustainable products that kind of thing so what would somebody do there so i'm a i'm a content creator what am i doing there in this example um making youtube videos instagram video instagram reels and tick tocks about um that content for the business to marketing to business owners as like hey business owner here's what you should do or to no not to business owners to consumers just being like this is how i live a sustainable lifestyle um kind of pick anything that you're passionate about and make a bunch of youtube videos about it or content about it and i think that can be a big business like you know doug de miro with cars right um see i i don't like those as much because i a i think it's a good thing to do because good things come of it i don't think they're very reliable at creating successful businesses most content creators don't make successful businesses right so if you just look empirically at the numbers you're just like okay of the two million twitch streamers and of the 10 million youtubers like who's making over 10k a year and the number is like astronomically small um and so you know the problem with those is that everybody wants to do that and there's not a clear way to like get the value out um it is good to do because you will learn you'll become good at content you'll meet cool people it'll lead you to the thing most likely but it's not usually directly the thing um when it's consumer facing if it's business facing i think it's pretty easy then to say oh yeah i market to the owners of self-storage units i create the best content for them you know you could go that's what nick charmer did right nick charmer's like hey i'm gonna write the best newsletter for a e-commerce store owner and i'm just gonna put together awesome information case studies deals whatever for them and like that's not for the consumer it's for the business owner and he created you know what what should be like a five to ten million dollar a year business when it's fully mature um doing just that and i think you could do that for basically the owner of any business construction businesses you know whatever any you know doctors lawyers whoever any any type business if you if you focus on that you you get good at doing that so i think that one i like i don't like the consumer facing one as much because i think the numbers would show that they don't make very much money the way that they currently do them and like you know i have this problem too where it's like um what's the most competitive thing is like being like a content creator like you know what what are most people doing from like you know even like a 12 year old can do it and i have this problem myself where i'm like oh i want to create a bunch of youtube content and then i'm like man this you know i'm competing with every 15 year old in america and they're better and faster and have more time and have nothing to lose and are willing to do way crazier stuff like wow that this might be the wrong game to compete in and i you know i'm still trying to square that for myself like is this the right game or the wrong game to even compete in um i could have said that about podcasts in general too right so like you know some of the best things i've done have been like in that category and it worked out just fine um but it does feel a little strange it's like against my own business advice to like don't compete in the thing that everybody is trying to do because most likely you know you're just playing game on the game on hard mode yeah the way i've seen it done well is like um there's this guy who's a realtor in l.a and um um you know small time realtor and he started making these youtube videos that were walking through mansions yeah i watch that guy he's great uh yeah and so he just like made 10 of them and were like was like this is fun and then he got access to more and more uh places and just made really high-end video walkthroughs of la mansions and you know his job was already to be a realtor so he was doing this as a way to get new clients in la and then um as he did it more and more it became a business of its own and he stopped being a realtor and now will fly around the world uh because people will be like i'm trying to sell this house make a video of it and i'll go make a video and a million people will watch it in three days because he's got so many youtube subscribers so i think where you're combining it with like a profession that you already have it probably is a good fit like there's some guy who's um smb acquisition attorney on uh twitter and so it's just a great way for him to get lead gen um yeah new customers well i also think like um i don't know if there's a good thing or bad thing but is that is that 30s age thing where it's like i used to think about a business and only look up like wow the skyscrapers are huge in this field i'm i too am going to build a skyscraper and now i'm like cool before i do that let me just go quickly look at the graveyard of people who have tried to do this and like when i was in my 20s there was no graveyard i didn't think about the graveyard i'm like music startup love it everybody loves music right like what could go wrong yeah and then when you're in your 30s you're like don't touch social network startup let's see yeah i did social networks for like seven years or six years uh of my 20s because it was like the skyscraper was so attractive and like there is some beauty of just doing that not even paying attention to the graveyard like i think the people who win will just do that and it'll work and their success formula was like yeah i didn't worry about the graveyard why would i do that um but as i got older i was like man you know what's more fun than trying to build a social network like winning is really fun and so like let me just make sure that whatever i'm doing like the odds are not like 99.9 chance of failure um like yeah that's because and if i'm gonna do it okay i'll go in eyes wide open i'm gonna look at the graveyard and say i'm still gonna do this that's kind of what happened with the podcast like you know what i'm still gonna do this even though i know that most podcasts nobody ever listens to um whereas before i did not even pay attention to that and i didn't you know but i don't know if that's a net positive might be a net negative actually in terms of like how uh you know the the the strength of that kind of like the ignorance yeah there's this guy bobby kodik who's the ceo of activision and um he's like i can be ceo of anything i could be ceo of a toilet company or ceo of campbell soup the thing that matters to him is success and momentum and you know there's so many people who are like you're the ceo of a games company that's what i my entire life would be made if i could just be that and he's just like success is what matters more than anything else and i'm kind of closer to that as i've gotten older where i'm like um success is the thing that brings me joy more than the specific category or product that i work on the thing that i think you've done um really well sean is you've seen friends who will have a successful business and you're like let me just clone this business in a different category like you know you did that with sam and um the hustle with milk road and then uh you saw an e-commerce business with ramon and the way that he was doing it and you're like i can do this too um so i think that's a really good way to to do it that's like kind of underrated uh and most people don't do where they're like i see this person is successful um i'm just going to do the exact same playbook but in a different product category or different sector yeah i call it having a blueprint like if i don't see that there is a blueprint of success in a category and that it is replicatable like okay i can look at how the guy started snapchat but if but that doesn't seem very like yeah i can't replicate that and so but when i saw in e-commerce or i saw oh the newsletter business i thought okay i'm not saying this is easy but i like i understand this this is simple enough for my dumb brain to get how a business like this works what is the cost what is the where's the revenue come from where does the growth come from got it um did they have some unfair advantage did they did they start at the right time and that there's now is like you know not the right time or whatever i try to just figure that out but if there's a and so now with new things i just look for that like first we're going to go searching for a blueprint i'm going to talk to people until i find a blueprint like okay i want to uh buy companies cool andrew wilkinson is a good blueprint what does he do how does it work and then do i want to like do i believe that i could replicate that in my own way in my own sector my own style um and if i don't see a blueprint i don't really get that excited at this point because i'm like why would i do it without a blueprint when i can do it with personally i'm like that or the same thing if i'm going to do it without a blueprint all right that's cool but i'm going to make the announcement hey i'm choosing to do this without the blueprint and i got to go in eyes wide open on that so like all of my rules i break all the time but i say them and i do them because i'm like i'm cool violating this rule but i just i'm not going to do it subconsciously i'm not going to do it blindly i'm going to do it knowingly and i'm going to make that trade you know knowing exactly what i'm trading off by making this decision versus uh you know how i you know used to do it where i didn't really understand i didn't even know what i was looking for um you know when it came to that i want to finish with some rapid fire can i do some some quick ones and then i just want you to say your reaction to this okay so i'm going to say this first category is things you've told me that i thought were funny and i want you to just like react or elaborate sort of like explain this tweet um i don't know what the hell mental models are i used to think i was dumb for not knowing what mental models are now i think everybody else is dumb for thinking about some version of that yeah that's right um in silicon valley it's so in vogue to be like oh i'm applying the you know this cognitive bias theorem to this situation um and you know everyone in silicon valley that's smart talks like that and so i was just like why do i when i see something i don't see it in that same way and i just thought i was an idiot um and i always solve a problem like from scratch like tabula rasa like it's the first time i've seen it and i just like that way of doing it so i gave up trying to find mental models um all right another one you started your first two businesses on what i'll call waves so like the facebook app platform i think launched the same day you like had quit your job and were like what can i do next let me just do this um you saw the announcement you're like i'll just do that i have nothing to lose um same thing with the mobile app store launch i think you were one of the first big iphone games um what are the waves today what would 22 year old suli be doing now uh probably something in genetics or um ai uh yeah probably one of those two things it's the biggest sectors okay what um you uh seven years ago we were at dinner and i was just asked you a question i was like why haven't you were like i want to build like a big company a billion dollar company i was like why haven't you done that already uh you you're so smart you're so great why like what's what's gone wrong and you said to me i don't think i understood what a billion dollar company was before what did that mean uh i think you need to have a certain moat and uh uh there's a bunch of things you need to get right to build a billion dollar company you need to have a big market you have a clear way of getting customers that um makes economic sense uh and you need um a product that's really good uh so i even today i feel like i've got a very clear path to be able to build you know 100 200 million dollar businesses but i haven't quite figured out how to build a billion dollar business outside of taking uh five or ten hundred two hundred million dollar businesses i think there's a different code to build a billion dollar business than a hundred million dollar one excellent uh what would you do if you were mr beast i would start a y combinator for creators and maximize the uh basically find uh the next kim kardashian the next mr beast and uh support them and own a piece of them and be a king maker where i'm making other kings um you did a lot of startup investing i think you've pulled back some from startup investing give me the uh the the bullet point version of your take on startup investing um i think startup investing uh i think competing for deals sucks i hate trying i find it very demeaning trying to convince somebody to let me invest fifty thousand dollars in their round uh friend of mine was raising money and got a term sheet from andreessen horowitz and bill gurley at benchmark and went with the andreessen horowitz term sheet and bill gurley was so mad that um he called the founder up and like yelled at them for two hours and sent them 15 angry emails and uh bill gurley is one of the most successful people in the industry and the fact that he still has to do that made me be like this is a industry with no moat i don't want to like have to go um kind of beg or try to twist people's arms to let me invest in their startup um the other thing that's happened is trying to turn um fifty thousand dollar investments into two million dollars over a 10-year period um doesn't really do anything for me anymore so my first startup investment ever was a hundred k investment a company called chart boost in 2011 or 2012 and then the company sold in 2021 and i made two million dollars so that was a 10-year time span um so i i think having to wait 10 years to get uh cash out is really annoying and makes me like it a lot less i think the valuations have also gone really crazy um and companies are so much more competitive like uh there's a company called divi home that raised at a billion dollar valuation and there's four other divi homes out there um that are competitors to it uh so the combination of high valuations and increased competition makes it really hard to make any money as an investor and i've evolved from being um interested in kind of making these 50k checks into trying to buy a majority interest or a 30 40 percent interest in businesses that have revenue and uh profit or a path to profit i think that's a better way to invest for me because i'll see money back and be able to take that money and reinvest it in other new businesses what's the biggest investment miss you've had and biggest hit you've had um biggest miss was uh coinbase my uh at tinyco we had this guy who worked for me named adam merber he was roommates with fred the um coinbase co-founder and so brian armstrong and fred um were fundraising for their series a they got a term sheet from andreessen horowitz and um benchmark and a bunch of other firms and so they called me and said hey should we go with benchmark should we go with andreessen horowitz uh you know we at tinyco raised money from andreessen horowitz mark and recent was on the board uh and uh i was like go with andreessen horowitz here's what's awesome about them and um on that call if i was like hey by the way can i put in 25k into this round uh i feel like they would have said yes and that 25k at their ipo was worth 200 million dollars i think it's probably did you not ask because you didn't believe or you didn't ask because you didn't think about it i didn't ask because i didn't believe actually that's the honest answer yeah crypto bitcoin these guys are building paypal for crypto and bitcoin that's silly that's just paypal um what about biggest hit biggest hit well let me ask you you wrote something on here you said could have invested in facebook stock i thought you i read something that you had bought after you sold your company that was on the facebook app platform you had bought facebook secondary shares did you do that or or am i missing that um i did this really stupid thing uh that i'm still embarrassed of to this day which is i uh signed a contract to buy some facebook stock like 150 000 worth and um the stock price you know it was private but in the private market the price went down by 50 percent and i called my father and was like oh you know if this happened to me and he was like don't worry about it just buy it and um you'll be fine it'll go back up and uh instead i didn't buy it um they i think they might have sued me and said hey you signed a contract to buy this and then i said okay fine i did and i paid them uh 75 000 to not buy it versus 150 to buy it yeah yeah i was 150 to buy it so i paid them 75k to not buy it and i was gonna go buy um some from somebody else who was selling it and um they backed out so i didn't end up buying it and then while i was uh buying it from the other guy somebody else came to me and was like hey um i've got facebook stock to sell too and so i hooked up a friend of mine with that facebook stock and he bought 50k worth of stock and that 50k ended up being worth like eight million dollars uh for him which is kind of amazing um and uh i was actually raising a fund to be like we're just gonna buy facebook yeah that's what i read i after we had very first met i was like who is this guy i googled you and i saw some article where you had sold your app on the your facebook app and you were like it was like what are you gonna do now and you're like actually i think facebook is the good investment not like my app and you're like i'm gonna just buy like millions of dollars of facebook stock if i can um and i was like wow this guy is super aggressive and interesting like i what a great in hindsight well this was now many years later so i was like you know wow that must have turned out amazing i didn't and i never asked you about it i never knew the full story yeah this was in 2008 during the great financial crisis so everyone was running away from everything and facebook was valued at two billion dollars in the private market at the time um and you know had an ipo and was unclear when it would ipo um was you know probably at a 100 or 200 million maus something along those lines um and actually i met this guy who's uh in new york city and was like hey i'm trying to buy this stock and he's like that's a brilliant idea and i was like yeah i'm trying to mac you know get the best price possible and he's like you idiot don't worry about what price you're getting just buy from everyone who's selling it go buy it because this price is so cheap that it doesn't matter matter don't worry about whether it's two billion or three billion or four billion just go buy it buy it all and uh i just kind of it up yeah easier said than done for sure when those moments happen uh it's happening right now in crypto it's like i know so many people that were like i missed it i wish i got in blah blah blah as it was going up crashes back down to you know eats at a thousand bitcoin was at 16 000 you know like a month ago and it's like hey you know if you did want to buy like now would be a pretty good time to buy probably and they're like ah i mean this thing is who knows now and they're the same people that three years from now are going to be like i wish i had bought again and they're still there's never going to buy they're just going to constantly sit on the side and wish that they were buying and never buy at the times they should and always wish they could buy at the times they shouldn't that's me right now because i've got like 40 million dollars or 50 million dollars in us t-bills that like mature every 30 days and um i'm keeping them on in like short-term t-bills because i'm like i'm gonna find some other investment whether that's the s p 500 or something else there will be other investments and now is the time to go buy them um the a couple months ago the s p 500 was at like 3600 and that was my trigger to go buy it and i was like ah it's gonna go to 3500 i'm gonna wait till 3500. it never hit 3500. i am still sitting on those t-bills did not buy s p 500.

yeah very very hard to do this sort of thing but like uh maybe this is where the mental model works the cognitive bias or the whatever whatever bias this is i got it uh you know there's someone out there who knows all these biases and they they're right i have all of them actually my father is really good at this in um you know i sold my first startup and made a million bucks in 2008. um he lived in florida and was like all the uh real estate prices here are at 25 cents on the dollar i'm gonna go buy it and so he bought a house i sent him the million dollars he went and bought a house for 150 000 two weeks later that same house was selling for 75 000 if it was me i this is literally what i did i would have freaked out and said fuck i don't know what i'm doing i'm gonna stop this is not working instead he bought another house for 75 000 and he just kept buying houses um like for the next two years uh all the way on the way down as the stock market as the real estate prices um bottomed out it kept going down and then even on the way back up as they were increasing he would just keep buying them and so as a result he owns or we as a family now on something like a hundred uh you know single family rentals in florida and what's the line there between degenerate gambler because i've done that too when i'm losing money and playing poker or blackjack or whatever what's the line between degenerate gambler and genius maybe there is no line maybe it's how the result turns out yeah i think it's the result but also it's the psychology going in where you're like i know this is going to go down i don't care because i i know i can wait five years or ten years and this will go back up right and he was like this is below replacement costs so if you were to build a new home right next door that was the same home cost you it would cost you four times as much as i'm paying for it right now so yeah amazing our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better you have a very honest linkedin and i saw a guy who i think one ups you and i actually want to tell you about this business in a second amazing so google this guy justin yoshimura so justin and then yoshi m-u-r-a so i want to read you this guy's linkedin he goes i'm currently the founder a founder chairman and ceo of csc holdings one of the dime a dozen quote unquote unicorn startups so already i'm like wow wow this guy unicorn startups time a dozen i'm trying i've been trying for 15 years to make a unicorn he's like these are dime a dozen and then he goes after being told that nobody would ever hire me i quit the bureaucracy and the negative negativity of palos verdes high school so already just like holding a grudge against his high school to start a marketplace for unlocked cell phones anybody who sells cell phones ringtones or any of that they're like the best they're great hustlers so already you know bonus points so he's got two points first making fun of the fact that he owns he's a ce of a unicorn second i dropped out of high school and sold unlocked cell phones he goes which was acquired by family office when i was 19 years old more recently i started 500 friends a marketing loyalty thing we merged with whoever and eventually acquired by whatever and then he goes i angel has 50k to 1 million in interesting companies run by interesting people that he names a bunch when he names the companies he names the round he invested in another another key thing that only real investors and honest people do um which is that they you know you know i invested in mux in the seed round i mess this one late stage right versus what most people do is they'll go buy you know airbnb shares in the public market and call themselves an investor in airbnb right it's like we know we know what you're doing here i've seen big venture funds do that too where they're like oh this is a hot company we want to invest in the secondary in the series d a couple million bucks just to be able to put on our website small amount at any valuation don't care i'm just buying a logo basically yeah um so then he goes besides besides business and things i shouldn't be discussing on linkedin i love animals dogs many cats especially persian himalayans dolphins whales he names like 10 animals manatees turtles then he goes despite this i'm not a vegetarian base mainly because i lack self-discipline however i do want to clarify i don't eat any of the animals above and i would judge you for doing so especially considering that the prevalent belief is that eating wild animals at wet markets is what caused covet where is this like where is this linkedin profile going and then he goes i've been included in many vanity lists such as forbes 30 to 30 inc 500 whatever yeah 40 under 40 but thankfully i stopped advertising these on my linkedin headline when i was 19 after realized i was being a douchebag for a formal bio go to my wikipedia so first just to digest this guy do you know have you ever heard of this company csc generation it's it's interesting so what he did was he started buying up all these like kind of antiquated furniture companies so it's this it's this kind of hush-hush thing but they own z gallery which like half my house is like from z gallery um he owns uh what are the ones here one king's lane he loan he owns surla uh la tabla so he's bought like surla tabla for 89 million z gallery for 20 million one king's lane and then he started making offers to buy i heard about him because um my our buddy i don't know if you know metab but metab uh sent me this link he goes this guy would be great for the pod and metab's like 100 signal to noise ratio if he sends me something a book i instantly buy it so this was like instantly just put it on the list do research on this guy so this guy's 32 years old he's built basically like a sort of like a billion-ish let's call it dollar company rolling these up and what he's doing is he's making them more like e-commerce and digitally like savvy uh so he'll close down half of the retail locations that aren't performing he'll get the e-commerce side to build up he'll take all the customer data that they have and he's like dude they they have like years of customer purchasing data but it's in a machine that's like 20 years old that they can't even like literally extract and like put it into an email database or like find that you know put it into facebook ads or anything like that so he's like we take this he's like we built a system to buy these companies and he's trying to build like what constellation software did for small sas companies he's trying to do that for large furniture companies he's like he's like that's my model they built a amazing intake engine to buy like 30 30 software companies a year and like unlock more value from them i'm trying to do the same with furniture companies and this guy gives like no interviews um he's just this one guy and the reason he's on people's radar now is because he started making these wild public offers at these old school furniture companies so he went to them privately he's like i'd like to buy your company and they're like you know they're in nebraska they're 65 years old they're like you know my father's father built this table in this furniture store like what are you talking about and he's here's this 32 year old kid who lives in la and they're like no we don't we don't want your kind here basically so they don't like his offer so he's like okay this is getting me nowhere so he just started releasing press releases saying i'd like to buy this company for 20 or 30 percent over the public you know share price right now please respond board uh you have not been productive you have not responded to my offer in private you have not told me a counter offer you've said neither yes nor no your shareholders deserve this um publicly so he's publicly making offers on these two public companies and that's how he's like now on people's radar because he was like pretty much doing this under the radar before this what do you think of this uh this guy this idea that's genius uh i love it because there's just so much unlocked value in these businesses and he's focused on a specific vertical furniture i have no idea why he's focused on that vertical but just that kind of focus will allow him to be able to take the same product seller across a lot of these different retailers get crazy improvements in margin by combining the scale of all of these and the idea of doing it going after publicly traded companies that are like undervalued so good and so he he said so they're doing they're doing over a little over a billion in revenue now out of their thing and he said he's targeting furniture because they're undervalued they lag um they're like kind of like uh they're sort of like lagging and they they who could benefit the most from like a digital glow up he's like it's these companies that are like basically not participating in the right way in like the digital world and the economy and e-commerce and whatnot and so um he goes a lot of these old school furniture companies have a ton of customer data it's an old physical server in their warehouse software's 30 40 years old the company that made the software's out of business you can't even like get them to update it he goes um i'm just trying to get it to be modern we've built a platform and a process to unlock the value of this customer data i'm always a a little a little uh skeptical of that type of claim but um he goes i have i have no desire to have my own brand um he goes constellation software has no brand they're just a 40 billion dollar company that goes 33 a year 10 years ago the stock price is 100 now it's 2000 they created a platform to buy these companies and unlock the value and tuck them in they have the infrastructure people and process they created a machine to unlock value in this category i don't think anybody's done that in retail that's what we want to become wow uh first of all i just love the tone with which he speaks and like the humility and is just kind of like this is what we're doing it's simple there's no magic to it um it's obvious in fact why isn't somebody else doing this okay nobody else is we'll do it and that's kind of amazing so i bring this up for two reasons one on the tone uh he reminds me of you your linkedin is the same way where you'll be like i invested this company kind of got it was kind of like a yelp for this ish i don't know i these guys can explain it better and like no no investor would write that on there or you'd be like yeah i kind of got acquired aqua hire ish i don't know good outcome for the guys you know okay for me um you're very honest with like your portfolio which i thought was good and unique nobody writes on linkedin like that linkedin is basically like you know it's like those dog shows it's not like owning a dog it's like those dog shows if you watched a dog show you'd be like is this what owning a dog is like and be like no that's nothing like what owning a dog is like um so i thought you'd like that you also when i started my e-com biz you sent me a one-line email i don't know if you remember this you go you go with my last business we realized that we just have to do this one thing differently than everybody then like the current status quo and it would work we didn't need magic it didn't need like 10 genius things we just needed we just had this one fundamental thing what's the one thing you're gonna do that's gonna make this work um and like you know that one question i was like spinning for like a week because i was like i don't know i don't have a good answer to this question does this mean my business is gonna fail uh but this is a great question and i stashed it in my great questions list i thought okay i need to find that for this business but also for every business going forward what is the one thing that needs to be true or like you know is true about this uh do you remember sending me that no not at all but i think uh that sounds like the sort of thing i would do it for some reason it reminds me of um my first company i started uh i started with a a friend of mine from college um and we sold the company and after we sold the company we got into a fight and uh he sent me this email that was like 50 reasons this company succeeded despite your existence and i was like ouch and so i went and read it and uh you know you go got to like 25 good reasons and then uh 26 he was like you get the gist and for a little while i've read that email um like every day for like the first year that i got it and then after that i read it um like kind of once a year every year to just be like what is it that he said and what was the truth to it um i don't know why it reminds me of that but uh that was such a great um great email great email there was some truth to it enough where i could kind of be like cool let me just take this feedback and action it in the future um and is also ironic in that um you know he uh he didn't he kind of gave up the startup game kind of shortly after that man you really broke him as a partner well he actually tried to do a couple other startups and then i think um and i think got into yc and did a yc funded startup um but i think it's you know startup game is a hard game and so he was just like this this game isn't for me after some number of years um and the other thing that's crazy actually is uh so you know i started that company then i started tiny co and we were raising our series a from andreessen horowitz and he found out and um he sent them an email saying you shouldn't let this guy uh you shouldn't invest in this guy call me and so they called him and you know he was like basically read that list of 50 things and uh you know it almost killed the kill the deal because they were like yeah we're worried about investing in this deal because of this um and uh it's funny because there's so many things that um um people uh there's so many things that people will like admonish privately but uh but kind of celebrate publicly like travis the uber ceo when he heard that some company some vc fund was investing in lyft he stopped what he was doing he drove down to that vc firm and said here are all the reasons you shouldn't invest in lyft right and that seems crazy uh but because he was successful brilliant and uh there were a couple other things with like mark pinkus and zynga where he did the same thing so um it was just a funny experience going through that with him and uh kind of andreessen horowitz series a and uh it's funny now because somehow uh 10 years later we're uh great friends again and uh you know he got married and i was like the best man at his wedding which is all right happy ending to this you um you also have been talking about this kind of like buy a public company thing so because i'm like yo what's next for you what do you what's the next big swing what are you excited to do and uh you've talked about this so let's let's go into some of those that idea because i don't think most people in the startup game think or talk about going and buying a public company or or you know sort of a hostile takeover or what have you uh what's the idea here and why might you do it um yes i've been kind of trying to figure out what to do next i think after tinyco i was like wow startups are hard i'm gonna try to take it easy and uh now got into a place where i'm like cool let's do something big again um and starting a new company from scratch is really hard so i've just been like is there a public company that i can acquire um where i don't go through that zero to one phase that everybody loves but is really difficult and go to a place where something's already at a five or ten and uh can i then take that and scale it as an as a way of uh kind of running a business um so to me the perfect business out there to acquire is this company that was that's this is number one on my list is a company that was a three billion dollar that's currently a three billion dollar company but in the private market was ten billion dollars so it was worth ten billion dollars before and now as a public company it's worth three billion dollars uh the company is squarespace squarespace ad i feel like every the only time i ever hear squarespace is in their ads now yeah squarespace spends uh so much money on these like podcast ads and uh you hear about them everywhere on podcasts or um places that you wouldn't really you don't see companies doing like direct response advertising like i never see them on facebook but i always hear about them on podcasts which i think is super weird and so the stock is down you know 50 since the ipo they're at this like kind of 900 million revenue run rate now uh it's a subscription business with more than 4 million subscribers um i'd love to buy it because i think it's a great company that's super undervalued uh it's not being run to maximize profits so it's being run in a way that um keeps it at break even so i think you could run it to maximize profits get rid of those podcast ads focus on direct response uh facebook ads to get new customers so where's the fat in their and their spending they do a ton of like uh uh non-direct response ads that are like tv ads or podcast ads that i think are great to have this like halo effect around the brand but i don't think those are the optimal way to maximize return on ad spend right and so they do i think 300 or 400 million of marketing spend so that's one you could make that more efficient or cut that down where what is the the other is it like like you know like elon buys twitter he fires half the staff type of thing there's like a huge head count or what else is like uh fat in their system yeah i think they've got a ton more people than they need and their head count costs are like 225 million a year and their headquarters in is in new york city and i think you could just cut that team materially and um you know get rid of the new york city headquarters because it's super expensive to be there yeah sam was talking about i remember back in the day like uh one of the earliest podcasts talk about casper and he's like casper you know how i knew casper was going to fail they had like 150 employees in new york and it's like why are you why are you hiring all these people in new york you don't need these people should be sitting in like you know south carolina omaha and like you know these other places like why is your customer support you know somebody making you know all this money in in new york he's like that's the first thing you got to do is just get rid of new york and he was like so adamant about it that's like his number one rant and this is at a time when casper was still like seen as like kind of like one of the like rising stars like now i think casper's just kind of taking a beating in the market and all that stuff um i think might have gone private again um because yeah casper went private couldn't last publicly i guess but uh but i remember that was his like number one thing he's like uh say no more i don't need to read the pnl uh i just saw how many employees work in new york i could tell you this business is mismanaged from day one there's this great carl icon story where he buys a business uh that makes like um subway cars and uh they've got a huge team in new york and a team somewhere in middle america and he goes to the team in new york and is like there's three floors of them in some fancy midtown building and he's like so what do you guys do and uh you know they show him all these presentations for two days and he's like okay i saw the presentation so what do you guys do and they're like we just told you and so there he's like all right let me go visit the guy who runs the middle america thing that actually makes the railroad cars and so he goes to visit them and he hangs out with the guy and the guy's super charming and at the end of the day he's like so uh you know there are these guys in new york what do they do for you uh do you need them and he's like no those guys don't do anything in fact i got four guys that are just there to manage those guys and all the questions that they bother us with firewall yeah if you get rid of those guys i uh think the business will continue to grow and uh we'll be fine and so the next day he goes back to new york and fires three floors of people it's like that scene in entourage where ari gold just walks in with the paintball gun and just starts blasting everybody that's basically like the the new york uh the new york firing by carl icon yeah he tells this story with such a smile and um actually he tells it as like this was pretty early in my career uh so it took me like a couple months to do this if it was now i would buy the company and fire them like the next week and so how would how does somebody actually do this how do you go buy a three billion dollar company because you're rich but you're not three billion dollars to spend on a company rich so how does somebody do this yeah um i think three billion the three billion dollar thing is probably too much for my uh you know personal balance sheet but the way you would go around about it is just like the guy at csc generation is doing which is um make a public offer it's the same way elon musk did it uh you first make a private offer then you make a public offer you um make sure that all your financing is lined up when you do the public offer and you know the way that u.s stock market works and um shareholder rights laws work is uh board has to respond to that offer and they have to have a really good reason to not take it if it's if it's at a material premium to the current stock price um otherwise they're gonna get sued out the wazoo by shareholders right um and so yeah that's kind of how you do it okay so that's that's one way you um let's do some of the other things let's do so that's from big idea to fun smaller ideas so you uh you were telling me something like you helped your buddy i don't know high school friend or college friend or something like this sell their dental practice what uh tell us teach me about that i don't know anything about that yeah uh this was a chance for me to be a deal doula so this uh friend of mine called me and was like hey i got a quick question for you um somebody i i started this dental practice you know 10 years ago somebody um came in to make an offer should i take it and you know i thought it was going to be one phone call it ended up being like 60 hours of work with a bunch of phone calls with him and and the buyers of the business um and it was super cool to see the inside of a dental practice and how uh the p l looks and how a company gets acquired like that so he has a dental practice that's massively profitable that he runs in a way where he's optimizing for his lifestyle so he does seven figures in ebida has a 50 net margin all while working three days a week and uh i was just like oh my god he's working three days what is he doing the other days he is making up new hobbies that uh he's getting excited about like uh he's never gone fishing before and he's like i got all this time to kill because i don't have i bought all this gear now i have to learn this hobby yeah so he'll go find a new hobby and like buy the gear find somebody in town who uh is good at that hobby and go with them so actually i hung out with him um recently and he's like let's go fishing i was like when did you take up fishing he's like i got so much time so he works three days a week and uh he's not optimizing the business for ebida he has a big waiting list of patients who uh want to become patients but he doesn't have the time to see them he has one dentist that works for him and a bunch of dental hygienists but none of that is being done in a way where he's like optimizing for revenue or profit just optimizing for his quality of life so this private equity firm um is doing a roll-up of all of these dentists in that area and it's super interesting how the um private equity so they've got a company that's going around and doing this roll-up of dental practices the company is um run has a ceo which is a dentist super nice guy uh super well known in the area and admired by admired and liked by all of the other dentists in the area so he's kind of like the figurehead of the company good cop good cop then uh they've got a coo who is this um hardened guy who's bought tons of businesses and worked for a bunch of private equity firms and is an experienced acquirer and you don't even like talking to him after you know five minutes and he's the bad cop so good cop and bad cop go in and you know good cop does all the charming saying this is going to be a great acquisition look at how it's turned out for me bad cop um does all of the numbers and negotiating so they bought this business and uh they bought it with a really simple premise they bought it for a 7x ebitda multiple and they're like we're going to go buy all the dentists in this area that we can and we'll sell it at a 15x ebitda multiple because we'll get to a scale of you know 20 30 million in ebitda that's just the valuation arbitrage right which is basically that small ebitda businesses like let's say you're doing a million or two million they'll sell for 7x but if you had 20 million of ebitda in a business it'll get acquired by a larger institution it's an easier buy button to buy 20 million a year of ebitda for 15x that's that's and so all you have to do is kind of like accumulate roll up and and put this together to get to that next stage of buyer yeah exactly right so that's one aspect and then the other aspect is they were like there's all these things that we can do to increase revenue for this guy's business one we're going to add another dentist eliminate the waiting list anyone wants to see a dentist they're going to be able to see a dentist within a week they added another dental hygienist chair so the dental hygienist chair costs like ten thousand dollars and um my buddy uh just didn't go buy one and uh kind of put a dental hygienist there to increase dental hygiene revenue um they even told him that uh there's all these things they can do to maximize to increase the amount of money they get from insurance companies so they were like there's this one instrument whenever you're doing a cleaning just pick this instrument up you don't even have to put it inside the mouth of the patient just pick it up for a second and then put it back down and then you can claim at this higher insurance code and we're going to generate more revenue so he called me and was like you know is this moral or is this immoral like can i go back to these guys and say hey i don't want to do this this doesn't seem right he said as he's holding the tool up for 45 minutes just to see what happens that's right uh and then because they bought all these other dental practices in the area they're able to take one dental practice and say oh um you need braces or you need a root canal or you need whatever uh oral surgery procedure we're going to refer you out to somebody and so they used to he used to refer to people who are just kind of third parties and now he gets to refer to people that are in the network already owned by the private equity firm nice yeah okay that's great so you see that machine and you're like wow this is amazing uh what's your kind of like big takeaway from that experience because i think most people wouldn't take the time to go do that uh you did and i think you probably got something out of it what what was your big takeaways uh well i thought it was amazing that was a win for the private equity firm and just being able to see the roll-up strategy and how good it was for them up front was awesome i also got to see it from his perspective and from his perspective it was also a huge win it was an easy transaction he didn't shop it around um it was a way for him to retire and become the richest person that he knows he owned the real estate of the dental practice so he got to keep the real estate and now the acquirer pays him rent every month for the real estate that he owns and uh now he gets to go because he was working three days a week which is a lot he now gets to uh take month-long vacations to europe or africa or wherever he wants to go for fun with his whole family yeah that's amazing i also like the i'm the richest guy i know i think that's a funny thing that actually does happen in a bunch of like especially smaller towns and uh like niche things it's like if you can make eight million dollars or something like that you are you you know you're done like you don't need any more and you you feel like there's a beauty in that like if you're in silicon valley you could build a billion dollar business and like you might not get invited to the big boy table still uh right because it's just like everybody knows 50 people that are more successful younger smarter and uh you know more ambitious than them and so there's this never-ending you know like race that you're on if you're in silicon valley new york la and that's just not true in these other places and i think there's some there's something great about that yeah it's amazing the only way to win the rat race is to opt out of the rat race and uh he has opted out and uh has thereby won the rat race and it's so funny to compare my life to his because um i spend so much more time working and uh uh you know have made a bunch of money so that maybe i don't need to work as hard or at all uh and yet i continue to work and he's like i'm chilling and uh you've thought about that or no it's like just not your nature um i have one of my goals for 2023 is to like take it a lot easier work-wise and spend a lot more time uh doing as many fun things as possible like i'm in la right now they have this thing called the porsche driving experience uh so you go and go with a bunch of friends uh they've got porsches and a racetrack and you get in a porsche and just drive it around the racetrack as fast as you can without killing yourself we you know when we got back from the weekend getaway that we did i gave a debrief and i talked about this one observation i had which was that at that thing there was p we met people or we were hanging out with people that were like four or five different life phases so there was like um you know uh you know victor and judy basically like you know 12 year olds and their mindset was like yo wake up it's time to play like they literally woke us up with a boom box by the window just playing like you know tiesto or something like that and they're like come on the pool's already warm and then we can go to the sauna then we can play golf then we can play with fall we can play this play that like they were just and like from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep they were like let's play so that was like the you know 12 year olds and then it was like the 20 year olds we met that came over that night that were basically like building the nft projects or doing the like tick tock in the tick tock ddc brand that was just taken off and they were like i don't know how to describe but they were kind of like in that hustle of like they kind of thought they had it all figured out but they don't but they don't realize that yet but that lets them do some cool because they don't know what they don't know yet so they were just like young stallions like just you know full of exuberance and didn't understand where the limitations were what the drawbacks were but that's okay they'll run head first into that wall when it comes but they're having a good time doing it and then there was like me ben like we're like in our 30s and it's like you know the 30 year olds were sort of like okay i'm i'm you know i still have enough energy to do things but i'm not dumb enough to just do them blindly i don't have that that great ignorance yet i really like kind of overanalyze things almost and so the whole time we were like trying to think through our next project trying to like sit down and map it out and pros and cons and all this stuff and um and then there was you guys who were in your 40s and you were like yeah uh you're like ramon yeah yeah you're like oh ramon's like throwing out his back playing pickleball and like you know you guys were basically some combination of like let's have fun like let's go surfing let's play sports like yo seize the day i don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to do all this stuff constantly like i'm doing it and you know like i guess like there was like an element of like you know yeah business stuff is cool but like life is a lot cooler than business um where the 30 year olds and the 20 year olds were like no winning and business is a lot cooler than life um yeah and like i remember just continually trying to be like hey guys all right you guys want to just sit down and just whiteboard for a minute and it was like you know just sort of like i was feeling this urge to do that and i feel you guys were this urge to like the sun is out let's go outdoors and like but let's wear our sunscreen because like we don't want to die like it's like this element of like i want to live and i don't want to die that's where you guys were at and then we hung out with like a 70 year old guy and he was just sort of like oh you know i want some action i'm bored i want some action and like you know um i want to contribute i want to give back and like that was like a big focus and like uh you know it's just fun to have like this energy around me so that was kind of one observation i had you know hey is that is that accurate as far as you read it or am i making stuff up here yeah it's super accurate uh ramon and i were like it's saturday night and we have a bunch of entrepreneurs who are just like trying to sell us on their business and just like get themselves excited and meet people on network and me and ramon were like it's nine o'clock i think it's time to go to bed and these guys are like no let's stay up till 2 a.m let's talk about business ideas let's start a new business tomorrow oh my god this guy is selling mini katanas on the internet through youtube and tick tock wow uh so it was a real funny thing and then you know you and ben were like let's talk about new business ideas here's a new business idea what do you think what do you think what do you think oh what about this what about this and ramon and i are like how about we jump in the pool yeah like just take an ice bath yeah so it is funny to see these different seasons of life and um yeah i'm trying to kind of adjust to this new season and uh for example now on saturdays and sundays i try not to touch my laptop at all and be outdoors and with friends as much as possible well it's hard to make that shift in that season i mean even at the beginning of this podcast like i'm gonna buy a public company and take it to the moon and then it's like actually i'm gonna like enjoy life and like you know whatever you know do family things and things like that it's it's it's hard to even be congruent in a one-hour podcast with like you know a a kind of like direction um so you know i think that's that's i've observed that amongst many many people it's like very hard it's very hard to stay congruent uh i noticed this about myself like i'll be like oh i love this content podcast thing this is great i think i could be the best at this and then and then i get all this positive feedback where it's happening and it's like growing and people like it and then i'm like yeah but should i start this business doing this b2b thing and then it's like wait what happened to the whole like i want to do this content thing it's like i don't know like i just it's hard to be congruent and and it's very easy to get distracted and get off kind of like mission when you're used to doing one thing and you know you can always go back to that well and do it and there's this new thing that you think might be the right thing for you but is different and maybe a little unfamiliar a little less familiar i met this guy who uh started a company called solo stove and sold it um and it then later went public uh named spencer and um he was like i started this company i worked really hard i sold it now i made mega bucks and uh i'm good i'm financially independent i um he doesn't invest in any startups he doesn't invest in any private equity funds or vc funds he's like when people are like do you want to invest in this that the other thing he's like no i'm good he takes all of his money and puts it in the stock market in the vanguard voo the vanguard s p 500 index doesn't think about it at all and uh he says that everyone else who uh is like this is an entrepreneur starts a company makes it and then goes back and starts another company they're only starting another company because that's the only thing they know yeah and he's like they just keep building a new prison for themselves that's bigger and brighter but it's still a prison and uh why would you do that and so i had this call with him and then for a week after that i was just like walking in circles uh like muttering to myself what am i doing with my life what what am i doing why am i starting new businesses what is all of this um so it's really interesting to see people on the other end of the spectrum i think i told you that once when we i remember we're at uh some park in san francisco and you were telling me about your new thing and it was working great and i was like i was like that's i was like that's great and i'm like uh i admire that you do this with such ease it's like watching steph curry shoot three pointers like wow you just can start a business and it just works like this that that what happened to all the hard gritty stuff that i feel all the time like you're just doing it that's amazing uh but then i also told you i was like i feel like you're playing the same level of the video game again and like you know you kind of beat this level like shouldn't you just like go to the next level uh i don't know what that level even is i don't even know what that means maybe it's not even business um but like you know i said that and i felt like a real dick afterwards i was like that was a stupid thing to say i remember like feeling like you know that i was i first felt really bad i was like that was just kind of like a i don't know like that probably didn't feel good to say that or to hear that and then i was like also like i was like well do i believe it and like you know what i want a friend to tell me that if they felt that about something i was doing and i was like yeah i think i would and i was like i think he doesn't take that stuff seriously so you know that's no problem um but you know like i've felt that and i've felt seen that now in many people the same like build a prison of your own making and like you said the only people who win are the ones who sort of opt out of the rat race and it's really jarring when you see that and you're like wait what you're leaving but you could do we're still here and they're like yeah we're still here and they're like yeah that's great um i'm gonna go wander over here and i'm like oh my god you can leave this room like i didn't know that was possible it's like it is honestly very jarring when you meet the like one out of 100 people in silica valley who do that yeah it is uh stunning that people do that and um it's so interesting uh when you meet people who do that and like what they choose to do with their time like you were telling me about that braintree guy who's like i'm trying to maximize my life i'm trying to reverse my biological age yeah yeah and so i change my diet i've got like a team of doctors uh nutritionists physical therapists trainers and i'm reversing my age um and that's what he's doing with his time and energy and money it's super interesting to hear when people yeah the thing i've seen now have this thought which is that um my life is actually limited by my imagination and uh growing up i always assumed it was limited by you know money or resources and now i realize my life is just limited by my imagination and uh one of the things that made me do is i'm trying to hire a chief fun officer my definition of fun is often like let's work and let's grind it out i'm trying to hire somebody who's the exact opposite of me to be like no that's lame uh here's like five more fun things you could be doing right now go do those instead and i will literally close my laptop and just go do one of those five things in response to that that's amazing if you uh that thing you just said that my life is limited by my imagination i think that's probably like i don't know how many minutes into the podcast video but that's a that's like a golden nugget right there like that's something i'm gonna think about a lot what uh say more about that like either how you thought of that or what's an example of that yeah um you know it's funny because i'm uh living with my brother right now and the two of us wake up and we're like it's monday morning let's go let's grind it out let's go let's win the ball game and um yesterday we like played paddle tennis for four hours until our limbs fell off and that was way more fun than whatever work we're going to do today um and so i just want somebody to uh like i don't spend it i spend all this time being like actually what's happened for me is as i've seen more businesses and gotten older and more experience i feel like this is a little bit of a hyperbole but i feel like neo in the matrix where you show me a business and i can like see through it and actually see the fundamentals of the business and have an opinion about whether it's a good business or not or i see opportunities where i'm like there's a hundred million dollar business here and it's just a matter of like doing the work and executing it and it could be a real business um so i spend my so much of my brain power thinking about that stuff and very little of my brain power thinking about how to have fun and like other cool things that people do in life i spend a ton of time reading the wall street journal and talking entrepreneurs but very little time talking to uh instagram influencers or just people who are like balling out and having a great life um and so i just want to spend more of my time and energy imagining fun things to do like i love magic i would love to have a magician show up randomly in my week um like while i'm at a restaurant a magician shows up and is like hey everybody i got a magic trick for you and then does the magic trick at the table i a friend of mine told me that him and a bunch of guy friends would go to vegas every year and one year um this guy was in charge of planning it and he hired um like five little people in uh tuxedos to follow them around and then a bunch of um like the brazilian carnival dancers to follow them around the whole weekend and so everywhere they went everyone was like who are these guys they got into every club they got free drinks they got to all these people coming up to them and uh they had a dope weekend as a result and you know lots of people just go to vegas and like go to the hotel and gamble and these guys just through their imagination had a better way of doing it yeah amazing um all right this has been good uh where do people find you you're you started tweeting so so shout out your your handle and then we can wrap it up yeah uh my goal is to get to 100 000 twitter followers by the end of the year so i'm going to be tweeting a bunch more uh my twitter handle is my full name uh s-u-l-e-m-a-n-a-l-i yeah sulaiman ali all right great thanks for coming on man you bet thanks sean you you
