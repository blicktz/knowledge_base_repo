so martin scrella if you just google most hated man in america i think he comes up as number one at least he did at the time when i first heard about him he is known for or he's known and hated for uh being a kind of a price gouger with a drug so what he did was he owned a pharmaceutical company that focused on like small like less popular drugs that were like niche and he would and he bought them so he bought this drug this drug called daraprim and he increased the price from like 13 to like 500 something dollars i don't know what it was but the percent was like he increased it by 5 000 percent and so people and then immediately the news picked this up was like oh man and they started calling him the pharma bro because first he did this they were like how dare you but instead of apologizing and walking it back he was like fuck yeah i did i own this i could charge what i want you know like and and like this is america that's the price of this drug and yeah he doubled down he doubled down and he loves attention and he's amazing at getting attention a lot of the attention is hate but he's amazing at getting it but and he was only 33 34 when he did this and this was basically he controlled two pharmaceutical companies that were each public at north of a billion in market cap i think i don't know i don't know i can't i can't confirm those that might be right but he also had a hedge fund before that where he invested in biotech stocks yeah just like he had done big things and he's a very smart guy uh now people think he's a crook they thought so some people said he was a crook because he raised the price of the drug that's not a crime that's just something you don't like then he actually got indicted and went to jail for doing something that was uh legal which i think was like he basically paid investors from one company with like the stock of his other company and then like didn't wasn't clear or something like that i don't know exactly what he went to jail for but anyway i've been in jail for two years he went back he went back to jail or his like like he didn't get released early or something like that for threatening hillary clinton he didn't really threaten her but he like made like a like a stupid joke on twitter yeah uh yeah anyway so he just got out last week that's kind of the the funny part of this so he gets out and uh it's like you know i don't know who's like a famous person like everybody wanted to be freed it's like a free young thug or who like martha martha stewart yeah free martha like whatever there was a group of people that were excited about his his arrival i was excited too because i enjoy reality tv i enjoy you know the drama he's like our version of kim he's he's our kim k he's that's exactly what he is exactly so i wanted to see a plow and so he comes back and i just started thinking about shrelly in general so i have a couple ways we can go we can go of things i find very interesting slash borderline admire about the way he does things and then there's what he has been up to in prison and what's interesting there where do you want to go i have both i like both of those so what has he been up up to in prison and the backstory you you actually need to mention this the backstory was he was an early user of your product blab and i spoke to him a couple times on blab and when the hustle first launched we were in our first office so this was in the first six months we um one of our reporters was this young woman named brina who was you know like a pretty uh like a good looking woman and he she dm'd him for a story and he was like hey do you just want to like fly up here and we could like hang out and like he was like asking her out and uh so i had i have a little interaction with them as well so we yeah we had an app called blab that was basically if you've seen clubhouse it was clubhouse before clubhouse and it had video on it um so it wasn't just audio and uh it got sort of popular except you know we tried using it we tried getting podcasters to use it we we got some kind of like marketers to use it for their kind of like promoting their stuff then we started getting some bigger brands the nba started using it ufc started using it oracle but none of them could hold a candle to our number one power user martin shkreli martin shkreli came on the app and basically broke the app from day one the first time he came on instantly the room filled up to like 5 000 people and it was more people than we had ever had in one room before that it hit our max limit we're like who is this guy that's when i first googled and found he's the most hated man in america and um he was famous enough to draw a ton of people in but he was not famous enough to have other shit to do which was the perfect sweet spot which as i said he is the most lethal weapon in social media uh he has since been surpassed by donald trump and elon musk as the most lethal weapon in social media but before that it was martin shkreli and the reason i say that is because um he creates a ton of content so he would go on blab every day from about 5 p.m till 2 in the morning he would be on that whole time um and he was the master at creating nightly entertainment like you know jimmy fallon jay leno you guys can't touch this guy in terms of nightly entertainment because he has no producers no script no nothing he would hop on and somehow or another he would cause enough ruckus that this room would have thousands of people in it all night long watching it like we were hooked to it and we would see this in our data like people wanted us to kick him off because again he's a bad guy for raising the price of this drug and like he said this thing that wasn't cool but this guy was driving in hundreds of thousands of new users to us every single month and so i was like i'm not trying to kick this guy off like this guy's like you know he's where the action's at um this was uh 2017 2018 cancel culture wasn't a thing yet yeah and i was like dude i'm a startup i'm gonna do what it takes to get off the ground like yeah bitcoin used the silk road to like get off the ground and like you know youtube started as a dating site and facebook you know before this he did face mash comparing like which girl's hotter like okay not everything starts with like the most like clean cut you know thing airbnb started by like faking and scraping you know craigslist sites and you know emailing them as fake people saying i'd love to book your thing can you just list on airbnb like dude people do what they have to do to get your project started started and so we had shrilly and i used to watch it at first what i noticed was everybody who came in came in to throw stones at this evil man who raised the price of this drug but he did not sit there and apologize or whimper he like fought back and he would give his side of the argument he would invite you up for a debate and that's when you saw how how strongly held opinions could be with no logical backing with no real rationale behind it the argument was so hollow and this was not just like average people uh people who were like very successful business people would come on trying to like kind of um stand on their high you know be on their high horse uh you know uh telling him what he should do and then he would like dismantle their argument journalists from cnn and other places would come on he would dismantle them um and he's doing a combination of like a making fun of them b hitting on them and c breaking down their logical arguments all at the same time i've never seen anything like it and i just thought wow this guy is very entertaining i don't agree with everything he's saying but i think he's very entertaining and the data doesn't lie he is very entertaining he he's and i think later on later on in some of the blabs he would have like these like cute women in the background and they like clearly i just met him on blab and he was just like hey i'll fly you out you want to hang out this is what started happening every started off hating him so after about three weeks he developed an army of believers of people who were there's a guy who became creeps yeah the creeps and so this guy came on his name was young shkreli and when martin was tired or had to go eat young shkreli would go hold court and he would just be like an extreme knockoff version of martin and he would just hold court defending him until martin came back to defend himself and then all these women started joining and they loved him and they would just hang out there all the time and they were like when they were not like cam girls or model they were like actual models fashion models cam girls only fans people whoever and they would get on and they would just be like you know martin it's like i don't know i would date you and they would just get on they were so the room was always filled with like his posse and it was like you go to like you know where a mob lord is at and he's got his goons and he had his goons dude and his army was just growing but within a couple months the number of people who loved him outweighed the number of people who hated him and it was like the most surprising thing it was like watching a cult form in real time it was fascinating and um i remember the cnn journalist came on and she was like martin i you know i know everybody kind of you know attacks you but i don't want to attack you i just want to ask you some questions he's like well you're on my show let's go she's like no no i want you to come on cnn he's like this is better than cnn he's like you're on my show you have questions let's go this these are my terms you can ask any question you want no holds barred right here right now and if you're not prepared come back and prepare but you could do it right here on my show and she's like i'm not going to do that martin i can only do it there he's like and he's like he's like all right fine come with me to my fundraiser gala tonight i'll fly you out he bought he goes he screen shares he buys her a plane ticket and like he's like what's your email address i'm sending this to you and she's like i'm not going on a date with you martin and he's like who said it's a date uh he's like you know he's just playing people perfectly and say didn't didn't they didn't she end up quitting one of the one of the women who hollered at him from washington post ended up quitting the job and so this is part of what's remarkable when he goes to jail this woman from washbow or someplace is assigned to cover him and or cover the story falls in love with him breaks up like she has a family she has a husband kids i think leaves them for martin falls in love with martin while he's in prison and then martin breaks her heart and she's heartbroken now and like you know whatever she gave it all up she gave up her career and her family for martin and fell in love with him this guy's got some cult leader shit to him so anyways he did some crazy stuff when he was on blab like he would he was so loyal to his army that he'd be like i'm i got a date tonight but don't worry i'm leaving blab on so he would leave it on in the other room and you could eavesdrop and overhear his date which is again oh my god prime time entertainment is it wrong yeah is it entertaining yeah it is and so this guy was phenomenal anyway so i found this guy interesting he would also do things so like from a marketing perspective i was observing how is this guy staying relevant like that drug shit was years ago like what how is he staying relevant he would just do stuff so like wu-tang clan had an album that they were selling like a one of one for their biggest fans he bought it for two million dollars and so now this guy that they didn't want so they even got in a feud with him he had this thing and then on blab he would play like snippets like 10 seconds of the album and no one's ever heard it before besides him but he would just like tease it dangle it um like the original nft when um there was like some building for sale in time square he tried to buy it for 10 million dollars to like erect a statue of himself in time square and again it gets covered so he was just news jacking constantly he was just hijacking the news and putting his own name for money did he have money when he got arrested or like because i i think he was actually like he he showed a brokerage account that had like 70 million dollars in it yeah i think he had like somewhere between 50 and 75 million dollars if i remember at the time but then he like had to declare bankruptcy yeah and i think at one point ironically his attorney that was defending him raised his price by five thousand percent and started charging him sixty thousand dollars per hour and like i don't know if this is real or not but martin came out in the news was like this is outrageous and like people were like dude the irony you know pot counting the kettle black i was like of course this is just another article he wanted written about him and like he's just a master of getting attention he did so many things like this i can't even count the number of things he did like this and i was like wow this guy just knows how to stay in the cycle and like constantly like reinvent himself because then he would like just when he pushes you away he'd lure you back in so like for example on saturday friday nights he would hold like you know his nightly blab thing where he's at thousands of people and it's like a roast session and he's saying outlandish shit and like you just feel yucky for being in there and then saturday morning he would wake up at eight in the morning and he would do a live finance like session where he would teach you how to analyze stocks and they were great phenomenal and i watched a bunch of them they're still on youtube you can go watch them he is so he's very smart and he was so thoughtful and patient as a teacher he's a he's a fantastic teacher and so anyway so that's like the backstory so anyways he gets out and he said they're like how's prison right he immediately he gets out he immediately jumps on um on twitter spaces oh by the way actually that's another funny story when he had to go speak in front of congress or the i don't know yeah congress i guess he had to go testify um he goes there and he just with a smug look kept saying like i i will take the fifth you know i choose to elect my my fifth amendment well rights to not speak he just said that on loop for an hour but he was but smile he was smugly smiling and just pissing them off and he was drawing the whole time and then he gets as soon as he left the courtroom he jumped on blab from his phone on the train and he goes all right who wants to see my drawings he shows his drawings of like dicks and stuff like that that he was drawing on his piece of paper and he's live the hearing was still going on and he embedded it in one screen and he was just talking mad shit about the congress people in the other screen at the same time again it was just like high level social media usage so anyways he got on twitter spaces and they're like how was prison he goes oh it was awesome he's like he's talking about the prison system and like how unjust it is how you know he's like you know 95 of the people that were in there um you had like traumatic childhood issues with parents and stuff like that he's like i hustled out like other people's lockers you know where i so i could store more books and um and he's like he basically was like so what was his like summary so so first he's been blogging have you read his blog from prison no but what did he say about prison he was he i mean i bet you he was actually well respected there yeah he's like because everyone's like tell me some stories yeah exactly um and so he yeah he was kind of like you know had his his crew there or whatever he said he created um a crypto study group um so he what did he say he goes um he goes when everybody else was working out in prison i would read because brain gains are all that matters not muscle gains because he's like real scrawny oh my god he's like i created a group called crypto thugs in prison and it was just me teaching crypto to um to the rest of my like my fellow like inmates or whatever and he had a bunch of like interesting stuff so um he had a bunch of predictions about crypto that were in there a bunch of he read he basically spent his whole time studying about crypto and artificial intelligence um and like biohacking and stuff like that so he's got this blog post with a shit ton of predictions about the future um i'll read you a couple of his i'm on i'm on his blog it's just it's martinsquarelli.com right uh yeah i think so so um i'm gonna read you some predictions on here so 2025 so about three years from now uh self-driving cars are the successor to mobile computing they trend upwards people spend eight hours a day in your car um tesla nears 10 trillion dollar market cap must becomes the first trillionaire 2026 an ai generated maybe gpt4 song gets created with zero human editing a direct participation and charts on billboard uh 2030 2030 um virtual reality slash metaverse is ubiquitous widely used all you needed was a comfortable ergonomic optical interface that's what was the limiting item i think he's uh wrong on that one 2030 vehicles uh self-driving cars reach majority penetration in the u.s car accidents drop by more than 50 percent and he said he just keeps going he goes out to like 2050 he's making predictions as to things like you know 2050 lifespan for a newborn is now 100 to 125 90 of non-surgical medicine is automated um blah blah blah like most contract law is automated on is automated on chain and so he keeps going now right or wrong you could disagree with all these but he's just a very interesting thinker very interesting guy to follow right and he does these book reviews that are like very hilarious where he's like this book three out of five uh you know first three fourths giant waste of time last fourth interesting about this topic it's like oh good like you saved me a bunch of time reading that book like i kind of trust your opinion on these things um and so i don't know his blog is worth worth a read we uh i i tweeted out asked to get him on the pod but i had no twitter handle to tag i didn't know who he was or you know which it was kind of hidden we maybe found the right one um yeah but we uh we should get him on i feel like we're big enough that we can get him you you you you
