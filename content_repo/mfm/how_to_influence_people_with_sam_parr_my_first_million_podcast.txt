okay the fourth and final skill set that i want people to take away from this rambling is how to influence people influence whether you i'll call it persuasion or influence it's really similar to similar to copywriting but this one's a little bit more psychological but it's similar and what most people don't realize is how to get people to do what you want them to do or how to influence them to think how you think and that sounds evil but that's not how i mean it i mean you could use it for evil ways i mean the stuff that uh you convince people to give to a non-profit or you convince people of certain morals or why something's bad and something's good it's the same stuff that you can use to get people to do a lot of really bad things and so this is definitely a scary skill set to learn but if you but the thing is is that people are like animals i mean in the same way that if you show a dog uh food um you know what's that pablo pavlovian experiment where you you show a dog food and you ring a bell so the dog starts associating the bell with the food and so whenever you ring the bell he starts slobbering people are the same way you can there's all these little tricks that you can do to get people to say yes to certain things or get them to buy into certain things more so for example if i'm a politician and i want to put a huge billboard in your front yard the likelihood that i of me just knocking on your door and asking to put this big billboard in your yard in your yard the likelihood of you saying yes is pretty low but if i go in there and i say hey can i put this small little sticker on your window and you and the likelihood of you saying yes to that is quite high now if i go back a week later and ask you to put this big billboard in your front yard the likelihood then that you're going to say yes is a lot higher than had i not asked you to put that small sticker because you're already bought in and there's about eight or nine principles just like this of of getting you to buy into things so another one's the rule reciprocity and so what that means is let's say that i uh i go out or let's say that you go out of town and you and i'm your neighbor and you ask me to check your mail for you when i'm gone and i say yeah sure no problem i'll check your mail you i've just done a favor for you now you owe me a favor and this is how humans work we all we work on favors and so now let's say next week i go hey look i watched i i um i checked your mail last week can i borrow your car for a day the likelihood that you're going to say yes is actually a lot higher because i've already done you a favor and so the interesting thing about the rule reciprocity is that people pay back disproportionately meaning i can do a really small favor for someone and then i can ask them to do a much bigger favor and shockingly a lot of times they'll say yes and so there's about eight or nine of these principles that are incredibly effective for influencing people um another example i've used this before i wanted to go i went and bought a motorcycle for a guy for three grand or he was asking three grand for it and i thought it was i thought yeah i'd be willing to pay about 2200 bucks for this and so i went and bought a can of coke i bought two of them and when i showed up to the place i opened up one i started drinking i go hey man uh you thirsty they you you want a coke i i was just down the street and i bought one and i thought maybe you don't want to he opened it up and he starts drinking it and i go cool motorcycle i'll give you 22. he goes ah everyone's been offering me that i'm not going to do it but you seem like a nice guy i'll do it fine and so i don't know if the coke was the reason but that's just an example of there's all these little tiny things that if you do them effectively they kind of add up to be pretty effective and so to learn these things there's this great book by robert ciaudini called influence if you just google influence book you'll see it it seems robert ciaudini read that it's it's that book changed my life and the second one which is pretty famous a lot of people know it's called how to win friends and influence people um that book i think that book is one of the best-selling books of all time the best-selling non-fiction books of all time it was written in the 1930s 1920s it's still 100 effective so go and read those two books and i and i think that if you learn how to influence people it's really really really effective and it will shock you now like i was a nerd in high school and i liked women and so i was always just like any other kid i wanted to go and meet girls i i remember reading this book as a kid i was like i want them to like me how do i do that and so i read this book and i would apply this stuff to to meet girls and i it worked um i i'm married to a an amazing woman and she was way out of my league when i first met her and um still is out of my league and i remember i used some of these things when i met her and it helped me kind of get my foot in the door and so this stuff will help you make money it will help you start a company it'll help you balance your emotions or it will help you meet your your future spouse um it's incredibly effective and so you
