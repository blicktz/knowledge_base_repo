Sam how you doing man why are you so angry god fucking shit nothing works I hate everything my Apple TV's not working QuickTime's not working I hate zoom god damn I hate it but your Mohawk's working that didn't even work I meant to shave the whole thing and I just forgot that up there you did not forget the top dude I hate working from home I hate it so much don't worry just like I don't know six to eight more weeks of this and then we're back if we're lucky if we're lucky okay so let's do this what do we got let's jump right in the people need okay we were supposed well we were supposed to talk about why comment or stuff today but I found I want to talk about something that I think is more interesting but you want to talk about some light-hearted stuff which is what's the sway thing yeah what is this way thing I saw you I saw a video of you dancing was that the first time you'd seen this dance pretty well no I had seen it Ryan Hoover had posted one of him dancing and when he posted it it looked very real to me yours did not look that as real I think is where you were in your room but when I saw that I was like holy shit Ryan can dance and then I saw the comments and everyone was like nice app nice how do we get the beta of this app and I was like oh shit there's an app that makes you dance wait so you have this app I think it's pretty popular it's called sway and what it does is you record yourself for 10 or 20 seconds you just stand there and you like walk around and move and then it uses AI or I don't know what it is but or not AI it's called um is it augmented yeah and then um makes it look like you're dancing like really good and I sent it to my family and some I made it like 20 of them they thought I was dancing it was hilarious yeah it's um it looks pretty it looks pretty funny if they actually just made it a little bit less good of dancing it would look real people would believe it but it's like so good that you're like no way no it's pretty amazing and so when I downloaded it it was number 50 in the app store and like as I was playing with it I saw it's been climbing up the charts and did you just download it because you were browsing the app store or you saw somebody do it so I all I do I browse the app store and I like to see the fastest growing apps yeah and I like to figure out what's going on I do that with gaming all the time so I have to figure out the games that are growing fastest so yeah I was just browsing gotcha and uh but it is viral like when you see somebody post it oh you're like yeah you're like oh this is great I can uh I can like I should do that so it has this kind of like monkey see monkey do virality that I like well do you remember that app that um you you would take a picture of your face and it would make you look older right didn't it turn out that that was owned by a Russian company and they were like doing funny stuff with your pictures I don't know if they were actually doing anything but people were definitely sketched out by it they're like wait I just gave my camera roll access to some random Russian developer and so did like 50 million other people like just to just to make this like uh old filter or baby filter on my face yeah so download that app it's called sway dance is it called sway it's called sway for sure s-w-a-y uh it's a cool little app it's good for little pranks and actually you know that is a light-hearted way to start it because it's just funny and people should just go to your twitter and they'll find the video of you doing it but um but this is also like part of this deep fakes um like this deep fakes problem and so if you don't know what a deep fake is a deep fake is basically people can now use um technology to make a video look real you can make anything look so for example what they do is they'll take obama obama's talking yeah but i can just say any sentence i could just be like uh hey hey my name's barack and um i'm the worst president of all time and it'll make it look like his lips are moving to my sentence because they basically feed in a bunch of footage of obama talking normally and it basically the algorithm learns okay here's how obama's face moves when he says certain things and then when i i can input any audio and it'll make it look like he's doing it now right now the technology is where it looks a little off but it's not that far off like if i showed it to my not all of it looks that off right but it's just getting better month over month so they just showed a um like a paper just came out with a new one and it's literally just taking a still photo so they took the mona lisa and then they do the same thing i can go say a sentence and it will make the mona lisa say it like the the voice can is that good and so like it's pretty crazy that they can just do that off a still photo you don't even need like hours and hours of raw footage of the person in order to do this now so i downloaded an app that does that with the mona lisa which app is that do you remember uh yeah it's amazing i'll tell you what it's called it's really neat and i think that everyone should download this stuff i paid five dollars for it it's called um um no i don't remember the name of it okay no worries um but what do you think of this whole deepfakes thing because it's a big problem like your sister's a lawyer and um i think she was she was like a da before right or something yeah uh well she's a public defender and then she's a public defender in the brox and uh and people yeah now it's like if you can't trust what you see right if if audio like we already have photos that could be photoshopped audio now that can be uh like live bird uh i think is the name of it um where basically you just you just talk uh you can you you can train um you can train this system to where you can just type anything and it'll say it in your voice or it'll say in a donald trump's voice so if you can't believe what you see what you hear or what's in video then um how does that like mess up the world like fake news is going to become a bigger problem yeah it's going to become a problem but why are we defaulting to that why are we worrying about i mean yeah it's going to be a problem but also let's think about all the amazing things like like act like there's going to be fake actors like my dance like your dance video yeah like it's going to be on that it's going to make movies amazing like like brad pitt won't exist it'll be it'll well it will be it'll be aj pitt and it will be some fake person and i think that's awesome so here's a future world you literally are just looking at your computer and instead like today if you want to make a movie or an animation you have to like be an animator or a movie editor or an artist to be able to draw you're just going to be able to say things and it's going to be able to create what you're what you're saying so you're going to be able to say okay what if donald trump was talking to you know whatever barack obama and then donald jumped in the air and he said this and then literally it's just going to be able to animate that's how that's how far this is going to go and that's going to unlock the ability to create stuff to people who don't have the technical skills to do it today yeah i mean i'm but i'm not too worried about how they're going to regulate it because like if you have a political ad now it like anyone could run an ad on facebook or on tv and it says donald trump i'm donald trump and i hate mexicans anyone could do that now but i mean like literally the tech like you could buy ads but there are ways to say like well no that's not allowed and it has to say like i'm donald trump and i support this you know what i mean like there are ways to like what do you mean like if you run a tv a political tv ad right now it has to say who pays for it sure it has to say is this but it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a political thing right this could this can go for anyone someone in high school who can just bully somebody else like right now the thing that yeah deepfakes got famous because people were putting other people's faces on porn actors and you could make it look like i could take a photo of your mom and i could put it on put it into a porno and it would look like your mom's in the porno and people were doing this with celebrities people were doing this with their classmates and uh you know the reddit the subreddit for this got huge is r slash deepfakes r slash deepfakes and um so this is how it got popular because it was like this incredible bullying tool like forget about political ads it's just like slander left and right did it did it get taken down that subreddit no i think it's still up i don't know i haven't been in a long time but um when it first blew up you know it got really popular because people were you know if oh yeah it is banned from reddit now because it was like it was becoming a problem oh um yeah but that that didn't stop the actual the actual problem that just stopped the subreddit where people were sharing it um so so i think this is going to be a massive massive problem for evidence i think it's going to become a massive problem for just like slander and um you know spin like i could i could take a video of you and make it say that you hate mexican people and it's not donald trump and uh and people would believe it because they would see your face and they would say i saw him say that yeah yeah i don't know and so i'll tell you what some people are trying to do to combat this is a whole bunch of programmers who programmers in general are have a high bar for the truth they really want things to be true logical solvable reliable and so when you take away evidence evidence which used to be a source of truth it's like well you're saying this but i have video of you doing that thing so that's evidence but now it's like well this video could be anything this video could be fake um so they're trying to solve this in the way that they think it can be solved so the theory is anything you make to sort of validate stuff um the con artist will always be one step ahead and there's too big of a payoff to be able to fake this stuff well it's like a counterfeiter and um so you're always a cat and mouse game which is not a winning solution so the solution that they believe is that the phone makers themselves the device makers themselves will need to put a cryptographic seal um on the video when it's taken and it's like a tamper proof seal like we have with medicine or whatever where it's like if this seal is broken that means this video has been edited in some way and so at some point people will only trust um videos or photos that have this this cryptographic seal on them that says this has not been edited because it's it's on the device itself from when it got captured it gets instantly implemented on and so who's working on that well the problem is a startup can't do this right because it's actually apple that needs to implement it it's actually samsung that needs to implement this and so uh luckily apple's a pretty privacy conscious company and they know that like if their tools are being used for evil they'd usually actually do stuff about it so hopefully apple is working on this but i have a friend who was doing a startup trying to do this and he was running into this problem which is like look the people who need to do this are all the camera makers like you know the security camera itself needs to do this and that's the only like decent solution now some technical people will say oh there's nothing that's actually tamper proof you can still you can still uh you know get around it sure but it's better and they are right but there are still things where it's mostly it mostly works right exactly so i think that's the world that's the way the world is going to work later where you're going to need to see this little you know icon that says it's like you know it's the gluten-free icon it's the it's the organic it's organic icon it's going to be this is legitimate and there's going to be a legitimacy icon on any photo or video that's the icon business that's a good business you know jd power no oh i mean i've heard of it but i don't know what you're going to tell me right now but you know what it is though right it's like all i know 55 jd power jd power and associates that's all i know what does that mean okay so jd power the reason i looked into this because i wanted to create a business like this where i was like because i was like this is a fucking racket and i'm like it does sound it does give a little it does give value if they're if you but you have to be like a uh benevolent dictator where like you can like rule it but you really gotta be honest otherwise trust as a service right right and jd power what they do is it's a billion dollar company jd power is and all i mean what they do is they test different cars and they give it awards but the the way that they make money is the car companies are members of the organization so if you're like if if you know if you only want the money you don't give a fuck about like being ethical um you could be like hey ford like our new membership costs us much money are you guys in or out and just so you know if you're out we can't give you any awards that's crazy um yeah that yeah if you could be in the business of being the rating agency that is gold in fact uh you know but one of the problems is like if people remember during the the subprime uh crisis i believe what happened was these these subprime mortgages um the bonds that were the securitized housing bonds mortgage bonds were rated triple a and people were like well how is this rated triple a this is like a junk bond um well why would it be rated triple a and i think i believe this um uh the companies i think it was the banks that were funding standard and poor right so yeah standard and poor was the rating agency and they were the one sort of um funneling money exactly it's the same thing it's the same thing and so they lost their they didn't actually lose it they're still around they're still one of the kind of main rating agencies but like that's a breach of breach of trust uh when the only thing you're providing is trust as a service yeah it's the same thing so jd power was sold to mcgraw hill in 2005 for 400 million dollars and then it was sold again recently in 2008 19 i think for north of a billion right i've really been wanting to do the same thing i like you have i've been wanting to create a credentialing agency so um either in the standardized testing world so like you know the way sat not with these these things are a racket because they can charge whatever the hell they want because you need that credential to move forward and um these credentials were you know for the most part all these credentials were just created at one point in time and uh so i was looking into like is there another credential that i could create that um literally all i'm providing is a stamp and i just get paid for for for the stamp well you know what i've always wanted to do that's similar is a vendors list so like sean if you're launching something you're going to come to me because you think i know a little bit about copywriting and you're going to say do you know any copywriters and i'm gonna be like i know one or two but like they're hard to find and so in my head i'm like i just got to create sam's list where it just have like approved vendors and now this is the best what are you saying this is the best are you saying these are 10 that you should check out or are you saying this is the best one like wire cutter well i don't think you could do the best one because if you have the best copywriter that person will always be busy but like there are definitely like uh dozens or hundreds that you can approve um i mean i guess angie's list was something similar and that's huge uh but like i've always wanted to do this for copywriters in particular i was i i almost bought sam or i almost did sam's list because people are always like which copywriter should i do i'm like i don't know man uh i could post on my social media but like it's a lot of work for me to go and find them for you right but like the same thing with law firms the same thing with accountants right um i'm like man i gotta just create like a vendors list of people who i know and approve of that's cool the version of this i wanted to do was around either iq so i was like oh okay like mensa iq like can i basically create some bullshit test that uh essentially labels people and you know if you're in the top five percent you get this extra little certificate and so people would pay to be basically have that as a bragging right or i was also thinking about it for developers like is there a um just an extra credential you could pay 39 to get that basically says yes i know x language or i am competent i have this level of competency at this thing and um i'm really a big fan of if anyone's out there creating a credential you know credentialing agency or trust as a service i'm very very interested in those because i think those are um beautiful beautiful businesses extremely easy to run low cost low risk and the more you do it the more powerful they become because the more you're the more times you see jd power even if you don't even fully know what it is it's like oh we need to go get that that's the that's the standard so i just looked up mensa while you were talking they have 150 they're a non-profit it's 150 000 members and they do about 4.8 million dollars a year in sales interesting not that big i wonder the backstory yeah but like as a non-profit you never know like what's the what was their motive how are they doing things well but you do know dude you can go and look up at all their uh they have to file a form a government form and you can see how much the uh how much they pay themselves how much revenue and what their expenses are right i guess i guess what i'm saying is i haven't i haven't done that part like the same thing can be done for athletes by the way like you know how nfl players go through the combine which is basically this battery of tests you'd run a 40 yard dash you do this uh bench press of 185 pounds you do a vertical leap test and so i really wanted i i really think that somebody could create a credentialing thing where you just have this facility in different cities and people pay to come in to get officially tested to get their scores and it's like here's how good i am as an athlete and then they use that when they're trying to basically like get on aau teams or get college scholarships or whatever it is it's like today we only offer that to nfl players right before they get drafted but i think that there should be a sort of um a standard service for athletes to say hey what's my reaction time what's my agility test what's my vertical so i did that when i was a kid when i was in high school i did the same thing it was called spark and okay uh s-t-a-r-q and the guy who created it was a x uh he was a college a very elite college runner in the 70s and 80s i think his name was rudy um i forget his last rudy chapa i'm remembering it off the top of my head rudy chapa he was a uh uh two miler from california in high school he i think he had the high school state record or high school national record for the two mile at like 8 30 something right and um his name is rudy chapa i think am i right is his name rudy chapa uh i'm on the website right now i don't see i haven't looked at his name but yeah this looks interesting and before this test and he was a nike executive and then he created the spark test and what you did it was very similar to a combine and it was and i did it i i crushed it it was a 40 yard 40 yard dash a broad jump a vertical jump um how far you can throw a medicine ball right and maybe that's it and they would give you a score and that score uh and i went to this place called velocity sports and velocity sports was created by the coach of lsu track and field and it was a chain of gyms that you can go to for high school kids and run and shit like that and the velocity sports must have paid spark money to use it and then when you applied to college i would put my spark score to get a scholarship yes dude that's exactly what i'm thinking about and i'm looking at their website now it looks uh very basic but uh yeah this is interesting i think there's a lot of unused facilities uh like track track and field that are unused so much of the time that you could do this without capex probably as long as you say like you know when you run a race and it's like as long as the wind conditions are under this then it's enough this counts in the official thing right um so i bet you could use you know in the summer time schools that are empty you could use their track and field facilities and um build a build a program like this because now people with sports are parents with sports have become so crazy um where people are doing travel sports at like age six age seven you're paying thousands of dollars for your seven year old to play baseball and um be on this like elite team and this is like a multi-billion dollar industry of the travel sports industry and i think all those people would be people who would want to get their kid tested and you could drive facebook ads to say hey get your kid tested here's your school what's your score and then every year you want it upgraded because it's like oh i've gotten stronger and faster and taller so i want my official measurements that are that are sort of ratified and here's another example of this is uh this is kind of funny we're kind of ranting on this i did zero research on this other than like i didn't prepare for this so me neither i just thought of this idea while we were talking that's how great we are dude just take a minute to appreciate that do you know um gallup i do know gallup yes okay so uh wait did my microphone is are we is it good um okay so gallup is uh is a um polling service right polling company created by this guy named joseph gallup i think and the uh another company or like a smaller company bought gallup and it was a family-owned business and the founder of that company that bought gallup his name was um i forget his name exactly but do you remember um strengths finder yes the guy who owned the family business that bought gallup he is the author of strengths finder i see and so strengths strengths finder it's hard for me to say they have a book that is popular but it's even though it's popular it doesn't make nearly the amount of money that the company makes the company makes about a billion or two billion dollars a year it's privately owned it's probably one of the largest privately owned companies in america like top 200 and they have a quiz so if you google strengths finders quiz it's a 29 or 49 quiz and it tells you where you rank on strengths finder right i've taken it uh because somebody sent it to me jim clifton's the name of the guy you're jim clifton jim clifton his dad jim clifton was the ceo of gallup right and this was his thing and so it was like a survey they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year off that quiz yes exactly so i've taken strength finders and i this is when i was like oh this is just bullshit okay gotcha like first of all it's a test you cannot fail it's just saying which of these strengths do you have so you're just gonna get one of the there's like 25 strengths or whatever it's like here's the five you get leadership determination and you know innovation and whatever and then the other person gets like empathy and you know you know thoughtfulness and whatever else so it's it's pretty genius and they sell these to companies who want to basically take these personality tests for leaders to say hey we want to understand our employees better you want to understand your team teammates better and this will help you work together better and um i believe strength finders was doing like 100 million plus in revenue i'd have to go double check that but um but yeah it's like a tremendously successful franchise and the book is really just a it's like a code you get in the book that says go take this quiz online um and then the book is like kind of useless beyond that but you have to buy it works really well using that book because um like i i said i've kind of talked about this me and ramon we own this this this this software for uh to-do lists and we get all of our signups practically because one guy who has a book mentioned our service and it gets signups and the book's not even popular that's amazing um also uh like we had talked about that person in our facebook group the my first million uh side hustles facebook group basically who is doing a chess tutoring service um any niche sport or niche niche thing like chess i don't know it probably is already because chess is so widely established but probably is already some sort of benchmark or test you take uh but if i was him i would basically create my own anyways which is like oh by the way for all my students like once a year we do this hundred dollar um you know test and you get your chess chess q score and what your chess q score tells you your adaptability your you know recognition cognition whatever and um and so it's not like total horse shit you actually are testing to see how good they are at certain things um but i think it's a it's just a very simple way to make a lot of money off of um kind of vaporware there's nothing physical you're doing there vaporware in that it's real but it's uh it's lightweight it's very simple to create it's very simple to maintain there's no like employees or assets you need to buy in order well because sean someone in the reviews our latest review says that you and i are unethical and that you have to check your ethics at the door if you're going to listen to this podcast which is totally but i just want to make them aware that when you say vaporware you need it's real or it's substance but yeah vaporware is the wrong word for it what i meant is a very lightweight thing to create and maintain and very low cost to create another example of this is doug score do you know doug score never heard of it dude it's just this guy named doug de moro he's this nerd uh like he's like the nerdiest guy ever and he's got like four million subscribers on youtube and like he's the type of guy who wears like a collared shirt but like you can see his white undershirt sticking out from from uh like the sleeves you know people like he's like i know exactly what you're talking about just like a sloppy dirty guy but he's amazing he has a thing where he reviews cars and he creates a doug score which is based off of like is this fun for a weekend car or is this fun for a daily driver and now at this point he's got a thousand cars that he's ranked and i'm when i'm buying my car now i check it i check the doug score ah i like that okay that's cool like kelly blue book for value and then doug score for sort of enjoyment i like that and kelly kelly blue book great example so like blue book it's a multi-billion dollar company yeah but they they provide a little different thing they have just like a data set that they're able to use to to give you a a price comparison which is like different than sort of an aptitude test but um nonetheless i'm curious um do you think we are low ethics do you think you have a sort of a looser ethical um criteria than most people for business i think that we have a looser um attitude yes but by the way i think it's it's significantly above the line of like good like right like for example most people are like i can't pre-sell product that i don't have and i'm like in my head i'm like who cares just refund the people and like you haven't it's not like i'm not saying steal money i'm saying advertise something it doesn't exist so you can get demand improve demand and then you refund the money you don't i'm not saying you steal from them but yeah you are lying and so i think that's ethical right yeah i think we definitely have a a looser definition than the average person i would say the average um maybe the average business person even um but there is you know i think the the problem here is there's no standard right there's no there's no definition for what what's ethical what's not it's completely subjective and judgmental um and so the the hard part is you know for us we think there's a line between right and wrong and we're on the right side we we we think we have a safe margin of a buffer where we're in the right uh but for other people their line might be in a different spot yeah but that's because most people aren't aggressive but anything that i do i would i would suggest to my mom that she'd buy whatever i'm promoting or like it's like do i want my family to use this or or if i told them about what i'm doing would i like do i want to hide this right and i don't i'm i'm anything that i do i'm not afraid uh to tell so i met this guy once um this guy had reached out to me about uh we're building this product called blab and blab was getting popular this guy reached out he said hey my name is billy i'm from uh you know i forgot where he's from like santiago or the from mexico or some somewhere and let him and he was like i'm coming up to california i'm coming to san francisco i want to meet you and i want to talk to you about this company i was like okay uh i don't know i don't know about that like most of the people who that are users of a product are not usually people i want to like do meetings with necessarily but he said a bunch of stuff in his email that made him sound amazingly legit he was like my family started the first television station in mexico um we you know i own all these different like uh music festivals and he said he sounded like super legit but his email was written with blue text font and like different sizes of text it's all i got the paste yeah so i was well no no not like that like it was like like he had chose like no i'm gonna my emails are blue and not the like copy paste little purple thing it was like um this was just his style so i was like i don't know if this guy's a joker or not anyways we go out to dinner and i have very low hopes we go to a sushi place and i walk in and i see probably the most handsome guy i've ever seen and this guy billy was extremely well put together he's like in a suit and tie um he looks legit he we sit down at the table he orders the omakase which is basically chef's choice like 200 each sushi dinner and he's like i got this don't worry and i'm like okay i'm starting to believe but you know could be could still be someone who's faking it and he starts telling me a story and this guy is completely legit and he's probably the most charismatic guy i've ever met my whole life i was like you know if if if i swung that way i'd be in love right now like this guy is amazing so at the end of the dinner i asked him a question i said hey um you know you're a very persuasive guy like this was you clearly are good at this right you're clearly very persuasive very charming i said i used to think i'm that way till i met you basically i used to think i was in the sort of top tier of that um but i always sort of had this hesitation of like you know should i use my my powers for good or evil type of thing like where do you draw the line on using this but this guy's legit he was a real completely legit yes and and so he really was wealthy very successful very smart very charming all that good stuff and so um i asked him i said you know what do you think he goes my rule is this he goes if your intentions are good then it's all fair game and so he was like he was like it all that matters is the intent if you're trying to scam people if you're trying to con people if you're trying to not deliver value if you're trying to just get something that's a good situation for you and not for the other person then you shouldn't be doing it what you shouldn't be using all these powers of persuasion sick but if you think you are genuinely going to help people if you think you are genuinely in the right if you think you're generally working for a good cause if your mission is pure if your intent is good then it's all fair game you should use it to the max and i was like all right billy thank you very much for this uh incredible i completely agree with him and if you study you know like persuasion and charm and i use it in the form of copywriting that's all some people are born better but it's a teachable skill and i always tell people like what i'm gonna tell you it's gonna sound like evil like i'm gonna teach you how to manipulate people but make sure you use it for good right because you can easily use this for bad and you know what here's a here's a weird counter to this and this is where you know people are gonna be like okay this guy's actually evil okay so the other way of doing this so the one way one of the things to say what you just said which is use these powers for good the other thing i've i've been able to do is is the opposite which is when i see somebody do something for evil but it works i try to learn from it and so for example i remember the first time i saw i'll give you a recent example first no i completely agree so trump is uh somebody who i'm not a fan of i think the guy is bad in all these different ways um but when i watch him the guy is an incredibly effective communicator and he's not polished he doesn't use fancy 15 words he um doesn't have a lot of substance behind what he's saying but the guy is like a a master of uh of communication the guy knows how to get his point across uh in a way that resonates with people i completely agree scott adams who's the creator of dilbert was talking about this when trump was running if you haven't seen it go read scott adams's blog um he's the creator of dilbert and he was early on when trump first announced his candidacy scott adams called it he goes this guy's gonna win and people were like what he goes i've been studying persuasion for 20 years i've been studying hypnosis i've been a communicator through cartoon i know an effective communicator when i see one this guy is a master he goes and so he would come up with whenever trump would say things like um low energy jeb or whatever when he would like call jeb bush low energy um he was like these are linguistic kill shots these are and or when he would talk about the wall he'd be like it's a great big wall a huge wall and he's like he's painting a picture in people's minds which is much better than talking about policy and uh so so you can learn from people that you think are using it for now he he and he called out that he was gonna win he called that he was gonna win months before anybody even took him seriously when 538 was like this guy's got a zero percent chance scott adams was like this guy's gonna win and uh of course if he was wrong nobody would ever even really pay attention to it because you know but when you're right on a contrarian prediction you get all the credit and the other example of this was hitler so hitler when hitler was rising to power i studied how did this guy get so popular what did this guy do because when you watch him speak he's not a very compelling guy um but uh they did a lot of things so one thing i remember uh that stood out to me this i was in seventh grade and i remember learning about this and when hitler was trying to rise to power all the political campaign posters were all like full color lots of text uh people trying to explain their position on things and hitler went the other way everything he did was black and white which would be normally it would not stand out but he was like well i will contrast everybody else who's using tons of color on their stuff i'll go black and white the second thing was he would use only like big images and like really powerful images and not a bunch of text and then he would use movies as propaganda and you know fill the cinema with people to watch a movie but it was very much a propaganda thing behind it so even though he used it for evil those techniques and principles are interesting to learn from for me as somebody who wants to you know have a strong toolkit that i can use for good i completely agree i was reading i've been going down so many wikipedia holes now that i'm home so much i was reading about uh i read hitler's wikipedia because i was reading about world war ii and it let me like i was reading about the mafia and then world war ii and then like and it's like he's there is like his rise to power was because he uh like would speak at these uh i don't know what what the equivalent of is now but just like halls where he right like bars like veteran halls and i'm like wait a minute he started as a speaker that's it right it was kind of crazy um so okay a couple of things we'll switch topics because people now are like what these guys are saying trump and hillary are good i don't understand um okay so i have an idea for you so um i call this my new lambda school idea um have you ever do you guys have like an office administrator or office admin i don't know if you guys are we have yeah i mean we have someone who handles stuff yes and do like an hr and things like that right i'm talking more like um so admin work or like an executive assistant or secretary do you have anybody like that have you ever so recently um i'm uh at my work we're hiring an ea right so we had an ea she left we had to hire a new executive assistant and so um they put me on the hiring panel and i'm like okay i don't even know what questions i'm supposed to ask like i i don't really know what the background i should be looking for all that stuff so i started thinking about this started looking it up so it turns out that um office administrators or secretaries or or executive administrators uh eas is one of the most popular jobs in the country um and it's also something where so there's about you know let's say 600 000 i think in the us um and they pay pretty well uh so it doesn't require tons of specialized skill it's pretty much anybody can learn to do this if you're you know somewhat competent but you can make 50 60 70 80 k um doing this i thought that's a pretty good paying job and i know at our company the ea is they're critical um they do such an amazing job they they're they help and all the senior leaders do what they do and so i started thinking about this and i said could there be a lambda school for eas because i think this is something that in three months you could teach people the core skills that you need around calendaring booking travel um you know note taking all the different sort of core components that you need to do to do this job well um you know it's not rocket science you just need to learn the tools and learn the sort of do's and don'ts and then i think companies when you know like us when we're hiring for this um there's no like school or degree that you look at where you're like oh because you have this degree you're going to do a good job and so it's usually like do you already have experience doing this or not but that's a catch-22 because how do you break in if if everyone wants to hire for somebody who already has experience doing it and so i'm thinking that you could create a program that uh tells it offers people who says hey in three months we can train you for a job that'll pay you 50 60 or 70k a year and it's a job that has good you know work-life balance and all these other characteristics of it and so and you could use the lambda school model where you take an income share agreement you say great i'm training people for three months it cost me three thousand dollars to do this remote virtual school but i make back you know up to 15k 17k per candidate that gets placed into a job uh over time what do you think of this idea fucking love it and i'm looking it up right now um org.co have you heard of org org no that's a hilarious name though we use it um let's see how big their team is that can kind of tell us how big they are but okay what org org is is it's a community slash community slash uh job board it's like a i don't know how you would describe it in one word it's a org org is a 100 volunteer run organization uh we have jog board blogs resources we have private groups and email lists and it's all for hr and right executive assistants office manager hr departments and diy uh admin assistant like you know whatever it's and so my uh our old ea was on this and it was an email list and and they would send out blasts like hey i'm looking for uh the best i it person our company's small we only have a budget of two thousand dollars who do you recommend or like when i wanted to hire a new ea i had a friend post a listing on there and i got tons of applicants what i would do with your idea is i would either buy this company man these these the lady who runs this i forget her name but she could be making millions off of this but i don't think she is i bet she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars so right i would buy that yeah i would buy that buy it or become the platinum sponsor for uh you know fairly a fair rate and use it for the sort of user acquisition and there's this powerful thing because um once you build the brand that hey yeah this is like a staffing agency right but it's a it's a big internet internet version of a staffing agency and once you place some people two good things happen the first is you get a reputation that says hey our eas have been hired by company a b c d e and if we could come we become a trustworthy source for good good eas but then also right now all the candidates in our current ea pipeline came from our existing eas people they knew from their network and so your alumni become your hiring become your hiring partners and so the more alumni you place the more opportunities you have for your own graduates and so i think that's like the real power of uh of the lambda school model and unlike developers okay so the lambda school model you got to break that shit down lambda school model you're saying you train them for free and then you get a percentage of their salary yes you do love that model for everything uh not for everything necessarily but i think when you have a low cost of training uh it's a great model because it reduces the friction to join because you say well it's free and so i it's i only i only have to pay them if i get a high paying job out of this so your incentives are aligned right because we want you to get a high paying job but you came to us to get a high paying job we only get paid if you get a high paying job and if you get a high paying job this is a reasonable payback for uh for us providing that service to you and so i think any way any place where you have a low cost of training this is a very good mechanism it's just a debt mechanism it gets a lot of hype but really it's just a debt vehicle and um but i think it's a good debt vehicle for for this um okay do you wanna i have a few things that i want to go over do you want to wait until next episode or do you want to let's do one more and then we'll we'll call it and then we'll save the rest for the next episode okay then i don't want to bring well let's not bring mine up yet the reason what i what i wanted to talk about was roger dickey's bathroom business that you brought up yeah made your main renovation i think but i kind of want to wait you want to wait on that okay we can do it next time yeah we can do it next time um okay let's bring up let's let's oh why don't you bring up this xavier neil story okay yes all right so xavier neil i'm sorry i feel like i've been talking most of this that's okay it's really interesting so xavier neil uh is my new favorite billionaire so this is my second section this is my segment of the show called my new favorite rich guy um so this guy is essentially like an elon musk type of dude in france but instead of trying to send rockets to mars this guy just operates in his own style but he's got the same kind of what i call like no fucks given um attitude like a branson or an elon musk and i never heard of this guy so um i'll tell you how i discovered him so i discovered him because he created this thing called 42. have you ever heard of the school called 42. um no so wait so he's in france he's in france um he so i'll tell you his kind of like life story so age 19 he creates this business called minitel minitel is essentially a sex hotline uh a phone service you know you call it's all called like sort of a sex line and at 19 he creates this thing and it goes gangbusters um and so he's doing really well makes a few million bucks off this then he either creates or invests and buys a stake in something called worldnet sold a few few years later for 50 million bucks right before the dot-com crash and then his big thing that he did was he created this thing called free and free was like a t-mobile it's like a mobile carrier and at the time in france all like sms phone plans are all very expensive so he created he undercut everybody he created the like lowest cost way to have you know a cellular cellular service and so free became this um huge company and so his his net worth ballooned to like 6.6 billion dollars i'm looking him up now this guy's my favorite person ever yeah and he's he's very legit and so he was like all right look um what do i want to do now i want to do more baller and so he was like okay i'm going to create this thing called 42.

so he was like i'm going to create a computer science school with no teachers and no staff so all he did was create this dope facility with a bunch of computers and if you get into 42 you just come and uh the computer is your lesson plan so it's like a video game there's like a challenge it's like hey you need to make a website that can do x y and z and you're like okay and it's like you have the internet and you have some people next to you and like you guys need to figure out how to get past this level and uh so you start doing the program and so it's self-serve you do it you do um a bunch of like projects to level up plus you create your own you know like projects or ideas so somebody created i don't know like uh somebody could create like a coronavirus tracker right now because that's a timely little website you can yeah i'm looking it up now they have 2500 students yeah and it's actually closed right now because the physical facility closed here but it was a wild idea i don't even know how successful it's been i don't think it's been a wild success but i love his bet so he was like yeah i'm gonna put 150 million dollars into this so he built one in france and he built one here in fremont for 100 million dollars in california and um it was just like so what a what a radical idea what a way to bet your money and try to like change the world over and over and over again and then he did this thing in in france he's like okay how do i build the like startup ecosystem here so he created this thing called station f and if you this thing it's like the fucking nasa facility it's like this huge huge like like i don't know how many football fields long office or hangar or co-working space and he's like all right i'm gonna make the dopest place for any investor to come when they're in europe here here's some space to go hang out entrepreneurs you're starting companies come over here and build your company here's an office space um restaurants come here at the bottom fill this place up you know gym whatever so he created his own little oasis kind of like tony shea did in vegas uh this guy did in france this guy's amazing station f what what i'm so i just love this guy's style so first of all i've looked it up now he's not perfect 2004 he was indicted and detained for a month for misuse of company assets which occurred in several of his sex shops that he was a shareholder in and he ended up getting a two years suspended prison sentence for misuse of company assets so he's certainly not perfect i i don't know i'm just reading off this one thing though in addition to all this he owns the rights of the song my way by frank sinatra which i love he owns one of the largest newspapers in france uh super interesting guy when i'm curious about people like this and um andrew wilkinson is going to be on the pot is he going to be on on this tuesday uh yeah next the next episode basically so andrew kind of andrew not exactly but kind of does the story in the same way as well and so we have to ask him about this what i want to know is how do these people manage so many freaking projects right because like i i can't even manage what i have on my plate and like right so this guy's prolific so so they you know they hire they hire people to run their shit right so like i worked with a guy michael birch who's kind of like this like billionaire type of dude and he created this incubator with this totally different model or everybody owns all the equity and all the projects and you know he picked me to run that run the show for him so he tried and he trusted me he's pretty hands off we checked in but like he let me run the show so i was looking at this guy xavier neal and he's got somebody this woman from google who runs station f the big the big facility he's got somebody who runs his investment fund and the guy that guy was telling the story he goes you know um we don't have board meetings but i was like uh xavier don't you want to know what i'm doing with your fund and he's like yeah yeah for sure tell me and he's like um he goes i told him i said hey we invest in all these companies i think we should double down on these winners and uh make make less small investments and do more on the winning companies and what do you say okay he goes he goes i'm not i'm not doing this to make more money i'm doing this to make more companies invest in more companies and i was like what he's like he's like you could double down but don't stop investing in new and like new small small companies uh and then the other thing that they talked about in his thing kind of like what you're saying how do you manage this they're showing like uh the guy showed his email inbox all the emails from this guy and i've noticed this a lot of wealthy busy people their emails look like text messages so like this guy will write them a long email about like hey we're thinking about this plan here's what we could do here's their plaza okay cool or like literally it's up to you all good and it's like up the number two the letter u okay where do i see this screenshot uh there was a story i think it was like a forbes or bloomberg story or something about this guy um and they they put that in there but i think this is a pretty common thing amongst the people who do a lot of stuff i guess it's kind of like if i buy like uh like i've talked about how i'm gonna buy like just a toy car like a fun car i guess it'd be like the equivalent of me buying like a ten thousand dollar car and like letting someone use it and it's like dude i don't care just make sure it comes back in one piece right and so you know the thing i guess the thing i want to clarify because when andrew's coming on on tuesday i'm i like andrew for the same reason i like this guy and they're totally different right andrew's not gone to jail and didn't start a sex hotline and he's not a billionaire like well we don't know that for sure yeah exactly not this guy and this guy has about 20 years on andrew so give him time uh but i guess like the thing the thing that stands out to me is i respect above all else people who do their own way people who have their own they are original thinkers and decide to live life on their own terms that's kind of what i got out of this guy is i think i feel like this guy branson elon musk the thing i like about them and they're definitely have lots of flaws and lots of you know messed up things that they do but i just respect that they don't just follow a normal societal playbook they live life on their own terms they they basically you know marshall be their own drum or whatever that's what i like about them that's what i like about andrew um he's done it completely his way which is very non-traditional do you think this guy speaks good english this french guy yeah let's uh i bet he's all right let's fucking email him yeah let's do it i'm looking at him now i i mean i he i would if you're french i mean if you're a a magnet like this i would imagine you you speak some english but is he uh yeah he speaks good enough english to be on this i'm sure he speaks i'm sure we'll learn french dude uh we'll we will we will make it happen if we need to yeah we'll be like uh yoel yoel romero on joe rogan where he just has a translator on the podcast right i'm down i would love to do this and this guy's in cahoots with uh this other guy who i don't want to say his name because it's too embarrassing if i pronounce if i try to say it say it because he's french but i it's bernard arnault do you know who that is he owns lbmh okay i'll tell you really quick he's usually goes back and forth with gates and a few of these other guys is the richest guy in the world he l lvmh it uh stands for louis vuitton something but they own um chanel they own louis vuitton they own um it's the largest luxury group in the world they own fent fent um what's the uh rihanna fenty yeah yeah they own that so the way he started it was his father was wealthy and they owned a construction business and it was big but it wasn't like billionaire big but um i think they sold it for like 20 million dollars in uh in the 60s which is a lot of money that i mean that's probably the equivalent of uh 20 million that's probably the equivalent of 100 million now so it's a lot of money um and so anyway he convinced his father when this guy bernard was in his 20s and he goes dad we gotta divert we gotta sell our construction business and buy luxury goods because when i went to new york they all knew what chanel was but that's not even a big company and so he goes let's let's let's fucking buy chanel and so they bought chanel for a small sum millions of dollars but not what it's worth now and then he runs it and he starts buying more and more and more so he turned a construction company into the owner of louis vuitton and dude they own a lot of so let me just throw off some names so they own belvedere they own hennessy they own dior they own fenty they own fenty they own tag um they own hublot they own moe they own i mean this is this is like uh like i don't know a luxury brand that's not on this list yeah they own it all like do they but then like gucci i think gucci is its own brand yeah it's kind of like you know like the ab and bev where it's like yeah two companies own like all the other sub companies yeah well this freaking guy did it and he it started as a construction business right and this doesn't happen that much anymore but this is what i love about business before for some reason it seems like this happened this had you this used to happen a lot more the chinese are notorious for doing this where they diversify like crazy so i don't think this doesn't happen more i think this is just something that happens on like a 50-year horizon and so it's just hard for us who like we're just for five years we've just been furiously looking at this for 10 years uh to see these things that are playing out over 50 or 100 year arcs right i agree i agree with you but i've studied a handful of chinese companies that were launched in the 90s and 2000s and they are like crazy about doing that right um where like they would start something and like two years later they own like apartment buildings it's like what the heck that's not even like and and um the japanese uh have done it as well they have a name for it i don't want to pronounce it because i don't want to butcher i don't even know how to say it it starts with a k kazu i think um okay and it and it's basically it's kind of like how do you know how yamaha makes motorcycles pianos and chainsaws and power blow it's kind of like that like they like are known for doing that and so what do you okay so i was saying what i respect the most softbank did it too right so what i was saying was what i respect the most is people who who you know create their own playbook on how they want to live their life and i agree what what would be your because like i think you kind of like the like mogul types you love researching like what do you think is like your highest highest bit thing you respect people who the the same you said it best i agree with what you said people who um people who look at the world and be like yeah i get it the world's this way i'm gonna bend the world to make it my way though and have you uh like in your own small way do you think have you done that like what's an example of where you've bent the world into working the way you want it to work i think that i'm from missouri i think that some of my friends from missouri think that i have done that um i do not think that i have done that right but i think give it time and i will i think some of the things you did with the hustle were like that so for example um you didn't go the vc route in fact you did some weird shit like crowdfunding and other stuff along the way um and from the beginning i think you i remember you distinctly saying because i was like why don't you do facebook you know why don't you do video why don't you snapchat this it's hot and you were like no i want to do email because that's my own little pirate ship that i can own and i'm not i'm not dependent on any other platform i want to make my own pirate ship and i want to get my part to be a big fucking pirate ship and i just never really heard anyone talk like that or think like that where they were so um specific around the like um the path to victory dude i have a video like i'm i i'm normally i try not to brag on myself because i think i got a lot of flaws but the way our company is shaping now i made a video in 2015 and i outlined what was going to happen and it is 100 happening exactly like that where's that video it's on youtube if you google the hustle seed invests i explain i go we're going to build to a million people we're going to profit from advertising and we're going to use all that profit to build more stuff and we're going to sell that stuff and then we're going to build more media around it and it is happening exactly and do you know how you said pirate ship let me show you something hold on let me show you something stay there all right so i'm off camera but i'm gonna show you why you're gonna see what i'm doing this is thanks killing it what's that sean all right so sam just dropped his pants and i'm looking at a giant pirate ship tattoo on his thigh when did you get that in 2000 like right around when i was telling you about the company i got a pirate ship and it says bold fast fun so you basically you tattooed your business plan under your thigh yes i love it because i tell everyone i go email list is our pirate ship and every email is a little bit of wind in our sales i love it that's great okay we got to end on that that's a classic uh i should have taken a screenshot of that one um okay so we will see you guys tuesday we're gonna have andrew on uh when we say tuesday that's when we record these come out i look like a freaking loose cannon right now with the mohawk and tattoos i'm not actually like that all right man i will we'll catch you later okay
