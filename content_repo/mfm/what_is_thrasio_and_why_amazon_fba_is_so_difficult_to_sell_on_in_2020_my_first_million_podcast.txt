me and sam are here sam you wrote something at the top of this i want to hear what you have to say which is people's reply about what we talked about last time thrasio let's jump in with that all right you want to i'm going to read just word for word i have it pulled up on my twitter okay you ready i'm not going to read the guy's name he goes i'm a modest size mid seven figure amazon seller in a network of guys that range from one to two million to probably 50 million plus we have a few guys in our network that actually sold their company to thro how do you call it thrasio thrasio i'm happy to chat about amazon e-commerce sometime okay so i'm going to read his replies now for those of you listening the background is is that on tuesday sean and i talked about thrasio it's a company that raised money they raised a hundred two hundred million at a 750 valuation i don't remember yeah close to 100 million at a 750 million dollar valuation big company you can um they're only two years old they're and what they're doing is buying amazon fulfillment and filled by amazon company fulfilled by amazon companies and they are uh making the brands better and just owning them they're doing a bunch of stuff um and so i had a guy reach out to me and he's i go that's great tell me what's the i asked him what's the cash flow situation like for most guys sub 10 million dollars they're probably working with zero to a handful of u.s employees still actively involved in the day-to-day large team in the philippines and in cheap locations and are probably netting between 10 to 20 percent a year um and and so the typical size for three to five million the typical size is three to five million in revenue and they're probably pulling in 500 to a million dollars a year for themselves but the problem is is that uh it's getting harder and harder in 2013 you could sell almost anything and scale a seven-figure business now there are a lot more dominant more sophisticated players and it's incredibly hard to enter in the business the amazon algorithm is much smarter and it makes ranking incredibly expensive and difficult also amazon treats their sellers like trash so it's kind of a mixed bag uh i could take a month and do nothing and let my team run it and it can go perfect or i can get an email tomorrow saying my account has been suspended or killed and i need a lawyer to reinstate everything or i'm just crushed so anyway sean i wanted to uh fill you in on this because i thought it was cool insight i didn't know about that yeah that's that's a good insight um so a couple thoughts on that so the first is uh i think he's right you know back 2013 2014 it was a lot easier to do it than it is today that seems consistent with what i've heard uh in fact it seems like the formula is build a successful amazon business in 2013 14 15 then start teaching other people how to do it because it's too hard to do anymore and so now you start giving away the sort of secrets and uh you become a teacher for the for the next three years um so i think that's the the career path right now the other thing that comes to mind we were talking i was talking to andrew wilkinson about this and he was saying he used the uh i think it's a i think it's a charlie munger quote um which is or no no no it's a nasim talib quote which is it's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller so you know there's a high probability you can make a little bit of money um you know consistently every single time you reach down you pick it up and then there's you know a low probability of complete death and that's what he's talking about when he says you can get a letter tomorrow that says your account is suspended goodbye um and and that's it or amazon cuts the rates of your category like i have a friend who was doing millions of dollars of book sales as a third-party bookseller on amazon and then amazon was like you know what now our take rate on books has you know not 10 we're gonna do 25 thanks and that like killed that happened to me that happened to me the other day so in our we uh in the trends group someone was like uh just so you know amazon changed the fee so basically i have various blogs like my personal blog or something like that and it makes just like small amounts of money like three to five thousand dollars a month off amazon affiliates and i don't even check it it just runs because because i've just written a lot of content over the years they changed their rate and someone told me in the group i think that i forget what i was earning i don't even check it i think i was earning six percent to nine percent for uh affiliate revenue and then they changed it to they like halved it so that money just halved and it's no big deal because it wasn't it it wasn't like a big income stream for me but if you're wire cutter or if you're buzzfeed and you made a hundred million dollars from this it's a huge deal right yeah that that 20 cut uh makes it makes a really big difference no no no no it wasn't a it wasn't a 20 cut it was way bigger than that it was like half they halved ouch and what what category are your links mostly in is it electronics is it some cat is it one category or is it just across the board um they rate they lowered it across categories but across the board it's close to half um my categories were probably personal care and electronics i mean just anyone who yeah or books a lot of books right okay um i want to know another topic so we're good on thrasio you want to add anything else no do you not want to um no i think it's it's consistent with what we thought you know i like when people fill in the gaps with information that we don't have it i'm not an fba seller i don't know the ins and outs of that market i just think it's interesting we talk a little bit about it and then people fill in the gaps and the next episode we come back a little smarter that's a nice little formula we have going so i appreciate that if we ever talk about stuff you know tell us tell us more about what you know that we don't
