There's something that happens every year when we're planning HustleCon. We get hundreds of emails from people asking us to speak and they tell us that they're professional speakers, that they speak at hundreds of events each year, or that they're naturally gifted on stage. And honestly, that's an immediate turnoff.

An easy no. Why? Because HustleCon isn't about professional speakers.

It's about real operators and builders who have been in the trenches since day one and have built huge companies. Each summer, we bring together founders from some of the fastest growing startups in the world and give them 20 minutes to explain how they started and grew their company. And the results are extraordinary.

In 2014, we hosted HustleCon for the first time. 300 people showed up. Now, over 2,500 people attend each year, from three-person startups to employees at Fortune 500 companies.

This event is for anyone who wants to learn from the folks who run the most innovative and fastest growing companies in the world. Like the founder of WeWork, who went from being a janitor to the founder of a $16 billion startup. Or the creator of ClassPass, who turned her passion for fitness into a business that generates hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

But the speakers and their stories? That's not what makes HustleCon special. There's another reason why people fly in from all over the world to attend HustleCon.

It's the people they meet and the connections they make. Like the entrepreneur who met her future co-founder. Or the business partners from Florida who signed three new clients.

They come every year because HustleCon is the only place where they can meet such high-quality people who are just as ambitious and driven as they are. And these are not the people who brag about being professional speakers or gurus. They're the ones who, in a few years, we're going to be begging to speak at HustleCon.

So, you want to come?
