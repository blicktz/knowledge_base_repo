She had she was about five feet tall Her hair was down to the ground. She had this like majestic chestnut hair. That was just Zach welcome back Brad So this week you have a really interesting piece about a female entrepreneur Who's one of the pioneers of the franchising business model?

Not many people have heard about her. How'd you find out about her? So her name is Martha Matilda Harper and She was kind of she created this phenomenal business and Long before Ray Kroc McDonald's and the whole franchising model took off She was kind of one of the early pioneers in the space in the late 19th century and her story was kind of forgotten and it's for For many years.

It was a footnote in history Until this woman Jane Jane Plitt a historian resurfaced her story in the late 90s and early 2000s and really made a push to get her more into the spotlight But even now today, I think relatively few younger people know about her And she's just got kind of a very interesting story so Tell us a little bit about her business and and how she found her niche Yeah, so she she started out her life In the mid 1800s in Canada and she was kind of born into a lower-class family family At the age of seven she was sent away to be a house servant by her family and for 25 years she was a house servant and Eventually she served At the house of a physician who studied a hair follicle Science and kind of some of the early science of hair hair treatments and And he bestowed upon her this this hair tonic and She took that with her to Rochester, New York and eventually Found her way into certain circles saved a little bit of money and Launched a successful franchise of hair salons at a time when it was very difficult to even launch a single business a female entrepreneur um She ended up growing this into a chain of 500 stores and um Was was an inspirate and inspired many other um women to to fall on her path A lot of the franchise owners she hired were were other Uh women who who didn't come from upper-class backgrounds She empowered a lot of people with similar backgrounds to her and and gave them Some freedom to run their own franchises She sounds like a really inspiring story to any anything you want to share Just any fun details about the business and in the in the hair salon industry that she was was created with Yeah, so she um, she actually invented a number of things like the reclining shampoo chair A sink with a little hole cut out for the neck Just little things you see in salons today that you don't really give much thought to Um, but unfortunately, she didn't secure the patents to a lot of these inventions, so um It was very difficult for for women at the time to get their name on a patent um Um, but the other funny detail is um, if you if you look at there there's one old kind of iconic photograph of her that exists She had her uh, she was about five feet tall Um, her hair was down to the ground.
