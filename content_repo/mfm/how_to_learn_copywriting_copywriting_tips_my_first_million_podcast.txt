you can do what i did which was very labor intensive and very effective but it takes a lot of time and that's called copy work and so what i did was i got a hold of the 100 best sales letters of all time i don't know what makes it the 100 best but it's just famous sales letters so in the 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s before the internet really came around and it even happened after that but predominantly before that these salesmen would send these letters to people's homes and they would try to convince people to get interested in buying a vacuum or an encyclopedia or a pair of sunglasses and the it was typically the they typically wrote to wives the the housewife would take out her checkbook and be like oh this is really interesting i need to buy this and she would write a check put it into the envelope and sell it back that's a lot of friction and so these people were so good at using words because it was so expensive to send out all these letters they had to be good they were so good at using their words that they had to uh that they convinced these strangers to write a check and mail to them and so i found these 100 letters and if you google best sales letters of all time you're gonna find them and i would i spent probably six months where i would spend about two or three hours a day and when i was 22 years old i would write them all out by hand i would also do that with books so the great gatsby saturday night live live scripts i would do it with movie scripts just any piece of great writing i would do that with and when you do this it's kind of like how you learn an instrument the way that we teach people how to play music it's incredibly effective so if i hand you a guitar or a piano i don't say go ahead write a song i tell you copy the star spangled banner go play jingle bells go look at jimmy hendrix go look at led zeppelin play all this all these copy all these other people steal their work for a little while and or whatever genre you're interested go and copy them exactly and in time you're going to learn how to feel the texture you're going to see the patterns that work best that works extremely well with writing and it's the same concept i call it copy work um this is how a lot of people uh used to learn our school our schooling the way that we do it now it's changed over the last handful of decades but for a long time people used to do this ben franklin was a great writer and he said this is how he learned how to write and it's really effective so it's called copy work the second thing that you can do and i'm biased neville is my good friend but there's a guy named neville medora and i actually met him because i bought his course and i bought his course and then after i took his course i became friends with him and years later we became best friends and he's what's the best man at my wedding so i love neville and so i'm biased but his course is what i took to learn about copywriting he has he's got this course called copywriting course it's spelled with a k copy with a k and course with a k i don't know it's how it stands out it's a great course i don't know how much it costs right now it could cost a few hundred bucks or a hundred i don't even know but it's relatively affordable and i think if you don't like it he'll refund you his money your money but anyway it's a great course so it teaches a lot of this this stuff it's worth it it's totally worth it and i actually think i used to promote this so much that if you go to copywritingcourse.com slash sam i've got like a referral link and i think there's like a 50 off code or something you could use so uh if that interests you do that the third thing is this book called advertising secrets of the written word by joe sugarman it's a great book it costs ten dollars and i bet you if you google google it correctly you can find a free pdf of it online it's a great book that walks you through copywriting principles and why certain things work and why they don't and finally the last thing it's not a copywriting thing but it's a writing thing and it's a book by stephen king called on writing and the first half of the book is it reads really fast it's only 250 pages maybe the first half it's all about his tools and tricks and his toolbox he calls it his toolkit or his toolbox for writing well and it's incredibly effective it's he has got rules like don't use too many adverbs or keep your sentences short things like that it's incredibly effective it's a great book on writing the second half of the book is about his biography and it's really really fascinating so it's called on writing by stephen king so the second skill set that i wanted to go through copywriting i think that because i know how i would say i'm a pretty good copywriter i'm a b because i am a b copywriter until the day i die i will never be homeless i will always make money now verdict still out if i'm going to be very very wealthy but i will bet everything which i i am betting everything by starting businesses and things like that that no matter what happens i will always be able to make a really good salary whether as an employee or selling someone else's products so i think that copywriting is incredibly effective it's it's just it's really useful for your life business and just living you
