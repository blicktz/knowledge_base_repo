Hiss-o-kun! Hiss-o-kun! My name is Kevin Ndigg.

Lindsey. Andrew. My name is Elliot Walker.

I work at Rakuten Marketing. I work at Atlassian. I write jokes.

I write funny articles. Tintry. I've never been to a HustleCon.

My heart is pounding right now. I have not been to a HustleCon before, but I'm really looking forward to my first time. It will smell like success.

Oh god. I don't know man. I'm hoping it smells like pizza in 40s.

I'm gonna say kale. Maybe like a sweet potato or something. It's a pepper.

It can be spicy. It's good for you. It's like not terrible tasting.

I think they like to sleep. Cause like they're underground before they're picked. It's kinda me.

Shondlyn Ma? Shondlyn Mai? I'm most excited for Pyo Kadakia.

I use ClassPass everyday. It's gotta be Jenny Rubio. From away.

Kitsune stat. For sure. No.

I figure hopefully there will be somebody on either side of me. You know I wasn't nervous before but now I'm nervous. Like the theme parks where they have some attractions and where people get wet when they sit in the front rows.

I mean the hope is where you don't sit down and somebody doesn't sit next to you because you smell that or something. I hope that's not gonna happen. But no I'm not.

I hope I can sit as close to the stage as possible. Oh bleh at least 20. Six million.

I have no f***ing clue. I'm gonna guess like 10 million. I got a pass.

I, I also. 12 million. 12 million.

12 million. 12 million.
