Sam this the secrets my success right here a plain gray t-shirt free shout out Kohl's these is this is the Kohl's super soft tee I wear a new shirt basically every day um which feels phenomenal you remember the TV show cribs where Master P would only wear a pair of Air Force Ones one time what do you think my last name stands for I am Master all right I have a uh an idea for you so would you like to hear billion dollar healthcare idea actually healthcare is the wrong word healthcare actually when people tell me healthcare ideas I just kind of tune out and run away I'm like uh isn't that like super complicated hard and impossible let me just let me just ignore this completely um but I think you'll like this one so have you ever done an executive health checkup not yet but Nick Huber's convincing me that I should do it okay so these things are pretty interesting have you done one I've never done one I've uh I've tried I've basically gone through the process of booking and there was like that's kind of the point they didn't have a lot of availability yeah so I have a long wait list oh I gotta travel to Arizona to do this like geez like if this was just here in the Bay Area I would have done it yesterday but it's not well that's the idea let's open one of these up in the Bay Area in LA and in New York okay so what are these so an executive health checkup is basically something that CEOs high net worth individuals will do where they basically pay somewhere between five and ten thousand dollars usually to go for a one or two day visit to a medical center and you do a battery of tests and just think of it like the four seasons meets a doctor's checkup and so you go and it's kind of this executive VIP treatment where you go and they just put you through a bunch of tests all in one day which normally if you try to do in your traditional thing like first of all your normal doctor's gonna be like why do you need this test you don't have it do you are you having heart issues it's like no I just want to like proactively measure my like heart health every year and like make sure I'm on top of that um and so you most doctors won't recommend these uh you know normally secondly if you even if you did you wouldn't get all your appointments done in a day just like one day knock it all out take months uh it'd be spread out it'd take forever um and each one you're like kind of waiting in line you don't have the uh you know the TSA you know pre-check to be able to just go through and do this so this is our actually better analogy is actually flying private and a lot of times they wouldn't talk to each other right it's not comprehensive yeah okay so why is this an interesting business idea so the Mayo Clinic which is probably the leader in doing this is estimated to do over a hundred million dollars a year on just their executive health checkup service right so that's basically seventeen thousand the last number they publicly released was seventeen thousand patients did it in 2015 um and you basically got to fly they have four locations they're Arizona Jacksonville Minnesota or London so like not in you know hot spots but like that's where they have their their big hospitals and so Mayo is doing this the Cleveland Clinic does this and then there's a bunch of private practices that will do this too so my idea is that somebody needs to create this for SF LA New York it's the Soho House for Medicine and um you know just charge a 10 to 20 thousand a year membership fee and it's an annual checkup for you or your spouse even and um if you can get basically 5 000 members across uh you know in in any of those geos you're doing 50 million a year of recurring revenue that's like 100 patients a week right it's like it's not insane it's something like this especially with the like longevity Brian Johnson like Huberman like there is a very very big trend in this direction and I don't really think that genie's going back in the bottle like I don't think that people are five years from now are gonna be like I just don't care about health anymore like I just don't think it's going that way I think people will get disillusioned with some of the things that are happening but I think on the whole more people are becoming you know health conscious than before and as that kind of high net worth class it becomes a high status thing to do to be you know health optimized I think that this is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger when we started this pod I think I said one of the big things that I'm bullish on for the next like 10 20 30 years is I always thought it's insane that you can have like a cancer in your body and like the conversation of well had we just known about this sooner we could have fixed this but we don't we or we didn't so you're dead uh and like that's kind of crazy to think that like had you just walked through the doors and gotten this test you would have been this was could have been solvable 100 years from now it's going to be insane that you didn't know how your body was doing yeah I agree maybe 50 years from now I don't know I don't know what the number is but like for sure by 100 years like the idea that you could it's like dude my grandpa used to walk around and he had no fucking clue what his like glucose levels were he didn't know if he had cancer people just had cancer it's like you know when we talk about like smallpox and polio just killing people or like you know like I don't know like how'd you get around without Google Maps it's like oh you just like you just keep stopping at gas stations and then you'd unfold this map you'd trace your finger and then you'd ask your guy and he'd tell you like when you see a blue thing turn left and like that's how you got across the country it's like going to a restaurant and saying you want smoking or non-smoking sections it's like wait that was a thing you you could go to a smoking section of a restaurant you know like because I that was one of the things I was alive for I remember as a kid it's like saying uh you only have smoking available fine we'll do that do you know what else that's similar to starting a newsletter today and not using that's what it's similar to that's the thrill of the shield today I'm gonna tell you guys about beehive easiest way to start a newsletter spin it up uh start your newsletter it has all the growth tools built in it's got an ad network so you can start making money on your newsletter even if you have a small newsletter I see people every week on Twitter posting that they're making a thousand dollars a month three thousand dollars a month on their newsletters and they don't even have that big of a newsletter it's pretty crazy uh putting your thoughts out there aside from the money is I would say the most underrated thing that a smart person can do if you're a dumb person you don't need to do this but if you're a smart person putting your thoughts out there and creating a magnet that will attract like-minded people create a little landing area for luck in your life where people can reach out to you because they heard something you said or they agreed with something you said or they offer you a job or they want to work with you or partner with you that's what happens when you when you publish and so highly encourage people to do it and if you're going to do it use beehive it's spelled b-e-e-h-i-i-v.com weird name beehive but it's a good great service and uh Tyler's awesome you guys I do think people should check it out Tyler's uh one of the interesting entrepreneurs that we've come across uh by the way actually the best thing about Tyler is his playlist on Spotify so if you go on Spotify you need music for while you work he has a playlist called Big Desk Energy is it actually good it's awesome dude I listen to it all the time when I work Big Desk Energy great name and it's a great place and he keeps it updated so he keeps curating it as he goes and I've told him I was like dude I you know beehive's great but the playlist is legendary if the playlist is so good but you invested in beehive so that's the one that needs to work out so yeah I did invest in beehive also um I invested once I use the newsletter twice a week and I use the playlist seven days a week all right beehive beehive.com um by the way the companies that are like kind of testing this out you did one of these right these like see are they MRIs that you can go to it's like 500 and you just walk off the street and get an MRI and it tells you if you've got cancer or something like that you do a full body MRI um at places and so I went and did one but I I've been you know the reason I didn't talk a ton about it afterwards was I just don't know the science behind some of these things and so it might be great I know several people that have said oh I did a pre-nuvo scan and we found something blah blah blah I've talked to doctor friends who are like this is BS um and I'm always like you know there's like a there's like a Theranos uh sixth sense in my body where I'm like just be careful before you endorse something that you don't understand the science of that's making a very bold claim that doesn't mean that they're doing something wrong or that anything is up with it I'm just saying I have no idea if these things work I do know that the stuff like the executive checkup where they're doing like more tried and trust trusted like tests are um you know a bit more more safe right just like the Lindy effect right they've been around for a longer period of time more widely accepted in the community more testing has been done they've made it through that gauntlet whereas the new stuff the full body MRI it might be awesome it might be overkill I'm not sure I can't say dude we have a lady so we do like for Hampton we have like perks so you get discounts to different services and we partnered with one of these MRI companies and this member and her boyfriend or her husband went and got one together and he had cancer they caught cancer and he got surgery and he's good and uh she was telling me the story I was like that's insane that absolutely insane so there's one positive story yeah I think they said like what when I was there again I don't want to repeat these claims I don't know what's true but I think they were like you know one out of twenty one out of thirty people come in find something that's insane it's so funny when you go do these by the way you're just like no news is good news so you're like I'm gonna go voluntarily check this thing give myself a very high anxiety day and then I really what I want is this anti-climatic like yeah you're fine dude 35 what are you doing uh you're normal do you feel bad no oh okay cool then uh that's that's the best case scenario at the end of these things hey real quick you know one of the cool parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes the fine folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show uh Sam did you see this thing that this guy tweeted at us the AI MFM theme song the rap song yeah Ari can you play this listening to the dudes who turn their dreams into bust Sam Paul his hustle muscles sealed the deal on the cusp of millions they say 30 a figure lust for trust Sean spinning narratives his stories grip they clutch podcasts vibing my first million stirring the pot Sean the ball a shot caller no small boy stuff he's got both for sage and a slack of productivity unlocked saying six pack dreams aesthetics they cannot be stopped MFM hosts with the most sharing that wealth of brain from tips to the realm of the game they still without restraint how did he do this so he goes here's here's my prompt a rap about Sam and Sean the host of my first million John Sam previously sold his company called the hustle for an undisclosed amount but everybody thinks it's 30 million Sean is a storytelling master the laziest most productive person who loves basketball and says no boy stuff Sam loves big muscles and six packs and then it generated that song it says that I've got six pack dreams I got six pack dreams yeah it's so good it was like actually very good for a AI song and the second one cracked me up this is uh this is me coming into today's podcast recording just put the gif up on the screen if you're on audio go to YouTube so you can watch this it's always funny yeah there are some internet memes that are funny for like 20 years this might be dude did you see this thing I believe it's called is it called Sona where you can make songs s u n o dot AI it is freaking awesome it is so cool it is awesome and like you can make it sound like Frank Sinatra is singing any song that you want him to sing and so you could use it for theme songs or background music different things it is awesome it's one of the few AI things that I've seen and I'm like this is wonderful this works there's a perfect use case for this it's really good dude my uncreative ass doesn't know how to use these I'll be like uh make it uh journey singing don't stop believing it's like their actual song I'm like I guess I just wanted to hear that song you're like I go listen to it yeah you're like a journey song about a boxer in Philadelphia and he's trying to beat the USSR and what do you got and it's eye of the tiger dude um there is a cool version of these though um you see that Drake tweeted out a song that he made using AI uh like AI Tupac and AI Biggie on his track yeah it's awesome I love these things dude let me tell you this story so I had to do some camera I had to set up this camera at my house and I don't know how to do it and a friend of a friend connected me with these three kids they're 20 years old and they uh they have like a marketing agency but I guess on the side they like help people like me set up their camera or whatever they've come out here they help me out and after about four hours of them in my house doing work I'm like all right so what's your guys's stories like I could tell that you're like being polite and like you're trying to ask a little bit about me and like let's talk let's let's hang out so it's these three kids that are 20 years old they dropped out of college to start a marketing agency and to get business they go to uh what's it called is it called a better business bureau like we're like your local small town communities have these like business bureaus they go there and start convincing all these small businesses to make promotional videos for their website so they start making videos for their website and then they're like well what do I do with this video now so they go to their clients and they go well you should run google ads we'll do that for you and we'll make a website and they're like all right cool I've got this website and how do I get leads and like well we'll run the ads and then we'll just get leads to you and I go wow pretty cool what software you guys use and they go we just use like our iPhones and they go and matter of fact my phone's ringing right now it looks like someone's calling for this particular landscaping company so they put their phone on speaker and they go hi this is uh xyz landscaping services how can I help you and uh they go hi this is rosemary I live here and um I'm trying to inquire about seeing if you guys can come and like build this like small project at my house and she goes oh yes ma'am I'm not the owner of the business but I'll put you in touch with her right now and so they you have their iphone out they click hold they call their client right there and this is at like nine o'clock on a saturday they go hey linda I've got rosemary on the phone right now she wants this this and this I'm gonna merge you two right now and she goes all right sounds good he clicks merge and he goes hey rosemary this is ad of the odor um she I feel they're all in about what you want and I'll let you guys take it from here and then he clicks mute and just puts the phone in his pocket and he goes that's that's four hundred dollars right there and they're doing fifteen thousand dollars a month this way these three kids they're like yeah we like have been grinding at this for like 12 months so then we're finally at like 15 000 we're able to pay ourselves we've been each been door dashing in our free time in order to make bills uh pay our bills because we live on our own and I just think to myself you've got it great stories begin exactly like this you guys they're asking me for advice I go guys you're it's gonna work out just keep doing this for five years dude the best part of the story by far is that's four hundred dollars right there but yeah I'm gonna start saying that every time I unlock my phone and I'm with my wife I'm just gonna be like another three hundred dollars it's just it was awesome what these kids were doing and uh I just respect the hell of that type of stuff and it it just showed me these guys have what it takes and this is how like great stories begin is these little like it's not complicated stuff it's really simple it's not sexy but it's awesome dude my brother-in-law I was asking him over the weekend I go yeah what's what's your favorite job you've ever had and he goes oh easy smoothie king in high school I was like smoothie king in high school you've had a whole he's 40 he's like 43 or something I was like your greatest job was your first job 23 years ago or 26 years ago he's like yeah no doubt and I was like why did you like it so much like free smoothies or something he goes no no my boss was so funny he's like my boss was this character he's like you know that thing I say every time I answer the phone I go yeah he goes I stole that from my boss and the thing he says on the phone is the thing his boss said so one day he was in smoothie king and the phone rings like the smoothie king like landline rings and his boss is basically like you know if my brother-in-law is 17 this is like a 19 year old you know normal dude he's a manager of smoothie king kind of an overweight guy and he goes I must be Jordan about that summer league and he picked up the phone and my brother-in-law thought it was so funny that he just came up with that on the fly like it must be Michael Jordan calling about summer league and for literally 26 years my brother-in-law every time the phone rings he goes I must be Jordan about that summer league and I could tell it just puts him in a good mood every single time well now the new one is uh when you hang out um you want to do one what do you got all right I got another thing that's funny well it's funny and not funny but the funny thing about funny things is that if you take a really not funny thing like war and you multiply it times a funny thing together they become funny that's the beauty that's the beauty of humor bold statement let's see let's see how uh you pull together the pizza meter do you know what the pizza meter is I don't know what the pizza meter is okay so the pizza meter is a way that people on the internet knew that the Iran strikes were happening before the news reported it you might be wondering how could just random people on the internet know this before mainstream media and the answer is the pizza meter and so the pizza meter is basically a signal that people watch for which is basically they study the um they watch the pizza shops that are around the white house the Pentagon places like that and they look that if there's a sudden spike and if you know for example if you go on Google and it says busier than usual and you'll see like wow 10 p.m it's like spiked way higher than normal that you know that something's going down that's the only reason that the closest pizza shop to the Pentagon or closest pizza shop to the white house would have spiked like that is that there's something going down that has the staff there late at night ordering pizzas and so they know and it's basically been a signal for like the uh the invasion of Kuwait the Iraq war most recently when Iran launched those missiles at Israel um and so people knew that this was coming because of the pizza meter and the fun the story behind this is pretty funny I don't know if you I guess if you've never heard of it you probably don't know the backstory either but it got popular because there was a guy named Frank and Frank owned 60 franchises of like pizza shops around DC and he actually went and told the LA Times he was like um the news media doesn't know about something big's gonna happen they're in bed sleeping but my guys my guys are out there on the front lines doing deliveries and we know when something's going down because we'll get a spike of deliveries to the Pentagon at you know 11 p.m at midnight at 1 a.m and that never happens and so this happened and then the government basically had to shift their they sent out a memo they're like hey guys you can't be doing this and so now they send staff out to try to pick up pizzas and do all this other stuff to kind of like smoothen out the curve where it's not so obvious that some shit's going down isn't that hilarious dude this is brilliant there's a phrase for this and I can't remember what it was but it's basically where you do all of this work to protect something and just the smallest dumbest thing that you forget about that you don't even realize is the key to you know unraveling the entire thing this is awesome this is so cool and I'm reading the Wikipedia right now it started in 1983 with the invasion of Granada and then again in 1989 the invasion of Panama what they noticed was that Domino pizza deliveries increased dramatically right before the invasion by 25 percent like so this has been going on for decades this is this is the password one two three of wars it's like the easy to guess password that like you didn't they didn't realize actually the true origin story was this of this was apparently during the cold war the soviet intelligence agency was using indicators like this so not just the pizza thing but other things like this to try to alert them of a potential global crisis and they called it uh pizant like pizza and then intelligence pizant and um so that's how that's like how it started and then Frank kind of put the spotlight on it and there's other ones too so like recently so this happened before the Iran thing people were like uh oh pizza meter spiking right now and then sure enough within 24 hours the news came out about the Iran thing the other signals people were like hey wait it's not just pizzas because they realized that the second best signal is that gay bars in the area see a like a big drop off in foot traffic when the government like is when they're busy basically and so people were looking at gay bars there was a guy who was like hey guys I can confirm because the the politicians would normally be going to the gay bars yeah exactly so this guy who tweeted out he's like hey guys I don't know what this means but I'm at uproar right now and there's way less government guys there than usual tonight and normally like I don't know whatever Thursday night this place is popping there's nobody here and so now there's the uh the DC bear index which is basically trying to measure um you know like the gay bar uh foot traffic as well so this is up there on my Mount Rushmore of silly indexes there's there's some other great ones uh that you might not know about do you know about the Big Mac index I think you probably know that one is that just the price of a big Mac or it's like a better uh indicator of like inflation or what they call PPP so uh purchasing power parity so basically how much is a dollar versus a euro versus a franc versus a yen and the most common denominator between all of those countries is what's the price of a Big Mac and so you can go see that oh man a Big Mac relatively is now more expensive in one place than the other that basically indicates that that currency got weaker it's a more true indicator of the currency strength or weakness than like what the government will tell you so that's uh that's what Big Mac index is supposed to be and by the way all of these are you know they're not they're not bulletproof so there's people who are like oh the pizza thing doesn't work anymore blah blah blah who knows I I you know I can't say that these are like you know perfect science or anything but they're they're funny the other one that's great is the Waffle House index you know this one uh for hurricanes yeah for storms basically they there's a three color a three color system so Waffle House which is open 24 7 365 so it's like uh how do you know how bad a storm is it's basically green is Waffle House is still open an operational full menu yellow is it's open partial menu and red is it's closed if Waffle House is closed and the guy like the director of FEMA came out basically was like you know it's bad when the Waffle House is closed and so it became the whole thing the Waffle House index is awesome that is a hilarious bit I I thoroughly enjoy this one and by the way have you ever noticed if if Waffle Houses are supposed to be open all the time why do they even have locks on the doors do they maybe they don't they do because I went one to one recently and I was like if you guys are open all the time why do you even why do you even lock the place up I'm sure they enjoyed that conversation like look dude you know waffles are not like scrambled or what what do you want uh it didn't work out uh that's pretty good uh where'd you why why did this interest you there's this general trend which is like whenever there's like a murder that happens or like a crime or there's like the Boston bombing do you remember like Reddit was basically solving it almost in real time or like yeah but they got it like they got it all wrong yeah but there is like yes that seems important but it is pretty fun to follow along and just see like what the open source intelligence community can do and like they do get things wrong but there's you know there there's several examples of this that are like you know if you go look at the root call the root the root um you know discovery of maybe some conspiracy or some uh um some some expose it's usually like some guy on a message board notices something and that's like often like how things get figured out and so you know that's how they caught the you know the Silk Road for example uh you know they went and looked at message board posting for example um but you know I just think that's cool that like there's a there is like the official agencies but then there's sort of like this open source community of internet sleuths and uh you know I don't think they're they're not necessarily better but I just think it's a cool in addition to uh what it what exists out there let me show you something that I saw recently that is actually related to indexes so I got curious about uh I was looking at like I saw an article about some of the most profitable companies in the world and now let me list a few that are very obvious so Visa of course Visa is going to be one of the more profitable companies something like 40 percent uh income compared to their revenue Nvidia Berkshire Hathway Hathway very obvious ones two less obvious ones public storage I think we've talked about public storage you know they make something like 50 profit on each dollar that they they take in on revenue another one is Relics we talked about Relics they own the academic publishing industry and it's like a very controversial thing because it's kind of a pay-to-play model and it's a little it's a little weird but there's two that stuck that stood out to me the first one I'll tell you because you may not know but it's called the Intercontinental Exchange do you know what the Intercontinental Exchange is no well the second one that stood out is NASDAQ so the Intercontinental Intercontinental Exchange owns the New York Stock Exchange and so these two stock exchanges are some of the most profitable public companies in the country something like uh I think in 2018 the Intercontinental Exchange I think it's I think they call it ICE I-C-E 60 percent profit for every dollar that it took in and this company is worth something like I think today it's worth 35 or 40 billion dollars one of the most profitable companies out there and it makes uh I think 10 billion in revenue so it's just like printing cash and it kind of got me interested that these stock market exchanges might be the world's greatest business models because when you think about a stock market exchange once a stock once a company lists on an exchange they're basically never going to go away and hopefully a great company like a Ford or something like that can last for 100 years it's incredibly challenging to build a new stock exchange there's actually only I think 15 of them in the world like 15 like legit big ones and the barriers to entry are super big but it got me interested do you know who started a stock exchange recently have you heard about this it's called the long-term stock exchange Eric Reese from the the book uh the lean startup one of the most famous startup books of all time so I think he started this in 2010 or 2012 a while ago and it's taken a while to get going and the reason he started it was at the end of the lean startup and like the the epilogue he lists like a bunch of ideas that are interesting to him and he said on this talk he goes all these ideas have been started my readers have messaged me saying I've started this this and this after this book and he goes the one thing that no one started was a long-term stock exchange so I decided to do it and one of the reasons he decided to do it was because so the large uh index funds or the or a lot of the large traders do you know how long they hold a stock for on average no I have no idea 10 minutes that's how long on average it's I'm super bullish on this stock for the next 10 minutes yeah and his point at home with all my ideas yeah it's for 10 minutes is the average hold time and he was like I think that's insane because nothing has changed with that company and it really bothered him and another thing that bothered him is there's this chart you like one chart businesses there's this chart that shows the average number of public companies and it's been going just straight down so I think 20 years ago there was something like 10,000 I think today there's like 4,000 public companies so people just don't want to take their company public for a variety of reasons one of those reasons being is that it's kind of a short term like what does Warren Buffett say in the short term it's a uh it's a what does he say it's like a measuring stick but in the long term contest long term it's a weighing machine yeah that's right and he's like that has a lot of people don't like that they don't want to take their companies public because of that so basically in 2011 he proposed this idea of a this thing called the long-term stock exchange where you get more votes for how long you've held the stock so if you held the stock for longer than someone who who's just recently bought it you get more votes into how the companies run theoretically and he actually raised something like a hundred million dollars to start this I think Andreessen Horowitz funded it and a bunch of other wasn't the only thing right I think there was like a mandatory one year hold time right wasn't there like a if you buy you you can't sell within a certain period of time wasn't that the rule yes and there's and there's a few other rules where the companies in order to get listed on the stock exchange you have to do what you just said you also have to like have a plan as to how your company is going to be great for the next many decades and so they like it's all about long-term stuff and so yeah there are a whole bunch of rules about this now the story is exactly going well because I think there's only like two or three or four companies listed on his exchange so far I think it's uh Twilio uh I think Twilio Asana and ThredUp I think those are like I don't think there's that many companies listed there and those companies are also listed on the Nasdaq so I don't know why you would use Eric Ries's long-term stock exchange however I thought this idea I didn't understand it when I was younger I'm like why do you why do you need to do that now I'm kind of growing to understand like that is pretty badass and this is an epic idea that has not played out yet but I was researching these exchanges and they're so fascinating at how they work it's this weird it's a little bit crony capitalism because they're in bed with the SEC so they're in bed with the government and there's a lot of regulation around this whole thing but it's so fascinating and Eric Ries was talking about starting it he was like in order to start it you have to file paperwork and it's called SEC 0001 so when you file paperwork with the SEC even for a startup it's all these paperwork this is literally paperwork number one it's the first like it's their first document and he like has and he filled out all this paperwork and now he's finally he's kind of starting to get a little bit traction but I found this to be so fascinating these these stock exchanges and how they're probably one of the best business models I could think of all right I have a bunch of short stories uh related to this number one uh I met the CEO of I think either the NASDAQ or NYSE he came to my office once and I didn't uh he came to meet Michael Birch who was our like main investor and they were hanging out and he's like oh come in here and join and so I'm sitting there and I'm like I didn't even know the exchange was a business I was like what the like why would it have a CEO it's a business and he's like oh it's not only a business it's a phenomenal business and he's like basically we have the exchange and the exchange in the U.S. obviously is the big one but what they do is it's a software company actually so what they do is they power the stock exchanges of like a whole bunch of different countries so it's like oh I mean Finland needs a stock exchange they're not going to build their own thing they'll just take the U.S.'s like battle tested super you know military grade exchange and they'll just be a customer of it and so that was the first like line of business is basically that countries will use their uh software to run their own exchanges the next is that they basically fight for IPOs so he's like yeah big deal is basically how do we versus the NASDAQ um compete to get you know Facebook's you know IPO how do we get the next big tech IPOs so that's why he was in Silicon Valley meeting people was like these are long-term relationships and like when the time comes that they're deciding which exchange to list on like that's a big deal for us and it's a network effect right the more great companies you have on your exchange the more valuable your exchange is but it's like a network effect married with enterprise um you know like super enterprise contracts married with like complete defensibility like nobody like literally like regulatory defensibility so you get the defensibility of network effects and of regulations and then you get the business model of enterprise you know enterprise sales and so pretty phenomenal um business actually it's also a marketplace right because they could take fees on all the different transactions that exist so pretty phenomenal business you're absolutely right and um I was surprised to even learn that this was a business it's just another reminder that like everything you see around you it didn't just show up it's there because somebody somewhere has a motive and a profit in order to generate that product or that service or that thing that exists and once you see that you can't like unsee it uh so that's my first story second story is about Eric Reese so I'm a I love Eric Reese uh like his blog was one of the key blogs that like you know shifted my like entrepreneurial journey like I was like oh this makes a lot of sense like that's why we failed we should have been doing this shit and I got to meet Eric I went to his house in San Francisco nicest guy nice guy but also wasn't just like pleasantries he was nice but he was so helpful like I was like oh we're planning on doing this it's and he's like okay that's an interesting idea I was like yeah we're doing this big launch blah blah blah he's like don't do the big launch and I was like but I just told you I told I like talked for five minutes about my big launch plan he's like not a believer in big launches uh here's why and he's like basically here's what you're gonna do you're gonna take the worst version of the product that you've ever made and will ever make that you have no idea if there's demand for and you're gonna completely blow your wad telling everybody how great this thing is and you have this like you're gonna put all this energy into that and it's gonna completely like the odds of you just getting it right and your initial product being good enough is so low that you're actually like lowering your odds of success by doing that and then now it's like pretty common this like fallacy of the big launch this is like 10 plus years ago and at that time like big launches were still kind of a thing that people tried to do and um he talked me off that ledge and then also I was like uh I came to him and I was like you know we have this uh idea it's not really working so I'm thinking about pivoting to this he's like okay here's he's like how do you plan to pivot I was like oh I think we're gonna make these like change this feature and start to test this and blah blah blah he's like cool here's what you need to do he's like you need to take your old idea you need to bring it to town square you need to shoot it in the head and I was like what and he's like your team is gonna be so confused unless you explicitly tell them that hey all the shit I've been saying for two years it's changing like the old assumptions turned out to be wrong we learned this by doing this and now we know that's not the path we now know that this is a more viable path that this is a better path to be trying that old idea is done that old assumption we had is done and he's like you need to take it in the middle of everybody and you need to do a public execution of the assumptions and the ideas that you no longer are married to because nine out of ten CEOs are too afraid to um to sort of admit that they were wrong or to like be really explicit that like no we that was a dead end we need to go back and we need to try something new is that you try to like blend it together and just kind of like keep iterating in the shadows basically you're like kind of like your team is always like half confused and they don't really know what they're supposed to be doing is that the thing we've been saying or this new thing or do we just bolt this new thing onto the old thing and then that doesn't really work either and he's like you know when Instagram pivoted and they became Instagram they basically were like look this other thing bourbon this idea of location based check-ins we're not doing that shit anymore locations suck uh we used to say location means everything location now means nothing it's photos with filters okay and we may have a new app with a new name and it's photos with filters and they're like but the old app had photos with filters in it he's like yeah but the old app was about the old shit and this is not about that anymore this is now about this new thing and that was very very valuable advice that I don't know nobody else had ever told me and I bet nobody else would ever tell me and I'm saying it here on the pod because you know there's probably a hundred people out there that need to pivot and like this was good advice it really helped me that's such a good metaphor too that's a very that's a very uh that's a very sharp metaphor yeah exactly I needed to be punched in the face because like most founders founders we ask for advice and really what we're asking for is can you please affirm the things I want and anything you said that I don't want even though it's important I'm gonna like ignore to my own detriment and then three years later two years later when it's all failed I'll be like huh maybe there was some like wisdom in that if only I had listened and uh I thought it was really good that he just like punched me in the nose so that I couldn't ignore the advice and most people that that's actually very generous most people won't put themselves out there to do that most people don't need it doesn't didn't help him you know I went to his house that changed my life he never heard from me again right like I've never bumped into him again and so you know I paid back nothing uh for that but he kind of went out on a limb and was like look I'm gonna be direct with you bro and uh I really appreciate directness because that's actually what I what I wanted do you think his new company's gonna work well it's his old company because it's 10 years it's like 10 plus years old now dude yeah I don't I mean as much as I love the guy it just seems like this idea has not come to fruition there's you said Twilio Asana and ThredUP Twilio delisted voluntarily so now there's Asana and ThredUP they have two companies listed on the exchange so like in terms of objectively it's not working unless there's some other you know momentum I know that for a long time they really couldn't do anything they needed the like regulatory approvals and that was like a multi-year thing so I it does seem like they crossed that but you know it doesn't seem like they have a lot of traction at the moment I wish they did I think it's a great idea I wish they did too I wish they did too in the words of uh what's his name Gary Halpert never has more money been lost than trying to convince the market what they should do versus what they want to do maybe long-termism is what you want the market you think the market should do and not necessarily what it wants to do maybe that's not what companies or investors want I think when I was thinking about this I'm like how do you make this work and I'm like well I think the biggest way to make it work but this has to do with the SEC is to get rid of quarterly earnings calls I think quarterly earnings calls should probably go away I think that this is actually something that I think Trump proposed this but many other people have proposed this I think he's like no audits never check anything he uh I think I think that's something he proposed but I think earnings is ridiculous every three months it's kind of crazy um but that's beyond I think long-term stock exchanges like purview like I think that's like some SEC bullshit but anyway I thought it was interesting I doesn't sound like it's getting the traction that I wish it would get but I still think it's intriguing the coolest innovation in this space was actually from crypto crypto basically yeah they had the token FTX no no no no like uh like crypto tokens that it wasn't uh this they didn't clear this for regulatory wise but the the idea was actually really good which is that a app should be able to issue tokens to the users or members of its community that are helping build it we've all been a part of things early on where without that user contributing without them being a part of it without them to them actually participating whether it's Airbnb or it's the drivers on Uber like for them to not get anything or like you know Reddit for example Reddit after like 20 years was like we're going public we made billions of dollars and the mods who you know have made this place what it is and who actually created these communities and run them uh they're like you we're gonna go we're gonna do the thing no company does we're gonna let you buy the stock at the at the price 20 years later when in reality like the the proper way to do this is what crypto was trying to do which was let any app create an incentive mechanism that will that will reward early participation of people who bring value to the network so that if the network actually becomes valuable you by being there and putting in work that was like the equivalent of an investment you were able to invest energy what if you do that it actually gives you a chance to spin up new networks or new things now of course all these things have the other side of the coin which is you might attract the wrong person the person that's just there to get the early coins right it's like the the worst customer is the one who's like the coupon clipper who's just you know there to just redeem their early early thing then then quickly cash it out and bounce and so there's all kinds of things you have to get right to make this work but a lot of them are evangelists yeah like you know the the idea that you could allow your early adopters early evangelists and early contributors to own a piece of the upside in something I thought was a really good idea and a big step forward um that just simply doesn't exist in the traditional system today all right well that's my bit on stock exchanges I'm gonna be paying attention I I think this will make it to Eric Eric you gotta reach out to Sean man and let him let him thank you uh face to face um what do you got all right this is my um hustler of the week so we kind of have uh we got the blue collar side hustle we got the Billy of the week that's for the billionaire of the week I don't know what we call this lady she's the uh the hustler of the week which is just somebody who's just making shit happen her name was Danielle Baskin which I thought was the same name as the Tiger King lady but maybe it's not um here's her story so I saw that this lady is doing a fruit swag company basically imagine you're a company and you're hosting some conference your HubSpot hosting inbound and you want to have something cool something unique for like you know 10,000 attendees they got enough t-shirts how many koozies can one have uh oh great a pen how thoughtful of you and so what she does is she's like I got it put your name on fruit baby let's do a salesforce avocado let's do a lift banana let's do a mailchip uh pineapple or whatever it is I guess it should have been a mailchip banana uh but basically she prints corporate names onto fruits and charges five bucks per fruit to the companies and companies pay for this for their conferences and she's made a bunch of money doing this I think it's awesome and I what I liked about her was I looked her up and she's like this like kind of this uh opinionated artist and she's done a bunch of these random businesses so she uh she was like bike helmets are ugly so she painted her own bike helmet and then she kept getting stopped at places for um for her bike helmet and so she's like okay and so she created a bike helmet company that just does like cool looking bike helmets and then that was like her first business and so she was doing that she like made us she's like I don't know anything about tech but like she went on like I don't know Squarespace and then like got like a you know put stripe on there or PayPal on there and started taking payments so that started to work then she's like all right where do I sell these helmets so she bought a vintage tricycle that has a wagon attached to it like a three-wheeler with a wagon and she just piled up all the helmets into the wagon and made like a cool little stand and the people like yo I love your stand and she's like huh all right I'll start selling these stands and so now she sells the helmets and then she built the stand for the helmets and then there people loved her help her stand so much that she started doing uh she started selling sands I think the fruit thing started the same way she was like oh yeah just to be funny I created this this fruit thing and then people were like hey can you do that for my brand and it was just a great example of this this awesome quote from the founder of geek squad he said marketing is the tax that you pay for for an unremarkable product and this lady has such a remarkable product she just builds remarkable products products worth remarking on that she never does these to do marketing and she actually just spins up new businesses because she'll do she'll make something for herself and then 10 people will talk about it and she's like okay that's business that's a thing and she'll make it she has another thing called mask alike where you upload a picture of your face and it makes like a covid mask but the bottom half of your face on the mask and on her branded fruit website she needs some her copy is funky she needs to move this part up this is actually pretty good this should be the tagline go bananas and it says uh how they work with local farms to source produce and they put these like stickers on the produce it's pretty cool this is pretty cool if we do a mfm meetup we need to have this at one of them I don't know what our fruit would be but like I'm a big I'm a beat guy I like beats uh big big fan of you eat beats how do you eat how do eat a beat dude I think I told you this my buddy Sam Soley from college one day sent me a PowerPoint deck he's like oh I was listening to the podcast I haven't talked to this guy in years and he's like oh I heard the podcast you're talking about health here's my beats presentation I was like what and he just has this slide deck of all white slides no design and it just says beats want to have a longer life next slide beats want to have better sex next slide beats want to feel good every morning beats and he's just like everything you want is on the other side of just a few beats and he's like you need to buy raw beats you need to put them in a smoothie here's my recipe beats are amazing for you how do you eat them I just blend them up in a smoothie like what's that mean what part of blended up in a smoothie is unclear what do you mean that's incredibly unclear do you literally take a bunch of beats and put them in a smoothie and like you juice it I make a smoothie and one of the ingredients is beets okay that's what I was asking you just said but what you said was you just put beats in a blender and make it into something so what do you put what is your beat smoothie uh so his recipe his recipe will be spinach beets water uh I think like a splash of OJ he puts like olive oil salt he puts like different stuff that I never put in smoothies like olive oil I never would have thought of hemp seeds he makes like a killer like super healthy smoothie and uh I'll try to I'll publish the recipe I gotta go find the exact recipe I haven't done it in a couple years but for like a year and a half I was all on the beats train and now did it make you feel better yeah it feels great uh well mostly because his presentation was very convincing and so like I got placebo pretty hard there but the hard part is that raw beats are the worst for cleanup like you have to peel them and then they're and then everything is red your hands are pure red the cutting board is red your whole kitchen is red nothing like these things are like just pure ink and so that's the only reason I stopped was for a hundred a time I was like I'm just tired of like having red hands for the all day yeah you know so I need to figure out a way to do this I need some gloves this is the answer dude what a dork I love this guy yeah you made a face like it's gross but this is everything you stand for in life doing weird overkill stuff for health I'm not that overkill but it beats are like oh I don't actually you're running right now how long is that race you're training for what are you doing you're not overkill right how long is it about 50 of them about 50 of the miles oh okay so like a marathon wasn't enough you needed two but you're not overkill for sure uh all right well congratulations to Danielle how'd you find her I honestly have no idea are we like the Chris you're like the Christopher Columbus where it's like you discovered America it did not exist before you before you it was it was not a thing you came across it now it is a thing uh yeah by the way she to me is like the female Peter levels in real life so you know he's like the indie hacker just spins up cool ass projects online makes a bunch of money I feel like she's the female real life Peter levels so that's that's how I think about her I also have a couple of her ideas that she's had that she's been tinkering with so um Baskin has been tinkering with other applications for this idea for example what if companies sponsor produce that's at the store so you can buy discounted fruits or vegetables if it came with the brand's logo on it what if Taco Bell sponsors some tomatoes or avocados for instance and then you could think about the brand as you make your Super Bowl guacamole these are the thoughts going through the mind of Daniel Baskin dude she has a whole website full of like crazy things so she's done drone sweaters sweat sweaters and clothing for cold drones uh she's got the helmets thing she's oh my god she she has an escape room for your baby in your womb womb escape game is an escape room kit
