Like one of my, one of my goals, one, something, this is going to sound crazy. And this is the perfect, the perfect audience to say this, but like, I get so jacked up about the idea of like toppling a dictatorship one day. I get so excited by it.

And I'm like, I'm not even kidding. All right. Look at what I have on my head.

There we go. Oh, look at that. Look at this guy.

Wow. You went from dad to cool dad in one episode with that hat. I'm hip.

I'm hip. I saw you had the shirt too. Did you buy like a full uniform?

Are you actually just working there now or what? Jonathan got the hookup and he, and he got a swag bag from them and he gave, came over to my house the other day and gave it to me. And have you gotten any compliments or like, do, um, anybody under the age of like 25 recognize you now or something?

I'm a, a few, a few, a few young people. One young person called me cool guy. That's all the affirmation you're looking for now as a dad.

Get away from me cool guy. Yeah. Yeah.

Hey, why, why you staring at me, cool guy. Do you need something? that's how it was uh you want to kick us off who do we got all right we got patrick in the house patrick's been on before so the og listeners know all about patrick campbell pc as he's in my phone he uh created a company called profit well sold it for 200 million bucks he's got the background that we always talk about where i'm like i noticed that people who have this background tend to be winners more often than not he was a competitive debater uh some would call him a master debater he's a um he was in the the nsa the intelligence agency so he brought last time you were on you were telling us about all the crazy shit you did to gather intelligence as uh in the startup world so like how do you learn about what your competitors are doing and whatnot and now today he's back with a bunch of ideas and um i want to know what you've been doing because you sold your company for 200 million bucks and then you had a bunch of time on your hands and that's a deadly combo uh you sent you sent us something i want to start with this uh thing you texted us about the bezos number and i don't know too much about it so i want you to explain you go i've been i've been working on i've been searching for my bezos number i don't even know what that means explain what is the bezos number yeah totally so here's the thing as this started from a premise so sold the company basically um working at paddle and also thinking about like what the next thing looks like and what i found in the ideation process like i haven't come up with ideas in like 10 years i've helped like companies come up with ideas but it's just one of those interesting aspects of the entrepreneurship journey and my big belief is your job as an operator is to basically know your customer and know your space better than anyone else and you need to do this before you start building because a lot of entrepreneurs fall into this trap where we're really good at willing stuff into existence because that's our job except it's relatively easy to do that today so this means that like basic ideas are cheap mostly indefensible and worse they waste a lot of our time and so the first step icon in terms of an ideation process is using this bezos number framework and basically when jeff bezos started amazon he noticed this like crazy stat you know this new thing called the internet was growing 2700 per year um so he knows he's got to build something on it um he didn't know what it was but he was starting from the trend because when you go where the water's flowing as they say and ride a wave you don't need to be like a genius to figure out what a really cool business looks like so i have this doc and i'm happy to share it with the audience where myself and a researcher basically call through industry reports trend and stat websites um and then the hack that no one really probably uses but they should use um is we use google scholar and other academic kind of publishing sites uh to find all these trends because in academia you have a lot of like undergrads and grad students basically writing a bunch of papers about here's what's going on in the space here's all these numbers that are going up or down um and then i put this into a spreadsheet and then basically label a couple of different you know categories one in particular is like what's the doubling time of this particular trend um as well as like how long or how fast this trend is going what the causes are what the effects are and the basic idea is then i can find like hey the world needs something in this space or the world's going in this direction and partially i can figure out like oh this is something that i could get paid for kind of in that ikigai framework that you like sam um i can basically take that by looking at these trends so let's describe this sheet so basically it's like category so you got like social issues health care energy right so the big categories then within each one you have a trend and so like for example a trend would be top college admissions rates are dropping so and then it says stanford admissions went from 4.8 to 3.9 in the last five years and harvard dropped from six percent to four percent in the last five years um so then it says direction you know decreasing uh in five years you know what is the kind of rate that this is happening what's the doubling time so like how many years would it take for this to this trend to uh the where we're at today to double based on that rate and then here's the sources and possible causes and possible effects of it and so you have i don't know like a hundred in here basically uh let's read a couple of these out i want you to to kind of riff on on a couple of these or you can pick maybe what does it mean when it's in blue does that mean you like that one or something or what does that mean uh those are just some some interesting trends that we've gone deeper on basically all right let's do this random one i want you to talk about this number number of coral bleaching events i don't even know really what that means what is a coral bleaching event and why does that matter basically coral is uh you know dying out um you know essentially when there's like stressful um conditions coral ends up like bleaching so this particular idea like i don't know what a business could look like in here and that's not the point necessarily of like the bezos numbers it's like i'm not necessarily trying to find like one particular business i'm trying to find an overall trend right because some downstream effects of this could be there's more money that's from the government from regulation basically going into protecting you know international or you know national waters and there's a bunch of different things that are why is coral bleaching bad okay well let's go back to your high school biology uh class i didn't know that's what i would be teaching today but um the basic idea is like you're killing off ecosystems in the ocean right that's probably the most basic way i can say it and there's a lot of downstream effects when an entire ecosystem basically falls apart and the coral is a major don't act like i should know this man 90 percent of people 90 95 percent of people listening this do not know if coral it's beautiful coral it's alive coral it's part of the underwater ecosystem and it's like the butterfly effect you just take away big part of the ecosystem it's going to have all these like secondary effects on the fish do you care about fish sam or do we need to explain why fish matter do you not care about fish look you guys sean you know about don't don't get get off your but here's the point here's the point sam sam here's the point the point is we're looking for major trends and those major trends like you ran basically a trend service website like you understand the nature of trends what i'm looking for in a particular idea is i'm basically looking for really really fast growing trends in one direction or another because that's where essentially as i was saying like the water is going to continue this coral theme and basically if i can ride a particular wave i'm hedging essentially all these business decisions that i might be making downstream from it got it so pick another one on this sheet patrick that you find interesting that you you kind of have noodled on a little bit yeah so there's i mean the obvious ones are like interest in ai these types of things but like some some less obvious ones might be around the kind of like the social issues right so right now a really sad one to kind of talk about are like school shootings right so i don't know if you've looked into this particular market not obviously increasing or you know school shootings but like there's an entire market that has been created around this because of the rise of that particular happening now you can get into kind of like the government dynamics of like gun control and stuff like that but like there still is the fact that schools are looking to like not only make their students feel safer but also their parents feel safer so there's things like bookcases that fly in front of you know doors there's things like clear backpacks there's an entire market that's kind of popped up against this and when you see this particular trend you can then think through the second and third order effects to essentially come up with is this something that hopefully you can you know obviously help the actual trend go down but also you can make sure that you can build a good business around i have a random question why don't they just make put a certain thing in the gun that like you know for example we have metal detectors which is like we're trying to find a gun but there might be other metal there should just be a thing in every gun that's like a detectable thing that you can now if you're a security thing it's like oh we're always looking for this certain compound of lead because that's intentionally put chipped into every gun that's sold so that it can we can easily identify hey a gun just walked through this door uh so a metal detector is that basically what you're saying or but not metal i'm saying metal will catch all kinds of metal i'm saying they should put something that's unique in every gun in the mold of every gun so that it can be detected easier than looking for all metals and slowing everybody down for like keys in your pocket got it sean your your your california it's showing yeah it's coming out yeah you you i thought you were going to say something that they can remotely turn off all the guns in case something happens like the gun hey it might even be a status symbol like it beeps it's like hell yeah i'm packing right who knows i'm not judging i'm just saying we're covering the environmental global warming debate and guns that's what makes my first i was just flying so i went through tsa like three times i went through disneyland security i've i've just been thinking about how do we make this faster because it's a very slow process yeah yeah imaging is actually getting really really good i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better you you have another thing on here that is interesting and i think scott galloway talked about it was and i'd never i didn't see the stat until just now teenagers not having sex so you said that um it's doubling every nine years it rose from 11 to 21 of teens that do not have sex that haven't had sex in the last year um that's kind of interesting i think that japan i mean you looked into this more than i japan has suffered from this and isn't there like a like an idea that like in the next 10 or 20 years japan's population is really really really going to be hurting for this lack of procreating yeah well there's there's a lot of countries where that's going to happen even china they're talking about you know a pretty big collapse um and so there's a lot of again causes for where this is at and i'm not an expert on like population design or anything like that but i do think that this is something that's really big not only amongst just teens in general but also amongst young men um who are kind of you know basically checking out of the ecosystem and this is like a pretty big problem just for the economy in general let alone like procreation and fertility and stuff like that and so this is kind of an interesting space where like yeah you have a social issue or like you know a cultural issue that's kind of driving things in one direction are there like private solutions to kind of quote unquote solve this particular problem um you know because at least in america we're not going to do what you know china has been rumored to be doing you know with kind of like the reverse of a two-child policy like these types of things and so yeah it's just this is one of those trends as well that's like worth going deeper and deeper on to see like what's going on not only make the world a better place but like see where business can be and this cost of cybercrime one that's one of your fastest growing ones what's that yeah so basically um the amount of damages from cybercrime so this is not only things like targeting old people you know for fraud but also this is things like um you know ddos attack on a particular website or for a company um basically cybercrime is exploding um and it's probably going to accelerate even further with ai beyond this like seven x five-year magnitude that i have in the spreadsheet um and so yeah that's that's something that's really interesting because you don't really have good solutions for it um you have everything from like aura and some of these like kind of vpn slash identity protection products um but on the corporate side there's been a lot of money that's sloshed in there but it's i don't want to say it's obsolete but it's changed dramatically with like the birth of ai and all that kind of fud that's happening with that market there was one there's a couple on here that um we've seen people come on this podcast and talk about specific businesses they created off of these trends so for example um you have sports betting revenue and uh it's the doubling time you have on here is less than one year so you said it was legalized in 2018 it's already 4.3 billion in the u.s right now so and that's a five year five year span to get to about five billion in revenue on on u.s legal sports betting and it's still only legal in what patrick i don't know if you know the details but it's only legal in a couple of states right it's not like yeah it's it's it's there are more states i believe that have legal marijuana than they do of sports betting so it's but it's it's getting a little bit easier the the rumor is and again not an expert on this in particular but the rumor is is that there'll be a lot more states that come with this before the other states kind of legalize marijuana and so those are both markets that are really interesting because it you know gets into all the vice market kind of dynamics that you see with a lot of those different types of companies the guy we sold uh the milk road to is two guys one of the guys had this interesting backstory because they bought it with their own money and they're not like a company that didn't raise money and so we were like where are you getting the funds to make this size purchase and they were like well you know here's our backgrounds and one of the guys had a fascinating background so he was a affiliate marketer so he basically would make like content sites for online uh poker and online poker was legal for a while then black friday came online poker is no longer legal in the united states so it's like business died overnight and so what every he was in a really competitive space of online poker affiliates because it was like a just absolute cash cow to be a poker affiliate because somebody's going to immediately go deposit money and you would get your your fee for that and so when they killed it in the united states out of the 100 competitors 99 said well i guess we'll optimize for international traffic now that's the only answer yeah he just took a different approach he sat there and he looked and he's like well okay it's illegal right now in the states but is it going to be illegal forever probably not and he's kind of waited and he's like he was just patient and he saw a little trend pick up where um new jersey was rumored to be uh be the first state that was going to legalize it again or he was going to legalize uh online gambling only for if you lived in new jersey and uh and i think the way it worked was like there was like local casinos that could have online portals to for you to gamble on and so with everybody else went international he's like i will now be the new jersey betting affiliate and he created his website was like i don't know what it was it's like betting in new jersey.com or something like that like very hyper targeted sounded so niche um it sounded almost like a step down but what he realized was if one state's gonna do it and then the second state started to get rumored to do it he's like oh this is a trend i just want to surf i'm going to start now and make all the content for this for the states that are rumored and i will be the best position when the time comes as this as this accelerates and so he did the new jersey one he sells it for i think it's publicly out there it's like 42 or 46 million dollars to a bigger betting company and then he just he's like oh cool minnesota's coming next he does the exact same thing and does it for minnesota sells that one for another 40 something million dollars and to the same company uh like within a like sort of two-year time span and then that company was smart and then they're like hey uh okay now this covers like all states you can't just do this you can just keep flipping these to us for 50 million to pop and so he basically made like 100 million dollars selling the same business just looking at the data and the trend and the news and realizing okay this is going to happen it's just a matter of timing uh this this wave now and he was the only one that was really paying attention to that and it was him and one other guy and they just merged and so they became they then owned all the supply so they could jack up the rates as an affiliate um which normally is the other problem with affiliates they get put under pricing pressure but because him and the other guy merged they could go demand whatever rate they wanted to anybody who wanted customers because they were the only only show in town um the other one you have on here is popularity of french bulldogs so you say it's uh doubled in five years um and both french bulldogs are now the number one breed of an uh in the uh akc the american uh kennel club um which is like a published database basically and so our friend ramon kind of did this with wiener dogs he was like oh like look at how popular these groups are how fast they're growing on facebook of people who own wiener dogs and he's like what's a pro then he started brainstorming like what's a problem in the wiener dog space and he found this company that was making ramps for wiener dogs to get on and off of beds and couches and because he saw the popularity of these groups and how avid the owners were how fast those groups were growing how big they were he knew there's a market for wiener dog ramps which like if you walk into harvard business school and you're like here's my big idea they'd be like you're nuts uh you know you laughed out of the room but that business was doing you know whatever 20 million a year because he was able to like correctly identify the right trend he scaled it i think from like 300 000 a year to like 17 million a year in like 20 months or something like that yeah it was insane but this is why like again ideation is it treated a little bit more like a science than just this random like listening to podcasts youtube videos and like having a notebook because there's a lot of these ideas that like i couldn't tell you what a good business idea is in them but if i start to think about it further and further that's where like really good ideas come from right so the french bulldogs right like i don't know what the pain points of french bulldogs are but similar to ramon's story there's like something very interesting there either directly or like sitting around that particular idea that could be really really interesting so basically we've all seen with ai people can now it's like generative ai you can create an image or create a video from just a prompt or from you could deep fake a video really easily and so uh you know crypto gets a lot of for having like oh there's no like use case for this even though like you know money is the main use case but they're like the blockchain what are the other use cases for blockchain and there's a really interesting company that's doing something in the space where they were like hey um crypto has this really cool thing where you have a private key you have your own address that only you you own and control and what what they normally do is they say hey sign it to do a transaction so if you want to send money you sign it with your private key that's how you authorize the transaction so these guys what they realize is hey there is now going to be so much video out there and there's gonna be a big question of is this photoshopped is this deep faked is this real or is this fake and they were like people are going to need people companies they're going to need a way to authenticate or to sign a piece of content and say this was real i made this this is actually me um versus the viewer having the putting the burden on the viewer and be like can you tell if this is real or fake it's like dude i don't know it's too hard like misinformation is going to spread so now there's going to be like a watermark that basically the creator the original owner the person in question can use their private key to sign and say yep that was that was real that was me that was my video or that was my my writing i actually said that that's my voice i'm i did say those words and it will become true very soon that like if there's a piece of content that's unsigned it's about you i don't you know i don't know what this is this is this ain't organic produce i don't know what this is this i don't know where this came from um i don't trust this and so i think that's going to be one of the the the consequences of let's say you see this rise in generative ai as a trend you say oh that's great people are going to create all kinds of content but wait that means we're not going to know what's real and what's been generated by ai we need a solution for that and i think those guys are going to do pretty well what's it what's interesting about this is not just the trends but the fact that you're doing this and and i think that that's kind of breaks a couple rules or at least rules that people think exist and a lot of people don't know that jeff bezos story but basically i think he i think the exact the exact quote was pretty good it said something like uh i saw the internet was growing at 2300 a year and i realized nothing outside of of a petri dish grows that fast and i just thought what can i sell and well let's just start with books because they're easy to ship and there's a lot of them and so i can just pack amazon with almost every book i can find and i think people will buy that whereas a lot of people think they have to start a company because they have like some passion about it or some mission which i actually think your passion can develop once you start working on it and it starts succeeding um a have you thought about selling your research process because that's actually what i did with trends and i and i made a bunch of mistakes with that i should have charged more maybe i shouldn't even have done it in the first place but um a what's your end goal with this with with like have you thought about making my mistake well that's what i heard it could have done better i should have charged 30 000 instead of or i should have charged way differently that's where i screwed up um but have you have you thought about turning this into a business the second question what is your outcome with your second business now that you have financial security and uh like do you have like a legacy plan do you have a number that you're working back for back from what are you doing to to decide which one to actually go down yeah so i think that to answer the first question i i've been asked because we've talked about research stuff a lot like either through dms or on the last pod like i think research companies they have they have a fatal flaw where they give people a dopamine rush of understanding something but people are pretty bad at then using that information in some particular way so like the retention ends up not being great unless you turn into like a mckinsey style like oh we trusted them to come in and do this research and kind of go from there so like even the competitive intel stuff like i i know how to use that because i've been taught how to use it and i've like developed it people really like the dopamine of like oh i can see exactly what's going on but they don't know how to like get to the next step so if i were to do it it would be some sort of you know almost do it for you not only in terms of the research but then connecting that to some sort of outcome where they can just hook it up and then it targets their ads or something to actually get an outcome so i can take the thought process out of the um out of my customers you know particular evaluation of the product i think in terms of the second question for me i'm like a cliche second time founder now right so i'm basically like either i'm gonna go into like cash flowing lifestyle style points type businesses or i'm gonna go into like big ass you know innovation type business and i think the bezos numbers piece is really really powerful for the latter one because you know you're looking at some really big trends that probably have some social and cultural like implications but then you're also trying to build like a particularly big business which is what my intention is essentially and i've done a lot of work over the past year to kind of like come to that realization with like coaches and therapists and all that kind of fun stuff so for me what i do is i look at this and i don't know if the bezos number piece is is is necessarily like useful to folks who aren't trying to like build big i think it's really useful for folks who want to do like quick hits but i think like the next framework that i kind of put in there around like you know taking different product ideas and then spinning them in terms of different customer bases or different like differentiators that's what most people should be doing because innovation like a 10x better product is almost impossible in this particular environment now like 10 15 years ago you could build an innovative 10x better product because you were the one that had the special relationship with the supplier in yemen for the coffee or something like that or you were the one that only could build this particular feature but now everyone and their mother can spin up a website features are no longer really defensible anymore and unless you have like some sort of patentable or some sort of scientific kind of breakthrough or regulatory kind of protection your best thing you're going to do is like a two or three x better product and that's why i think it's just one of those things that you know innovation isn't something that you should be targeting unless you're really really going big is essentially what i'm getting at why do you care about doing the cash flow thing because many of our friends sean and i friends i mean sean's friends and you i'm sure your buddies are like this they're quite wealthy many tens of millions or hundreds of millions and they're like but i would love to have five million dollars a year of income i for me and this is like very personal it's not for everybody but like i discovered in going through this like wave of like massive wealth really quickly i discovered that like like i'll give you like a little bit of an anecdote so when the money hit the bank account i felt nothing like i was like happy i was like obviously you know happy for the team but the thing that like went into the back of my head and i didn't know how to express it in this particular way it was very much well if i did it it must not have been that hard which goes into like childhood it goes into a bunch of different things and so when i'm thinking about the next business i look at those two paths right like there's like more cash flowy business own your own destiny lifestyle style points these types of things and then i think that there's like spending your time going after something that's harder and harder and trying to go after innovation right like the perfect like antithesis of how i view the world now is like nick huber right nick is like why would you ever try to like innovate that's like so much harder etc and we've had many like long night conversations about that um and for me it's like i want to go after that bigger and bigger thing and it took it took a long time to like realize that because i went after like oh let's do this let's do that let's do this other thing let's go after this quick buck you bought 19 gas stations i did buy 19 gas stations but that's jenny that's jenny that's the wife the wife handles the real estate portfolio and it doesn't mean i'm not going to like do stuff but like my primary focus is going to be like one big thing um i don't want to be an investor i don't want to like come up with a bunch of cash flowing like studio style businesses i i respect the hell out of all those things it's just i just found out it's not for me or at least that's that's where i got to wait by the way can you tell us the gas station thing real quick did you meet syed and he told you about his gas station portfolio so okay here's what happened so i bought 19 gas stations um they're in north and south carolina you bought them all at once or like one at a time like you bought a chain all in one pot so essentially there was there was a kind of a patriarch of a family who had built up a portfolio about 120 he passed away and then um basically i think it was the trust or the estate i don't know which which but he was they were selling them off in blocks right and they don't want to sell off like one at a time because it's 120 because the kids they had a tax bill coming up because the inheritance yada yada so um this actually is is this started with nick huber and mitchell um ballbridge um of the cost seg world because they started talking to me about oh there's there's some tax implications where if if your partner your wife or your husband is a real estate professional your passive losses on like real estate become active losses and they offset active gains so got a big pile of you know kind of gains from the sale of the company and then all of a sudden i can offset those with depreciation of the gas stations and i can do that with bonus depreciation in one year so just to use some round numbers like if i buy 10 million dollars of gas stations i basically can take 8 million of depreciation essentially and that can offset some of those particular gains and so in october september um nick starts telling me about this i start talking to mitchell trying to figure it out i start talking to tax lawyers all of a sudden we got intro to someone who saw this deal of these 120 jenny who's been in the real estate game for like 10 years and so it was one of those things we were able to kind of like you know we weren't starting from zero but it was still like a big big purchase um and we closed i think like december 23rd or something like that so like right right at the particular edge of the end of the year to uh to not only get a good deal um because we had you know we looked at the real estate deal independent of the tax implications but the tax implications kind of put it over the top to be really really good and has there been like are they is it just like wow this was a great asset great smooth sailing or is it like oh my god i have 19 pain in the asses now or what's the what's the situation like what's the verdict of guy who didn't own real estate and gas stations like tech entrepreneur does this thing that has clear benefits on the tax side might have a might be a nice diversifying part of my portfolio might be good cash flow might also be a headache what's your answer now that you've come out the other side uh so they're triple net leases so that basically means we don't manage don't handle any operations anything like that um they're owned by a a big flag a big company um so they're corporate backed which may or may not mean anything depending on who you ask in the real estate world so we've had very little headaches um we also have a partner on the deal who's you know we were the money they're handling most they handled all the analysis and all that kind of fun stuff um so it's been pretty smooth sailing i mean there hasn't been any issues that's famous last words i think um there's a way to basically you know manage these into more investments and things like that those that's where it can get a little tricky but like yeah we we got at least knock on wood pretty lucky in terms of what's going on but you gotta can you get can you give any numbers i mean how much income is that bringing in how much did it cost can you give any numbers um do you feel comfortable i can give you some numbers so um well i don't know my wife runs it so if you don't want to share the specifics on yours you could just be like you know i think about this like uh this business is a box like a restaurant restaurant will typically cost you let's say half a million to open and then you're trying your goal is to net 150k a year per location you want to get to 20 that's how you get scale like it's simpler than that so it's 30 million in gas stations um i believe i can't remember the exact cap rate um basically what we're getting out of it but we're getting um i believe the caps are at like five and a half um and so we're not getting like an immense like an immense amount of income from that um but we are getting income basically from it and then the leases on this particular deal what made it so great is um all of the like rent increases were based off of cpi and they were they were written in like the early 2000s so basically what's happening is as you've seen all the inflation data when these rent increases go into effect the increase in rent is pretty significant um and so that's what made the deal really really good but like yeah we're we're cash flowing i don't know it's it's it's definitely over a million a year on these um i don't know the exact numbers um which i feel good about because it's one of those things where i trust my wife to figure it out and you also said that there was like you sell the company and you're like uh you go through this wandering phase for like a year uh you said there's five phases what are the five phases uh i just sold my company for a bunch of money yeah this is like the the champagne problem cycle i think and it's it it's just this crazy roller coaster and i don't know sam sean if you guys went through this but for me like i was pretty even keeled emotionally before the actual sale what i mean by that is like something bad would happen to the business i'd be like oh that sucks okay let's figure it out something good i'd be like oh great but we have all these other problems um when the sale goes through especially if it's like announced like everyone kind of starts treating you like a god for like a hot second and then that leads you to go like wait am i a god right you have this little bit of this like almost this like imposter like i don't know what reverse imposter syndrome is and like i never got like i have good friends around me who are like yeah you st your your still stinks but like it was one of those funny things where you're just like oh my god i can do anything and then like you go through the second phase which is like oh my god i fear death i'm gonna screw this up i'm gonna like i don't know how to rich how does one rich correctly i'm gonna lose it all and this is when you're like tax lawyers accountants other lawyers how do i evaluate how they're good or not like all these crazy things what is a wealth manager like oh my god the wealth managers every single one of them tells you just put it in index funds and then you ask them well then what's your job and then they're like oh we just advise you and you're like okay what does that mean and they can't answer the question so do you get one do you not get one right and then um you start to get a handle on things you start to kind of like get your feet under you you buy a bunch of gas stations you do this type of a thing and then like phase three is like or like part of phase three is like i call this the delusional peak of cocaine energy and this is like you have all this energy and you're like i'm gonna do everything right this is what i was getting into with sam before it's like i'm gonna hire 19 people or not 19 17 people it's 19 gas stations 17 people to do research to look into things to go look at this deal to go look at that deal and just like do all of these things and i'm gonna build this and i'm gonna build that because you just have those all this energy and this optionality um and that leads to just a full-blown identity crisis um and so i hired a couple of shrinks um to basically help because you know it was a major change in my life and you know just kind of a major thing where like it's kind of like you know figuring out like who you are what you want which i kind of talked about a little bit before and starting to realize like oh like i don't have to do these things i can do these things what do i want to do um what does that look like and then you know then you kind of even out and you go back to the grind so that was like my last year of just up down down even further and then kind of back up to figuring out like hey this is what i want um and kind of going from there you even did this cool study or this a survey where you talked to didn't you survey a bunch of people who are wealthy and you asked them about happiness and things like that yeah this is how i cope with things research as you clearly can see so i spent 50 grand on like a study basically run and this is one of our products at profit well was like basically running research studies um and so i spent 50 grand basically trying to get in front of as many like rich folks as humanly possible um and then doing a bunch of qualitative conversations with like you know you know number of billionaires a bunch of like centimillionaires etc and just trying to figure out like okay what what makes them happy what makes them unhappy so that i can you know kind of take some of those lessons for for me personally what were the lessons one of the biggest lessons that i think is most helpful and i don't know if everyone's going to be able to like hear it or they'll hear it but i don't know if they'll actually like internalize it is when you look at the stack of like how money can actually bring happiness um there are some really really obvious things like um people who spend money on stuff they are happier than people who don't spend money on stuff but they're not as happy as the people who spend money on like a particular hobby or a particular like narrowing of stuff so buying a birkin bag that you guys talked about i think last episode like that brings some joy it actually does it's not something that's like completely joyless but if you're really into f1 and you buy your own car that you go race in the track that brings you more happiness right and then one layer above that in terms of increasing even more happiness is experiences so this is something that we've all heard about like buying experience actually does bring more happiness and what was really interesting were the top two one is really really obvious so above experiences was like giving money away in like a targeted way not just like general like here you go this um organization or this non-profit but like actually giving it to a cause that you really cared about but the top one was kind of fascinating like the things that we coded that built or brought the most happiness were what i kind of labeled freedom inducing events or freedom inducing items so things like a jet if you can afford a jet and you can fly private it's not the nature of the jet it's that it brings you so much freedom and so we saw this kind of coded in all the responses and so things like i know sam you've been a little hesitant to it things like getting a personal assistant things like getting someone to take care of stuff at the home those things actually bring a lot more happiness because unless you really really like buying the groceries or doing something like that that brings more freedom and that that actually increases happiness levels even more than all the other things that we talked about um the other big thing that was really interesting is that um the the happiness scales that you see kind of online in those studies um for both income and net worth like typically they can't they're i i they're limited that's what i would say um like meaning like um they basically are like oh 75 000 your happiness doesn't increase and then there was another study that found enough people you know up to about a half million where happiness increased well i took it all the way to i think it's like three to four million a year and the happiness just continues to increase it's not at the same rate but like more income and more net worth does bring more happiness like i'm not sure where it's going to like level off but right now in my data on net worth i have a good enough sample that i can actually map it from zero to about 50 million um in net worth um but the one really interesting thing was no matter the net worth um particularly for the folks who have more than five to ten million in net worth um no matter what it was if it was higher and some of the billionaires qualitatively this was also the case um you would see that if the net worth went up they got happier if the net worth stayed the same they were a little bit happier if the net worth went down even just like a minuscule amount that the like the the reduction in happiness was considerable and so it's one of those things where it's like when you get wealthy it's like all about protect protect protect that's you know for a lot of obvious mathematical reasons but also from a happiness perspective that's where a lot of like the anxiety was coming from from some of the the more wealthier folks um there's a couple other things oh like this was really fascinating because this was like a little more personable um of wealthy folks let's just say i think it was like folks over five million in net worth um but it continued the trend even higher um there were only a couple of like trends that everyone did like almost every single person not 100 but like you know let's just say 90 ish percent plus um lists was a big thing like lists or like a to-do list of some sort um wealthy folks almost to a t had some sort of system where every day they were like here's what i'm gonna do for some it was like i got one big thing each day for others it was like some hardcore like to-do list app and all this other fun stuff that was organized but that was a really big thing um everyone's still in the game meaning still building a business still trying to build their wealth worked out or had some sort of fitness regularly folks out of the game they started to kind of like fall off on that particular fitness but like 90 of people like it wasn't they're all doing crossfit or all doing anything crazy but a lot of them were doing um at least something consistently every single week um so that was really really fascinating to see as well there were a couple other things that were like pretty consistent but um those were the really really big ones that stood out that would be most helpful i think to folks i have a nerdy question about the happiness thing how do you what what is the actual like how do you know how happy somebody is how do they know how happy they are so are you just saying how happy are you did you get happier when you got more money it's like a self-reported like one to ten thing or is there a better way to have people ask that question yeah totally so my instinct is to like teach stats right now so i'm going to try to avoid that as much as humanly possible um but that you don't when we look at like temperature just trust me for a second like we can get very very accurate readings on like how cold it is in your apartment right now or your house right now right and we can be very very confident in that particular like measurement right now we can also get the temperature measurement by like maybe measuring the outside temperature and subtracting what we think the insulation is of your house and trying to figure out like in a backwards way that would be less accurate than like measuring the actual temperature but still more accurate than if i went and i asked you what you thought the temperature was right and there's different ways that i can ask you temperature right if i just straight up ask you what's the temperature it's like it's actually kind of a difficult question for you to answer but if i ask you do you think it's more than 68 degrees it's a little bit easier for you to answer so there's different ways to answer these questions now what that means is and the way the reason i gave that little metaphor is like there's we're not looking at measuring temperature like the way that we would in a very scientific way like we just can't do that because like happiness it is relative there's a bunch of different factors but that doesn't mean we can't like measure it purely right so what i did and um i'll try to like keep this as as helpful as possible is um i looked at how the 75 000 study does and and there is a happiness kind of research center there's a number of different actually the first undergrad research i ever did was how do tax rates impact happiness um in the economics department in school and so there's different ways to ask it so the way that this was asked there's a number of different ways there was a scoring system there was uh this happened how does that affect your happiness so there's a composite score that we kind of put together based on those different inputs to come up with essentially here's what their happiness level is comparatively and then you keep that consistent across the board and there's ways you can adjust the model um but long story short like it's it's the way i describe temperature it's a little bit closer to like hey what do you think your temperature is so it's not dude i think that's just fascinating i think it's incredibly fascinating and i think it's amazing that you're doing this uh uh you i like seeing your nerd come out i i think it's this is very this is very cool yeah yeah i got really excited i felt my heart rate just go up there sorry i think sam sam hit the nail on the head where he's like uh these things you said are interesting but what's more interesting is that you did this and uh you know you were just describing like people spend on stuff but they're more happy if they spend on a targeted set of stuff yeah that's you spending 50 grand on a study about wealth right that's you you don't have a model train hobby you have a research hobby and you were like oh how do i use these funds to scratch my itch in a way that i haven't done before and i'm sure that it was like it wasn't the takeaways from the study probably it was doing the study that actually made you happier and felt like a good use of your time um i'll also say like uh you know a lot of people listen to this podcast will probably be probably make this mistake and so i'll say it out loud because i made the mistake which was i thought my goal was i don't want to be rich i want to be free right i think that's a common thing people say makes themselves feel a little bit better than i'm just chasing money say no i'm chasing freedom and it's true like it is better to chase freedom than than money uh but i thought you know there's a number and i remember thinking uh when i was like maybe 26 27 i was like oh you told me it was six million right yeah i was like six million dollars that's my freedom number and i really i like i was focused on six as my freedom number i even had it in my passwords it would be like a six in there because i was like every time i log in i want to be thinking about that number and that's how i was thinking about things i passed that number and i was like well uh all right was my math wrong or is this concept of a freedom number wrong and i had a very simple realization which was that being financially free doesn't mean you have a certain amount of money in your bank account it means you are now free from money owning you and that is a decision you make and so for example the the simple test is um how much of how much of what you do is because of money and somebody who's truly absolutely financial financially free they do not make a choice based on money so that could be they buy something and oh why'd you buy it why do you shop at this grocery store it's more expensive well because i'm not making my decision based on money it could be um a job you tell me why do you why are you working on this oh because i think it's going to have a big payoff or i think the salary the salary is you know too good to pass up well you're making a decision based on money and the true financial freedom isn't on some number it's when you can get to the point where you stop making choices that are based on money which is half minds at least 50 mindset if not 80 mindset and maybe the remainder is an actual you know uh financial reality of how much money how much money you have in your bank account i would i would edit that very slightly and it's almost semantic i i think it's it's almost a it's a it's a function of force rather than um choice so what i mean by that is there are a lot of people myself included who are still making decisions with money in mind right because to me there are certain goals that i have that are probably going to change as i get nearer to them not just for a number's sake like i'm not one of those people who which i i don't judge but like there are people who just want the number to continue to go up right and there's other folks and i count myself as one of them is like i want ever increasing um waves of like freedom the ability to do stuff and money unlocks that ability so i still make decisions based off of it but i don't have to right like i can rationalize as to why i don't want to so i just found that there's still a lot of people who have like there's this billionaire who i was talking to about this and we were we were basically having coffee and you know he's going through like he's still in the game he sounds just like us he's still like oh yeah i'm gonna go do this i'm gonna go do this like the stakes are different the numbers are different and some of them the moves are very different but i asked him i was like so why like you don't need to do any of this right but it seems like you don't want to do this decision but it's going to net the most money for you in this particular situation so like why do you want to do this and his answer was basically what i was just saying which is like well if i get another billion i can go do this thing and his thing was like this non-profit thing that he kind of wanted to do and so does he actually believe that i have no idea right i can't read his mind but like for me the idea of like okay i can buy 19 gas stations i'd like to buy a skyscraper next do i need a skyscraper no do i want a skyscraper not really but i like the idea that i can't right but you realize that sounds totally ridiculous right like if i understand it sounds ridiculous right like one of my one of my goals one something this is going to sound crazy and this is the perfect the perfect audience to say this but like i get so jacked up about the idea of like toppling a dictatorship one day i get so excited by it and i'm like i'm not even kidding and i'm like okay well if we if we go after cuba it's going to cost this much because i have this idea and this idea have you done you've done research on this you have spreadsheets oh 100 yeah well how much does it cost in which order of countries do you put like what's like your top three of like yeah i don't want to name i don't want to name countries quite yet because i think that that like could get me in a little bit of trouble and also like again my point is more like will i ever actually do this i have no idea but it gets me so jacked but maybe i think there's maybe i think that there there are certain countries that i think are in really really dire straits that i think like three four hundred billion you could really immediately make a dent and it wouldn't involve like doing anything like crazy illegal or anything like that it would involve basically uh um because if you think about if you really want to nerd out on this which i don't think you want to but it's like countries breathe with their gdp right the money coming in the money going out etc so when you look at that as like an axis that you can attack um there's so much you can do um and that doesn't even get into like stuff you can do with social media and with the actual like you know people we haven't even mentioned murder yet no no no no yeah yeah yeah you're the second successful entrepreneur i've met who has researched this and has seriously not they haven't seriously considered it because they're not there yet but they're like you know i think i could take over bangladesh uh like like i don't want to take it over i'm not going to install myself as a leader or anything i just want to like genuinely help right like you must have better the place like look at cuba like cuba you know it's one of those things where it's like it's been in problematic you know a problematic state for a long time part of that's our fault as the united states another part of that's just you know the people who um governed it but like i think it'd be really cool to like basically free cuba people people can't even free the city of san francisco right now like they're trying to yeah they're trying to get the mayor you know to actually like you know enforce uh you know punishment on crimes or they're trying to recall gavin newsome it i think it is a lot tougher than you think but it's surprising how many uh you know i guess like the game from you know sort of wealth to status to power uh you know it's it is interesting to see how many people end up in the power game um it's not a like i i want to be clear it's not a it's it's not a uh it's actually more of like a social entrepreneurship thing than it is anything yeah no that's not true dude that is no it is i gare i okay i've done the work i've done the introspection yeah like like the debate you're having in your head like it's basically like if you are mark benioff and you create the benioff hospital in san francisco what ratio is because you want the mark benioff hospital or because you want to cure cancer and i don't think it's wrong that it's higher on the i want my name on it it's not wrong if there was a pie chart right there's like the challenge of it the intellectual stimulation and the challenge that's definitely one uh there's the impact and the wanting to do good in the world that's two there's the bragging rights slash power game of like yeah i did that um you know like i helped do that that's what i did with my uh my my time my talents my my money i think there's some combination whatever the combination is i don't think it's zero on all the other things but there's a really big difference right there's a really big difference right so like i am i'm as close to nihilist as like i think one can get without being a full-blown nihilist because i just from from a just the way my brain's wired if i was like a nihilist i just would be like well i'm i don't know if i'm going to be a net positive therefore like nothing matters etc so to me it's like you get to design the game right you get to design the game that you want and when i look at like spending money to put your name on something it does feel kind of like a waste i don't i don't like at least personally like i haven't had my name on anything i don't really get excited about that but what i do get excited about is like the challenge part and then yeah like oh i you know if i could be the person who did x like that is really really interesting right like that is interesting but it's not like a it's not it's not this like this this uh i i want to name a journalist who has a very cynical view of our industry but it's not like this like you know cynical view or it's it's not this like oh i need to you know have a dick measuring contest or something like that like that's that's not how i think about it and that's why like i think that like doing stuff in san francisco i think some of the worst days in san francisco are still better than some of the other stuff that's happening in the world right and so that's why like looking globally i think are really really fascinating i think after this podcast you're going to be adding a third shrink to the payroll yeah probably probably just based on this yeah yeah you have two other really interesting things that you said i want to i want to hit so one is you had this remix framework that you kind of talked about earlier but i want to like double down and we should put the slide up on youtube because it's hard to describe it's too it's too much to describe but the slide makes it really easy so you basically were like look innovation you know maybe you're not like all innovation nor are you nick hubert you know innovation is a waste of time you're kind of like your goal is to you know i i don't know you could say this but you want to take a product and you want to remix it that's one way to think about how to come up with a novel business uh opportunity is to remix an existing one and you had these remixes i thought the good example was you took consumer products and you were like if you take it and you make it cheaper that's a way to differentiate um through better supply chain you could take it and you could say i'm going to align it with a celebrity that's a differentiator and you got like you have the example here of feastables with mr beast you have um you can align it with a lifestyle like keto or christian or hunting and you have like yeti coolers here um yeah science-backed you have another one that's like you align it with a uh an identity like a political party or lgbt or you have here as the example black rifle coffee so does this first talk about this and then is this only for consumer products or does this work across the board in your opinion so here here's where this comes from so we had 50 000 different there were subscription companies but 50 000 companies using our financial analytics um and we were helping them with pricing their churn and giving them their this data and they were from across the map b2b sas subscription nonprofits d2c was one of our big segments and i started to notice that like for just under 10 000 of these ddc brands the playbook was almost the same over and over and over again right like it wasn't like there was some innovation in creating mattresses it was literally like we will be cheaper through better supply chain and we will help the environment and maybe we donate money to people who don't have beds right like it was just over and over and over again so i wanted to create essentially a unified theory of like creating products right and so i i shared the consumer one because that's probably the easiest one to talk about but there's just there's only 10 things that these brands differentiate on and there are a number of the things that you talked about and my point around innovation is that like don't try to necessarily innovate maybe don't even try to like raise money for any of these types of like consumer ideas because all you really need to do is take a particular product and then remix it with some of these differentiators right so for example like you mentioned black rifle coffee that's basically aligning with an identity right so black rifle you know it's guns it's right wing it's veterans it's all these other fun things well identity based products increase willingness to pay by about 20 to 40 percent so if i just had regular coffee and then i had regular car or i had regular coffee that was built particularly for this like we'll just say like conservative but i don't think they necessarily claim that party all of a sudden that coffee's worth 20 to 40 percent because you're niching down into that particular group so i put together these 10 things and also the the data around increased willingness to pay but for example if i was a you know particular entrepreneur who didn't necessarily like want to necessarily innovate which most people shouldn't um i might go and be like cool well i like coffee i think coffee's great i think i get really excited about that what's a what's another lifestyle right so creating woke roast right coffee for the left basically um where all of a sudden you can have coffee you know basically for that particular identity and people flock in your retention is typically much much higher when you do this as well um it's something that really works right um i had a friend a really good friend who wanted to create a business um he's involved in the lgbt community so we talked about kombucha specifically for the gay community calling it bubbles for bottoms which was kind of a fun name um and so it's just one of those things where it's like creating this like product remix and you can do this in a bunch of different ways like you could be the premium version of whatever you're actually selling um you know shinola right it's watches it's notebooks etc but they're premium versus you know some of the other stuff that's out there you have here uh you have health plus lifestyle athletic greens for dogs condoms plus organic materials last week yeah organic condoms they're just going to sell you a package with nothing in it that's the organic condom that's basically what it is yeah yeah yeah yeah all that's right i didn't even think of that that's good made out of air honestly i bet you could sell that that's liquid death right liquid death there's water in a mean licking can i think you could probably sell uh like an all-natural condom uh that's just nothing uh you could literally do it the natural way yeah yeah there's a way yeah you got to look at it it's like sustainable right i don't know a lot about the sexual wellness market but it's like yeah long story short like it doesn't have to be complicated the effort and the execution is really really hard but the ideation doesn't have to be that hard did you make this chart this is really good this is great where'd this come from yeah so this is this is based on like probably collecting i don't know i i don't know the number but it's hundreds of thousands of willingness to pay data points because we did the pricing i don't know if you guys even know that we've never talked about pricing that was like my core thing that's what i was most well known for in the sas community um so we did the pricing for like blue bottle coffee we did lifts pricing we did a bunch of other like b2b style pricing so we have a lot of data in the pricing space and when i say we did it it's like we might have done it or we might have helped them do it depends on the company if you had to summarize your learnings with pricing is there like two or three bullet points where you'd be like just do these three things and you're 90 there sort of but with like giving you a little bit more bulleting um you should be changing something about your price every three months that does not mean raise your price every three months but it means like changing up your packaging going up market down market changing up an add-on changing up your discounting strategy it's this forgotten growth lever in most businesses you acquire customers you monetize them retain them we focus probably 60 of most budgets more so in d2c less so in b2b on like basically acquiring customers we spend a little bit of time in retention we spend like no time on pricing so change something every three months um one of the biggest hacks that's easy to talk about on a podcast add-ons um they're the most underrated underutilized aspect of all pricing consumer b2b enterprise um they boost lifetime value by about 20 to 50 percent so just to make sure this is clear like hey they bought your core product which is a fitness shirt well add a white t-shirt for ten dollars like stuff like that those are like add-ons hey they bought your sas app add priority support for whatever 10 of your list price is for the the software um most companies like the most high growth companies at least in the subscription space they have 12 or more add-ons typically customer never sees them all at all 12 of them but they'll see like one or two of them and then one other really quick hack is um localization this doesn't work for every company but like internationalizing your pricing so the nordics um you know when we take into account exchange rates and stuff like that they're still willing to pay about 30 percent higher than the us for the exact same product um folks in like southeast asia it's about 40 percent less there's a really large variance on that um but that's a really quick thing where you can boost typically your revenue per customer by about 15 20 literally by just like changing what the pricing looks like depending on where they come in um across the world dude you're insightful as fascinating yeah that was good uh you also said a really good thing in the in the sheet here that you didn't say which was how do you measure if your pricing changes like a good change or a bad change right how do you know um how do you know if you did it right what's the metric you choose yeah it's it's it's revenue per customer which is going to be different for every company so in your business if you're doing pricing properly that revenue per customer number should be going up into the right so like arpu arpa acv however you're measuring it um that that should be going up um and now it's not going up as fast as your sales or as some of your other numbers but like you should if you're changing something about your pricing every three months you should basically be seeing that number go up i don't know it's hard to give like a benchmark because later stage it goes up slower but it should just be going up every single year if not every six months is that assuming you have free and paid as a mix because like for example if i'm an e-com store i could quadruple my prices i would make more money per customer but i would just have less customers and less money overall if i did that right because yeah it's an e-com like you know for example what we use is uh revenue per visitor which is like uh for if somebody hits the site how much do we make two dollars off them a dollar off them for every average because that takes into account conversion rate and how much they spend when they convert yeah so i would say and you can get into like cart average cart those types of things i think that as you get more sophisticated in how you think like for example like for an e-commerce world i would probably want to look at like maybe lifetime like dollars in like that average number going up because what that means theoretically is assuming revenue is going up and all those numbers are great that means like i'm monetizing better right so it's not necessarily in a vacuum right like if my revenue per customer goes up you know a thousand x but i don't have any other customers obviously that's not great but it's one of those things where most people again they don't like like the average like people don't it's it's kind of crazy like it takes when we looked at how often people raise their prices so you should be raising your price at least once per year um there are some top outs and there's some exceptions to this particular rule but everything about your price is basically this exchange rate on your value so like you've created this value and because you know we don't trade goat for wheat anymore you're basically saying this value is worth this much dollars right and so it's that exchange rate and there's a bunch of things that influence that like your brand um the quality of the product who which customer you're going after like some customers are will value your product higher and so if your product is improving every single year your brand's improving you should be able to demand higher prices but most people i think the average amount of time they take between pricing changes like actual price increases is like three years and i've seen why because they're because they're fearful because the ceo is fearful they're scared is that the number that's probably is that like 80 of the issue they're just scared it's just scared yeah and we tried to fill this gap with our pricing product and we still do because it just gives them confidence because we're like all right here's data that says you sat in a room when you founded the company and said ah base camp does 50 bucks let's just do 50 bucks too and then you never revisited that like for years we have this data that says you can actually charge this customer 500 this customer 100 and we're gonna like roll it out in like a nice way just for new customers first and all of a sudden your conversion goes up and your revenue per customer goes up and you're really excited um and then all of a sudden you're like confident enough to basically put that for your existing customers as well um so yeah i think that's it's just a lot of fear you get all these like i've been in so many like so many exec teams with this product where it's like the smartest people i've ever met just sitting there and like if i give them any other problem in their business they're like okay um i'm not an engineer but like let's figure it out what's a what's a stack what is this like they'll go like attack it you give them pricing and they're all like i don't know what do you think what do you think because it touches every area of the business and they just lack that that confidence in looking at it and so i i think like starting off with like let's introduce an add-on let's introduce some of this stuff that's typically like the gateway to oh this pricing stuff works let's you know let's raise our prices and i have it i have an email that i've um i've basically cultivated over the past decade for like changing prices i'm happy to share it and we can put the show notes or i'll throw it on twitter where it's literally like just steal the template like t-mobile used it they stole it from the website and they used it which was kind of fun to see um but it basically just goes through like how to communicate a price increase um the tldrs don't make it about you make it about them um because they don't care about your costs or whatever they care about their costs and that's the biggest mistake most people make but yeah i'll share that you're uh you're this is very insightful you're very fascinating uh you have a lot of really interesting insights and i think you approach things in a really cool way where you have a good amount of self-deprecating humor but also like academic rigor you're you're a fascinating person so are we gonna is that mean we're gonna do this skin to skin bonding now or is that later in the podcast is that bro when i i told sean the same thing pop the top baby come on let's go let's go cheek to pat i'm losing weight so i don't i don't feel uncomfortable taking my shirt off yeah you've lost 40 pounds right yeah yeah i'm down like probably about 90 total but 40 since i saw you guys um wow and as gucci main once said money makes you handsome so like all cliched post exit founders i have to get healthier and uh basically take it seriously what's been the number one driver just eating less or what uh i use my body tutor so i know you're a big fan of that i don't know if sean you're still using it um sean you're using it yeah i went back to it and i'm having such a good time the key was doing the uh call the daily call i do the daily call yeah basically we have to tell people it's my body tutor so basically it's like the simplest thing ever we don't get paid for this there's no i don't at least say maybe you do but i don't get paid for this i ever i talk about that constantly they said eventually if i tweeted about it i sent a bunch of people and they're like hey we'll give you a little bit of money but i don't care i don't even mention me when you use them i don't give a but basically it's uh it's uh 650 a month and they call you daily and it's like a five minute call and they're like why did you eat this you're too fit let the fat guys talk for a second here all right go ahead yeah thank you thank you here's the thank you sean i didn't want to say anything but nobody wants to hear the shredded guy talk about this yeah yeah i'm down to like two percent body fat i'm still experimenting with those that big it's not a big deal if you're in this spot where you feel a little shitty about yourself you're like all right i'm overweight and i know this was completely in my control and you've done all the things you've uh listened to the podcast you got your andrew humer has got you injecting sunlight into your eyes in the morning and you you've you've tried keto you tried paleo you did all the right and none of it's working or it all kind of worked and actually the problem it was not in the plans it was all you to begin with what my body tutor did was smart which is they realized it's not the diet that's the problem it's you sticking to the diet that's the problem as we all actually know deep down inside and so they help you with that root cause which is how do they hold you accountable and help you actually stick to the thing you actually want to know they do give you some strategy along the way they do give you some helpful um ways to think about things i'll give you a very simple example hayley was like um hey when you eat um i want you to take note for a second like on a scale of one to five one being like i'm totally satisfied five being i'm like ravenously hungry right now where where are you when you sat down for that meal if you're sitting down at fives the problem was like we spaced out these meals the wrong way or we're not getting the right meals in and you're not expected to have good willpower when you're just like completely ravenously hungry and so like we want to be eating at a three um and we want to leave it at like you know you know we want to leave the meal also not completely stuffed you want to leave it about a three two two or three like you want to get in and just get your meal that way you're just fueling up versus like you know going to this like feeding frenzy so there's little mindset tips but more than anything it's you get a call in the morning and she's like so what's the plan for today eating wise you're like i don't know i'm just going to eat everything i see i guess oh wait no that's not the right answer hold on uh i'll eat at these times i'll eat these meals no i i think the only thing i would ask is like or um also add is it health is in your control like if you're listening to this like you know unless you have like an obvious like disability or something like that like health is very much in your control and what i love about my body tutor is it kind of cuts through the bs i ask haley about all these like esoteric things like hey i read about this like you know the cold plunging movement and she's just like fitness strength training which country should i take over haley haley and i don't have that relationship but uh no i think it's um i i just think it's one of those things where we're bombarded with a lot of like either quick fix or very marginal stuff like even the the you know i i'm a big human fan uh sam you tweeted recently you would i also would like that's you know he's he's he's a very very uh awesome guy but i think it's one of those things where a lot of that stuff like unless you have the basics in place it doesn't matter and so haley like has kept me accountable and like no no no we're gonna we're gonna do peloton today and we're gonna do this so we're gonna do that it's not even anything she says that keeps you accountable it's just saying the out loud and you're like actually what exactly am i talking about never mind sorry uh i apologize well and for me it's been it's been like a you know probably a year-long journey and it was it started off with like you know basically just breaking all of these conventions like sean you were saying where it's like oh i can't like bs myself out of doing the right thing here because i'm gonna have to talk to haley tomorrow about it and she's gonna not be like sympathetic she's gonna be like why'd you do that and she's like you shouldn't do that i'm like yeah i know and it's like cool let's not do it tomorrow which is you know obviously really helpful we appreciate you coming on man you're super insightful um you're always fun to talk to uh i don't remember the last time you came but uh i feel like this time uh definitely probably kicked its ass because this was a 10.
