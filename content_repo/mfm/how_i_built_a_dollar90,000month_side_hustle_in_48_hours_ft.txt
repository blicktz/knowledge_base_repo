you built a thing called wordplay is it wordplay.com it's wordplay.com right by the way you buy domain names so you bought the hustle.com for us you bought me copy that.com thank you for that um i forgot to say thank you in person but uh uh so you buy like a lot of amazing domains but you have wordplay.com and did you tweet that it was getting 7 million users a week or three what was the number well so the i just went and checked with the numbers okay so just to kind of place the timeline in frame uh so november and december of last year 2021 is when wordle took off and january is when it really um kind of hit its i think close to its peak um and that's roughly when the new york times acquired wordle um and a couple things kind of i mean it was fine i think it was um a great outcome for josh wordle but there were things that were kind of bothering me that were limitations in the game and i was an avid player of the game um and now it's like okay well the new york times has bought it there's no way that anything's going to happen for like years if ever uh so that was kind of thing number one uh thing number two like it was uh it had been a while since i had launched like some simple free thing publicly uh hadn't gone through the process and there were other things i wanted to learn um it's like oh i want to learn more about versell and next js and typescript and things like that so i'm like okay well this is a excuse and then that intersected with the third thing which was like the dominant variable in the equation is my uh son was taking a python programming class he's 11 right uh he's going through this process and for him um it's it's still very abstract he's learning programming he enjoys everything involving technology and screens but it was abstract so on a saturday night i said okay well let me build something when python happens to be my language um build something so he can see because he plays world he knows the game um and so i started on a saturday night with a deadline for sunday that i'm going to launch something with him tomorrow we're going to have google analytics on it so we're going to launch it i'm going to launch it by tweeting it and so he knows he knows what social media is right he's um you know uh so i'm like oh we've got this thing that didn't exist yesterday i wrote the code over the course of last night in python the language that you're learning and we're going to launch it and now you can see users coming in right you can see this and so now what i want him to have in his head is that when he as through the course of his life as he encounters problems that are solvable with software which is a lot like it's actually tactile for him it's like oh i don't know i don't have the skills right now to do what you know dad just did but i know it's possible i know it's possible because he did it in the span of 24 hours right so if i want to go off and build a video game i want to go off and build some tool for my school i want to build some social network for my whatever it is it feels like now it's it's more approachable for him he's got years to go before he'll get to that level but um anyway so those three things sort of came together and so we launched it uh on that sunday this is i think in february or so give or take um and since then it's had like 45 million games have been played uh nine and a half million people have come through it um any given moment in time right now if i look at the google analytics it'd be two three thousand people playing like right now um which how did it get so much traffic where did the traffic come from uh well it helps i have a social media following right i've got a million followers on linkedin i've got 300 000 on twitter so there's that uh there's some that that's that's a lot but that's not i i wouldn't have thought that yeah yeah it's not enough for that is it how many users do you think got from that um in the early days all what was it big was it big right off the bat like the first week was it big i know the first day probably a bunch of people checked it out but like i'm sure you posted it and that was the big surge so what was like the first week roughly do you remember the first week was probably maybe 50 to 100 000 so it wasn't it wasn't a lot but it was something uh but then once you kind of get into it this is the you know kind of power of iteration is that oh well one of the things that i found missing in the original wordle was that it was a single player game like you played and you played once a day and that was it uh so two big changes that we made in wordplay one was it was unlimited play you didn't you didn't have to play just once a day and two it it allowed you to challenge your friends so you could say oh i just played this word i solved it in four turns here's my score and send literally a simple link to anyone or a group on and this happens tens of thousands of times right like someone will take a link that they just played they're really proud of their score and then their family they can post it to their whatsapp group uh they can post it there you know wherever they want and say i invite you to like beat my score kind of thing um and so that's the viral element and so then as more people play you can track that as you might have as a google analytics event and say how many people how many times are people clicking that share button and issuing challenges to other people and so that once you can kind of get into something where there's a compounding effect on the user base so as the user base grows um and so now the thing i'm fighting though right is that so that's happening that's going well but then the interest in wordle uh in related games is waiting because everything has its kind of peak in its uh in its ebb um and so but it's been an interesting exercise so on the kind of learning path one of the things i hadn't done in a while is like okay well what's traffic actually worth let's say i had to make a living on this thing or make the company quote unquote or project profitable so i put google adsense on it which is the easiest thing to do and discovered that like if i weren't bothered by the fact that there would be two ads on the main game board page if i were solving for monetization it was like 90 thousand dollars a month uh in google adsense traffic wow i thought you were gonna say less yeah i thought he's gonna say like five grand a month but 90 grand a month and you're you only have your only costs are hosting right yeah and my time right and first of all sean go to wordplay.com and then go to like the about page his about page is incredibly well written it's wonderful copywriting it's wonderful uh you've got a wonderful voice it says uh i'll just read the first sentence but it says why would you do this or the better yet why would i do this that's a really good question my wife asked me the same question and then you like go on to explain why it just you you're you're quite a good writer for also being like this amazing engineer typically those things i want a power writing course that sean put on you know that right it's like i'm not right i'm getting around here with my alumni i like to say i taught darmesh everything he knows even before he met me i somehow taught him all that good stuff before he built hubspot what uh what do you so this is making 90 grand a month maybe or about what do you it could it's not right there's no i don't see i turned i turned ads off because that's sort of not the point and people were asking me like darmesh why do you have ads on this thing i'm like to learn like it's like i've learned what i needed to learn so i can was was tweeting and linkedin posting this on linkedin the only way you got users what do you think this could sell for right now and is the is this the biggest side project you've ever created our buddy tried to buy it sully tried to buy it off you did he really he he tweeted out he's like i'd like to buy this off you i've you know i've built mobile games before you know he was like semi-serious at least i don't know i don't know if you talked to him or not but i did not what do you think you could say what do you think like if you cared what do you think you could sell it for two or three million dollars maybe right now that um let's say the ad revenue would go down to like 50 000 or something like that because i haven't turned google adsense in a while that's 600 000 a year apply a 5x multiple um so somewhere between two and ten million dollars would be my guess if i like if that's what i was calling for so it's and um is this the bit it was was posting it on linkedin and twitter the only way that you got users or did you do some other weird hacks i had my blog uh had my it's like i'm a big believer in like you know what folks call like the flywheel there's all these little things that are attached to the flywheel right it's like oh well linkedin helps a little bit puts a little energy twitter does a little bit and i have my blog and the email goes out and there's like things that i sort of do um yeah so it helps but it's like the hardest part is that cold start problems like how do you get your first hundred thousand people a hundred to a thousand people and then it's the matter of like tracking the retention rate on those users do they come back the other thing that's been interesting about wordplay as far as the lesson learned um is that you know when it started the average time a user spent uh according to google was roughly four minutes um on the game okay um in the early weeks and now that number is at 14 minutes is the average time a user spends um you know across however many a thousand users come in a given day so right what uh and is this the biggest side project you've ever created depends on how you measure it um so technically no not in terms of just like raw traffic um i've built graders and things like that before that uh have done better but what have you built that did what side project have you built outside of hubspot that gets more traffic than two or three million people a month i don't really did side projects this is my first one um that was like clearly because it was a game had it been anything other than a game i would have rationalized some way to bring it into the hubspot umbrella because i like to have like all my eggs in that basket uh but just given the circumstances here didn't really make sense um and even now like i'm thinking about doing a uh kind of a marketing and sales related edition of wordplay right it's like oh the entire list of words or uh do it based on martech companies like okay do you know the the players in the space kind of thing and then you can get sponsorships or whatever anyway but um yeah website greater was the this kind of a project where it was like a free i'm i really like low friction things that people can come to the website this is why my son and i were chatting yesterday because we're looking at flutter this new uh development environment and language um well darts to language but flutter is the uh the app framework for building mobile apps across ios and android and things it's the what the cool new kids are learning and he's like no why would i ever want to build a mobile app that's like something people have to download i have to get approval from you know apple to kind of post my like i i want to like to just do it like immediately he's got uh and he's right it's like okay anyway so that's the wordplay story it's been uh it's been a lot of fun i've um it's hard to know with these things like like where the road leads like wordplay itself may or may not kind of connect back to other things whatever but the things i've learned through it i think will it's like okay well here's what it takes to build this kind of thing it's like okay well then i'm using it to uh play around with community it's like okay can i take the wordplay user base what are the things they care about and build a community around wordplay yeah using one of the existing kind of community platforms um and and see if that's a thing right it's like okay if you could aggregate people with like interests um that in itself has value and i want to be something or something that kind of self-runs but we'll see
