Hey guys! We realized in our tour of the office that we didn't show you guys the magic inside our fridge so we thought we'd show you a little bit of the kind of fuel that keeps the hustlers going every day so let's just take a look see what we got here. First of all got a bunch of cheese, a bunch of bacon because we're living that keto diet.

We also have about 100-150 eggs in there. We have an empty jar of pickles just the juice and there's a spoon in there. Cool.

I got some more pickled things. Got some deli sliced jalapenos, some mild pepper reins, and another empty jar of pickles. So that's that's like the main food groups.

We got eggs, bacon, pickles, and Coke Zero. Favorite of our founder Sam. And on the fridge you can see we have all of our state magnets.

We have a bunch of team members from a bunch of different states. California, Cleveland, what what, Indiana, Missouri, the Berg, Jersey, Texas. So pretty much from all over and that's pretty much it guys.

Thanks for checking it out. Stay up. Do definitely music.

All knowns.
