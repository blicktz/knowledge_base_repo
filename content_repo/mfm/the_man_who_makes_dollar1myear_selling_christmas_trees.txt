So this Christmas tree thing is kind of crazy. The story is this article that I read in Curbed. Basically, it's talking about the brutal mafia-style business of Christmas tree sales in New York.

And I'm just going to read you a paragraph here that just captures it. It goes, Christmas trees are a big business in New York. A lot of people see the quaint little shacks that appear on the side of the road just before Thanksgiving with a bunch of trees.

And you think, oh, these are probably independently owned, maybe by jolly families of lumberjacks looking to make a few holiday bucks. That's what I thought anyways. In reality, a few eccentric, obsessed, and sometimes ruthless tycoons control the sale of almost every tree in the city.

They call themselves tree men. And they spend 11 months a year preparing for Christmas time, which to them is a 30-day sprint to grab as much cash as they can. I'm in.

You're in, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This needs to be a Netflix show, right?

Yeah. And is this the one about this guy named Scott? Well, there's a bunch of guys.

So it talks about like the different guys because they basically carved up the territories. Like you got Harlem. This one guy gets Manhattan.

This other guy's got the east side. And they all have different territories. And they all have crazy names.

So it's like George Nash and Kevin Hammer. And it's like, oh, yeah, Nash got Harlem. He's a smooth-talking hippie from Vermont.

Hammer is a Brooklyn-born Scientologist who was a powerful force in the business. He's the one who shaped it. Hammer is rumored to own half the tree stands in Manhattan, bringing in more than a million dollars every December.

Hammer is Hammer lives on a yacht somewhere in the Atlantic, and he visits New York only at Christmastime, where he holds up in a midtown hotel room with a pile of cash on the bed and a pit bull squatting on either side of him. Like, is this even real? What am I reading?

That sounds fake. Dude, if you sell a million dollars of trees in one month, like with all your expenses, like that's like a $150,000, $200,000 a year salary. Yeah.

Like way more aura. Yeah, you might have a pit bull, but there ain't going to be piles of cash or a yacht. It might be like 50%.

I can see there's a world where there's like 50% margin all in. Well, you ain't owning yachts in Manhattan if it's on $500,000 a year. You've been doing it for like 20 years.

This is an old article. So I think, yeah, it's pretty crazy. So then it talks about like, basically, one interesting thing is it talks about the history of the Christmas tree.

So it says 200 years ago, the idea of putting a tree inside your apartment would be a bizarre decision. It didn't make any sense. This is supposed to be shelter from the outside.

Why would you bring a tree in? And it talks about how like Christmas trees that are trees themselves weren't even really associated with Christmas time. And then it says that started his change in 1851.

There was a Dutchman named Mark Carr who was like, I think I can do this. What's doing this? He's like, selling trees to people for the spirit of Christmas.

And so he goes, he's considered the father of Manhattan Christmas tree business. And we don't know much about him. But basically, the way it describes him is he was out of work.

And he realized that he could chop up a tree from the forest, bring it into the city, and try to sell it to the people in the city to have like a piece of like, you know, nature with them. And he goes and he tells his wife. She's like, that idea sucks.

This is the great story of every entrepreneur. Tell your wife an idea. She says it sucks and you do it anyways.

I think that's the real American dream. And so he comes in and he basically tries to associate these trees with Christmas spirit, with the jolly wintertime. And he goes and he got a permit for $1 to sell it inside Washington Market, which was like their wholesale bazaar.

And he starts to explain to people there that these are trees that you can stand upright in your house. And it signifies Christmas. And he sold about a day.

And that kind of started the trend of indoor Christmas trees. Again, assuming this article is not fake completely and the onion. My parents used to do this for a living.

They owned a fruit stand. You're just sitting on that fact for five minutes while I'm making up shit about the Christmas trees? No.

So to this day, I've told you my father's a produce broker. So basically, these are made up numbers. But hypothetically, he'll buy a million dollars of onions from a farmer and then organize a truck to go pick them up and then sell that load of onions to Walmart for $1.1 million and hopefully make $100,000 in profit of which 50 goes to the truck or whatever.

You know, made up numbers. But the way he got into that was my mom and dad owned a fruit stand on the side of the road. And that fruit stand made a lot of money every October by selling pumpkins and every Christmas selling Christmas trees.

And my mom would tell stories about getting up at 5 a.m. in the morning in order to flip the pumpkins because I guess they can't rest on one side for too long. Otherwise, they get lopsided.

And they would package up these trees and they would just sell a shitload of Christmas trees and that would make their Q4. I am fascinated by these kind of once a year businesses. Like Michael Girdley came on the podcast.

He was talking about his fireworks business where 99% of the revenue happens the day before July 4th, right? Like July 3rd is 99% of the revenue. And it's like, what a make or break.

What a high stress, but also kind of peak season versus off season style of business. And those kind of fascinate me. We've talked about before, like I think one of the great side hustles is going around the neighborhood and basically saying, hey, like, do you want us to put Christmas lights up for you?

We'll put Christmas lights up. Like I think you can make, you know, tens of thousands of dollars in a six-month sprint if you just wanted to go knock on doors and ask, you know, the same question over and over again. And I think that, like there's a guy in our neighborhood who basically does that.

You know, he hits up, he gets like 50 houses to say yes to this thing. Each one of us pays, you know, I think I paid like $1,700 for like a basic Christmas lights thing that took him, you know. And the guy who was knocking on the door wasn't even the guy who put the lights up.

So I don't even know if he was just like a lead gen guy. I don't know who he was, but you know, I respect the hustle. All right, my friends.

So a lot of you guys who listen to the show, you listen because you want to start a company, but you're not sure what idea to choose. Or you may not even have an idea. And you like our podcast, My First Million, because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas.

What's this health startups that have wild traction? So there's a couple of health startups that just caught my eye as normally there's a bunch of these ideas that sound really great and then they just never work. And a lot of them are like, and they're all the things that, you know, basically a rich, smart, San Francisco, LA, New York type of person does or wants in their life.

And they think that everybody does and wants that and that it can be accessible to all of them. But actually, it's too expensive and too hard to do and too bespoke and all this stuff. Ideas that fall into this category were like music discovery.

And then there's like... Let me give you a good example. This was a headline in Business Insider.

Billionaires plan to launch a media brand around the zeitgeist of Brooklyn. Exactly. A billionaire launching a media company about how Brooklyn is where it's at.

That's the worst. I'll take how to lose $50 billion for $100, Alex. You know, the Instagram co-founders after Instagram, their like revenge company was this news reading app.

So they basically, they quit Facebook and they were like, ah, Facebook is kind of bastardizing Instagram. They're just copying Snapchat and like all this shit. And they were kind of like making these low-key like passive aggressive remarks.

And then they were like, we're doing it again. And they did this photo shoot of them in their like, you know, like in their vacation home where they get away when they want to be creative. And they say they're going to like try to change the way that we consume news and make news, you know, less biased and more like easy to consume and all this stuff.

And like, of course, you know, two years later, they shut it down because that's, again, this kind of like smart, wealthy, well-meaning person trying to solve a problem that they have, but that not a lot of, it's not, it basically is not junk food. Like people want junk food, people want Cheetos, and they want the Cheeto dust on their fingers. And anybody who's like, I'm going to take the Cheeto dust off their fingers, they just don't find a lot of demand typically.

Okay. So this is like what I, there's like one model of the world I have. And then there's, but then you always pay attention to what's going to break your frame.

Where am I too biased? Where have I locked in? And, and maybe the world is changing underneath me.

And so there's two health startups. And so Daniel Eck, who is the founder of Spotify, who is awesome guy, but it checks a bunch of the boxes, right? Billionaire who's, you know, coming off of a, you know, huge, you know, life altering, you know, win of a company.

And he's been rich since he was 21. Been rich for a long time. And I'm obviously is at that Huberman phase where he's like, you know what, I need to like take care of my health.

I need to get a protocol. And like, I'm going to start taking these, like, you know, I'm going to start taking drugs that nobody can pronounce. And like, I'm going to do all these things.

Right. And that's like a normal thing that like, you know, I'm sort of biohacking and like, like protocol phase of life. Like, yeah, exactly.

So he's in his protocol phase. And so he, he launches this thing called Neko Health. And it even had like the other kind of like, uh-oh, warning signs where it's like, he's not really running it.

He's like a part of it. But he's like, wait, you're running Spotify. So how are you going to do this?

Like, oh, there's like a team that's running it. Okay. So maybe this operator model, who knows?

We'll see what happens. So, you know, there were some warning signs. Instead, there's this post that came up.

So he posts on LinkedIn and Daniel posts over 60,000 signups in just 12 weeks. It's been only three months since we launched Neko Health in London. The response has been nothing short of incredible.

Over 60,000 people have signed up for a scan, which reflects a growing shift towards preventative healthcare and early detection. And I think it's sort of like, you know, maybe pre-nuvo-esque. Dude, by the way, I think that's bullshit.

Getting 60,000 email subscribers. I don't think that's particularly. Maybe.

Maybe. Because, like, if you go to the website, like, it's the craziest, awesomest thing you could imagine. It's a $250 scan, right?

So let's just say, you know, the full value of this is $15 million pipeline in three months. Now, you're saying, okay, some of you will just looky-loos. Sure, of course.

Not all these people are going to convert. Okay, fine. Even if it's one-fifteenth of that, if they booked a million dollars in bookings for this thing in 12 weeks, for a single geographic location in London, that's kind of interesting to me.

That's not nothing, right? That's not, like, this pie-in-the-sky thing. What's it do?

I think what they're trying to do is, basically, they're going to scan your body. They're going to look for moles. And they're going to look at your arteries and your cholesterol levels and all this stuff.

And they're going to be, it's like a better health check, okay? So it's preventative. It's not, like, normally, you know, normal health care system is you have symptoms.

We sort of tell you to take two Advils. You come back. You're like, hey, I still got the symptoms.

And they're like, okay, well, let's check some basic things here in the office. And then you're like, dude, I really think something's wrong. It's like, all right, go get a scan, right?

So when you're broken, you get scanned. And the idea where health care is going is, like, you get scanned before you're broken to tell you where you might break or what's starting to break so that we can fix it earlier, right? Obviously, like, anybody can agree with that idea.

But actually doing it and making it work, both technically and building the brand around it and getting consumers excited about it and getting enough funding or getting enough revenue in the door for this to be a real business, it's pretty impressive to me. Okay, so that was the first thing that happened, that little post. The second thing was, I'm an investor in this thing called Superpower.

Have you, are you an investor in this? I think you told me about it and it looks amazing. So superpower.com, so it says a new era of personal health, the world's most advanced digital clinic to help you live longer, prevent disease and feel your best.

Okay, ignore all that. Ignore all that. All it is, is a 10 times better version of an annual physical.

Okay, I like that. Okay, you're getting an annual physical anyway. If you're bought into the idea of I should get an annual physical, here is a better annual physical.

And they're like, okay, what's a 10x experience of the annual physical? And by the way, I love that idea. The simplicity of that pitch, of that mission, I think is really, really powerful.

And the thing costs like, I don't know, like 400 or 500 bucks. So it's like, I would be willing easily to pay. Dude, you're on their homepage right below Mark Zuckerberg's sister and right next to the Winklevoss twins.

Oh, hold on. Mark Zuckerberg's sister? Well.

Okay, well. Still pretty cool. My excitement went up and down.

You're right next to Mark Zuckerberg's sister. Shout out to, was it Ariel? Yeah.

Cool, actually. I met her. I met her at a party.

She was actually very cool. Okay, yeah. Me and the Winklevoss twins and then a bunch of MDs and Bology.

Okay, so let me just tell you a little bit about this. So they sent this investor update. I think I'm allowed to share this.

So Jacob, one of the founders, he sends this investor update. And I invested in this thing like a little while back. Didn't kind of hear about it.

They were like working on it. Honestly, he was like, all right, we'll see when this thing comes out. And here's what they said.

They go, the best doctors in the world already offer this today. But having a concierge doctor who does this type of work for you can cost like 100K plus. It's right.

It's only for rich people. So our job is to make that available to everybody. Okay, so then.

By the way, I'm going to my concierge doctor tomorrow for my checkup. And it's not $100,000. What do you pay?

20K a year? No, maybe 5,000. A year?

That's it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's okay.

I don't want the facts. Bottom of the barrel. Have a doc here.

Yeah, I found them in the yellow pages. No, I don't want facts. I have a friend who has Peter Atiyah as his doc.

And I think it's a quarter million dollars a year. So there's a range. And you're on one side of that range.

You're not in the middle. That's the good news. Yeah.

I'm definitely on one end of that bell curve. Not the good one. They wrote these stats and they were like, we had 3 million hits to our site during launch week.

Wow. I was like, what? And they said, our wait list has grown to over 100,000 people.

What? I was like, what is going on? And so I emailed them and their product is, the first product of the membership is a 10x better version of the annual physical.

And so basically it's like. Is that the language they use in their documentation or you just saying this is just 10x better? This is what they said to me in an email.

Got it. And they were like, you know, basically you're going to get 100 plus lab tests, a full body report, an hour long consult with your doctor, a limited QA with your doctor throughout the year, additional health consults and whatever at Insider Prizes for 499 bucks. Okay.

I kind of buy this value prop, right? Like I think that's going to work. And so I was like, dude, that's pretty crazy.

Like, how can you even offer this for 500 bucks? Secondly, did you say you had 3 million visits during launch week and 100,000 person wait list? Like, how did you do that?

Because, yeah, I tweeted your thing out. But like, you know, as much as I love to pat myself on the back, I don't think I can help anywhere near that type of those type of numbers. And they were like, yeah, like basically in the first three or four months, 100,000 people signed up for this thing.

So superpower.com, their site is beautiful. But the way to you, you can click join. Did you say thank you?

Yeah. That's my thing nowadays. I'm just, I'm slipping in thank yous and your welcomes when people are not trying to give me compliments.

It's great. Or when you're 0.1% of the, of the reason why it looks good. You know, like you, you.

We have a 100,000 person wait list. Yeah. Do, is it in person?

So like, is the checklist done? Or sorry, is the checkup done in person? No.

So how do they like, like, you know, like do the thing where I like cough? I think, I don't know, because I haven't been a customer yet. I'm on the wait list still.

But I assumed it's like those other, like all telemedicine. Where basically, let's say they send you to a diagnostic, like, you know, a quest type of thing to do the blood draw. Got it.

They order your labs. And then there's a doctor remote who's analyzing your labs, who does the call with you, does the consult, talks to you, all that stuff. Understood.

Okay. Anyways, I thought that was pretty crazy traction. Because I was like, dude, if I was like, let's just take the total potential value of the pipeline.

You're saying during launch week or during this, like kind of first couple months after you just announced the company, you have $49 million of potential revenue in the, in the list. Which, of course, only a fraction of a fraction is that, is that going to convert. But, I mean, it's still just like really impressive.

So, a lot of these health startups that I thought were kind of like wishful thinking, I think something has shifted in the culture where health startups are no longer wishful thinking. And people are legit willing to pay. And you see this with content.

You see this with Huberman, with Peter Atiyah, with Brian Johnson. And I think you just, I think there's a shift happening where health is cool, health is in. And whatever that next layer of like the market, you know, that next segment of the bell curve that's interested in this, but it's a big like sizable chunk.

It feels like another part of the bell curve has gotten unlocked of people who are willing to spend. What's the early adopter phase? Is it like, like, it's like freaks and then it's like early adopters and then it's like everyone else.

Like, what is it? What's like the. We should rename all the segments.

Yeah. Yeah. Like, like fucking quacks of weirdos.

Yeah. People you hate to talk to. Yeah.

Like, you know, it's like. Innovators. That's the one you're talking about.

Freaks and geeks. Yeah. All right.

So the freaks and geeks. And then there's early adopters, which are the wannabes. That's us.

Yeah. So we're, we, we keep an eye on what the freaks and geeks are doing and we start to, you know, half ass copy them. And then there's the early majority.

And the early majority is kind of like, you know, the smart, reasonable person. And then you get to late majority and then the laggards, which is like, you know, your, your mom who still has a newspaper subscription and, you know, whatever else. AOL email address.

My mom does actually. And I, so I, I would say I'm early adopter. Sometimes I'm the innovator for some of these things.

And I think what's going to happen based off of my pattern is I think a lot of these things are one-off stuff. So I have tested so many different blood work companies just because they're the latest and greatest and it's exciting to try something new. In general, I've not had a huge amount of repeat purchase for many of them.

For some of them, I've like, for example, do you remember Forward Health? Mm-hmm. Like I, like something like that.

I was like, oh, I'm actually in. Or you remember One Medical, which is, you know, like popular now. We've been paying, I've been a paying customer of theirs for like five years.

So some of them I become like recurring customers. But I love trying new stuff. What I think is going to happen is now it's shifting to now the one past the early adopters.

They are now open to trying this stuff. And so I think getting a wait list, I actually think it's less challenging than it appears. But making it so you come back every year is really, really hard.

And it's going to be interesting to see who can pull that off. Because I've done the Pronovos. I've done, you know, InsideTracker.

Have you? Yeah. Like I've done everything.

And they're awesome. It's just a matter of like, which ones do I rely on every quarter or every year? As opposed to, I just found some new drug and I just want to stick it in my body this one time.

Just to see what's up. And I'll never touch it ever again. There's a lot of people like me who do that, by the way.

Yeah. Yeah. You're on the fitness and health side, I would say you're in the freaks and geeks category.

Yeah. Right? You were telling me about like, dude, I injected this stuff in my butt and I don't have cravings anymore.

And basically you were talking about Ozempic before Ozempic had like a brand name. You're like, I read about it on a forum and it's amazing. I don't eat candy anymore.

This is going to change the world. I think I told you about that in 21. I think it was summer.

I think it was summer of 21 and or something like that, maybe 22. And I remember telling you when I was like, when I put this stuff in my body, it feels like people who have alcohol and addiction issues. I think that's going to go away.

Right. And then actually last week, my friend Jason went to a conference and the CEO of Eli Lilly, I think it is, the maker of one of the semiglutide or Ozempic competitors, he announced that it has been officially approved for alcoholics. So like I do put weird shit in my body just to see what's up.

And I actually texted you eight months ago, I think. And I said this new one, I forget what I called it. It was like, it started with a T.

And I was like, this one, this is going to be the one. What was that called? Yeah, I remember thinking I should buy Eli Lilly stock when you told me that because I was like, who makes this?

And I'm in. I learned my lesson the first time, like kind of writing off your weird health experiments. And I was like, okay, I'll just blindly follow this.

But Eli Lilly is already a $750 billion company. So I was like, okay, I don't know how much upside is left on that. Like even if it became a $2 trillion company, it's like, what am I really thinking is going to happen here with this thing?

So I think I missed that. But if you look at like a five-year span, Eli Lilly is up 10x almost in the five-year span, 8x. Do you do any health stuff today that you think?

Doesn't it show? Thank you. The sentence was not ending.

Do you do any health stuff? Do you do any health stuff today? Are you trying to die?

Do you do any health stuff today that you think is considered a freak and will one day be the norm? Yeah, two things. I don't think these are like in the freak.

I guess they are. I guess if I took a population of 1,000 people and I said, how many people are doing this? I think the number would probably be zero.

Even if I went to a CrossFit type of like health community, 1,000 people and I said, who's doing what I'm doing? I think the number is zero. You, I think, have done one of these things.

But there's basically two things I do on a daily basis and have been doing now for probably two years. The first is breathwork every morning. Yeah, that's awesome.

So I do breathwork every morning. It only takes me six to 10 minutes. I use the Othership app.

It's the best breathwork app. I think you might have invested. I invested it too, but this is not a shill.

I don't even think the app is their product anymore. Like the app is like their side thing. They have like physical locations in New York and stuff, but their app is so good for breathwork.

So I do that. The second thing I do is I work out, but I don't do what most people do when they work out. So, you know, I would say conventional workouts are either cardio or weightlifting.

And then some people will do like a yoga, Pilates, something that's flexibility, pliability based. And my trainer got really into something and I'm into whatever he's into because he's my trainer for life. And he got really into something called functional patterns.

It's basically a style of training that I think the way to describe it would be. Like it helps you pick up a baby when you're old, right? Where it's like.

Yeah, it's like, so it's based around core movements. So like, like if you like sport, this will make a lot of sense to you. If you don't like sport, if you're just used to going to the gym and trying to get a pump, then this might not make a lot of sense to you.

But like if you play any sport, baseball, tennis, basketball, whatever it is, like the core movement in all of the sports is like, let's say throwing. It's a twist motion of your body. Yeah, it's not like a squat or a bench press where it's a linear lift weight up.

It's, yeah, I understand. Love the pronunciation of linear there. That was awesome.

That was like European. Yeah, it was like, I also call it personal finance. Yeah, exactly.

So the callers of this are, all right, so, so yeah, so if you go to a gym, everything is usually static. It's rigid. Or even if it's like a dynamic movement, it very rarely involves like torque.

And if you do that wrong, obviously you can get really hurt, but doing it right matters. So functional patterns is based around moving in like the four kind of core movements. So run or sprint, throw, which is a twisting motion, jump, and then I don't know, I think it's just like walk, like your gait.

And so like I literally, like my workout when I go downstairs is not to like, I go to my gym and it's not like some like Barry's boot camp music blasting, like go, go, go, push, push, push. It'll literally be like, all right, let's practice our gait. And it's like, are you putting the right amount of weight on your big toe?

How's your weight shift? Let's look at your ankle mobility here. Let's try to get strong in this position.

It's like things that don't even look like you're doing a workout. It looks like you're rehabbing from an injury, but it's an injury you never had. It's like to prevent all your injuries.

And so like I do it, my mom does it. He trains like NBA players with this. It's like, it's, it's that type of training where it's very much for sport and it's for, yeah, it's, it's to prevent like disease and like breakages in your body.

So it's a weird, it's a weird style of training, but that's something that I do, you know, four times a week, basically. Mine, mine are, I think that in 15 years, we're going to look at Whole Foods sort of like a discount grocer where it's like, you know, however you look at like Kroger or Safeway or wherever your regional like Normie brand is. That's what Whole Foods is going to be.

I think that people are going to be like, they're going to think it's nonsense and they're going to, instead they're going to want to buy their meat locally. So I think that. Is that because it's marketing smoke and mirrors or it's just not the top of the top?

There is, there's no more levels above that. Which one is it? Is it that it's not what they say it is?

It's kind of like, it's just a marketing stick or there's, there's even better. It's not what they say it is. And also because they were the first popular health food store, we still hold them with high prestige.

But in reality, I don't think they're that high prestige. I think maybe it's a lot more expensive than other alternatives, but I'm not convinced that it's actually significantly different than anything else. And what makes you say that?

Because if you go and look at the ingredients of the hot food bar, so if you go to the hot food bar and you look at the ingredients, it's shit. It's not good. Like they got all types of crap in the, in those ingredients.

And that like, to me is like a signal. That's a canary in a coal mine type of vibe. Gotcha.

And I also, when you look at the meat. So when you look at the meat, so I tend to buy, during the summertime, I have a farmer's market across the street from my house. So I tend to buy my meat there.

And the chickens are like bright yellow. Have you ever seen like a, like a, like a chicken from a farm that you get? It's like.

No. I've seen eggs. Eggs look different.

But they look way different. They look way different. They look way different.

It's like a bright yellow. Honestly, it's kind of gross if you're not used to seeing it. And so all the foods have way more color in them.

And you go to Whole Foods and it's kind of weird to think that a company as big as Amazon can somehow get lots and lots and lots of fresh, healthy stuff. Isn't that fucking insane how in Connecticut in December, I can still get a strawberry? Like that's ridiculous when you think about that like supply chain.

And there's no way that you could do that, in my opinion, in some type of like safe way. Like it's better to do like local in-season type of thing. And I think local meat in particular is going to be a huge trend in the next 15 years.

You're seeing it a little bit. Like there's a lot of people in Austin who I know that were like yuppie types, not like rednecks or farmers. And they would buy whole cows and you'd store it in your freezer.

And I think that will be more common soon. Do you agree or disagree? I do agree with that because you're right.

When I think about the freaks and geeks in my life, a lot of them already do that. It's like they have a favorite ranch. Yeah.

It's like where do you get your meat? And I was like, the store. What are you talking about?

Like, you know, I don't have a, I don't like to have farms on speed dial. I don't have like a personal relationship with a ranch, but they do. And they have like, they'll open up their freezer and there's all these like kind of like frozen steaks basically that they have.

Yeah, you like spend a thousand dollars and you get like a year's worth of beef. Right. So like, I don't know and understand that.

I also, I don't know if this is true or this was just a one-off thing, but like aren't farmers markets, like I've read something that farmers markets got in trouble because the, they looked into where they were getting the stuff and it wasn't like from a farm. It was like, they were taking this, the safely rejects and like stuff that was about to expire and just selling it at the farmer's market as like, Ooh, like this is, this is, you know, straight farm to table or whatever. So I don't know how much I trust, like, you know, even my local farmer's market.

That's the problem with all food. Yeah. And I agree with that.

What do you trust? You know? Yeah.

My sister one time went to Ghana for some trip and she came back with the souvenir that she bought from some kids on the street thinking they made it. And it said made China on the back. And so that's basically what like this little lady selling chicken at my farmer's market might be doing.

So yeah, that definitely could be a thing. I think another thing is that in the future, I think a lot of people are going to have plants in their homes way more than they do now. I think plants are going to be a lot more popular because it keeps the air clean.

And I think one of the things in 20, 30 years, we're going to look back and be like, you had dirty ass air in your house all the time. That's probably why you feel sick all the time. I think that here's one natural fiber clothes.

That's going to make a big comeback. So there's one company called Ryker. R-Y-K-E-R.

I don't know these guys. They just think it's cool. They make all cotton workout gear.

Workout gear in particular, oftentimes you want like some type of sweat absorbing, stretchy material. Typically, that's not natural fibers. And so a lot of people are wearing shorts and shirts and underwear that has plastic in it and has forever chemicals in it.

And I think that natural fiber clothing is going to be a lot more in fashion in the next 10 to 20 years because of what we're going to learn about forever chemicals and plastic and foods. And then the last one is one-use plastics. I think we'll make a decrease.

I think that it's weird how much bottled water we drink. And so those are some of my predictions. But the cotton clothing, I would bet a lot that that will be a very popular trend in the next 20 years, a health trend.

Is there like a trade-off, like quality, price? What's the trade-off here? Yeah, like look, the reason why Lululemon is dope is because when you put on a Lululemon pair of shorts and it has that nice stretchy feel, and when you stretch it, it goes right back to how it's supposed to be.

That is man-made material. So like it's good in that sense. It's probably cheaper as well.

Like natural fibers, I think, are probably more expensive. And they like, have you ever had a sweater that you wear a bunch and it starts losing shape? Like that doesn't happen with like a Lululemon, what I call it a swishy material.

What's like the rain, water-resistant like material for like a range? Like that shit doesn't happen with that. Right.

So that there is a trade-off is that like some of these man-made stuff are definitely more convenient or are better performing. That's why they call like... Performance wear or whatever.

Performance wear. Yeah, it's because it is like better performance. Right.

So there is, yeah, there is a trade-off. But I do think it's going to be more popular. Riker is actually the only company I have found that is making somewhat interesting non-toxic workout gear.

But that's like an interesting... It's an interesting angle for a company like that to get started in. Right, right.

Okay, fascinating. Do we want to wrap it there? I feel inspired to be a healthier, better local eating man machine.

Dude, local eating is great, man. It's great. I got a nice old Russian lady who makes great cheese.

You need some cheese? I got a lady. It's fantastic.

I kind of want to have a guy or a gal for every food that I eat. It's like I have like a hummus lady. I got a chicken guy.

That seems like my future to have that. Dude, I'm down. All right, that's it.

That's the pod. That's the pod. Thank you.
