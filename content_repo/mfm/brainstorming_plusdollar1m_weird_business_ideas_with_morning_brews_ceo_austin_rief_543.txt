dude this is a great idea this is why we started this podcast for somebody to come on and say yeah i just built a hundred million dollar media company but guys smoking meats is where it's at what's up we got the three amigos of newsletters the short story of austin is out of college create morning brew sold it for i think i read 75 million so don't you have to correct me if i'm wrong but 75 million bucks you still run it hundreds of employees amazing you have a doc here of a bunch of topics yeah someone sent me this deck like last week and i was gonna text sam about this i was like let me wait for the pod to talk to you guys about this this is a uh i feel like i'm my first million special so i've been super excited about a bunch of these post covid get out of your house do exciting things that's not go to a bar and just drink i think that's pretty boring and there are a bunch of these in new york i don't know how if they have where you guys live but they have uh ping pong bars and pool bars and they get more and more uh out there and i was tweeting about this and some guy sent me a deck he goes i got something interesting for you so if you have your computer up look up uh bingo loco right this guy sends me this this deck for bingo i'm like well what the hell is this right bingo loco uh it's basically a club meets bingo right so boozy bingo performers confetti showers the the whole thing this looks like a tiesto concert or something going on what is this i didn't know people played bingo off of cruise ships like i thought bingo was either for old people or cruise ships he sends me his deck i don't want to disclose their numbers but he goes check out one of our competitors uh bongo bingo usa and i'm like there's no way there's a whole industry for bingo raves for bingo parties dude the websites are exactly the same dude they just copied each other it looks like those i i again he just sent me a deck apparently people in the industry said these bongo bingo guys apparently uh pre-covid we're doing 20 million a year in revenue no way explain this model do they own the place or they're just going and like doing a pop-up bingo night at some place no i think they go all it's actually really smart right because what they do is i believe they go for pretty off nights for certain places right so you know so nights were a club or whatever wherever they had these wouldn't be that popular but they still bring that environment right so they still use a lot of the infrastructure that these these venues have and they bring it seems like the whole show the confetti showers the performers everything and what i think is interesting is they keep you there with the bingo right so there's a there's a shuffleboarding place in brooklyn right they keep you there because you play shuffleboard for you know hours and hours and you're just buying drinks and that that's like the the shtick that's the hook to get you in and it's the same thing game of bingo i'm sure they have performers mid-game they keep you there for seven hours you just buy a bunch of drinks so i thought this one was awesome tickets are 53 right now wow and they sell these out i guess so they must be making money off the boots right i was i was trying to do more research and there's not that much information i never heard of it but they must be making their money off of the boots well look at this ad so i went to their ad library people of minneapolis a bingo rave is coming to granada theater march 15th which uh is a couple months out it says after a single sold out shows across america biggo loco it has minneapolis in its sights and then it's got like this tiktok video which literally looks like you're at like a rave and you go there and then that's the you know 30 ticket and then there's like a you know what what is this basically there's a host there's music there's confetti there's um you know dance-offs links lip sync battles there's a you know there's drinks basically there's alcohol this is like uh the sound it's like that on a website that's the business plan you open up open up a deck and it just plays that sound i've got four words for you investors i'm sure the margins on this are crazy their costs are some some random performers and and bingo again i i i played bingo one time on a cruise ship and these guys are making what seems like 20 million bucks a year off bingo i gotta we gotta figure out what we can do this next for all right everyone a quick break to tell you about hubspot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because i'm gonna show you a real life example so i've got this company called hampton joinhampton.com it's a community for founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like 250 million dollars a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then i shared this page on twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and i could see did they come from social media i can see did they come from twitter from linkedin basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from i'm able to track all of that and then i'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of hampton in other words i can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic source things like that but the best part is i can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen hubspot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the link's in the description and i'll also put the link to the survey that i did so you can actually see the landing page and how it works and everything like that i'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to mfm so you make a lot of money at morning brew doing digital stuff and you just hit send on a little email it's easy kind of kind of easy uh why on earth do you care about physical stuff that seems way more challenging yeah i don't know if i would ever start something in this space but it's just so fun to go see to go see the way people you know i would never think this would work in a million years i would never think bingo uh on steroids bingo uh performers would work but i think it's so interesting i love going to these things around the city to try to see how people get people hooked on these things it's so easy to hook people in a newsletter right it's it's content every day it's very different people come back to to play shuffleboard or bingo so i i love these i have an idea for one can i pitch you guys one all right so i'm sure you know as soon as you set this bingo thing my brain starts the wheels start turning and sam you appreciate this you like the ufc so i don't know if you remember when conor mcgregor was on his come up uh he was knocking people out he was knocking people out it was the best and this guy everyone's like what can't this guy do because everybody thought whoever the next guy's fighting that guy's gonna neutralize him with this this and this knocks him out and i remember watching uh one you know uh ex-usc fighter he was doing like an analysis and he's like i'm watching connor he does all this spinning shit and he does this he does this he's like i think it's all smoke and mirrors he goes i think everything is just a distraction because he's trying to land the left hand and he's like you know that's every all this stuff he's throwing he doesn't care what happens with it he's just trying to hit you with the left hand to me this is the same business model like the bingo it's like oh you hear about that bingo business no no you hear about that alcohol business that uses bingo to get you to the bar so similarly we got to figure out what's going to get people to the bar and get him drinking and so here's my idea i've always wanted to enter one of those eating contests i don't know if you guys have ever done one i've never actually done it but like those places where it's like if you can eat this pizza it's free and like i've always wanted to actually go do it but there's always like this problem where it's like it's like you have to pay 75 dollars to like buy the huge pizza it might be free but you you know whatever i would love if somebody turned this into like you know if i was in college i would have been all over this if it was like it's it's the contest is who can eat the biggest you know who can eat the most hot dogs or the biggest pizza who could finish it the fastest and you can go enter and you have to bring friends to be kind of your cheering section they're all rowdy and drinking and cheering you on it's free to play because the pizza is not that expensive but you're going to fill up the bar with like you know whatever hundreds of people who are in the mood to kind of like binge and go extreme because that's kind of the theme of the night in a way it's like sports meets binge eating well what's the best thing that goes with both those things binge drinking who's with me the only thing you can add is a little bit of gambling you need to have people gamble this is like gamble it's like gambling right it's it's it's vegas meets a party so just add some betting beautiful yes and there awesome i don't know if you've been doing some improv but that was a beautiful yes and i really appreciate that one good riff i follow this guy on youtube he's called beer meets food and looks like he has uh 3.6 million subscribers have you guys seen this guy he just goes to small restaurants in england that they have like you know uh you get this free if you eat it he eats roughly 10 000 calories in each of the challenges and he nails all of them like one time he ate like i think it was five pounds of chocolate have you seen this sean this guy's channel it's the craziest channel i've ever seen and i watch all of his videos it's one of the few youtube channels i subscribe to this guy needs to launch your food challenge gambling business and there's actually a bunch of these instagrammers that you could do this with so uh you know there's that guy who eats the raw meat i think he's called raw meat experiment read his bio read his bio sean his bio is great i so 142 000 followers he goes eating raw meat every day until i die from bacteria then it says line two seeing if i live for five days or 500 years and literally he'll just take a chunk of ground beef and just sits outside of a whole foods he buys the ground beef and he just eats it raw or he'll just get a chicken breast uncooked and he'll just chew it like it's a you know uh i don't know like a slim jim or something like that and uh i feel like these there's so many instagram food mukbang like different variations of this like there's a lot of youtubers that that do this where they order just an insane amount of food watch me eat and it is entertaining to do i could feel like you could get them to host be like kind of guest host promotional to to do these pop-ups i used to um when i worked uh when i moved to san francisco i didn't have a lot and i would part-time i had like a part-time job and i worked for this guy joe garvey he had a company called clash it stood for california league of adventure scavenger hunt or something like that it was called clash sf and he was making seven figures a year and we would host these city wide uh scavenger hunts and they were the best it was so fun and i got to see some of the like economics of like some of these in-person stuff and i was actually pretty shocked at how great some of these could be it was a lot of work um and then we have another friend nick gray did you know sean that nick gray had a business called museum hack and he eventually sold it and it was doing many many millions in revenue and the way the business worked where it was he eventually or at first it was just like gorilla where he was he would like go to i think it was met the the met uh in um new york it's a free museum and people would pay 50 and he would give them a tour of the museum and he would explain the the art and then eventually he hired lots of theater kids to lead these tours and he had them set up in a variety of museums throughout the country and eventually he had a partnership after they like kicked him out a bunch of times and uh he said that business was awesome dude i love the way he described it too he uses the phrase renegade museum tours i just thought that was just a great way to pitch it he's like yeah i my first business i hosted renegade museum tours he doesn't really explain what it is but you try to put it all together and the word renegade i feel like is uh underutilized underhyped word i think i'm gonna try to try to bring that back into my my everyday uh vocabulary i think they made him i think time out made him the number one uh thing to do in new york and i think that's what blew him up right he blew up and then and of course he went b2b because that's where the money and all this stuff is right selling and you still have to consumer 50 bucks you sell the morning brew for 20 grand and our hr team just sides off and approves it austin last time you were here i think we we talked about like the creator economy and i'm almost certain all three of us were like this is gonna fizzle out and has your opinion changed and i know like some things have happened in like the news or the media world that has uh got you excited tell me about that yeah i think uh last time we spoke i remember we were all talking and we're like what what's the next milk road for right milk road for x we're all talking about that uh and really oh ai's popping up let's let's so much to launch the milk road for ai milk road for x that just got sean all all he's all hot man you're you're you're speaking to him perfectly awesome got on the call called me skinny and now he said milk road for hex x instead of morning brewer hustle for x and i am this guy's a charmer i love it just try to hype you up sean uh i mean look but there was 10 000 i mean there's beehives growing off the backs of milk road for ai and i think the the problem with these businesses are they their content's not very good they've all grown with these these crazy growth hacks which is great for the you know newsletter ecosystem as a whole but it's not sustainable i think there's there's no more alpha in the the newsletter game everyone talks about everything and i think beehive did for newsletters what shopify did for e-commerce right e-commerce stores started and people got super pumped they're like you know investors invested it away and then all these businesses because they're like oh shopify makes it so easy to start an e-com store and that's awesome the problem was they made it too easy to start an e-com store where everyone started e-com stores where you have to be either the absolute best or you just can't raise a bunch of money you have to be okay with it being like a fine business but everyone's just pouring in again not a ton of money but a ton of people just think oh if i can just create the the milk road for marketing the milk road for uh ai i'm gonna have a milk road like exit i just i don't know what you guys think but i just don't think these newsletters have it on a value let me ask you a different question uh you spent a bunch of time in media now how long have you been doing this like seven eight years something like that coming up on 10 oh my god uh wow incredible a third of your life you've spent in the media business i hope you don't spend the next two-thirds of your life on the media business too if you were going to do something different where would you go let's say media was off the table um what would you do next yeah so i think there are two types of businesses i love i think one is uh you know b2b i think you know we've all built businesses where the ltvs are like 15 bucks that's pretty tough uh i love you know selling significant enterprise products the other one is building the passion audiences that's i think where i'd actually go so you know we went to camp my first million last year and we met that guy i think his name was al who's building for uh filters al don't yeah um i think he does hundreds of millions of revenue so i think i want to find a niche there figure out you know what is a weird niche and so the one i've been spending a lot is i researching i almost did something here i ended up not doing it is meat smoking i am obsessed with my traeger right how do you use a traeger you live in an apartment in new york like on your balcony yeah on the i live in the first floor so i i have access to the common space so i don't i don't mean what what even is meat smoking can you just give me that but first dude it's such a pain in the ass it is such a pain in the ass grilling or it's different than grilling you cook you cook meat it like 200 degrees for like 10 12 hours it's like barbecuing but 10 hours and no fire and they use smoke instead i all of my jewish friends are into this because you guys grew up eating brisket you got to wait 10 hours to eat and you've got to buy like special like wood chips for it it's a fucking pain in the ass i've got friends that will wake up at four in the morning to like get their brisket started okay but i'm a believer anything that's a huge pain in the ass that people do there's like a shit ton of money there exactly right and so there's a couple big brands in smoking there's traeger right traeger's the one i have and the thing is to sam's point you don't just like it's not electricity i'll just like turn it on and it goes you have to uh it's it's wood pellets right you literally smoke wood pellets and these pellets traeger gets you to buy the thousand fifteen hundred dollar smoker but then also you're spending fifty dollars every time you smoke meats because you're just burning these pellets and there's a lot of meat smokers uh influencers out there these guys in nashville guys in texas and literally it's like how to smoke a ribeye how to smoke a brisket and they have tens of millions of views and they're all like kind of sophisticated they have these rubs that you put in your meats but none of them are taking big swings right none of them are built are building the traeger competitor i want to build the traeger or the green egg competitor sell the fifteen hundred dollar product sell the fifty dollar a month hundred dollar a month pellets and build the next traeger which i think is a multi you know billion dollar brand dude i'm fired up i'm smoked up right now that was a good pitch and you you seem pretty lit up about that uh why did you not do this this sounds awesome yeah i've been talking to some some meat smoking influencers uh i'm working on it the the the meat smoking boys that's what we'll call them what i like about these guys are they're just so much more down to earth than these new york city influencers you know it's not like that the the tick tock 22 year olds these are people who just love life they just want to smoke meats and if they can sell a grill even better there's there's this guy have you heard this guy um jonathan moses katz no who's that so he's a he's a woodworking creator right and he's done kind of what i'm saying but in the woodworking niche so this guy has done he was a big woodworking creator and he built some tools for and it's cool because obviously he's a woodworker so he can build them himself for his audience dude his site his site gets so much traffic this guy kills it i bet crushes it right and so i spoke to this guy one time so i don't i don't have you know any insider information but he crushed it and what he started to do is he started to partner with every other woodworking creator and said hey look i'm doing you know crushing it for myself selling a bunch of whatever widgets to my audience let me make you your own custom little thing you're in your woodworking niche and i'm going to help you all sell them as well and then we can build a collective store of all our all our products and and sean if you sell one on behalf of sam you'll kick him an affiliate this is a big business i bet you he does 50 million a year on so it's called km tools i think right yeah km tools i bet you this does in the 50 million range yeah i wouldn't be surprised it does more dude this is a great idea this is why we started this podcast for somebody to come on and say yeah i just built a hundred million dollar media company but guys smoking meats is where it's at this is a niche you're never really thinking about there's an opportunity here here's the here's the distribution model we're going to use i'm going to partner with these influencers and then do this kind of affiliate network and build this competitor this is awesome we're going to call it the meat smoking jerky boys and we're going to this this one this this way it allows us a little bit of a lateral expansion into uh the beef jerky space but we're going to call it the meat smoking jerky boys you know that you know that um that cigarette brand that we we love the branding and the packaging of oklahoma smokes yeah i feel like you kind of got to do it oklahoma smokes or like a a nashville nashville smokes club uh or something like that brought to you by the jerky boys and uh you know i think it's all needs to come together into one mega brand i have not seen this branding this is awesome oklahoma smokes we're stealing this we're buying the company just to steal the brand dude they're so good google like some of the most popular towns in louisiana and just pick one name that like stands out you know like tupelo meats or something i'm just i'm just hoping a big meat smoking influencer creator listens to this podcast and dms me on twitter and goes i'm ready to ride the baton rouge smoke company god there's just so many possibilities here um awesome i know when we started this conversation i didn't even know what smoking meats was but i'm in and hold a little check space for me on this company because i love to be a part of this you know i'm the opposite of an expert advisor here i'm actually going to be your your in-house beginner and that's how i'm going to add some value to you dude even zuck's into it remember remember the whole the the zuck uh meme about uh smoking me or whatever yeah he loves smoking meats and you're you're into this i know that for a minute austin you're talking about how you're like i want to partner with traders because i because like once you can attach with some of these folks you just you kill it is that what you would do i mean for this yeah i think that is still uh it ever it's very popular these days to partner with creators i still think that's the future i still think we're we're scratching the surface you know there's feastables and prime and everyone talks about those and it's definitely been played out in terms of talking about but i still think ultimately you're going to walk into a liquor store you're going to walk into target and every brand is going to have a face and association because why wouldn't it right if there's a brand that could have nobody attached to it or a brand that could have someone attached to it why wouldn't that brand have the built-in distribution of you guys or someone you know more widely well known or or just someone like i just don't see how that doesn't play out and so you know it's it's been done with the the biggest creators i think the real opportunities in the niches sean how big do you think first of all we don't really have that many like cool interests that you could have like an mfm product in target like what what are we gonna fucking sell red solo cups like i don't even know like what what what is there like tupperware like uh i don't know like what we could possibly sell the dumbest thing that would be associated with yeah like a notebook i don't i have no idea but mfm slinkies baby let's go how popular like what's like so barstool has like the barstool razor they're in uh uh stores so and they're a way bigger brand than they have a frozen pizza they have like they have a bunch of stuff how famous do we have to be do you think in order to make a dent into like getting sales at target so i don't think that famous if you pick the right product i actually think we're past the point where do you become more famous do you get more famous because your shit's in target like oh my god they're actually in target i think we're past the point where just fame is going to drive right i think that works for for a few people but i think you actually need to have a great product i think had them on the pod you know danny austin and uh her husband jordan yeah danny's big but danny's not as big as some of these other creators but her brand is worth way more than almost every brand out there because it's actually a product that has a need it's not hey we're gonna rip off you know one of the biggest brands on the planet it was a true it's a great product oh sam we could have done hymns have you ever taken it i don't know is it good i've never taken it either i've never tried it austin have you you're younger than we are have you done it no i have not all right guys we know what we're doing next time we hang out yeah doing a podcast we're gonna be playing swords so i think that this is gonna be like the new newsletter thing i think that people looked at feastables they looked at prime and they looked at skims and they're like creator brand and every creator is like i need to do a creator brand and every like former drop shippers like i just need a creator and then we win and they're all gonna go do this and then they're all gonna wash out there's obviously gonna be a few winners because the difference right like what logan paul did with prime is so different than what most creators do with their product like that guy a had like actually like a humongous audience took it everywhere built the brand sort of like brick by brick oh he's at wrestlemania guess what he's gonna fucking hit the guy over the head with a giant bottle of prime or like you know there's one and it was him and ksi right so they got two huge creators two big markets to pair together to go into this industry you know mr beast is like i'm gonna do feastables but he's not just like hey go ahead guys go buy my chocolate he's like i rebuilt willy wonka's chocolate factory for three million dollars and that's how i'm gonna launch this thing i'm gonna make the product the content the content is the product there's no line between the two and you know so you know he those worked because the creators really were like actual entrepreneurs and partnered with world-class operators to pull them off right like we talked about the guys behind prime those guys are monsters uh you're right those guys are in their 20s and mega billionaires for a reason have built multiple beverage brands for a reason the guy who built conor mcgregor's whiskey brand was also the guy who did like whatever two other alcohol brands that were multi-billion dollar dollar brands and they they partnered with him to do proper 12 and same thing conor is like mega mega famous and went all the way with the promotion versus other people may not i think the danny austin story is good because it was like her real story was like postpartum i was losing hair i was ashamed of it i bought wigs for the last year i've been wearing wigs while i've been an influencer but instead i really wanted to find a product that would work and here's the product here's my before and after and it's like that's like the perfect combination of things you have high margin product you have repeat purchase because people are gonna have to have to keep applying the thing you have a visual before and after and you have a true story around the creators like actual need versus just like a nice to have and you know that is like the you know that's the the yahtzee of putting these these together most people are not gonna be able to do that yeah but awesome you could do it you you've got that operator gene you could be one of these nerds well the thing is we're we're all doing it in the b2b space right so what we're doing is not is like okay we have one 100 the audience of a mr beast or a logan paul cool so we need to sell a product that's a hundred times more expensive than a bottle of crime right he spent he sells his for four bucks or whatever we're trying to sell products that cost four thousand or forty thousand or four hundred thousand dollars a year by doing b2b software right that's why hubspot did it with us and i think this is the other thing like austin you did a thread that was like this is the new thing but it's like dude people have been doing celebrity endorsements forever the difference is that now the celebrities own equity i'm like oh yeah people can do this wait a minute we did it that's us exactly that's good for their brand right like to help them sell a product that's worth thousands of dollars right it would be smart of us to do that not the uh the mfm whatever like target brand nail clip yeah exactly adult legos yeah and sam i think really that that is you and hampton like you really are i mean it's it's a what eight thousand dollar product like i think that is the perfect example you may not be tony robbins right you may not be gary v right maybe they're the equivalent of like the logan paul and b2b but you found a great product and it makes a lot of sense for your brand and your audience and so i yeah i think it's a it's a home run yeah keep showing speaking of tony robbins austin you know this episode's going to come out right after the episode with tony robbins so uh yeah which is good for austin i think that's good for you no i mean maybe but i i meant to start with this actually so maybe we'll cut this and put it at the beginning but you know when you start a not to shill hampton again i hate to do this but when you start a hampton session with your your group you you air grievances right everyone says can you be honest with everyone can you really have a good dialogue and discussion or is there anything you need to get out in the open well clearly we could because i didn't say this but but i i do need to tell everyone that monday you and i were supposed to talk like one o'clock sean's like i'm gonna i'm gonna call you awesome i give you a call one o'clock comes by no call two o'clock i'm like no call so i text him like sean what's going on you're like oh i'm prepping for the biggest you're texting me thanks for the call which is even better and so i'm like sean what the heck's going on you're like i'm i'm prepping for the big guest i'm like oh sean's hyping me up like 10 minutes later by the way that was actually tony robbins not you yeah so basically like he reached out or someone on his team reached out i had a thing planned and also sean is like the biggest fan so sean it was awesome that you got to like just hang out with a guy you admired how was it it was intense is the way i would explain it i mean when i tell you i prepared for this not only did i basically spend every waking moment for two days just like preparing for this thing which i never do for podcasts um i've also kind of been preparing for 10 years because i follow the guy and i'm a big fan of what he's i've been to three of his seminars like right i know a lot and oh there's there's kind of a curse of knowing too much going in and so like meeting your heroes type of thing yeah it's like you want it to go well so bad it's almost like you squeeze this like don't don't squeeze the bar of soap too hard it just squirts out like if you if you want it to go so well it's gonna fuck up i'll tell you guys the funny part so like interesting analogy interesting analogy it's not the bar of soap analogy you thought i was gonna do you know i took the road less traveled there so so we're getting ready to the pod it's me and mari we're sitting there and his team's like you know his team's like swarming the computer setup they're like tony will be here shortly uh you know just everything's okay and i'm like all right sweet i never get here early you know i'm like chronically late but for this one 20 minutes early so i'm sitting there for like 10 minutes and i could just feel myself getting cold i'm like oh no i can't just sit here and i was like i gotta use the shit tony teaches you you gotta be in state you want to have a peak performance you gotta be in a peak state of course right athletes do that well guess what what's one step down from an athlete a musician what's 25 steps down from that a podcaster and so i got up and i start doing my like tony robbins power move where i'm like i'm basically doing this like really dorky to like mid back stretch to like you know unlock my fucking chakras or something like that try to get some energy flowing and then i just hear hello and it's tony robbins i'm like rush back to my desk yeah sorry you're just staring at my chair there as i was doing like you know tony robbins stretches in the corner trying to get hype for this he just hears like off screen sean saying like i'm the man who's the man i'm the man i'm the man even better i'm visualizing thanks tony i had a good time too you want my number let me get it for you i'm working backwards from the desired end state just like you did just me but here's an off camera and it went well i mean i'm not going to give away too much but let me just say this tears were shed and they weren't mine and if there's one mark of a successful tony like life accomplishment i wouldn't say he cried wouldn't say well but he you know teared up and so you know i thought that that was a you know a good thing but it's really hard to interview somebody who is a stage performer like sam you must feel like this sometimes when i'm just monologuing monologuing monologuing like right now he's on he's like a next level at that and it's all good stuff but it's like you know it's like you poke the thing and an avalanche comes out were you ever like uh all right tony shut the fuck up let me ask my next question so uh this guy's like 45 minutes they were like um like you got 45 minutes with tony and i was like 45 minutes jeez this guy does nine hour a day seminars for four days straight like what am i gonna do in 45 minutes and then and i'm like hey uh you know actually it might be better if we do this in person i'm i will fly to you tomorrow and i'll be there and his team was like um no thanks uh we'll do you stay over there we'll do it this way instead but it was it was good i enjoyed it uh i do think i'm gonna just make a prediction awesome sorry to the big dog you with the tony robbins thing but i'll give you this compliment i think people are gonna like this episode more because the rapport and also just like the style of stuff we talk about is so like you know on point for for what this podcast is can i ask you a different story though about a big name yeah go ahead a couple years ago you texted us that you were going to dinner with sbf and at the time sbf was the next mark zuckerberg sbf was multi-billionaire of the fastest growing private startup uh boy genius from mit who wore like cargo jorts and uh we were like dude tell us more and you were like i can't gotta put away my phone right now like you know you know see you later suckers i'm gonna go have dinner with sbf can you now two years later can you tell us the story what was it like going to dinner with sbf yeah he's not gonna do anything now right he's in jail for a long time i think so maybe one day i'll get out and listen to this episode i don't think i've told this story publicly uh so i'll tell it um but i have a friend investor at a big vc invested in ftx and you know this is probably out of 2021 so sbf was sbf right this is pre him obviously getting caught as being a fraud but he's at the height of his power he was whatever the stat was the top richest you know the richest person under 35 in the world oh the one-liner for anyone who doesn't know who sbf is sam bakeman freed he was like the bernie made off of crypto 31 year old worth 20 billion dollars and it all came crashing down now he's in prison for fraud okay go ahead great thanks to the background um it's gonna make it look really good um so i uh didn't know that much about him though like i didn't do any research uh i'd heard him talk a couple times but i know any of the stories and so my friends like break trips to bahamas i'm like i'm in it's for his birthday so we show up and i've been to nice places right i've stayed at the ritz carlton i've stayed all these nice places and so i thought i knew where the rich and famous live i was wrong this place it's called the albany in the bahamas this is where the rich and famous live like this place was there are 250 foot yachts everywhere i mean this is i think tiger woods owns it uh justin bieber who i actually met the next day lives there will smith lives there like this is where the rich and famous live it was nuts and so i get there i'm like oh shit like yeah we're in for it so we show up we actually stayed at someone else at ftx's house they put you in the guest boat which was a pretty pretty nice guest house no it was not a boat but it was a house and so we show up and we get there here's the first thing i observe right it's like the penthouse 225 million dollar apartment i had no idea what i was walking into i walk in and there are 50 pairs of shoes laying everywhere like crappy nikes i'm like this dude's worth 30 billion and there are all these weird nikes laying around and my friend's like oh yeah i forgot to tell you like the entire exec team lives together in this one apartment and i'm like oh boy what are we what is going on and so obviously now we know in hindsight like you know there are articles who knows if it's true they were having orgies and all all type of of weird shit so we i knew all this like i knew some weird stuff was going on because if you did you get the orgy vibe did you get like did could you smell it yeah no but there was a weird alpha attitude that people had towards sam like he was clearly the alpha in the room even though he's super nerdy super techie but he just had this weird thing where people anyone who said anything looked to sam to make sure they approved like it was clear he was in charge he was the man and so again first thing shoes second thing you look to the left and sam is in the kitchen cooking food which i was like oh probably the chef cook us dinner no sam is there cooking us food he does not turn his back is his face to us he's his back is to us and he starts having a full conversation with us without ever making eye contact he's no eye contact he goes the first thing he ever says to me and my friend is so what do you think about indian crypto exchanges what and i'm like what is going on because he hasn't turned around yet he doesn't realize you're one guy i don't know so so in my friend who knows did you have an answer to that i probably said four words the entire dinner they they were speaking a different a different language you know all all crypto stuff um so i show up in the kitchen and sam's cooking us dinner i put dinner in quotes everyone got one beyond sausage and two russell sprouts that was the meal for everyone so i think the vegan stuff's true because he cooked us all beyond sausage right so that was pretty weird we sit down so again 20 million apartment but there's hardware everywhere cables everywhere it was like post-apocalyptic right it was super super weird being in this 20 million apartment but there's like ps3s and xboxes like everywhere a complete mess of an apartment and so we sit down and i think the craziest thing about the dinner was sam was a genius when it came to the things he had to know for ftx and crypto so for example tom brady was a like sponsored by ftx right sam could have told you every single thing about tom brady could have told you his stat line everything about him but i don't think sam knew what a first down was i don't think he knew a single thing about football but if it benefited crypto he was the smartest person on the planet same thing with politicians he could go every single senator every supreme court justice he could tell you their exact stance on crypto i don't think he could tell you a single other thing about them it was incredible dude sean you and i i don't want to i don't want to say their name because i don't want this to be an insult but you and i hung out with someone who was the best in the whole world at what they do and well fuck it i'll say it was mr beast he was the best at whatever this is not an insult i guess it was mr beast you know he's the best in the world and i remember i think it was either you or me or me and someone else and i we're just shooting the shit about like a tv show that i thought everyone knew about and he had he had no idea and i was like i was just like curious about this so i had some more pop culture stuff didn't know anything about like this normal stuff he's like sorry i just pay attention to youtube like that's all i do he had the exact same thing where he didn't know anything about anything outside of his expertise there's a funny uh interview with conor mcgregor on bbc it's like uh you know usually ufc gets covered by these small niche outlets but one time like he got on the main bbc they were like they were shooting the shit before the interview they were like oh how about the game you know whoever like some soccer game like some famous soccer game he's like he just laughs he's like he's like haha yeah it was great he goes yeah he goes yeah it's great and they go you don't watch soccer do you he goes no i have no idea what you're talking about he goes he goes um i don't know what's happening in the news i don't know what's happening in the world uh he goes i've lost my mind to the game and i only know about my shit i don't give a damn about anything else and i think that's like actually kind of common for people who get like top 0.0111 percent of like what they're trying to trying to become it's like when they asked trump what his favorite like verse in the bible was and he goes you know what i love all of them i love all of them yeah too hard to pick i love them all that's what conor mcgregor was like i love all the sports well you've seen the video of lebron he's on instagram live and people are like oh who are your favorite soccer players and lebron's like because he's like i love soccer no no they asked him about the team he owns they were like who are your favorite psg players or whatever and he's like he owns the team and he's like he names one and he's like you know such as such as i mean you know so and so forth there are so many it's like etc etc such as yeah you only use the the middle words of a sentence you didn't say the subject did you get fraud vibes when you were there or were you also tricked i mean i was totally enamored i i because the perception at the albany like there was a buzz we took a cab to the albany and the guy's like oh you're going to uh you know like the albany that's where that's where ftx is headquartered like oh yeah we're like we're gonna see sam and everyone's like oh my god everyone's like yo we one of the security guards said you know here you know you think the celebrities are famous the famous people they want to meet sam sam doesn't want to meet the people they want to go meet sam like this guy he just had this aura around him everyone wanted to meet him now in hindsight i feel like a complete moron because there were so many red flags every you know the whole effective altruism thing he he parody you guys know about that yeah make as much money as you can to give it away yes i heard about this and everyone's like yeah you know sam lives a really low-key lifestyle i'm like guys he lives in a 25 or 20 million apartment it's a nice apartment i've ever been in and they're all like no he only lives there because the most convenient to the ftx yeah yeah yeah he lives in an orgy compound and he still he lives a low-key life we just drove by the ftx office there were 75 you know neighborhoods in between here and the office like that doesn't add up what is going on yeah because these videos came out that was like sam still drives his 93 corolla and he's just like shrugs like why do i need to get a better car and it's like oh damn this guy's full of shit you know like wow he's got like a full olympic-sized swimming pool on his on his balcony but he's an ea he's not spending his money there was a there was a rumor that he was uh that they're high on some type of like uh you know adderall type of medicine that was like a patch did you see any of that shit laying around no i wish again like hindsight's 2020 i wish i was looking for this stuff because i was just so enamored by this guy and how well he knew crypto but i just wish i started like digging and looking through more stuff i'm sure there was crazy shit everywhere dude you also i don't know if you probably can't say this but you went and hung out with kid rock as well uh which is like a crazy story you've hung out with some cool people you've had some diverse experiences yeah the kid rock thing i think i might spoke about that last time the kid rock thing was awesome he is he's obviously super interesting i he told us he is the only person to play at both president obama and president trump's inaugurations and he knows both of them uh he's the only one that can heal this country he's the only one that could bring us together he he lives in this this car he actually owns his compound which it is a compound he has like a full bar uh and i don't mean like the the physical bar i mean like a whole uh pub at on its compound he also lives and i it was being constructed but he lives in a house that is a replica of the white house i'll show you guys pictures it he modeled it after the white house so you walk up you're like oh my god like it actually looks exactly like the white house looks like it's nuts all right everyone really quick this is sam i'm gonna do a thrill of the chill so basically i've got an ask for everyone out there i just launched this new podcast it's called money wise it's a personal finance podcast for high net worth people you can find it by looking up money wise on spotify and uh itunes or wherever else you get your podcast but here's the deal this podcast is a ton of work and i'm only hosting the first handful of episodes i need someone to be the host of this podcast i have a feeling it's going to be pretty big and it's going to be great for whoever hosts it but i need help hosting it i don't want to do all the work our first episode you can find it on whatever all those platforms it's pretty great i think it's with the guy who sold this company for 200 million dollars and we get to hear like how he breaks down his net worth how much he spends each month all this transparent money stuff that's pretty interesting and so if you want to host it i'm actually not going to give out my contact information you've got to figure out how to contact me because that's what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to find guests so contact me and let me know if you want to be the host of this and send me something that is impressive that shows that you have what it takes all right back to the show awesome did you ever hear the story cody co told on our pod about when he went to elon musk's house for a party no it's so funny it's a very short story but i find it hilarious even though it's not meant to be a funny story he's just telling what happened but the whole idea is so funny to me so he goes he's like yeah i was hanging out with uh so cody's like you know la youtuber cool guy also makes some music so i think they were hanging out with um post malone so he's he's had a thing with post malone he's like oh elon asked us to you know come over for a party he shows him his phone he's like you want to go and he's like uh of course okay let's go so they go to elon musk's house i was like what's it like he's like first thing no furniture in the entire place an empty house and he was like uh does everybody live here like what is this he's like no no elon's house across the street this is like his party he hosts people here he lives over there i was like oh naturally okay this is a stupid question by me dumb all right i won't ask him questions like so we're just sitting there and he's like uh it's like a fire and they're just kind of like eating you know like uh eating marshmallows or whatever the fuck and he's like he's like you know got kind of late people are doing their own thing and he's like you know all right i'm just gonna go i'm just gonna kind of dip out of here this is like you know it's it's late this was weird and he's like so he's trying to leave he doesn't know his way out of the house so he's like trying to get out he turns the corner and it's just elon making out with grimes and so he just turns and he opens this door and he's like he's like he's like dude i thought i was gonna open this door and there's just a rocket and they're like get in there's no time he's like i just wanted to leave so bad you guys read the elon book i didn't read it i i'm kind of over elon sean and i are both over him hardcore but i don't want to read that book because it sounds so stressful yeah i i just finished it i read it uh over the holidays and it definitely gives you a different lens into elon musk you really see the full spectrum of of who he is as a person and i think people try to draw inspiration from elon and i think you can in little bits and pieces but to me my big takeaway from the whole book was like elon is hardcore like that is the one word he uses and like that is who he is he's hardcore he's extreme i don't think you can be like 70 elon and be successful like he just has no regard for any person he works with he's basically fired everyone he works with right he he you know he treats his family like shit he's scarred from issues with his dad and my big takeaway was like elon is this unique one you know one in a billion one in 10 billion people and all these people who are inspired that's great but don't try to copy him because this guy is is to the extreme and i don't think almost anyone can can be as extreme in every facet of life he doesn't sleep he doesn't vacation he has crazy relationships i mean obviously that's all public with with all uh you know he has so many kids but it's all everything's extreme every single thing he does is to the as extreme as you can possibly do it it's incredible you should read the book dude i just don't want my blood pressure to rise reading that like just hearing you talk about this because on one hand i'm like when i hear about him i'm like oh i'm soft i should step it up and then on the other hand i'm like his life sucks i do not want that and so there is that whole you can't be you can't be like him and be said and be 70 have i told you my david goggins point i think that's what applies here which is what you only want to be david goggins for one hour a day and that's the whole trick with david goggins you you can't be you don't want to be out on all of david goggins because he's inspiring and he's so tough and he's so like mentally strong that there's something to learn there you also don't want to subscribe to the david goggins lifestyle or even like try to emulate you know half of what he's doing you would just want for one hour a day when you're working out to just shift into david goggins gear for that one hour and then never never touch it again like i don't know if you saw this post that was uh david goggins is engaged and yes yonce fucking insane it sounds like an onion article i was gonna say there's this video of her i didn't even know he's engaged i don't know how he's in a relationship first of all but i here's here's what i actually saw we put this on the youtube but just like gets youtube may delete our account are they like we just got home from dinner or something first there's a picture of his toes which is just like i don't know if you've ever seen an ex-athlete's toes but they're like all nasty as hell this guy i don't even know what's going on he's literally just ripping off his big toenail because he's like ah don't need this shit anymore like and then he's like no david please don't and like whatever and he's like why are his feet so jacked up because he's running 100 miles at a time and so she posts this thing she's like yeah a lot of people think that david only turns it on for the camera i just want to show you this he just he's two weeks two months out of uh you know two weeks off of surgery for his leg where they like broke his leg and fixed it for whatever reason and um he just came home and was like i want to run 100 miles tonight and so she's following him in the car she's been with him in the car for like eight hours she's following behind that like five miles an hour or whatever and he's just running he's he's on you know three a.m seven yeah hour seven it's like you know 3 a.m and he's almost done with 100 miles i think it said like i think it said like should we got home from dinner and david just looks at me and goes i've got to go run 100 miles now or like i got to run a truck what's like what are they called trucks or something like that i gotta go go to a truck tonight uh i forget what they're called but like a ruck so we're going for a ruck tonight and i don't i'm at this out of shape i don't even know what a ruck is let alone it's just like running with the it's running or walking with a backpack on that has weight in it okay so he's doing 100 mile weighted run and uh you know then you see that you're like well this is fucking stupid this is not the way to lose um right that's like the only the only intelligent response to that is that and so the trick with david goggle is going to be david goggle is for one hour a day the trick with elon musk is you only want to be elon musk like 15 of the time in your company right when you're establishing the vision of like thinking big about what you're doing he's amazing you want to channel your inner elon when you are um you know telling a story about your product the way he demos you know tesla every time and sells hundreds of thousands of cars before they're even ready people pay money just to wait for the car right that's when you want to you want to reserve your thing or like when he came into twitter was like i'm gonna do this really hard thing hardcore i'm gonna do a sprint i'm gonna sleep in the office and like i'm gonna make sure everybody knows if you're in this you're in this in a hardcore way versus like dude awesome i don't know how you run your company but i was always on eggshells with my employees like like hey we got uh you know we got to do this tomorrow but if that's too much tuesday's okay right like yeah is that okay with you i don't i just don't know what the boundaries are versus like mr beast or david goggle or elon these guys have like kind of no sense of boundaries they just they're on their mission and you're either all in or you're out and uh i think that's pretty cool and that's the part to steal yeah i think so i think the the thing to steal in particular is that vision right elon starts with the vision and then builds the business builds the business model that's really impressive i think the way he treats people the way he you know some of the things he says that could that could be in the 85 percent of stuff you leave out right right and actually sbf is kind of the same way the sbf book kind of highlighted a bunch of things uh that happened my friend read the sbf book and he was like i think i'm supposed to hate sbf uh you know because of everything that happened but reading this book made me like him more and it wasn't because of the spin he's like actually i found a few things i really respect about what he did he's like let's take away the fact that he was taking customer funds to do these things but like let's just say he was using the company's money or his own money or whatever right which he was also doing he just overextended and used company uh the customer funds too but they were like the fact that he was like okay if i have a hundred million dollars he didn't like feel any fear towards losing it nor did he feel any attachment to it he's like great let's use the hundred million to pay off steph curry you know uh tom brady and whoever because we're gonna build the brand that way and like go and cut absurd deals in order to pull these things off or like there's that email that leaked of him and the guy in la where the guy he's like i went to this dinner with this guy in la he's the most connected person i've ever seen at this dinner was whoever like you know uh nancy pelosi leonardo dicaprio and like whatever 12 other people he's like we need to give this guy 200 million dollars to invest in his fund and i think he'll open all the doors for us after that wire him the money now please and like just the ability to throw your weight around is actually pretty badass and if you take away the fraud stuff i know other successful people in our life that do this andrew wilkinson does this he throws his weight around when he wants something or he like sets his target on someone a relationship or a business he wants to buy or whatever he really throws his weight around in a way that i definitely don't uh right like sam when he wanted to buy the hustle dude he flew me private up to his house he's like oh you he's like i want to buy this company let's talk and you're like cool we can talk on the phone he's like no let's meet in person you're like i don't like to fly and canada's far away he's like my jet will be there tomorrow let's go and uh you know he throws his weight around in a way that i think i am like often either too cheap or too afraid or or just don't even think about those options um and i'm learning to steal that part of my my game have you guys thought about that or do you guys think about how you're going to use that i'm the same way as you i appreciate it and i'm fearful of it it's a very scary thing and but i when i see it i get inspired yeah i think it's a for me it's a conviction play right i'm more inspired by uh like i read the the warren buffett book for example right and he's more cerebral in the way he does it but it's the same thing it's like he sees an opportunity and he's not dipping his toe in the water he's not a diversification guy it's like oh bank of america is going under i'm gonna buy a ton of preferred debt this is a can't lose bet and by the way i'm sitting on however many billions of dollars on my balance sheet so i'm gonna own whatever 10 of bank of america and so i love when people have conviction and they just say you know what this is it i'm taking all the chips all the social capital everything i've made and i'm doubling down on this dude your chips on the table moment right now is just praying bill ackman doesn't crush your company because morning brew is running away hiding under the table actually speaking of throwing your weight around right that's what he's doing right now he's trying to throw his weight around in a way i think i actually don't morning brew is owned by business insider which is owned by axel springer and bill ackman is at war with bi and axel springer awesome i'd like to hear your response to this yeah what's your official response you just gotta message bill ackman to be like bill same team same team like i'm all right yeah i'll save my response for the private group chats i think that uh the i think you don't want to be excited to to just like plow chips into something because you're you're you're naturally going to just kind of make that make an impulsive wrong decision but i do think there's a good question which is am i throwing my weight around right like am i um you know how hard how much gas versus how much brakes am i applying to the things that i want in my life that's one of my themes i think for this year that i'm gonna i'm gonna focus on ramit saithi has this good thing where he talks about spending and he was like and he'll message me privately he's like what interests you and i'm like well i've got this cleaning lady that comes every two weeks i wish they would come every day almost and he's like i'm gonna challenge you to figure out what makes you happy and i want you to spend 10 times the amount that you're spending now um and so like for him it's like travel and he goes when i travel i will spend 50 000 on a trip and that's a ton of money but i know that's what makes me happy and i'm gonna 10 times spend what i used to spend because that's what i love and that's what he was saying to me about um services like cleaning ladies things like that he goes i challenge you to spend 10 times more and that's like a miniature version of what you're talking about also what about you you made a bunch of money selling morning brew do you use it in any way that was interesting or like improve the quality of your life meaningfully yeah the big thing for me is i love traveling i love staying in nice hotels on vacation and so i when i when i travel that that is my money dial is traveling i think ramit's is two actually you were texting us about this amman hotel what's the deal do i need to know about this what what is it have you heard of it it's just like supposed to be the fanciest hotel ever i've heard about it like two times this year and i don't know if i just started hanging out with different people or it's new is this i'm guessing this has been around for like for like a while we're growing a lot but essentially amman i i think is the standard for customer service and for any business right you know we're talking about the milk road for x i think the a good way to think about a business is what's the amman for x so a lot is just the absolute top customer service i mean i think the cheapest amman there's maybe 60 or 70 of them the cheapest one is maybe 1500 bucks a night i think they're regularly 2500 there's one out west somewhere i think it's amangiri arizona yeah that's what people love it's like six grand a night and people go there and they're like it was worth it what do they do why is how would that be worth it well it's beautiful for one but it's sort of like remember sean the bear that episode like it's like better be touching my body for six grand a night but yeah but you remember like you i like i remember the there's like season two episode six or something is where the guy goes and learns how to like wash the silverware perfectly it's like that and i think that that that type of excellence helped make it popular where people like oh i respect this craftsmanship but have you been austin i've never been so i've never stayed at one i'm that's i'm planning my honeymoon now and that's that's our goal is they had a bunch of uh amans but i've been to a bunch when i travel so i travel i always try to get like a drink or go to them they're also interesting because they're typically not in the heart of a city they typically are on the outskirts a little bit they actually and i think this is really cool i think they just intentionally they make you travel there a little bit right it's not accessible and that's part of the allure is it's like a destination you have to really want to go to an amman to be at the amman now they've grown and they have one in new york city so maybe that's not quite as true but they really want you to to like be in the amman essence when they're there and it's just again it's it's the pinnacle of customer service well give me an example what are they doing that's such good customer service yeah like i went to a motel eight with a slip inside do they have that i mean the highest quality food the best quality bed bedding the mattress every little thing right when we go the toilet paper is folded the right direction every detail is perfect and if if if nice hotels is not your money dial you're gonna be like i just wasted five grand a night but if if luxury and having everything you need cater towards if that's something that you get joy out of you're gonna go and you're gonna love it yeah i get why you like it no slip yeah is there a mini fridge though or not i just need like kit kat and animal crackers at midnight and i'm gravy like life's cream cheese just give me that and we good uh and a little keurig machine um austin thanks for coming on man this is good yeah this is fine all right that's the pod so all right Thank you.
