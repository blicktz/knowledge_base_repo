heavy metal yoga studios you know where it's like i think about all these other places where there could be innovation that tie to our general mission of like health that's like do we like what if liquid death creates like a chain of heavy metal yoga studios you know where it's like people who want to do yoga but they don't want to listen to yanni when they're doing it like is there some room for like some kind of cool like how do you make a totally new you could do like this experience you could do like tough guy multivitamins if you need to right you can take a healthy product multivitamins and be like okay cool kind of interesting actually you know rainbows and care bears like maybe we could just make this form factor a little different brand a little different right to speak to a different audience who's you know so you you guys have raised let's say 10 i forget the number 10 or 12 million dollars you're not huge yet you're definitely still getting going how do you decide so like at my company we have a brand that people know and people just if we make stuff people will buy it but in my head i'm always like i don't want to make other stuff let's just like focus on what we're doing and kick ass at that and then maybe eventually expand whereas you've done these little experiments like the vinyl record and maybe you're also trying to uh maybe you weren't joking with your heavy metal yoga thing in my head i'm like no no no that focus what uh do you have like a like logistically how do you decide where to throw a budget at and throw money at in order to so so let me ask you that so this this is what i mean all these other products that we could potentially make that actually sell or actually succeed they double as marketing for the water you know yeah it's just marketing that it's profitable it's profitable exactly it's like we made a vinyl record i can't tell you how many eyeballs that got liquid death on from people reposting the album sharing the album talking about it and that album for us to execute including printing the vinyl cost us 12 000 and we've already made all of our money back right how much staff did you have work on that what's that how much staff who worked on it like you hired did you we hired a guy that we knew that was a friend of a friend who's an incredible metal musician who wrote the whole album his name's gus rios he wrote and recorded the whole album his buddy mixed the whole album and his buddy mixed stuff for justin bieber and all these other guys so we got the whole album recorded we made a commercial for it maybe two grand on stock footage and my wife edited the video so it was like you know that's all that's all we launched with it was a little launch video made with stock footage and we pressed records and sold the records in our merch store um and it's like all that stuff adds together that's why it's like what would it cost to to start let's call it a chain of five little small heavy metal yoga studios in la like small little studios not a lot going on you find some you know some instructors like maybe you could actually build that out for call it 500 grand let's just say like you can make you could build a five chain yoga studio heavy metal yoga studio chain for 500 grand what does 500 grand buy you if you try to run one tv spot right during the oscars like maybe you get a 30 second spot and what's going to see more lift and brand evangelism for your brand running one 500 000 commercial during the oscars or building a chain of five heavy metal yoga studios in la that gets talked about by every publication heavy metal yoga studio launches in la people actually go to it everyone who goes takes photos and shares and talks it's like that's a way smarter way to spend your money and you might actually make some of it back if it's a good enough business model you know this is like uh elon selling flamethrowers right yeah he is the you know sort of iron man trying to be a badass rockets and you know drilling into underground and electric sports cars so he comes out with a flamethrower for 700 i think it was and he sold i don't i think he sold like millions a shit ton a shit ton i think it was 10 millions of dollars and the whole thing is basically just being like you know feeding the evangelism like you said of the cult of elon of yeah life should be a little more badass we need a little more fire a little more speed and a little more like you know uh rocketry to to in our in our lives and so it's the brand
