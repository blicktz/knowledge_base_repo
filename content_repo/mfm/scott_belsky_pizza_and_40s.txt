I want to make this interesting so you know let's interject with questions whatever you know my passion for the last like 10 to 12 years has been helping organize creative people in teams I feel like it all kind of came out of a sense of frustration because I felt like there were so many interesting people with ideas that just never got shit done and it was like wow like these are these are interesting creative people and they're always kind of complaining that there's no progress being made and whatever and there were things like TED and other magazines and conferences and stuff all about ideas but there was so little focus on the execution side and so the origin of Behance was this mission to organize the creative world and so I would tell people I want to create a company to help organize creative people and they'd be like yeah like good luck with that because creative people oftentimes wear disorganization in some ways like a badge of honor it's like oh I'm you know I'm disorganized it's sort of like the absent-minded for professor you know or type of type of drama but in fact the most productive creative people and teams in the world are very organized I think organization is a competitive advantage in the creative world and so so we built the business that we liked to call mission centric and medium agnostic mission centric meaning it's about organizing creative people and and then mission medium agnostic meaning we would have a conference or paper product line or a network like Behance to help to help achieve this and so that was the origin of the business we were bootstrapped for five years in New York barely making payroll some of those times and we were talking a little bit about some of the you know the messy middle as I like to call it the last years of Behance and things I learned and things I wouldn't do again and things I would we became a we were a venture-backed business for two years after five years of bootstrapping we were acquired by Adobe in 2012 I joined the company and took over the VP of product role overseeing the creative cloud services and the mobile products and rebooting that whole franchise and and learned a lot about being in a big company and fighting fiefdoms and and leading change within a larger environment and actually I found it strangely interesting and exciting I didn't expect that either so I was always torn like should I be an entrepreneur or should I be like a you kind of a big company person and I was and I I kind of liked both a little bit and so yeah is is is it public how did Behance end is it is that are you able to reveal any of those numbers to get people perspective sure I mean you know the the I'm putting you on the spot the room the rumored acquisition price has never been confirmed was 150 million dollars and and you know after a small financing so we had a great team that did really really well and what was actually interesting was that three years into being at Adobe we were all basically still working together we had very few people leave it all and even now four years later over four years later I would almost say the majority of our team is still there because people just love working together it's a great culture it's a great mission it's a great purpose and you know everyone talks about the term unicorn I feel like the true unicorn is an acquisition that works most everyone always talks about acquisitions being the end of a culture the end of a product the end of a company and we just had an incredible integration the team was empowered to do important things and it's been like a very good outcome I think for the whole team monetarily but also just like work wise and stuff like that and some people have moved on so how many people here work at a company that has less than 20 people so it looks about half so I think that one one of the reasons a lot of people like to come to these things is they love to hear about the early in the beginning yeah and and all that okay you bet I mean you've been at you've been doing this for a long time can you talk about the first where you were before you had the idea what made you think that this idea was worth pursuing and what the first six months were like yep the so I had a background in business and design and then I went to work at all places at Goldman Sachs this is like 2001 2002 and I was doing a finance job and then a year and a half and I was like this is not what I want to do with my life and I was gonna leave and I went to my manager and said to her like I'm out of here you know basically and she said um if there's any job that you would have at the firm that you would find interesting what would it be and so I said well it'd be really cool to understand how the firm works like how is it run how is it how our leaders chosen how a succession planning managed I was always interested in kind of the leadership side of things and so I got this job in the executive office working on this new team that had just been put together that was started by the guy who helped Jack Welch the former CEO of GE build this thing called Crotonville and Crotonville is like GE's leadership development center and that's how they develop leaders and stuff like that and so I was the junior guy on this team and and I had all kinds of weird jobs so I had really fun jobs like helping people write you know talks and you know in Hank Paulson at the time the CEO would like give a talk I could help I was helping him write it and I also had weird jobs like helping film and and write the script for the partner video and they would like be chasing each other around and doing you know jokes and stuff so I had really weird I was I think it was like the youngest guy in the executive office so I was asked to do all these like random things I learned so much in that three years I learned that I did not want to be at Goldman Sachs forever I also learned that I really enjoyed organizational improvement and helping develop leaders and and I also realized I wanted to apply a lot of the things I was learning there to the creative world and so that's when I started the idea of Behance when I was at Goldman and I left to begin that you know begin that journey and what was the original idea what did you say this there's something here yeah so the original idea was we're going to try to organize the creative world I felt like we would build a that's a huge I know that's a huge mission and you know for the first five years it was basically paring it down it started like kind of broad and then we were like what's working and what's not and let's try it in different ways and where we ended up was building this network so Behance for those of you that don't know it's sort of like a LinkedIn for the creative world it allows people to showcase their portfolios allows them to connect with each other it allows companies to hire talent and sort and search and whatever else and you know they're probably around 10 million or so creatives on the platform now and and that was it really you know what really really motivated me around that was there was no transparency and attribution in the creative world you never know who did anything whereas when you watch a movie and you see like the credits you know like who the who the second grip and the third grip and all these people were when you look around you see like billboards and designs for anything all the stuff that compels us to take action on things and to relate to news and things as they happen it's all it's all created by creative people and these people never get credit and actually agencies take credit design firms take credit but you never know who actually did the work and so the idea was with Behance let's expose this information and with attribution give people opportunity and when you first came up with this idea and you decided to quit your job did you actually think that this was gonna end to be a huge business like it was or no I didn't and it's funny like I had so I had I started the company and I hired a designer to work with me a guy named Matias from Barcelona and he like kind of evolved into a co-founder role a couple years into the business and five years in when we first raised our capital I remember we were talking to each other because we were asked earlier that day when we were doing an investor presentation what our exit plan was and we realized that for five years we had never once talked about our exit like we never talked about it so how are you paying the bills between we were I mean we were we were break even we were trying to be break even and you know through random things like conferences and paper products and speaking and books and weird stuff like that and so you guys were just kind of you had this big mission but you're just doing all these little projects to make ends meet in order to achieve this big thing yeah and we kind of thought maybe this could be a lifestyle business you know as long as we're having fun we love our team we feel like we're doing good work but it was never you know it was never like what what's our outcome gonna be and when we would hire it when we would interview people and they would be asking about you know what's what's your plan like are you gonna be a public company you're gonna be acquired they would never like be a fit for our team so we just built a team that didn't it's not that they didn't care about their financial outcome but they just felt like we were building we felt like we were building something important we felt like if we did a good job this would be valuable for all of us and we just never had a structured conversation around the exit we just were like so engaged in like the process between starting these projects that would actually pay the bills and your first couple hires how are you able to manage that had you saved up a bunch of cash from working at Goldman I put some of my money in from Goldman I think I got like hundred and fifty thousand dollars over the course of that few years from family that it were like that was sort of like my angel money if you will but I really call it bootstrapped because that didn't really last this long and we did things like conferences or you know gatherings like this we would basically do anything we could to try to just meet that break-even mark every month and where everything changed was when about five years in I started to feel like we had an amazing team of designers engineers and others who were coming to me saying I feel like I need to hire her or I need to hire him in order to like build the best team do the greatest work of my life and Scott like you're not letting me do that and and I and I felt like at that point I was strangling the potential of the team and to me that was a very like taught I had a toxic reaction to that where I was like oh my god like we got it we got a raise finding funding we have to like capitalize on the opportunity we have here we can't strangle the potential of the of the team so from years zero to five your your mission was to help creatives basically but you did it in various different ways it sounds like a lot's going on how did you actually spend each day I mean it seems like a controlled chaos at best yeah so it wasn't controlled chaos but it was different periods of focus at different times and I don't know if I would recommend this to others I think that when I look back upon it it was when we killed certain things that everything started to become more focused and productive and started to grow more and they were all hard to kill and we talked about this a little earlier but you know what I was saying is that it's easy to kill things that are not working it's really hard to kill things that are and writers and novelists you know call this killing your darlings they're usually like the characters and the plot points that as a writer you fall in love with and become sacred to you but you have to kill in order to have a more focused and and tight novel or output and as entrepreneurs we have to do the same thing you know you have to kill some of the things it's almost like bonsai cultivation you know you have to kill those nice new branches in order to make like the right the bonsai kind of grow into you know what you want it to be but it's hard because you're like killing off all like the nice newest little branches and stuff and it's the same way in a business your things are working and you're just paring it back it's very it's sort of easy to intellectualize this but it's really hard in the process because first of all it's revenue you're like wait we're not gonna do another event but we made $20,000 doing that how could we not do that it's like money except for the fact that by doing that event you're taking your eye off the ball of the thing that matters the most and so what I think I failed at doing early enough was paring back more more easy more quickly and I think it kind of it snowballed until I like had to do it and I have to tell you it were the hardest decisions ever to cut some of these products or outsource some of them we had a task management tool that was like sort of like a base camp competitor and we had loyal subscribers and people loved it we had to kill it it was the hardest thing to do but a week later it was like breaking up with that person that you've been trying to break up with for years and you're like ah like liberated you know and the team just became more productive and focused and the brand became tighter and it was one of the most and I just remember thinking like wow I don't know if I should be proud of myself that I made the decision or like ashamed that it took so long so how many people here are running their own company at the moment a while a lot and how many are let's say product managers where they have to decide what's going on with the product so a lot of people so one thing that we face and I imagine everyone faces this is they have an idea for something and they build the first iteration and sometimes things work really well sometimes things fail right away sometimes that kind of works and that's like a really hard challenge is deciding what stays and what goes you kind of talked about that a little bit but can you get even more specific on let's say this task manager about some of the numbers that you were seeing and what you did with your current team to after cutting it and things like that because I think everyone struggles with this well there are two approaches right there's the lean approach of like launch something super simple try to get one thing right and then kind of carefully add to it over time the other approach is to launch like a bunch of different things or features or whatever and then see what sticks and then kill as quickly as possible the stuff that isn't working to make the stuff that is working get more tension I actually don't think there's a right answer to which which approach to take because as long as you're willing to kill the stuff I think that both merit you know some sort of credence and from a strategy perspective when when you have something out there you know it's it's really about learning to listen to it you know learning to developing the gut instinct around you know how to mold it really I think one of the mistakes that we make as entrepreneurs is we build something out of passion instead of empathy when you're really passionate about a problem you like go and you just solve it and you have such a vision for what you should create the problem is is that if you're not doing out of empathy with the customers problem sometimes you just create something that's like five degrees off or 50 degrees off or 180 degrees off but when you really like really anchor yourself repetitively with like the problem and the people that you're solving it for you're just like there's a gravity to that so it's hard because we're passionate people and we become very very convinced that we know what this needs to be I always force myself and my teams to just spend tons of time with the people that we are trying to solve the problem for now this doesn't mean focus groups it doesn't mean asking them what they think we should create for them what it means is just getting ourselves into their daily life like what are they doing what is friction observing it as if you were you know in in in the wilderness you know observing people and your things in their habitat and and that's where you get the empathy so it's I think it's it's it's really a process driven by empathy as you like pair back and optimize the product offering can you talk can you can you help turn that into action so you said observe observe people don't necessarily listen to what they say they want but kind of observe them and decide what's best that you think you need to build what does that actually mean in terms of how you spent your time does that mean calling them does that mean hosting me up so I mean yeah it actually is sitting next to people as they work was one of the big things I think actually one of the greatest things for Behance was when I went into that project of writing the book making ideas happen in 2010 it was a book about the most productive creative people and teams in the world and so I went and met with a lot of creative directors and designers and illustrators and writers and entrepreneurs and and the calling card to get in there was I'm writing you know I want to do some research understand how you manage your team and whatever else and it actually was a way of forcing me to develop that empathy that I'm talking about that informed the product that we were building for the creative world and so I don't know if I would have had the discipline to do this if I hadn't had a deadline for the book I would like to say that I would have done it but you know only through that process that I realized how important it was and you know now I'm working actually with a new team focus on something in the professional independent professional services provider space and they're just doing tons of you know sitting down with personal trainers you know between sessions and asking them so like what's your day look like today like how do you know did you write it down on paper did you schedule it in your in your phone was it annoying to arrange those things did you have any last-minute changes you have any cancellations are you pissed about that like all these empathy driven questions are helping guide that development of product so in about five or ten minutes or so we'll answer some questions because I think that's one of the best ways to learn but aside from being a extremely successful entrepreneur you've I believe you've invested in Uber and Pinterest both when they were valued at around three million dollars uber is now worth 70 billion so I don't know what's that like a 20,000 X I think that's maybe 20,000 X I think is what it is as far as I'm concerned any company that's still losing money is worth a zero that's fair and then Pinterest now is I don't actually know if they're profitable or not but they're in the five or six or seven billion dollar range those are some pretty good pickups early on what what how did those come about I don't I would love to say that I'm just like great investor but the truth is is that 2010 the answer still a bootstrap business we were we built a site that was a design site that was a grid system Ben Silverman from Pinterest was also building a site around collections and this is a time when delicious was recently I guess acquired by Yahoo was like all the rage around collections and so people in Silicon Valley told him we don't need another collections website and so he you know what does someone do when they can't raise money in Silicon Valley they go to New York and then you would people like me I don't know how did you know I had gotten introduced to him through a friend and he was interested in in you know in product feedback and in talking about the role that designers could play as users of Pinterest what I did is I looked at our Google Analytics at the time and realized wow like even though Pinterest is a small traffic driver overall the growth of traffic from Pinterest is is outperforming other sources and that really interested me and started to work with him a little bit on some of the product questions and then when he said would you like to participate in my seed round I was like sure you know a little bit I was not really making much money at the time so it was a small investment and but it was also for me it was like a way to learn more about another business and I imagine as a bootstrapped founder I mean you probably didn't have a ton of cash so what I mean that was this a big deal for you yeah it was and I remember I I kid you not I hate to admit it but like six months later I was like should I have done that because it just was like okay now I have less money in my bank account and this other site who knows what's gonna happen there but you know I think that I developed the principle of you know I I want to support my friends just like they're supporting me and my business and and I started to have this my the the ethos I developed was when I have a real resonance with a founder and the problem they're trying to solve and the product that they're building and I feel like I can add a lot of value on the product side like why not have some skin in the game and so and that was also the story behind you know working with Garrett camp you know the story with Garrett was that and that's the founder of uber he's a co-founder of uber is that he had recently purchased his company stumble upon back from eBay so he had sold it to eBay and then purchased it back from eBay so he was now CEO again of this company and stumble upon and behance behance we were doing some some partnerships together and so he was I think it was also 2010 this is like my third investment so I just I should have stopped there so it went a relatively small check in Pinterest and then what was next I think it was this company called paddle eight and then it was and then it was then it was uber and that was all in a span of how many months yeah like a really short period of time he was in my office which was also my bedroom and and you know we were like talking about symbol upon and behance and then I kid you not like after the meeting he pulls out one of our notebooks like one of the doc read journals that we would make at behance when we were bootstrapping our business that I had sent him because he was one of our partners he's like I'm actually working on the side project you know that we're gonna start testing in New York at some point and it's like a livery service and I looked at him being like like you just bought back your company and you're trying to make it work I'm like trying to make things work like isn't this like textbook 101 like only focus on one company at a time and you want to build like a car service and he and he was saying to me like you want to like you know help me out a little bit I'm like whatever man you know and he asked you yeah no he was like telling me like you you know do you have ideas because we always kind of batted around ideas and and then you know he just sort of started sending me like versions of the logo and like the early prototypes and whatever else and then that's how I got involved with with his company so it was and by the way like you know everyone looks at a company like uber and says oh that was logically you know a great company but the truth is is that it didn't really have formal leadership back then Travis was an advisor Ryan had jumped in and was helping run things Garrett again had another full-time day job and so and investors and a board and stuff like that so it's none of these that's one of the things as an investor that's really crazy to me is that investors are always talking about pattern recognition and stuff like that and they forget that they're in a business of exceptions like that's what great investing is it's like figuring out when to make exceptions not to we're not when to follow the patterns and so it's really about kind of some some amount of pattern recognition but then like knowing when to make an exception it's actually very similar I think to building great products you know great great products are I would say like 95% familiar and then 5% retraining of a behavior or introducing a new behavior that the product user never had you know example with Behance sorry I'm hopping around here but my brain works but Behance you know we we started this network and we called the creative fields that you could join like industrial design or illustration or motion graphics we called them creative realms and we called the groups that you could join circles before Google had it and we had all these like creative names for things first of all my Spanish co-founder couldn't even pronounce the word realms which should have told me something right and and and then users you know over over the years were just like I don't know like what you mean by realms and so eventually you're like fuck it we're gonna call it creative fields like just make it simple and then of course everyone started using it and when we called circles when we turned it into groups everyone started using them so you know it just made me realize that again like great products are you know you look for a lot that's familiar and then you like try to make some exceptions that are really like like an exception for example was when Periscope was launching and we had a debate about yeah you were the first I was one of the first investors in Periscope and I met the team and I loved them and we were working together and the question was this was around the selfie phenomenon when like every app was a selfie and so the the the common you know pattern here was well when you open Periscope it should be you first it should be a selfie it should be the the you know the the front facing the rear facing camera but the ethos of the company was experiencing the world through someone else's eyes and so the team made the decision to have the default to be facing out which was like a a bit of the retraining back then versus the other apps that were hitting the market like Meerkat I believe was face forward by default and so it's little things like that you have to know the little things you want to change but then try to be familiar and try to follow the patterns on everything else we're in San Francisco we're in Silicon Valley a lot of people are trying to raise money for something great can you talk about so so you kind of described a little bit about investing in better start drinking here this is yeah you talked a little bit about investing in uber and Pinterest but what was there like a defining moment I mean like what made you actually believe that what they were gonna do or was there anything that you saw in them as a entrepreneur or did you see it in their product what what can someone take away from that on how basically what I mean a lot of people are looking for investors as for validation but also it's actually legitimate that they've got something great what can they take home and be like all right I'm on to something and and what did you see in these guys that made you believe that well I think for me it's I mean the trite answers are like oh it's the people or it's the product or whatever I mean to me it's really first of all and I think this goes for if you're investing in something or if you're hiring somebody or if you're working for somebody every conversation you have with that person should be a step function more and more exciting to your interesting to you the next time you have a conversation there are a lot of people we meet where the next conversation we have with them feels like the first conversation and it's like okay we're now we're running out of things to talk about and you know it I don't know like it's it's sort of we're covering we've kind of covered all the terrain already but every now and then you meet somebody where every time you talk to them it's a step function more interesting than the time before it I think that's something you need to look for first of all on the people side on the product side you want to look for discipline I think you want to look for some sort of ethos or something that makes you think and surprises you I mean I remember with Ben Silverman I again I'd never done an investment before so I like remember asking him once like so like you know what's what's your plan for the next six months and I was expecting him to be like well here are our next three sprints and the milestone in a month is going to be launching this feature and then that feature and then that feature and that was what I was expecting to hear and he said to me you know Scott over the next six months I want to have a better process I was like what like that that's your goal you know for the and he really was he was trying to build like a company that would last a lifetime and he had this I mean and it was one of those humbling moments for me where I was like oh like I'm I'm sort of thinking in sprints and stuff you know this guy is really teaching me something and so that's I think another thing you want to feel and you know from both the person as well as the way the product is being managed was there any so ubers CEO Travis is notoriously aggressive and very sometimes controversial is there a similar story because that they seem quite different than maybe a little bit than Pinterest was there a similar story with that it's interesting you know it's it's a question around every company you know needs a playbook in order to exist and to succeed and then every company needs to consistently revisit their playbook and decide whether it's the right playbook for the next chapter of the company or not if you think about the ride-sharing industry in general you know to make this possible in the very early days I mean I remember there were days where I heard Travis was like camping out in some local congressman's office to make sure that it could exist in that in that area and you had to be I remember also thinking in the beginning like I could never do this this business like you know worrying about someone breaking my knees or some like mafia run taxi conglomerate in like rural Chicago like putting a hit on me like that I'd be like well peace out like this and I don't I don't care so much like I just want to be alive you know you had to have some degree of perspiration perseverance and somewhat like aggression to be able to exist you know you were fighting tremendous forces and so in some ways that was the perfect right playbook to start that industry and fight the incumbents that just wanted it to be the old way was there a specific story where you're like oh god this guy is unstoppable well I think that just I don't think there's a specific story but I just remember admiring and realizing like wow there's really a unique playbook for every type of business and this business requires this in the beginning and I also know you know I know the other number of folks on the management team there and they really have tried to adopt a different playbook and iterate over time and I think that you know I think that you know it's hard you know it because as as a company's culture changes the reputation lags you know so I think that I think people will start to see and you know I'm not just saying it's like I really do believe you know I think their next year is like the year of the driver like they're really trying to focus on empowering the people that are using the platform and and and standing for other you know more of an ethos because there's they're in a different chapter now and people need to need to I think that but it also teaches us another lesson which is like you know reputation matters and you know you want to you want to make sure you get the benefit of the doubt because sometimes a rumor starts and everyone just assumes you did it you know because of who you were years ago when in fact that may not be the case so it's it's it's it's you always want to be thinking about you know the type of company you are and you always want to be changing it I think you always want to realize the hardest thing for an entrepreneur is to throw out a playbook that works so well for you for so many years and recognize it's time for a new one so we'll give you a second to take a drink and does anyone does anyone have some questions that they want to start asking yeah oh I think we have a microphone that's gonna be going around too we got two of them okay thank you this is great I wanted to know about the transition from from Golden Stacks until leadership role in the hands which sort of challenges did you face and what did you learn the most about yourself well listen I didn't know anything of what I was doing and and I really was like so naive and and I probably should have brought on I don't know like I I guess there were a lot of like fits and starts in the beginning to be honest with you because you know Matias the designer who I'd hired to kind of work with me I just assumed that he you know as a graphic designer I thought that that's what you needed to design a digital product I didn't realize the difference at the time believe it or not between that and like real user experience design background I mean this is also 2005 where user experience design was not like taught in school this was something that was just a new field at the time and so he whipped out Adobe Illustrator and started designing our websites and stuff like that and it was this process of working together the best thing that he did bless you blessing that he did though was he hired people quickly that were better than he was and I mean he was able to build a team you know that that that could teach us what to do the the the transition you know it was a it was a lonely time and and I think you know now reflecting back on it I really you know in a quick side note here you know I really think that the shame that all of us you're gonna have to deal with is the fact that the press and the media and everything only celebrate the starts and the finishes of things and the messy middle which is all that matters never gets coverage because it is not sexy so people love the starts when someone quits their job or start something whatever that's kind of interesting and it generates some talk and people love finishes whether it's an acquisition an IPO or a bankruptcy they're willing to give you a headline and and when you ask somebody like tell me about your career it's always like a pithy one paragraph like well I started this company I bootstrap it for five years venture backed and then we got acquired it's like great that tells me nothing so like what about the middle the middle is all it's two things it's endurance and it's optimization it is enduring endless periods of anonymity and ambiguity it's dedicating a portion of your brain to constantly processing uncertainty and never truly being present with anyone in your life because you have this on your shoulders other people's careers on your shoulders you have your own self-doubt you're reconciling it is this constant constant toll it's also a lot of fun right to have that independence but there's just that a lot of endurance and then it's also optimization it is optimizing whatever seems to be working like crazy and I think that one of the weird things people always say is like don't fix it if it ain't broken when in fact the truth is that you should fix things that work like anything that's working make it better because that's your only chance of distinguishing what you're building and standing out amongst the mix of everything else that is mediocre so the messy middle you know was really what I remember you know in the first initial years of Behance now I go every year to like some of these big startup you know conventions or the web summit in in Europe and now and and and you walk to these startup pavilions and it's like literally thousands of entrepreneurs with a two-foot by two-foot space kind of pitching their thing and you know and you walk by them and I just like there's something in my gut that makes me feel so bad because I'm like walking by dozens of people who are all like trying to survive and like deal with that endurance and you almost want to like stop and let each person tell you their thing just because it's like I remember that so that's what I remember you know that in that transition was just a lot of like loneliness in that sense but also there was this you know I was always trying to channel the romanticism of it too were there any books or resources that you turn to to develop your leadership skills I think I think that being in the job that I was in at Goldman this is where that helped because it was three years of focusing on leadership development and organizational improvement and stuff like that so it kind of prepared me in some strange way to to build a team and and to lead I think that another quick thing that I learned very quickly that is somewhat counterintuitive is that the long-term vision that is motivating you to start something is not enough to motivate others on a daily basis nor is it enough to motivate yourself on a daily basis so what you have to do is you have to learn to short circuit your reward system think about it you know when we are born we are motivated by our parents gratification and love and whatever else and then we have a you know we go to kindergarten and first grade and second grade you start getting tests and you get a check on the test and then you get a grade in the course and then you graduate and then you get a salary and a bonus I remember Fred Wilson you know from Union Square Ventures who was our backer once said that the two greatest addictions in life are heroin and a weekly salary and so to unplug from those things these short-term rewards that we are all addicted to is extraordinarily hard and to say that this long-term vision of someday building this company that changes the world or makes an impact or makes you this grand outcome is not enough to keep you motivated on a daily basis because after a few weeks you'll fall behind on those television shows you will realize that you know your friends are escalating their careers and you're just in that period of anonymity like trying to endure and so we you need to do is you short circuit yourself and what does that mean it means making up milestones making up metrics you know one of our things was we called ourselves Behance which was a made-up word and so every time you typed into Google Behance it always said do you mean enhance do you mean enhance do you mean enhance and the team was like wow like Google thinks for a freaking mistake maybe that's our goal like let's build enough blog posts let's get enough portfolios online and let's get enough SEO where someday Google doesn't think we're a mistake anymore and that was a near-term thing it had nothing to do with revenues or users or anything else and eventually it was motivating enough and we were looking at Google search rankings for us and whatever else it was like a really motivating factor for the team until one day we typed in Behance and it was like Behance like it showed up and I kid you not like a year later Beyonce became super popular and it was like back to square one that asshole you guys want to ask another quick over here Jackie in the back what time we have till 730 right Jackie yeah you have like 30 minutes where have you failed as an investor and why do you think you failed oh that's easy I mean there are there are there are a bunch of companies that I invested in because you know after like after my start I was like well I'm really good at this I should be doing a lot of these and yeah I mean that's that's a great first too right so and not you know that's where things went wrong it was always it was always it was always like bad judgments on people listen there are a lot of investments that I made that I still think I would have made because I liked the people I thought they were right and you know all the things that I mentioned spoke to me and it just didn't work out competitively they were building something that ended up being a feature of another product the market changed whatever but there are some investments that I really regret because the founders were extraordinarily egocentric and you know and and there were signs like I remember you know one of these investments in particular San Francisco based company and when I was talking to the founder every time I would talk to him he would name drop people like oh you know hey Scott like this morning I was talking to you know Richard Branson who really wants to invest and you know but great to talk to you you also know so and so right like yeah I was talking to him yesterday and you know I was like whatever I may have made a comment like yeah that's that's great but you know it's not about the names you want to find people that are like gonna actually help you and spend time with you I try to give him like a clue you know but it just kind of continued and then his team started to feel like they weren't being listened to and he was always out there trying to take credit for any videos that worked and would never like put the team on a pedestal any chance he get he would put him on himself on it he was always at conferences you know always trying to get his name out it just was there was there was something about him that just followed him and I truly believe that the product and how blind he was to some of the empathy things like it was all a root of some of the things that I saw so we're the to the point where I like kicked myself when it was all struggling I was like I saw this like what was I thinking and so I think that those are the ones that I regret where there was something that I just felt didn't jive but excused it it goes back to that point I made about you know that you're in a business of exceptions and and sometimes you meet in a founder or something rubs you the wrong way about the founder or the product you're like well maybe this is the exception you know I'm feeling like this is not right but maybe this is you know the next Steve Jobs who people are gonna find is really you know an asshole sometimes but is an amazing leader I think that when it comes to values of the things you respect or disrespect in people like maybe that's one line you shouldn't cross and shouldn't accept any any big any big companies that you had a chance on that you didn't you didn't execute on no it's good does someone standing up I have a question I'm gonna get you guys involved to feel bad you're standing up every we got someone over here not yet actually I'm sure there will be yeah I'm curious if you wouldn't mind speaking to you you talked a little bit before about when you meet in a you meet somebody who you might be investing in how you get a bad vibe from them but you excuse it because you think that they may be somebody worth investing in what would you say in that scenario if maybe it's a co-founder right if it's somebody that you've suddenly realized after you know really sort of combining with you know your forces how do you how do you overcome that and it's a great question because co-founder relationships are struck so quickly people decide to date for years and then live together typically before they get married yet you know you'll come up with an idea and you'll be like well I'm in this you know pure complete anonymity no knows who I am like no one cares I need someone to partner with me on this and you'll you'll strike a co-founder relationship so quickly and then you know and and then it oftentimes either you have to grow together or you grow apart I really like the idea of co-founders in the beginning agreeing with what happens if it doesn't work out for one of them oftentimes you know one one of the two or three whatever will decide that they're not adding as much value or you'll decide with them that they're not adding as much value and can you have a way of having that conversation regularly and also what would happen if that were to be the case I know co-founders who say listen if it doesn't work I get we're gonna vest our own equity so if it doesn't work within a year I'll have a big part that's not that's that's vested and non vested or what they'll agree is that there's like a buyout condition anchored at some sort of fair market value or a very low price to suggest because I've seen I've seen great companies that end up failing because someone who is an early founder or you know involved with the team leaves and holds a big part of the cap table but does no adds no value it and their attitude is well it's mine rightfully and so why should I give it up but they're realizing what they're forgetting is that it pulls the incentive away from the team you know it just like sucks the energy out and when investors look at that cap table it tells a story so it's it would just be great like I always encourage teams to just you recognize that a company is a living being and there's no cheating it you just don't get away with owning a piece of a company and not doing the work it just you end up losing in the wrong long run because you just incentivize other people from coming on who you end up needing it you just incentivize investors from participating who you need so it's like one of those things you need to talk about it's like a prenup you know in the beginning like what happens if it doesn't work like let's just figure it out and figure it out so our kids don't get screwed and and so that's that's part of the part of the answer but I've seen that happen so many times great companies are able to maneuver this because the truth is it happens and sometimes there's not a co-founder sometimes I'm just like the earth the first head of product or the first this or the first thought when you hire people in the beginning you can't be choosy because no one knows who you are and so you basically hire you know in many cases whoever will be willing to work for you and so by nature of the fact that you don't have a great selection you're gonna hire people that aren't right so just build a culture that's all about performance I think it's a mistake also to think of an early stage team as a family because a family puts up with the drunk uncle that shows up on Thanksgiving because he's your uncle and you love him anyways a family an early stage company and read Hastings from Netflix calls it a sports team you know if some guy stops passing the ball or someone just stopped then you'd cut them and I think that's the way we should approach it it's like we're a high performance sports team and we're all together in this and we have camaraderie and whatever but we're gonna cut someone who's not pulling their share otherwise we're gonna lose our matches let's go right back here that's okay your hand shot up very fast so you got our attention thanks so I want to know how do you think about pivots in your own business and the companies you invest in that's a good question so I'm a big supporter of teams making bold inflections in their plan whether that means a completely different approach to their product or a completely different product because the ability to make bold moves is your competitive advantage against your incumbents if you have an operating business with investors and users and and and and payroll and all this other stuff you just can't make big moves you're you're paralyzed in that sense and if you're a big public company you definitely can't make big moves without huge in order in order amount of risk but if you're this small company and you realize something's not working you should totally act on that and a lot of you know what I do I think with with teams that are sort of feeling like their product isn't really getting traction is I try to convince them to answer the question honestly if you know if you knew everything you know now in the beginning would you do something differently and oftentimes their answer is yes and they're like well then why aren't you oh because you know we've already built this and we just launched or you know like it doesn't matter you know it really doesn't matter so I think that I'm a big supporter of pivots and of all you know of all shapes and sizes and I think you have to constantly ask your question is this working and with what we know now like would we make the same investment again and until you're in the position where you can't make those bold moves you should keep making them that's okay right here hey Scott so I have a lot of friends that asked me this question and I never really have a good answer for them but there's a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs and obviously there's a whole lot of risk that you have to take to leave your job leave that safety that you're talking about and the question is always how do I know my idea is sort of good enough how do I know it's gonna work is there sort of a process that you went through originally would be hands for any of these companies that gave you that Eureka moment that said I have to go in full in because I've also seen people that were like half in and then failed not because their idea stuck but because they were just halfway in I mean honestly the honest answer to you is is that you know I always tried to hedge myself with a story I was always because I would love to tell you yes you know I took the leap and I knew that this was worth my next few years and I was determined to make it work but the true answer is that I always was telling myself that the story I will tell if this doesn't work and I was trying to always be comfortable with that in order to allow me to take the risk I needed to take because you know we all care about our reputations and whatever else I was also always measuring the opportunity cost so there was a big part of my calculus that was saying Scott you're single you have no dependents the opportunity cost is lower now than will ever be again and I remember actually and it's crazy to think about it I remember how scared I was to leave Goldman Sachs you know even though I knew I didn't want to be there and I knew this was not gonna be my long-term career there was still the safety and the you know the like when I meet people in New York going out and it's like what do you do and it's like well like I'm starting you know I'm trying to start something new oh what like something for the creative world really go great you know and so there was like part of me that was actually scared and of course I look back on now like that was that was crazy like I couldn't believe I was hesitant to leave but I think that that's so part of this part of it is like making yourself feel safe and and so the story I told myself was I was gonna start this and if it didn't work I was just gonna like say I'm going to business school and then sort of erase it and if something worked I would I would parlay it into maybe the book that I would write someday or whatever else like there was always like that and it helped me feel more secure with the with the the different tries and whatever else and of course I grew more confident with the idea as I got the team together and we started to learn more about what we were doing and I think we have time for one more question did I like handle it go ahead and decide you know it was a few things I think I think you you have to hire people to have a genuine interest in what they're building and and so it was an eclectic team of people that all had this like interest in what we were actually doing again as I said because no one joined us to get an exit because we were very transparent people that that's not what we were even focused on and we never even really talked about in the beginning so it was people that enjoyed working together which I think built a really grid a really good sense of culture the other thing I always encouraged people to do was I always told my team as we were in years into the business I would always tell them that everyone has to move on and what I meant by that is that when you're learning curve plateaus you either have to have a new role in the company or a new role out and it started when we had our first departure which was years into the business at first voluntary departure and I was really scared about the message it would send to the team because it was like oh my gosh like someone just chose to leave and and I realized that the reason they were doing that is because they kind of felt like their learning curve had plateaued there wasn't an obvious spot above them and they were just doing the same thing for a year or two at that point and so I really you know I built this mantra of everyone's got to move on hopefully you move on internally but if you can't move on internally you should move on externally and so what it did is it kept the team engaged and learning and I really do believe that the reason someone takes the call from a headhunter or start surfing a job board is because they don't feel fully utilized it's you know in a decent team it's not because you know it's not because of like some crazy idea it's just they don't feel like they're being fully utilized and being developed and so they start to meander and consider other opportunities but if you keep people deeply engaged and challenged they'll just stay sometimes for less pay because they feel like they're learning well before we say our thanks we just I just want to thank you guys all for coming if you go to if you're not subscribed already go to the hustle the hustle.co and sign up
