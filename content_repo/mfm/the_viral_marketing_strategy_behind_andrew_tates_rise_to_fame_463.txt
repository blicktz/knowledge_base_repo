what else is traits of the total man the total man does not get caught up in bs drama um the total man does not act like a wussy so uh when things you know if like david goggins is like uh i broke my foot good i'm finishing this hundred mile run like and the stories they collect and pride themselves on are not about lifestyle balance are not about like someone came over to my house the other day and they she said this to my wife she goes it's okay to not be okay and i go total man would never say it's okay to not be okay you're turning into uh sasha fierce with that trying to calm down all right we're live i don't know who sasha fierce is i bet she's amazing it's uh beyonce when she goes on stage she has a stage character she calls sasha fierce she gets into that mode so no matter how she was before going on stage she's like that wasn't i'm a new person now and i'm doing my thing that i do with this it's hard that's hard when you drink your tobo chico you take a big swig of that and you become sam fierce where do you want to go from here you drive all right i got a couple things that i want to talk to you about so i think i think this episode is not going to be for this for the faint of heart i think it's not going to be for the sensitive i want to talk to you about a concept that i've seen two concepts that i've seen the title the title of this episode is going to be i'm not racist but it's not illegal right like i'm not i'm not trying to be sexist but that's what this episode is so okay so let me tell you something so i'm doing this um um workshop that is clearly not a webinar today right after this with our boy nick huber and um how many people signed up can you take a guess take a guess how many people signed up for a webinar hundreds five thousand people have signed up for this no really your boy pulls weight i think is one conclusion but the second conclusion is is i saw i got to see up close and personal how nick marketed this thing so nick does something i call mob marketing he basically angers the mom nick who nick huber um and he's on twitter he's at sweaty startup and he's got a big following couple hundred thousand followers and some people love him and a lot of people hate him he's one of our only friends like we have this group chat of people who all got big on twitter he's the only one of us i think that gets like death threats on a daily basis um dude his home address gets posted all the people will post his home address they'll post pictures of his wife and they'll talk about how he's evil they'll post on linkedin separately not even tagging him the next day being like i couldn't sleep at night just thinking about how much this bothered me with what this guy said and he'll say things that definitely ruffle feathers he does it i would say it's some overlap i can't decide you know it's hard to get into the mind of like you know the joker that man what's an example post it's like someone so he'll be like um i've never met someone who has purple hair and also has their life together he's like i'm not saying it doesn't exist but i'm over eight and so it's like some people think it's funny some people secretly kind of nod along but they'll stay quiet about it and then a bunch of people are like dude what are you saying here and they're offended or they're like offended on behalf of somebody else and then he'll do that again he'll be like um you know he'll say i run my company um i have you know 20 people that are making five dollars an hour in the philippines and it's the best decision i made um hiring my my international staff has been you know an absolute game changer i'm never hiring entitled americans who care about a b and c again um you know whatever and then people are like you're what are you anti-american and then they're like wait five dollars an hour in the philippines do you feel good taking advantage of this labor and he's like well you know i'm paying them double what they were making before this otherwise they wouldn't take this job like i'm not forcing anyone into anything but okay if that if you want to protect these people who like this job okay sure um but the point is is he posts up that he knows he knows ruffles feathers he takes a very polarizing approach to it and i would say in our world in the business world this is not common um elon kind of does it but not really and he's the only he's the only one i could think of uh that's like maybe there's a bunch of other examples but on the on the business side it's not that common and the pull trump political side you see it right trump on the trump did it before he he was doing it as a business person well i think it was i don't know maybe because his whole business career was kind of pre-social media so it's hard to say right like i think he always was this guy but you know when you do it in dinner parties it's very different than doing it out loud on twitter where anybody anywhere in the world can follow you and hate you um tucker carlson is like this uh all all of the like kind of media pundits that get really big like hannity and whatever they take a very polarizing view on things ben shapiro right and then you have andrew tate and this kind of leads me into a um so first i kind of noticed this mob marketing tactic i was like this is very effective um i don't know if i would want to do it it sounds like it you know is a lot of like kind of firefighting um and i've been able to make it work without doing it so i don't i don't really intend to go do this but it is one tactic that does work the other thing that i've noticed with this is it ties to this idea i call total man i think total man is a new lifestyle that is popping up and i'd like to tell you about it so here's the idea with total man is this a trademark uh phrase i tried to buy the domain it's taken uh i'd like to own this domain um and i think that this is going to be it's either already is or going to be the next big kind of lifestyle brand trend is whoever owns this total man thing i think andrew tate kind of did it so i'm a little bit late to the to the game here but basically if you look at the following individuals david goggins joe rogan um jocko willink andrew tate donald trump even nick hubert to an extent they all subscribe to this like total man lifestyle what is the total man lifestyle so here did i get did i get left off that bullet point you you are you're like half of them um like i think i think you definitely you're not total man you're half man but you might be two percent milk yeah you might be trying to get to that to that level okay so here's so my trainer even said this he's like he's like i'm just trying to live the quality like i want to be a quality man and i want to have this lifestyle i thought quality man that's a good phrase i said let me just sharpen that a little bit total man i said what do you mean by that he goes he's like i just want to have my finances like set i want to have i want to be wealthy i want to i want to be fit like i don't want to be out of shape i don't think it's cool to be out of shape i'm going to push myself to be in phenomenal shape um and you know i found some other characteristics that he didn't say these but basically somebody who's unapologetic so you see this with nick when the bob comes at him he never apologizes or backs down he pushes back again trump does the same thing andro tate does the same thing they double down instead of backpedaling so they're unapologetic why because they live by a code i think you do that too they live by a code it's an internal code and the internal code can be a little bit flawed like andro tate says some wild stuff but the fact that they have a code is actually quite admirable i think people are attracted to somebody with a code because they themselves don't have a code and so you it's sort of like life is easier when you're just uh around people who live by their code um what else is uh traits of the total man the total man does not get caught up in bs drama um the total man does not act like a wussy so uh when things you know if like david goggins is like uh i broke my foot good i'm finishing this hundred mile run like and the stories they collect and pride themselves on are not about lifestyle balance are not about like someone came over to my house the other day and they she said this to my wife she goes it's okay to not be okay and i go total man would never say it's okay to not be okay this is lifestyles right i think there's one lifestyle and so let me keep going he knows what he wants out of life and then he has it so it doesn't matter if what you want is a bugatti and uh you know three model girlfriends what matters is that you wanted it and you sort of whatever quote unquote manifested it i think that's another trait of the of these people that do this total man lifestyle and lastly they have strong hobbies joe rogan goes bow hunting uh you know goggins does pull-ups for fun uh these people have strong hobbies and lastly they are charismatic and they care about being charismatic so to me i think that you're gonna see a bunch of mega influencers and a bunch of brands being built like in the same way that there's like right-wing conservative like that became a lifestyle and an identity and then a bunch of brands got built for that population i think you're gonna see a bunch of people you're already seeing it with andrew tate and others david goggins and others that are trying to do this total man lifestyle and then build a bunch of products for other guys who want to be in this want want to be a part of this religion and i think about this and this isn't anything this isn't anything new i'm reading like the biography of arnold schwarzenegger right now and but you know he like something he was in the church of the total man would do is go read an arnold schwarzenegger biography for fun yeah well he's he's an eclectic person but he was uh you know he was selling workout plans and things like that because people are like oh you're on the he would he would do these photo shoots in fitness magazines of him holding a surfboard on the beach in la and he in the biography he's like i've never surfed in my life like i could barely swim look at me like have you seen a bulldog swim like it doesn't happen a lot and uh like he's like you know i don't really like i'm not like that but people wanted to look like him they wanted to be around these hot girls they wanted to live in la and he would sell these planes so of course this isn't anything new we're just seeing a different generation here's what i think is new i have this belief that like almost everything that becomes a big friend is in response to the world being a certain status quo in the other way it's a pendulum that swings and so you had an era where it was like the world was very conventional and traditional and blah blah blah and then you start to see a bunch of unconventional untraditional things and this is people having different genders and pronouns and purple hair and all this stuff and you see a big movement in that direction and then you see um like i would say therapy and empathy and all these words have never been more popular and amongst men and women um and i think in response to that i think there's an undercurrent of people who feel like it's all too soft the world's getting too soft we need hard men we need we need the total man and and so here's how i know it works everything i described is the opposite of toxic masculinity it is basically uh being a man became something that got labeled as toxic masculinity and now i think there's a bunch of people trying to take that back and be like hell no we embrace masculinity and so that's what i see happening is people basically flipping that on its head and be like i'm not i'm not going to apologize for being manly in fact i'm going to double down on it and then there's this wave of people who have been craving something like that and i'll give you the example i remember when snapchat came out and i underestimated snapchat at first i thought oh just disappearing photos for kids and is this just for you know bleep pics like you know what what is this is this is gonna be a real deal what i underestimated was that snapchat was the response the pendulum had swung at when snapchat came out facebook was basically at the peak of its powers um or had like sort of like was was uh facebook and instagram were like the top and what facebook and instagram were were every photo is public every photo is permanent every photo looks good and just trying to make you look look cool and what was snapchat it was the exact opposite it was every photo is private every photo is impermanent and it lets because of that you get to be silly you get to let your hair down you get to just send goofy pictures instead of pictures that make you look cool and so that it there to me the need for a product like snapchat only be only came out because the world had got so instagramified so facebookified where everything was public permanent and uh and and pretty and so i think that you see this anytime you notice that the world goes in one direction you can sort of anticipate that two or three years later the counterculture response is going to be there the opposite is going to become popular and so uh this is like a way for me to get like when i think about how to be ahead of the curve on trends i start to think about what what feels dominant today and in three years what would be the opposite because i think there's going to be an emergence of that counterculture what do you think of this am i just am i just doing fake astrology they're trying to piece things together uh no your theory i think is is exactly right you know there's been things that i've been interested in like um have you heard of the the light phone it's l-i-t-e phone i i looked into buying one because i i believe that why because we're so well i guess explain what it is but it's like we're so happy so the light phone is it's like a 300 phone but it has the screen of a kindle so no colors and i think you can only download i think you can only do spot i think it's just spotify i think it's just google maps and then phone calling and you might be able to text but you can only text like a nokia so you have to type in like yeah in order to do c you got to hit one three times right and it came out like maybe 10 years ago at this point eight years ago and it didn't really hit right away but it's getting more and more and more popular another one that i've been preaching about forever and that hasn't entirely taken off yet is duck duck go so duck duck go is a search engine it's just like google but it's uh you can't be tracked and so if you google duck duck go internet searches they actually have a graph and you can see like the number of searches per day and it's growing exponentially right um yeah so your theory i think is totally right i think anybody who's in fashion or whatever is gonna know this they're gonna be like yeah duh like when everything goes to skinny jeans guess what's guess what's coming back next which is bell bottoms and whatever the you know the baggy stuff the high-waisted loose stuff or whatever um but you have an issue here's a here's a flaw with this premise this particular one it's not a flaw you're stuck in this california bubble man you gotta you gotta come to where i'm from in missouri i think like you know this is this has been gaining momentum now for a little while i think the difference is is that um california types you know the people like if if i'm from like a place that's generally right of center now the left of center people i think are also craving a bit more than before right before it was like kind of cringy guys um and then they start evolving a little bit to being a little bit more holistic and so for example do you know who andy frisella is yes so he's in our world and that technically we compete against him in the podcast charts but i had no idea who he was but he was the he was the he's the number one business podcast typically in the charts each week and he talks a ton about like politics and stuff and i i believe he's right of center but it's that's mostly a stereotype of just the way he looks and some of the phrasing that he uses his podcast used to be called the mfn ceo right and then i started listening to him and i'm like oh you're way more eclectic than i originally judged you for and you're actually really interesting and i think that that's what's happening is that there's uh people who don't entirely fit into the previous bubble of of of whatever i would stereotype these guys as being which is like lower iq big ass meatheads it's like oh no you're actually way more thoughtful than i thought totally uh yeah i think that's that's totally true um so yeah i think this uh i'm keeping an eye on this and i think that they've been very successful like david goggins is kind of like stunningly popular now and um same thing with andrew tate well so is jocko you saw andrew did you see andrew tate came out of prison and did an interview do you see this interview on bbc just it ended mid-interview didn't it well there's the full thing got posted on like rumble or something like that like what happened yeah no i didn't watch it i mean it's kind of a headache the thing about him is like he started out like if you listen to his messages like maybe 70 is like good like you know a man is someone who exercises they get what they want but then like there's like 30 where i'm like oh bro like i don't want to be associated with that like that you cross the line there but uh yeah some of the stuff he says is awesome so for example yeah the the bbc so it's a woman she comes into his home and she's interviewing him and uh she goes you are you know um how can you say these things that are you know toxic and dangerous and whatever you've been named by the uk um commission uh committee of whatever as the most dangerous man in the united kingdom you he's like dangerous man in the united kingdom he's like he's like he's like what am i preaching that that is so dangerous he's like he's like i don't i'm muslim i don't drink i don't do drugs i tell people don't drink don't do drugs i say work out i say work hard get rich um and you know like build yourself into a quality individual who lives by code and he's like you know that's what i that's what i preach what is dangerous about that and she's like well you said on an interview that um if your wife does only fans you're entitled to half her earnings or whatever um or like that you know if your wife is your wife that she is your your property as a man or whatever and he's like he's like did you listen to the actual interview she's like you said that that is that's what you said he goes yes but what's the context of the interview the context of the interview is uh or the context of the podcast is i'm me and several women are on a podcast we're joking around because one woman says um if my man owns a car and i'm dating him that's my car i own that property too and then he countered as a he's like he's like i basically as a joke countered if i'm dating a girl and she has an only fans then i i get half of that too and uh he's like well the same logic right and he's like so that's what i said and she's like so are you saying it's a joke he's like yeah i'm saying you're taking it completely out of context and he's like you know he's kind of like trying to defend himself they're arguing back and forth and he's like he asked her a question and she's like no i'm asking the questions here he goes no no you're in my house i invited you here i'm doing you the favor you know you're begging me for interviews and uh i i let you in here we are equals uh you do not hold any authority over me we're equals if i ask you a question you you can choose to answer if you ask me a question i don't have to answer either you know that's how this is going to it's a conversation and she like was like rejecting that premise and then you hear their handlers in the background that are all like getting really nervous about how the whole thing's going because it's like going off the rails uh the bbc handler or the tate handler because they he he has them yeah he has people who are like you know i wouldn't say maybe handler is not the right word but like you know he has this like kind of whatever pr type people that were like he's answered the question already like why like you repeated the same question six times like just move on to the next thing like you're stuck here like he's answered it he's not going to answer it any differently he's answered it five times now just move on to the next question and so they were like you could hear these voices in the background in the unedited version like even they take a break they're like how are we got the camera camera died we got to reach reset the batteries hold on and then you can see what happens in the break she like immediately is like no doesn't make eye contact she's like looking at her notes only and then they go like good interview and his aunt was like we don't have to do this it's fine it's fine no this is good actually i want people to see how this goes he's like i want people to see her uh like you know how how the mainstream media how they don't they don't do their research they lie blah blah and he's got his like spiel but during the break there's like maximum tension it's like that's actually probably the most interesting part of the whole interview so i uh i'm not con i'm me personally i'm not convinced i'm willing to sign up for that i don't want to i'm not i don't want to deal with that headache agreed i'm willing to make sacrifices to some parts not of my code it's just that my code is like not that hardcore maybe is the right way to put it but i've met a lot of people who run companies that you know that are worth hundreds of millions and some that are actually worth billions and i'll see them like do certain things that are common now about like uh uh like they use phrases like bring your whole self to work which is like kind of like a funny controversial statement to some people because some people like no just bring your work self to work like we don't we don't need it yeah or no there's like a crew and then there's like they'll do like certain things that are typically like uh that you see a lot of that are categories as woke and i'm like dude i know you don't believe that and i i see them say they'll say things privately like yeah but i want to win and this is the game i have to play in order to like hire all these people and i don't know how i feel about that when i hear about that i'm like i had a funny uh experience with this so when we got acquired by twitch i'm now in a 2000 person organization and twitch uh literally i think uh you know five percent of the staff has like you know purple hair like and i don't mean that's a knock i just mean like we're in san francisco we are the stereotype of when people talk about like kind of like left leaning social media companies like people think this about twitter or facebook i would say twitch is probably more like that than um in terms of the staff so i'm in a meeting and i joined like three minutes late as i do as you know that i that tend to be three minutes later every time and um there's a presentation on the screen i don't really understand what's going on i'm like what is this presentation about and i'm i slack somebody and they're like oh it says like a uh you know just kind of like updating our copywriting whatever i'm like oh copywriting i love copywriting what are we talking about and it was talking about like how we use uh genders from now on it's like we only say they and then and then they were talking about uh women they're like we don't say women we say um and they spell this word w-o-m-x-n and i was like i was like how do you even say that what is womxn i don't know what is that or is it just women like what do you say for that and like this is now how we say this and i was like i was like what does that mean like sorry dumb question like like what is it who is it who's offended and what does this mean it's like oh this is inclusive of like people who were maybe not biologically born women but now are women and so this is like the inclusive term and i was like so i was like how i was like how do you say this and and like all of a sudden i could see i could feel like a bunch of heat on me like why are you asking all these questions and like there's kind of an undercurrent in the way i'm asking the questions which is sort of like is this are you sure like that's kind of all i was i was like i was like wow this is overnight we're just changing like this is we don't say that and now we say this like this is a pretty big change no and um and so i'm hearing this and i'm like okay i guess you know that's cool and um um and then they the funny thing is the company then tweeted out for international women's day they tweeted out international womaxons day or whatever right like they tweeted it out like that and then they got tons of blowback from the transgender like the lgbtq community being like don't don't use that phrase just call us women why are you trying to make us seem different and i was like oh my god that backfired like their attempt to to like you know placate actually backfired and i was like wow this is really like this is there's a bunch of landmines like you don't even know but then what if the executive were you like hey executive team what are you thinking you can't ask that but i was like i said it in a different way i said uh we're talking about like you know questions i was like um amazon has this thing where when you are doing your yearly planning one of their questions is what are the dogs that are not barking yet and it's from this old sherlock home story of like a crime occurs in a house there's a break-in and there's no clues and sherlock can't figure it out and he figures it out because he's like um well the dog was here right so surely the neighbor heard the dog and they're like no the dog didn't bark and he's like ah that's it that's the clue watson and he's like what he's like if the dog didn't bark it's because he knows who the intruder was that means this was an inside job and so he figures out who it was because there was the dog not barking so they have this thing in amazon which is when you're doing your annual planning they said what are your dogs not barking basically like what are you not hearing that is actually telling you something um or it's a different way of saying like what is something what is something that's not being said out loud but could signal something that's worth yeah yeah and um so i said i go i think we should decide how woke we're going to be and like where like is there a line and what does that mean and who do we want to like we should say it out loud what we want to be um and then literally my slack just blew up of like dms being like like abort don't say this don't like don't bring this up like um what are you saying dude like this is like you know uh a suicide mission and one girl goes she goes she goes um i didn't appreciate that we don't use the word woke anymore and i go i go we who like there's a company policy you can't use the word woke i was like i didn't even mean it as an insult like i thought it's just like yeah because at the time it really wasn't this was many years this is like four years ago or five years ago now woke was woke became a little bit more derogatory over time uh at first it was stay woke it was like uh the kids were saying it as like yo you if you're not you're not like awake to what's really going dude i think twitter had t-shirts that said stay well yeah it was like a positive thing and then it turned into a criticism later so somewhere in the middle of that and i was like we should decide what and she's like we don't use the word woke anymore so i you know i appreciate if you don't do that okay who's we is there a committee that decides what words we can say like that sounds pretty non-woke to me and uh and she links me like a vox article i'm like oh you read this vox article you decided that i can't say this and i was like oh this is just too much for me and i was like there's only one piece of advice that i needed it was a piece of advice i got on this podcast from a guy very early on daniel gross he's super smart guy he got acquired by apple and i go what was that like in that acquisition you were there for three years what what was the best advice you got about navigating that and he goes don't give yourself brain damage and i go what he goes yeah when you get acquired there's a really tempting thing as an entrepreneur to like i'm gonna i see things that are wrong in this organization or that i want to be a challenger voice and not just like another another person who just follows you know the company line and i'm going to challenge you know maybe our innovation cycle or our policies or anything i'm gonna i'm gonna be the one who brings change he goes it's just brain damage don't don't try it and i was like oh i'm doing it i'm giving myself brain damage how'd the woke story end it ended with that one person telling me that we can't say say these words anymore which was backed up by nothing and i was like oh cool so you read this article and so you decided that i am not allowed to ask this question again gotcha just make this clarifying great uh thank you you know whatever head of important thing inside the company like yeah i'm glad that you're uh i'm glad this is how this this this works and you know what do you think without calling out well emmett is the ceo and he seemed i don't know him but he seems like an awesome guy with i don't know if you can answer this without calling him out but what do you think he thinks or someone like him can i say someone like him someone in his position someone in his position with his name and face what would they say yeah i don't know i can't speak for him but i i guess my impression of it was basically i think he's mostly shielded from this stuff so like i don't think the most of this gets to his plate and that by the time it does he's he's a total man he doesn't care about drama like i think he's he's like a renaissance man he's a little different um i think two things i think one i think he's mostly just like um he i think he's gotten a lot of ceo coaching to where he doesn't let his first reaction be his response so like something comes up and now instead of reacting he responds and he usually responds with a question and he'll just ask them tons of questions and he's like i'm in the spirit of literally understanding what you're saying and trying to figure this out tell me what does that word mean like and they'll be like it just i mean it means inclusive means he's like well like no like can you please like use an example or can you uh like from can you explain that from like you know base principles like what are you talking about where what are the boundary lines like let's make sure we're all talking about the same thing and uh he does look kind of like a socratic method where he would he would end up just like fatiguing out anybody who wanted to bring something up and he would get his understanding of it and to decide is this important or not but um i think most people are sort of intimidated by him and then in the process of trying to debate him on something would sort of like nobody could really a very few people in the company could really like hold up to any debate or any scrutiny from him in in a conversation i saw it just many many times and he was trying to dial that down because he knows that that's like you know already he's in a position of authority plus he's like a you know world-class debater who's got this like wide breadth of knowledge to like pull from so he already knows he's like you know if he does that he's gonna shut people down so he's trying not tries not to do that but i saw you know most people didn't want to bring it up to him dude i just avoid all of this this like i can't stand this stuff and it's just i just don't care is really what i guarantee it's the worst part of the job for zuckerberg or or an amit or anybody who runs these networks it's like the one percent of trust and safety or like angry people that's constantly angry about something that's got to be the worst part of the job that's not why they created these networks is to like be public policy maker in their own like kingdom but it is amazing how they uh get around it uh because i could i could tell zuck doesn't care about that stuff but he still plays the game yeah and zuck's a man he's never had a controversy he's never done anything not a lot of these guys have it uh like they've done pretty good with navigating some of these topics and i'm amazed that they don't react by saying oh you guys want to form this union or you want to like protest over this you're all fired like this is a machine you know we don't need this we don't need this this is what happened to the mail right like didn't he he say something in an email which is like you know let's not do it this way and then he got fired from his own company what happened i don't i don't know what happened he he he was he wrote an email to the staff about a trend he noticed in the workforce which was new hires had to introduce themselves using their preferred pronouns he says this is completely unnecessary for a woman who is clearly a woman to tell us that her pronouns are she and her and a man who's clearly a man to tell us those pronouns are he and him um he understands that the practice is rooted in kindness but he says in the long run this approach does more harm than good because you're forcing people to behave a certain way and that's the opposite of inclusion um um and then and so then uh he says first there's a tiny number of people at uh well he says peeps so you know already maybe that's a fireable offense it's a tiny number of peeps at mailchimp who would consider themselves transgender forcing either with orders or guilt the other 1390 other peeps to adopt a new communication time the humanity has never had to use in our 300 000 year existence and our 150 000 years of spoken language in order to make things slightly more comfortable for an extremely small group of peeps is completely illogical um so then he got fired it was probably for the peeps sake to be honest like into whoever bought the company was like look man we need to talk yeah he's like but i didn't mean to hurt the the trans people he goes what no look we need to talk about this peeping yeah he stepped down as see uh shortly after and uh voluntarily uh and then also somebody came out was like by the way there's no policy that says they have to do that he's like this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated whoa i can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better we um one time at the hustle we wrote an article on sasha gray sasha gray used to be like this famous porn star and we wrote about how she was trying to change her image around to not be that and every single night at like midnight our time i would get all this traffic from japan because i guess that was morning time in japan it was all people searching for sasha gray and they were fighting our article yeah and i found out that she had hired this company called like reputation.com to like boost that article so it showed up first so we're getting all these people searching sasha gray xxx and they didn't get what they wanted to but whatever you're like photos at the bottom of this blog post photos inside our newsletter if you subscribe dude i didn't realize i guess i realized it but someone posted this infographic on twitter of the biggest websites and it was like google was just like the largest it was like bigger than everything combined but then like i think four of the top 10 were were porn sites and uh it's it's wild i mean imagine working at one of those companies can you imagine that what would that be like just sitting in the office it's weird i've imagined it many times no um so i've been i can't talk about these but i've been i've had very interesting conversations with a few people that own only fans based businesses recently and they're absolutely crushing it to the point where i can't talk about it because i would be kind of like it's like do you mean do you mean the the stars or like the ancillary things all most i'm talking about the ancillary things right now but they're all crushing it the platform is crushing it the stars are crushing it and the the cottage businesses that get built around this to help this to be a part of that ecosystem but they're doing so well that i sort of if i talked about them i would be coming between them and like millions of dollars because people a lot of people would want to compete with the the strategies that they're doing but i will say one thing that i've learned that's pretty interesting so i always assumed that only fans was popular because um you're sending like i don't know nude pics or videos to guys and that's like the thing that's what they're paying for and i was always a little curious i was like porn's like free on the internet why would you pay for this like there must be something i don't know and i just kind of wrote it off as that do you know why they make so much money do you know what the actual money maker is inside of a of an only fans account when these girls say that they're making like a million dollars a month you know what actually drives that i've never i've never subscribed to one i guess you probably have subscribed to a few now that you're like researching it but i've never subscribed to one you know i'm a married man and i did not do that but uh you didn't need to because i talked to the people who like run they like run the accounts or whatever like what a lot of people don't realize is that a lot of these accounts are just they're bought so like uh a girl has a public persona she does an only fan she kind of gets exhausted running the thing because it's like a lot and it's like emotionally exhausting dealing with all these guys and uh whatever so she's uh so somebody come approaches her and says we'll buy your account for um you know i'll give you two hundred thousand dollars right now for your only fans account and then i'll give you you know x percent of the profits and i'll run it you just have to put pictures in a dropbox folder and uh you give me good content and i will give you money and that's how it goes and then uh and so what what actually people so i was like why do people pay for these pictures and videos like again porn's free that's like one of the rules of the internet is porn is free uh so what what do people really want and it turns out that they want like the girlfriend experience and so yeah not through the content but through the chatting and that the chatting has all kinds of weird things like is it one group chat or individual no individuals and so they hire farms of chatters so basically what only fans is built off of like a lot of the the money is made through is giant like customer support you know uh call centers uh essentially in the philippines talking to you know it's basically like dudes in the philippines talking to dudes in the u.s pretending to be the girl and so they it's just like they have this army of chatters that will chat with these guys and tease them a flirt with them and then upsell them and boom cha-ching got the sale there and they're like sales people they they got to they get commissions and all this stuff it's insane and what how within that okay so one of the highest ticket items what's the you know if this was the the county fair what's that top stuff stuffed animal at the top and it's basically like the number one is pretend to be my girlfriend for like you know a month and it's like text me as if you're my girlfriend um and it's like that's the that's like the top prize but there's other weird stuff underneath weird so weird that i can't even say this this is a family show um and so i can't even say some of the weird stuff that they want but it's not what you would think it's not like super is it just like sending sending pictures back and forth like i'll give you one example one example is the guy who's the customer sending pictures to the only fans person asking for their opinion or rating of them and that's like a service that they pay for and so there's stuff and and i guess like the two things stood out one is it's like the free market at work baby it's like you you can really see what humans are all about when you talk to this to these people because it's like man people are into all kinds of crazy stuff these are like their real desires and these are desires they wouldn't admit and i bet a bunch of these people are you know they're the person they're doctors and they're the ceos and they're they're other people like you know human desires got revealed they were always there and they got revealed because only fans gave a a better avenue to to realize those desires which is kind of crazy to me the second thing is i think it's wild how much money is being made in this space and um my reaction to it is not kind of like like i think you were asking what's your reaction to no my my question is not who cares that if it exists my question is uh you getting involved into it what how does it make you feel and how does it make your wife feel and are you like well okay you're you're contemplating i'm learning i'm talking to these people because i find it fascinating uh i have contemplated investing in some of these because i'm like i would not want to operate this but you know if you're if you're already down there in the sewer let me know if you got something i'll you know hand it up here you know like i i will i'll provide resources dude you realize how that's so hypocritical why is it hypocritical i'm saying i don't personally i would not personally enjoy operating this i i also would not like operating a deli or an ice cream shop or whatever but i'll go i'll go eat a scoop what's the problem with that if they need resources they need capital or they need advice i'll give them those things i don't want to operate so to me that's fine um my wife it's also hypocritical of me by the way if i consume porn and to also on it so i'm not acting like i'm whole i'm not acting as though i'm holier than thou but it is a conundrum i told my wife by the way i was like hey and think about this and she just goes okay don't tell me but if it makes funny that's fine um yeah i would also say that it's really funny i find it like amusing the way that the ecosystem works where it's like what you think it is is some woman with an account who's putting up content and guys want that and then she's chatting with them and it's like actually this like whole other thing there's agencies that control the accounts the agencies are 90 dudes the chatters are like you know these call centers in india and the philippines and um i find it amusing i'm like that's hilarious that that's what this like that that's how this like evolved and i find that dude and i always i always get their reels on instagram at night in bed so like i try not to keep my uh so i i like if i'm scrolling on my phone at like 10 p.m it's normally like rip guys and dogs in the day and then even in the evening it's hot girls that pop up on my reel or you know like when you're scrolling through your instagram right and i'm like wait what is this and then you click on their profile and it links to a link tree which goes to well the funny thing is you see it because what they one of their main growth tactics is they pay meme accounts so accounts that just post funny jokes 99 of the time the way that those accounts make money is only fans people will pay a lot of money to get posted one time at night on those accounts and then you can delete it in the morning um and that's how they grow their their own social followings and so uh through these meme distribution channels and so that's a funny part of it but anyways i don't even know didn't plan to talk about this one but that's a funny little tangent so all right listen i don't know if this actually is going to interest you but i'm going to try to make this interest to you because anything that uses the h word history you're not into right that's not but the total man should understand history because yeah he actually listen he actually you know has been alive through all of history so i'm reading this book it's called like killers of the flower moon it's basically about the 1920s osage indians it was native americans they were given this plot of land when they were like you know like the government was like hey you know we're taking this over here's your plot of land turns out it sat on all this oil and so they all got rich and white people take advantage of them and kill them to steal their money and i was reading this book and they keep talking about the pinkertons have you heard of the pinkertons never so they were like kept talking i was like why don't they go to the police and they're hiring these guys called the pinkertons so pinkertons it was basically a guy named alan pinkerton he started this company in 1950 and he started it because he was walking through the woods one day and he saw a bunch of like counterfeiters and he got curious so he starts watching them and he starts figuring out what they're doing and then he calls the police on them and they're like well we can't really solve this he goes give me a few weeks i'm gonna i'll keep an eye on them and i think i can figure out what they're doing where they're going and i'll be your detective he does that and they get arrested and he's like i love doing this this is very fun and so he keeps doing it and it starts like a small like little mom and pop business where he goes to other people he goes hey do you want me to help you solve this crime just pay me a little bit of money and i'll go and i'll go and do it and we'll report it to the police and we'll give them all the evidence that they need so he does this for a handful of years and eventually he works his way up to like the uh the government american government is paying him money and it gets to the point where his people this is pre-secret service his people uh protect abe lincoln so we didn't have the secret service back then secret service was invented after abe lincoln got shot and do a great job yeah can't win them all it turns out yeah can't win them all can't win them all it turns out yeah that is actually totally true he's had a bunch of losses but uh so he so he was like uh uh failed to protect the president but for some reason the government still liked him so they started giving him contracts so anyway fast forward to the pinkertons are still around and they've done a bunch of controversial so like as they grew companies like uh andrew carnegie like the titans of uh industry would hire him to basically like when there were uh unions that would go and strike they would literally sit outside of a gate of a factory and like like protest and and then also fight and so the pickertons at one point killed like 24 of these like protesters it was like a huge thing and so they're like you have a note here that says at their peak they had more agents than the standing american army is that true that's insane dude they had tons of people and their motto was pinkertons don't sleep we don't sleep and their logo wasn't wasn't open was an open eye and so they like it was just like we are we are there all the time uh and we will always find out what's going on you know i thought that mighty ducks ducks fly together was the top but uh this we don't sleep might be better than ducks fly together yeah we don't sleep but so this company was created in 1850 i think i said i was reading about uh coincidentally this other thing going on with like amazon amazon was having some issues with union stuff and dude amazon this company still exists and amazon hired these pinkertons so basically what they do now so the company was sold in like 2005 or something for like 400 million dollars so not a significant amount of money for how long it lasted but because it kind of peaked in the early 1900s it's like a lot of money for the people who are in the early 1900s but they're still hired by look at their website have you been to their website no it just says our story and there's literally a picture of abe lincoln that's the hero image do they have a home about owning you're owning your failures these guys love it yeah yeah it just says we've learned from our mistakes nobody nobody feels faster than us uh yeah they took fail faster risk advisory investigations protection embedded smes i don't even know what that is that sounds dude so listen to what they do so they basically they'll hire these guys so pinkerton like there's like guards now i guess i don't know what they wear like blue blue jeans and a plaid shirt and they like go to like they'll go to starbucks hired them and they'll go to the starbucks to get a coffee and they'll just try to listen in and you'll hear like one guy talking to his co-worker like hey we should unionize or you know this guy let's do this and that and they go and report it back to like corporate headquarters or they'll try to figure out like when uh amazon was launching a bunch of stuff they'll go and just walk around the office and be like is anyone talking about some shit they shouldn't be talking about and they like report it they still exist google hires them facebook hires them they still like monitor monitor this stuff and it's a really it's a fascinating that a company has existed since 1850 or whenever it was and they're still like working and b i started thinking about like private police and security companies and there hasn't been that many like interesting security startups so one of them that i actually invested in it's called deep sentinel do you know what deep sentinel is it's the uh security um it's a security thing where you like it's a security camera where uh it'll talk it'll like there's like a human watching on the other side uh deep sentinel's whole thing like they make a joke they go rings awesome for watching your shit get stolen and uh like i i have deep sentinels at my house and like one time a drunk guy came up to my front door thinking that i was we were his airbnb and like the camera like catches him and he says hey sir what are you doing here and they call the police so i walked down at like 3 a.m and i see the cops in my house like taking away this guy and so anyway that's kind of cool another one is called banner man have you heard a banner man i have heard of this it's nice like bodyguards right dude we used to do it all time so it was a company that went through uh white combinator and we host conferences well i don't know i'm trying to figure out the site's still up but basically when you host a conference by law as well as like practicality like you need it you have to hire security you need security guards and we would use bannerman and we would hire like and they have like a menu it's like armed gar 200 an hour non-armed gar 150 just a huge scary looking guy 100 an hour like you could like hire them by the hour and it was so easy it was like uber for security it was awesome but there hasn't been that much new startups like in this space by the way here's the pricing unarmed guard 59 an hour armed guard 90 an hour off-duty police 145 an hour and they're armed that's it that's it so i just get a big scary guy to walk with me for 50 bucks or 80 bucks an hour whatever it was i'll do it for free um uh so anyway i'm just like interested in this space and i thought like the pinkerton thing it was wild that this shit still exists you know how much they sold for is that or do you know anything about their revenues or anything like this is a crazy no and i've looked everywhere and the founder uh he he says uh on his linkedin he goes i don't use linkedin anymore that's like what it said on his profile so i founders alive yeah his name is johnny chin um how is he alive 1850 oh oh i thought you're talking about uh bannerman uh no no no no no no dude for sure dead uh how much does it cost i don't how much well you said they sold to somebody right oh 400 million dollars in 1999 400 like 99 um but it's pretty fascinating that it lasted that long it got sold so basically and i was doing even further research on this that like there's this like the security industry it appears as though it's like a handful of big players and then tons of mom and pops but the handful of big players there's like three of them and they each do like 10 billion dollars a year in revenue and what they do is they just acquire tons of like mom and pop businesses and so now the biggest ones you'll you'll probably recognize a lot of their t-shirts because they'll see them at like um concerts and shit like that but then there's a bunch of private ones so have you heard blackwater no that sounds good though so dude this guy his name's he's his name's eric prince very controversial guy uh i haven't read his book but i want to but he was controversial because he started like a it was basically a private security company but they did ship for overseas so they would like uh protect like princes and saudi arabia and shit like that and then also when iraq and all that shit went down they would do government contracts and so they would eventually like you know do army shit so they would like protect like a convoy and eventually kill a lot of people and they were like hardcore and eric prince uh became a billionaire doing this and he eventually sold it to private equity for billions of dollars it's called blackwater very ominous name i love that name yeah there's like a there's like a bunch of interesting players in this space but not that much like of these like tech startups so i think it's really interesting and fascinating industry uh i'll give a quick shout out to this genius restaurant uh so this guy joshua goodfield tweeted this out there's a restaurant that basically named all of its like the number one the number two the number three um office supplies so it'll be like mini dry erase board or like pack of pencils so that's hilarious you can expense all meals from this restaurant it's called usb wired mouse five dollar french fries yeah exactly i thought that was a genius little uh little marketing hack uh so shout out to that and then um dude are you watching the nba finals i got a little little human interest story for you uh no but but tell me about it it's pretty crazy so the two teams that are in it is miami heat and denver nuggets so um the best player on both the teams have just like crazy back story so um one uh this is the guy in the heat jimmy butler he um have you ever seen the movie the blind side i love that movie that's my favorite movie it's his life so the guy got kicked out of his house at like 13 and was crashing on friends couches and then this white woman just took him in and um she just like joined their family and he's like yeah she's you know she didn't have to do that she just did it um he calls her mom like you know his brother her her real kids are his brothers and sisters like that's just like the way it was and he was not like unlike the blind side with the blind side it was like it's pretty clear this guy had like nfl talent like he was just like a freak athlete it was huge and so any coach would kind of tell you that not to say that's why she did it but like it was kind of like possible but jimmy butler was like he wasn't like he went to a junior college then he transferred to marquette then he barely got into the nba and now he's a star but like it was not obvious have you heard do you know who the real parents in blindside that you know it's real people he owns he owned a load of kfcs and like long john silvers and i googled him he sold it for 400 million dollars all of his franchises good things happen to people good things have good people and so what jimmy butler was this woman this woman that took him in single mom also so single mom with seven kids did this took him in basically put a roof over his head and uh he ends up grinding his way to the nba and is you know doesn't make the thing he also is doing something really really funny so back when covet hit the nba to keep the season going they had to create a bubble many sports had to do this they created a bubble which was like a didn't they do like at disneyland yeah they did at disney world i think so they did in disney world in orlando it was like you live on on campus nobody comes in or out like if food gets delivered it gets delivered in a like sealed box 30 feet away and it gets you know like given to you and they just like tested everybody daily and if anybody ever had anything they got kicked out and so during during that process jimmy butler realizes you know supply demand is out of whack so he starts he's making coffees he brought a he brought a fancy coffee machine and starts making coffees and um people are like yo can i get some coffee like the coffee here sucks i want i want the good coffee he's like yeah cool man it's a hundred dollars that's like a hundred dollars he's like he's like that's the price he's like where else to go he's like these are emmy players who cannot leave this bubble and so and they're like all right man and they just start giving him a hundred dollars for this coffee and so he creates this brand i think it's called big face coffee uh he and now he's like so he and during the bubble people want to know what it's like and there's a lot of the guys were like vlogging so this was like one of the storylines you know jimmy opened up a coffee shop he's just like you know killing us on this coffee and he's like yeah i make the best coffee it's best coffee in the world a hundred dollars and uh and so now he's like creating a spin-off brand of actually that that that coffee brand which is i think kind of cool and who's the other guy that that big white guy the giant white guy so uh yokich but he looks mean that guy looks mean i saw he got into it with small town in serbia somber he got into it with some dude on the on the sidelines too i saw uh yeah that's funny that was the owner of another team he basically like bullied an owner of another team so um so this guy's he's awesome so he basically his story is even crazier i think so this guy's born in the middle of nowhere serbia he's got two older brothers and um his he's even though they're really tall he only likes one sport horseback riding so so he just falls in love with horses always on the horse track or whatever but because he's so tall like uh you know when he wasn't on with the horses he starts playing basketball and um what's interesting is that nobody would have ever known of this guy except for the fact that um there was one team that had a business model and their business model was basically let's find prospects that might have like nba we don't care if we win now but let's just find like big dudes who got a lot of potential that like might get bought out by the bigger clubs and let's they're like kind of like house flippers they're like let's buy this guy let's see if we can turn like you know polish up the asset and let's flip them to a bigger team in europe or let's hold their rights and maybe we get there and maybe the nba team will have to buy us out and they had done this with a couple of guys and so the guy's reading the newspaper one day and he sees that at some youth basketball game like say some eighth grade game some kid you know had like 25 points and 25 rebounds and he's like oh so he goes and he finds this guy and he's like hey you ever thought about playing pro basketball he's like no and he's like come with me so at like i don't know age 13 he like leaves his hometown and joins this like team and they're like and so you're so then you think the story is he's the best player in the nba now so it's like he must have been he's the best now he's the best player in the world right now and so it's like how calls he he's like seven seven foot one something like that and so they're like you would think oh he must have been dominating in serbia and then like you know he went to the he's like you know tier four league like you know he must be awesome no he didn't even play the coach was like this kid is so fat he is just so out of shape i will not play this guy and so he's only allowed to go to practice and they're like until you can run like until you're in shape or this is not gonna work he's like what do i do like well what's your diet and the guy was drinking like two gallons of coke a day he's just who's addicted to coke he just loved drinking coke and so they were like you gotta stop that like first of all and um and so he he stops drinking coke he loses like 30 40 pounds in the course of like a few months just by changing that like one habit and going and running every day in practice because he won't they won't give him the ball he just have to run on the side while everybody else practices and so he's doing that finally he um starts playing he becomes the top player on his team like as soon as he like was able to get in shape he was the top player on his team and he gets drafted in the second round like basically he's like one of the last picks the nba draft if you go watch the video of like oh i want to see when they got drafted like you've seen when lebron gets drafted he gets on stage he shakes the commissioner's hand he smiles the light bulbs are flashing like people know this is the start of the a star is born well was he just like walking by and they're like uh here take this hat here just take that one even better they just cut to a taco bell commercial and at the bottom ticker it just said pick number 41 nicola jokic it just like it goes across the screen it goes away and it's a cheesy gordita crunch ad he didn't even have that starting moment because nobody thought this guy would turn into anything and then he's basically become you know the best player in the world how old is he he's only like 27 28 something like that he's he's pretty young still and um he actually wouldn't have even made it to the nba like this team in barcelona was going to buy him that was going to be the flip it was like he goes from the serbian team to the barcelona team and the day like the day before he was supposed to sign the contract like it was already the lawyer just had to finish one thing he played in a game he was so terrible that the team backed out so he had no choice but but to go join like the nba team that had bought his rights or drafted his rights and he's like i guess i'll go to the nba then like you know i i don't really know if anything's gonna come up with this but whatever and so he goes and he's this very stoic guy like in all his interviews they're like they have these narrate the media has all these narratives they're like how is becoming a new dad helped you become a better basketball player and he'll just look at them be like what it doesn't that's that's not how that works he's just like he's like just very matter of fact like you know like you like the kind of like dagestani guys in the ufc he's kind of like that but for basketball so he's a fan uh fascinating character it reminds me of this quote that i heard from this this vc i was like you know what's uh he had this twitter bio um let's get nico uh nico i don't know how he says that same bon santos bono sastos i don't know exactly how you say oh from uh general catalyst yeah from gc exactly the guy he invested in snapchat super early on and um i was like nico why is your bio why is your bio quote what it is and his quote was um talent is everywhere opportunity is not so talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not and i was like why is that what does that mean he goes because it's true he goes talent is everywhere but opportunity is not evenly distributed and if i do my job right we're going to distribute opportunities to more people who have the talent and i think about both these guys the two guys that are starting in the aba like you know they're kind of like one little bounce of the plinko chip away from it being a zero and instead they get to be world famous basketball players it's like if this guy didn't get discovered while playing in like a youth farm league in serbia or jimmy butler didn't get you know adopted by this woman like who knows if they would have ended up actually even getting their shot um and it's like that's how fragile like you know like success and failure can be dude last night i went and uh hung out at this like uh have you heard a flow track or you know or flow sports sorry sports yes so flow sports uh started as um uh it was basically this guy would go they started out of ut university texas this guy would go and film track meets and wrestling meets stuff that wasn't going to be broadcasted otherwise stuff that wasn't going to be broadcast and he was just like uh he was a track and field athlete and i think they had friends that were wrestlers and he's like but you know i'm i'm a fan of running and like people love that but just not on tv so he starts filming this and then he puts it online and he forms a company and people start buying it and paying like 100 bucks a year to watch this stuff and it's been around for 13 years now and now they do over 100 million in revenue and i was like what's the fastest growing segment and he said uh uh uh motorsports and i was like oh like nascar and he's like no it's like these like it's like the pre-nascar so it's like where the 18 year old kids they do this thing called dirt track so it's like it looks like a buggy kind of and they're on it's like he's like it's grassroots but he didn't say it but it's like redneck and he's like that's our fastest growing segment but we have like 18 sports i think they have wrestling grappling running cross country track and field whatever all this stuff and so he um i went and hung out their office because they had a little party and i was with like three different guys who had won gold medals in the olympics one guy in the decathlon one guy in the mile and uh some other guys and first of all here's what was interesting one of the a bunch of the olympians i was like hey do you still run you know they're like maybe 40 now and like you still run and they're like not a chance like it was my job and like i don't want to do that at all anymore like i'll exercise and go for walks and i'll lift weights but i don't want to like run like i used to run i'm done with that and the second thing was interesting is like dude these guys are all freaks like one guy his name's trey hardy you can look him up his body is crazy and they are freaks of nature but it's cool being around people like that who are a the best in the world at something like they are literally if they won a gold medal at that point they are the best in the world at what they do and it's so fascinating to like hear the stories like they would tell stories they're like dude that guy we used to go to the hotel and he'd be wearing flip-flops and he'd be like hey i bet you could touch the ceiling and the ceiling was 15 feet high and he would just jump and just touch the ceiling and they were like we just would see a little like things like that this guy would do all the time or he'd be like watch this i bet i can backflip but he would backflip but he would jump so high in the air and like we would just see these like freakish stuff all the time and so i was thinking would you give up any of the success that you've had so far in order to be a broke but olympic medal winner or like the best athlete or whatever in the world because i was thinking about that and i think i would no chance on the uh the gold medal well best athlete in the world yes i would do that that's but there's a lot of sports where you could like be the best like ncaa wrestler best like normal wrestler i thought you meant overall athlete no no no if it's if it's uh i'm i'm the fastest miler or ncaa you know uh nation you know national champion or whatever no chance i've said this before the olympics are for suckers oh you are so crazy because i'm hanging out with these guys and i'm like congrats you're the best bobsledder the world has ever seen you've dedicated your entire life to this absolutely arbitrary thing that got you that got you no money that got you uh you know no no skills beyond this i'm just dude i'm so i so disagree because they're asking me advice on business shit i'm like hey just so you know i'm like the hundred thousandth most successful person in america maybe like that's what i want to do i want to play a game where the hundred thousandth person wins and has an awesome life not where i have to be the best person in the world and even then i gotta start over at age 27 and create a new career because i'm done with the thing and my joints don't work anymore these guys had shaved arms and shaved legs i was just staring at those calf muscles and i was like dude i could see every vein of your forum that's so awesome i would kill to have that i want some of that vascularity like look at that vein pop like i just love that it was cool uh his business advice was great but then he said he wants to put butter on my chest i didn't understand that they kind of saying i had a really nice ball cast at the top of my leg like dude they their cap muscles were just so solid a little tennis ball was stuck in there i just saw that i'm like so i remember i was thinking of this one guy and i told sarah after i was like dude i bet that guy's wife is so hot like she just she's like you said to your wife dude they're so lucky and then she's like well he worked hard and i was like no the wife that wife is so lucky can you believe that she gets to see that bod like i was just thinking about that man and i just love these olympians man i'd give it all love just to be to be a gold medal in the high jump so i don't know where we go from here this is the total man episode it ends up with sam loving men dude i do like i can't you see a guy with like you know like some sick calf muscles you got to admire it you know yeah i guess
