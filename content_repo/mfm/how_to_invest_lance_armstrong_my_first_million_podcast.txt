Do you like investing? It's kind of boring. No, I love it.

What's wrong with it? It's boring. What's wrong with you?

What's wrong with this guy? He doesn't like making money. I like it.

You know, there's probably some charity right down the street where you could go give him all your dough from Twitch and give him all your time. You know, investing sounds fun and the initial pitch is fun. Yeah.

But once you give him the check, it gets very boring to me because you're so hands-off. I like it. I like being a part of creating stuff.

Dude, it's like being an uncle. You get all the fun stuff and not only the hard work. That's actually a good analogy.

You might have convinced me. That's a good analogy. Being an uncle is the best.

Yeah. I mean, we launched a fund and almost probably 90% of the companies were super involved with. In what way?

Well, either through the board or being on the board or just they just need help. I mean, you know this. I mean, young entrepreneurs, they might have a great idea and be smart people, but they're going to come across things.

They just need help navigating and or connecting them. I mean, in our... I remember once I went to pitch an investor at Founders Fund.

And Founders Fund is like a top fund or whatever, and he offered us a term sheet. And I asked him, I said, you know, we have this other capital source right now, like self-funded by my business partner. We could just keep self-funding or we could take this.

I said, you tell me, like, you know, how much value add do you guys really bring? I'm ready to hear, like, the sales pitch. And he goes, honestly, the worst companies need the most help and I can't save them.

The best companies never need my help. And so, and then there's everybody else in between. Yeah.

And here... If I'm giving you this term sheet, I hope you're one of those that are the good companies that I really don't have any influence in. I just get to take credit in the end.

And I was like, I dig that honesty. That is true to me. The best companies truly, like...

I've only made a couple of investments, but Lambda School is probably the best one. It's done pretty well. You know that one?

I'm like a needy girlfriend. You know, they're like one of the hot Silicon Valley companies doing super well. And, you know, I'll text the founder to be like, hey, what's up?

You want to jam on ideas? You want me to help you with this problem? And he's like, dude, I'm just busy with all this fucking growth.

I hate when investors ask what I need. I don't need anything. And I'm like, oh, this is what it feels like when you're winning.

When you're really, really winning and you're just too busy for any of this bullshit. Yeah, we won't tell Neil when he gets here. Well, what I do is I send monthly updates and they're very clear and succinct and I'm very transparent.

And they're like, how can I help? I'm like, you can't. Unless you have ideas and you're going to tell me how you can help do it.

But I don't... I can't think of anything... Yeah.

Like, it's like, I don't know. How can you help? You're on your way.

You know what I mean? It's like, what are you going to come in here and write emails for me and do work for me? I mean, like, I don't know.

They're like, do you need insurance to anyone? I'm like, who do you know? I don't know.

Well, that's... I mean, I think the intro part is big in our world. And so, you know, in health and wellness, fitness, nutrition.

I mean, it's... You know, I've been doing this for 30 years just as an athlete. So I've gotten to know everybody.

I mean, if we make an investment... These are just examples. But if we make an investment in a company like Amphuman and they need...

And it'd be very obvious that they'd be connected to Strava and vice versa, it would take them a month to get a call. I think you're different, though. Well, thank you, Sam.

Well, that's your value. Well, that's our value. Everyone knows that you know everyone.

I mean, you're a celebrity. Like, you could get in touch with everyone. But, like, if, you know, I'm an investor, you're an investor, it's like, they don't know who I know.

Yeah. And I probably don't know that many people who they can't just cold email. Yeah.

Do you know what I mean? Yeah, you need it to be unique. Is that what your angle is going to be?

Is that you have... There's that. And we call it...

I mean, we refer to it as the flywheel just because, you know, now the one show, the second show, The Move, is about 15 million downloads a year. And so, you know, once that started to really take off, then I was getting all this interesting deal flow. I thought to myself, we should just start a fund and invest in some of these companies.

And then what happens when we reintegrate or occasionally integrate some of our companies back into that audience, right? That core sticky group of 15 million people. And so that's what...

Here's Neil. That's what we bring to it. They'll get it.

Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, there is the connections.

There is the flywheel. There's the audience. And then we've got a pretty kick-ass advisory board that we pull into, whether it's, you know, researching deal flow or sitting on boards.

There is the balance. So... There is the tri시죠 between the Americans, the daughters and the iPhone��, and the others.

There is the Motion One. There is the case. There is going to be able to make them all the way.

There is theСТ Unai One. Where is the journée One. Theilahاس In themap In the地 One.
