why are we going to bail out the airline companies when they're doing all these stock buybacks yeah it's about boys said that and so i was yeah moise ali was saying that and i said what's up with these stock buybacks and so i went pretty deep on understanding you know what what are these buybacks because i only knew at a surface level pretty interesting to me so let me talk a little bit about what's going on here so um stock buybacks started basically at the great depression so 1928 uh the depression happened stock prices start crashing for a bunch of the companies and the companies realize hey normally when we want our stock price to go up we got to generate more revenue more customers more profits but with the great depression happening those are going down so our stock is dropping and then the way that our stock is measured revenue profits etc is going to get worse and it's just going to cause a cycle we're just going to keep keeping keep crashing so somebody very smart decided oh i know what i can do if i want the demand for my stock to go up i should just limit the supply how do i do that well what if i just use the cash we have and rather than investing it in our business to you know grow or do more marketing or whatever i'm going to um just buy back shares so they started buying back shares and they bought back shares and then all of a sudden the there's less shares available on the market and the price started to buffer and price started to go up and so uh this became like immediately the the sort of silver bullet solution that companies were using to sort of survive in the great depression now this is actually a technique that joseph kennedy did with uh there used to be a cab company called hertz which is now the car company and this is exactly what he did uh the founder of hertz said joe i need you to lock you he was young and he goes he was willing to break the rules he goes i need you to lock yourself in this hotel room up in new york and i need you to do a lot of these buybacks so it appears as though we are a lot bigger than we are and then once people start buying them back sell them our stuff and you're going to save us right exactly and uh you they just need to reverse the momentum and the appearance that hey this company's doing well in spite of everything else and so when there's a you know when the economy is crashing people fly towards safety so there's a flight to safe safe havens and so if your stock is going up people will view that as a safe haven and so anyways this happens for a few years happens for six years and then they put a stop to it so the government comes out says hey wait this is sort of an artificial way to pump your stock price and we don't like it we don't think it's a good thing you're just buying they're basically buying the management stock itself so the management would sell the stock using the company's own money so the executive management would get rich and the stock price would go up and so the executive management keeps their jobs so it was a double win so 1934 this stops and it stops for about i don't know 50 years 50 years there's basically no stock buybacks in the stock market now 1982 comes around you have reagan as the president and um there's this guy john shadd and i don't know exactly what his deal was but um but they decided that hey you know what um we should they changed they wrote a new law which allowed uh stock buybacks back uh back into play um companies should be able to do this and the theory was hey here's what will happen when a company buys back its uh shares um they can use you know they can use uh some of that a little step back a company could use its cash to do three things at any given time they can give it to the employees and raise their wages they can invest in growth hire new employees or invest in machines and whatnot or they can issue a dividend to investors and um that's the sort of buyback route and so what ended up happening was reagan writes this law in the past so 1982 buybacks are back after 50 years and the second change that happened was that ceo started getting um compensated not on salary but also based off of bonuses for the share price so now the ceo is also incentivized to buffer the the sale the stock price and so you go from in 1982 half a percent of profits were spent on buybacks before this law 2008 77 percent of profits are used for stock buybacks even now it's 65 so 65 percent of profits not going to employee wages not going into investing for growth just announcing uh stock buybacks and you can see that the ceo compensation is sort of skyrocketed as well so it went from the ceo used to make 15 times more than the average employee at their company now it's 220 times more because they're compensated on the stock price and the stock buyback is the easiest way to buffer the stock price and so this has been getting worse and worse and worse 2008 was sort of the peak uh worst time because when the financial crash happened in 2008 companies they pulled their favorite lever to keep their stock price high or from plummeting further and so uh recently trump cut the corporate tax from 37 to 21 and the idea again was like all right great if we don't tax the companies they'll use that money to give higher wages to reinvest in the business and they did a study they saw that it's been a year and a half since that tax cut and uh wages have gone up 1.2 percent only but there's been one trillion dollars of stock buybacks announced since then and so clearly the the reason the company has asked for the tax cut is not why they did this and um what do you think is going to happen so i think what's going to happen is um now there's a there's a problem right so these companies like the airline industry right so i have this graph um that we can show on the screen for people who watch this on instagram or on the youtube channel for the hustle uh which by the way for some reason nobody watches on youtube even though it's much better we cut the clips of just the good parts and you see the video you see the graphs so i don't know why nobody's watching but they should the podcast gets way more listens than that um but anyways there's this graph that shows okay if you look at like international companies outside the u.s where you know like volkswagen or whatever they'll have like zero percent stock buybacks if you look in the u.s some of the corporations like united 80 percent of profits went to uh to uh stock buybacks southwest 66 delta 50 of profits being used on this so now these companies they don't have cash anymore because they bought back their own worthless shares so they they ran out of cash because they were buying back their shares to pump their price and now they can't do it because the whole economy is crashing so now they can't get their way out of that and they don't have the cash to withstand this so they're going to go to the government and say hey we're all out of cash don't let us fail but should we reward that because you used all your cash to buy back stock to make yourself rich for the last five years which by the way we know how this is going to end yeah you're going to get bailed out and they're going to do the same thing sadly it's yeah this is it i didn't know i didn't know about a lot of that um so there's our clip uh so there's our clip so so you
