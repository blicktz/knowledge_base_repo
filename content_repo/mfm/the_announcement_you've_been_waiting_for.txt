When you are home alone a podcast can become a tragedy. Hi, I'm Sean Puri and I'm here to talk to you today about a condition that is affecting millions of men and women across the country. Podpod.

Podpod is a disease that turns fit people into mush due to the never-ending stream of podcasts that they listen to. If you've never seen it, I must warn you, these images are disturbing. If you thought COVID was bad, buckle up.

Doctors warned us that Athletic Greens does not cure Podpod. Help, I've fallen and I can't get up. Even those listening to podcasts while walking are not safe.

I've fallen in the park and I can't get up. But don't worry, help is on the way. And as the host of My First Million, I admit, I'm part of the problem.

500 episodes, 50 million downloads. I'm basically a crack dealer for ambitious men with strong Wi-Fi. But today, that changes.

This weekend, no podcasts. My First Million proudly presents My First Muscle. A fitness challenge for people who are fitness challenged.

My First Muscle is simple. 100 push-ups, 100 air squats, and 100 burpees. 100 times 100 times 100.

That's the real First Million. So whether you're built like a French baguette, or you're the greatest physical specimen I've ever seen, anyone can enter. Just start the clock, post your time, and may the fastest nerd win.

So if you or a loved one is suffering from Podpod, please share this video. Tell a friend. Save a life.
