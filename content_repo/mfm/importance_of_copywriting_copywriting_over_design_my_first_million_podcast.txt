um okay yeah let's talk about agora okay you want to hear about agora okay so agora is is what it's a b2b paid newsletter company uh yeah that has absurd revenue go to my twitter account okay so here's another interesting company i know this because i'm in this world and it's directly related to us yeah just yeah the sam par yeah whatever that's fine um okay so agora crazy interesting background so agora was started by this guy named bill bonner in the 1970s he was a publisher he had a a magazine um about money and investing and things like that and then he decided to start uh changing how he did his marketing and he created a newsletter that became quite popular um at this point uh it you'll see it it's the most popular one no up higher at this point they make it's rumored to be one and a half to two billion dollars a year and the way that they do this there it is they own 20 to 40 different newsletter publishers and what they do is is they buy a ton of traffic to their funnels their marketing funnels and right off the bat they'll sell you a 50 product right and once you buy that 50 product they now have a large database and email list of qualified buyers who are interested in a particular topic and they typically lose money on this first purchase so let's say that they have a book that's 50 bucks they'll spend up to 200 to acquire you meaning they'll buy a ton of ads and they'll lose money on you but they'll make it up because on the they call it a back end on the back end they sell you a two thousand dollar paid newsletter and this company in particular they even sell supplements and shit now some people think that they some people love them and when you own 20 or 40 different brands you're going to have some legitimately great products right so what's their best product um moneymatpress.com or yeah moneymatpress so this is for hedge funds for financial traders no um yes some financial traders their their typical audience is white men between 50 and 70 who who who are conservative and believe in like the government's going to come and like take your money um i mean that goes like so i signed up some of their funnels and there was shit like if you go to breitbart.com you'll see an ad that says like nancy pelosi's coming for your money and things like that and you sign up takes you through one of the agora funnels uh-huh and it's a five dollar book and then yeah and then you'll you'll go through these funnels if now let's just get rid of the whole unethical part because you can learn from everyone who cares if it's unethical or ethical it's fascinating regardless and you can learn from it what they're experts at is copywriting and everyone in silicon valley not everyone but you know you get the point it's all about design it's got to look good it's got to be aesthetic their websites are a blank page with text right not just text but like fucking 5 000 words and a buy now button at the very bottom it's crazy fascinating that is fascinating and i think you're you know you know that peter teal quote where it's like what's something you believe to be true that few would agree with you on yeah i feel like you know you might have many but one of them would be copywriting over design any day copywriting over design 100% most people i remember when i learned the word copywriting because i was like what does what does what is copy why does everyone keep saying this and like i literally was at work and people like hey can you give me some copy i was like coffee what did she just ask me to go get a coffee for her like i had no idea what the fuck she was talking about and uh and then i sort of learned oh copy means text that's going to go on the website and then through you i realized hey wait a minute the text that's on your website is essentially your salesman and sales gives you the money i should probably learn how to do this and then i went deep on it it's the most important skill you can learn because i've spent years learning it if you just give me a blank page i will i will make money till i die right i will always have a job because i can do that right now what i could do is do really unethical shit and scam a lot of people really easily but if you know how to copyright do or you know how to persuade via the written word yeah i would say persuasion is the most important skill whether it's through the written word verbally um you know i don't know if there's some other yeah but copyright variation copywriting just the form in which you learn it now the way that i describe it is if you're a good copywriter you understand what motivates people and if you understand what motivates people you can create products that they'll want that will appeal to people yeah and then if you are that is that's the when you do copywriting you just learn what motivates people and then you just happen to use the written word to right communicate yeah uh when when you mentioned the boron letters and then i just went deep on that that was like my foray into this so we'll do a whole section on did you read the copyright yes and then i started like doing all the things in it uh because i got obsessed so the boron letters if anyone's curious gary halbert is his name he's dead now he died of a heart it's actually kind of hard to find it's hard to find but there's there's one link and if you get to it it's like chapter one two three and it goes to 19 or whatever it's this copywriter who's one of the best copywriters of all time and what he would do is he was such a good copywriter that he kind of turned into a crook and so he would write these sales letters to buy like encyclopedias or and buy like fucking anything just shit so the boron letters are the way it starts it's like he's writing to his son he's in jail he's in jail writing to his son and he doesn't start off by being like here's how you copyright he's just writing to his son and it's one by one and each one's a teaser every sentence teases the next sentence and every letter teases the next letter and then by the time you get 20 deep you're like this guy's a master it is awesome you
