so i'm basically putting together a report of the coolest companies in india that don't have analogs here um like for example there's this company called biju have you ever heard of biju b-y-j-u b-y-j-u yeah this guy basically started off as a teacher and he would teach like essentially test prep oh you freaking love this i think i've told you about this before but basically this yeah you've you you like you say that's your dream is to be yeah this this guy he started off as a small teacher in a town basically and was doing test prep and then sort of got bigger and bigger and bigger people wanted to learn from him to the point where he was selling out stadiums of people coming to watch him teach math and uh that was when i saw the picture of the stadium i thought this is remarkable then uh he turned it into an online learning platform a basically a video-based teaching platform sort of like khan academy but for profit and it's eight billion dollar company now and um this guy biju is sort of one of the youngest billionaires in india he's a teacher turned billionaire which is very rare and uh you know cool product cool company and there's actually a company in this yc batch that's trying that's the former first instructor of biju he's like i was the face of biju because he was in all the videos and he left to start his own thing he's like you know here's the dirty secret about biju's thing it has very low retention great at making money great at getting people to sign up but less than 15 of people stick with the course as it goes along we're doing this other way and we're going to win and they're in this batch as well so that's interesting so i would love to ask you questions about that first i want to tell you that i'm looking at their wikipedia it says they do they're worth eight billion dollars they do 80 million in u.s dollars in sales um and then it says they only have five employees yeah that's wrong and also they do more they do more revenue uh recently they were over 100 million i think the last like i read something where they were where they were doing over 100 million but so why is this no way they have five employees that'd be amazing why is this big in india but not america is because indians love math and science i mean yeah so education is like you know god in india like you you can be dirt poor in a village but you'll do anything to educate your kids and uh you know even the sort of indian people in america you probably have noticed are like you know their parents are pretty strict about education you got to get good grades all that stuff and so um indians are willing to pay anything for education and they don't really pay anything for anything else um so you know entertainment is is usually lower on the list although bollywood does well but like on a per capita basis where you're going to spend your money um education is sort of number one for for indians so that's the first part second part is they have such a huge population so you can take a really small amount of money from such a huge number of people and build a very big company that's the second part how much bigger is uh india than america and population three times so yes uh four times i think it's like one i think it's i think it's over one billion and us is at 300 million i believe um so it'd be like about four times and um and of course not all those people have smartphones not all those people have money but like you know it's it's india has like sort of the largest growing middle class so that's some of the reason why this works um is because people are willing to pay for education and there's so many people that if you take a few bucks from each and everybody's willing to pay for this because it's education that adds up um but you know eight billion is sort of out it it is outpacing their revenue growth right so i think the part of it is the story of what this becomes and their sort of defensibility that's probably why they're valued so much higher than their value than their revenue would suggest do you think that that that can be popular in america oh i think so like i think khan academy is fairly popular and it's mostly in america no money though it's just yeah it's a non-profit and they don't pour money into growth like these guys do i'm sure these guys are aggressively trying to grow and using their payback to to sort of fund more growth um but yeah i do think like something like this can work here um but you know we'll see there might be other reasons why it doesn't you you you you you you you
