this guy's story is kind of amazing so this is basically a farmer billionaire love it and in okay let me give you this one this is kind of a crazy story so do the words John Bragg mean anything to you no they don't mean anything to me either shout out to uh Shane Parrish over at Farnham Street he did a great podcast with this guy that caught my attention um this guy's story is kind of amazing so this is basically a farmer billionaire love it and in like there was only two sources for this Farnham Street and the Van Trump report had written about this guy there's only things I could find yeah he's got a biography as well but um all right so so here's this guy's story I just think there's there's a bunch of factoids about this guy that I just think you're gonna love you're gonna love this guy's whole aura his vibe he is the Billy of the music a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars John Bragg this guy grows up on a family farm like a sawmill or something like that and when he's in high school you know what do teenagers do they start to experiment they start to dabble maybe a little bit of maybe girls maybe weed no no blueberries he tries to harvest blueberries for the first time at 13 14 years old you know he starts to he gets the itch and then he goes to a local blueberry farmer he decides hey can I pick blueberries for you and he picks blueberries all year his last year of high school him and four or five other blueberry pickers end up making four thousand dollars each picking blueberries which was a lot of money at the time because this guy's very old and he realizes oh wait I can pay for college if I just pick blueberries every year and so he's making a college like 10 or 12 grand he's making four grand he realizes oh I can do this my parents otherwise weren't really gonna be able to send me but I could do this and so he makes more money the next year in the next year picking blueberries finally when he graduates he's got a couple options on the table uh you know plan a was going to be to become a teacher and he was going to make I think like thirty eight hundred dollars or something like that big a teacher extra hundred bucks if he coaches like the the the basketball team or something and plan B was let me go work on the family business maybe over time buy out my dad on the sawmill but he decides to go plan C he's like I think this blueberry thing there's something to it and he decides to start his own blueberry farm so he buys a little piece of land and he starts trying to harvest blueberries and it goes pretty well the first couple of years he's doing all right but a couple years in he there's a problem in the blueberry uh industry which is that one year there was just huge supply glut so there was way too many blueberries not enough buyers and um prices crashed and so he's like shit you know could have quit but he's like no no I'm just gonna figure out what I should have done differently he's like I need uh basically like a backup plan a sort of you know an insurance and he wasn't doing financial insurance but he's like I need another way to make money in case this ever happens again never again will I let this happen to be where I'm at the mercy of the prices and so he decides I think I need to build a packaging and freezing plant for blueberries now he's got no money but he's like uh I'm gonna try to do this so he goes to the other blueberry farmers he says hey guys we all just got whipped let's put some money in together and I'm gonna build this plant and then you can use the plant too you could freeze and package your stuff too if it ever if we ever have oversupply and so they do that he borrows money from the bank he gets money with other farmers he starts to build this thing never no experience by the way no manufacturing no factory experience but he's like I can do this so he builds this plant and in the first year that they build the plant he's ready for two million uh like a capacity of two million but they only produce a hundred thousand because there's this crazy frost that kills all the blueberry production that year and he's like oh my god I owe so much money and I and like we came in at like five percent of the like the estimated like freezing capacity this is terrible I have this empty factory now I owe a lot of money and basically it's like dude you gotta just let this go declare bankruptcy move on with your life instead he calls another guy uh who he knows guy uh McCain and he's like McCain he's like yo what's something you need to make but you don't want to make is there anything give me the the last thing you want to do but ah you should do it and the guy's like all right I got you onion rings he's like onion rings okay he's like I he's like can you send me like a file like about so he gets like a little book on how to make onion rings and he's like all right say less I'm never gonna ask you another question I will figure this out from here and so he he's got an empty factory but he turns it into like just for that one season or whatever he makes onion rings for this guy it just tides him over enough to continue and so he carries on and he ends up building something called Oxford Frozen Foods which today controls about 40 to 50 percent of the global supply of blueberries it's like 70 million pounds of blueberries they're making every year do they still have uh onion rings and blueberries and onion rings and mozzarella sticks on their website you never forget you never forget who got you there and so he builds this absolute juggernaut over time and they become bigger and bigger and bigger his brother invents this like blueberry picker that do the work of 35 like humans doing this and he's like oh amazing and then what he does is he actually like gives it basically like freely shares it with other blueberry farms too he's like he's like what's good for one is good for all here we go and so he wants the entire blueberry industry to grow because he's like the more the blueberry industry grows the better we all do I don't want to be the biggest fish in the smallest pond I want the pond to get bigger and we're competing with all the other fruits out there so if we can up our production and we can have more blueberries we can build more innovative products it's gonna be good for everybody and so he's got this very interesting business philosophy he ends up then going in to a new business so it's um many years later uh actually I actually I think he kind of did this around the same time I shouldn't say many years later I don't know the exact date on this but it wasn't like once he is already like huge it was like somewhere somewhere around the same time um TV was picking up and cable cable TV was picking up and this guy's from Nova Scotia population 9 000 and so they held a like an auction they were like hey all right who wants to buy the cable TV rights for Nova Scotia nobody shows up he's the only guy there and so he picks up the cable TV rights for that area and he's like all right I don't even know what to do with this like I guess I'll put like some old recorded programming on here there's like no programming basically but he's like whatever let's do this and so he's in that business and he's losing money the first couple years and his dad's like bro you got to figure this out like this you can't just keep bleeding money over here and so he cuts his costs he tries to figure this out he finally gets it to like kind of a like a break-even point or whatever he ends up over the next you know couple of decades building the largest private telecom company in the country and he owns cable TV networks you know everywhere he does a bunch of acquisitions he takes on a bunch of debt and he ends up buying up others and he goes down he goes like sort of down uh the stack so whereas most TV companies want to do the sexy fun stuff they get into original programming and content and they're like content is king he's like yeah no yeah you know what's king fiber like I'm gonna go own the underlying infrastructure for for cable TV and he ends up building this juggernaut and so this guy ends up now he's like whatever uh like you know much older now in his 80s or something like that and he's worth a billion dollars he built the largest farm uh fruit farm basically in in the world and he's built the largest largest private telecom company in in the country isn't this kind of amazing this is amazing I've I'm as you're telling me this I'm I've noticed there's a trend amongst this era of people was this was he doing it right when cable was getting started yeah man there's uh there's a trend so Ted Turner who eventually went on to start CNN he owned a billboard company which he parlayed into a radio station and then eventually a cable uh news network CNN cable news network uh do you know another guy named Jim Pattison have you heard of Jim Pattison no who's that dude google Jim Pattison another Canadian guy look at what he looks like he's like oh yeah yeah yeah I've seen this guy before he's like one of the richest guys in Canada right yeah he's like he's like one of these guys who is like he's like an energizer energizer bunny like he like he's like a wind-up toy like he just can't stop like moving but he I think his story was he uh at a young age uh opened up a car dealership and within three years he bought like a plastic manufacturer or something very like out of left field and then another thing and another thing now he owns a telecommunications business but he also owns like Ripley's believe it or not and I think that like the Pattison group which he owns the whole thing I think has a hundred thousand employees or something insane like that and then another one is his name's John Kat his last name is crazy I'm gonna butcher it Kat's mandatitis yes is that it he's got a condition Kat's mandatitis wait do you know him do you know him no so he started a grocery store uh I think it was called apple foods dude let me just tell you this any guy who looks like this if I just showed you this photo and I said rich or poor yeah you already know everything about him just by looking at him one photo yeah like when he this guy when he gives you a handshake he's pulling you in do you know what I mean you can just look at him and you know what he's gonna do he's gonna pull you in he's gonna smack you really hard on the back shoulder yeah uh no chance this guy has one wife by the way let me look this up I bet you I'll bet you anything right now let's just Wikipedia if you google his kids they're beautiful first wife divorce yeah new wife Margo uh this guy started um apple grocery store it's like a 20 what it's a 20 store chain in New York City like it's it's tiny but then he bought a radio station and then uh that's like how he got extra rich and then I think he also bought a cable news network as well and so my point being is there's a refining company and then he owns a energy company like an airline he I think he owns like a small private airline he owns everything there's this type of entrepreneur where they're kind of cowboys where they start in one thing and they get into media eventually and a lot of it happened in the 80s the late 70s in the early 80s when cable was getting popular uh and it was sort of like uh the first version of uh of a of a SaaS business you know it was um uh recurring revenue huge tam uh kind of weird and unknown people weren't sure what to do and I believe that a lot of the cable news networks they were regulated by uh the FCC and you had a certain satellite like you'd only own x amount of satellites like there was some type of like limiting blocker where only a certain amount of cable companies could even exist and so if you were able to like get in on that it was almost a near monopoly Ted Turner came along and he was one of the first guys that were like uh petitioned to Congress and was like this is nonsense we need more competition and that's when CNN came about but this whole era like I like how sometimes when we explain these things it's kind of like when I explain stuff to my kids like they're like how does um like how does the picture come on the TV like where is this coming from and I'm like oh um satellites and they and they're like but how does it get from a satellite to our TV I'm like it shoots it it's like it's a video it's shooting Gabby dollhouse at our at that tower I think I think that's what the cables are for or maybe that's electricity I'm not sure exactly what's going on it doesn't matter though just go back but you're like they ran there's only so many satellites you had to buy these letters but they only had so many letters no letters okay I do know that it is true like spectrum available there's like a yeah yeah we know a lot about spectrums uh there was I do I do know there was a famous like um like hearing where Ted Turner like made this passionate speech to like politicians to convince them that they have to change the rules to allow small upstarts to to get a satellite uh but anyway that's cool I like this blueberry guy all right so a lot of people will talk about how you need a million dollars and three years of experience to start a business nonsense if you listen to at least one episode on this podcast you know that is completely not true my last company the hustle we grew it to something like 17 or 18 million dollars in revenue I started it with like 300 my current company Hampton does over 10 million in revenue started it with actually no money maybe 29 or something like that nothing and so you don't actually need investors to start a company you don't need a fancy business plan but what you do need is systems that actually work and so my old company the hustle they put together five proven business models that you could start right now today with under a thousand dollars these are models that if you do it correctly it can make money this week you can get it right now you can scan the qr code or click the link in the description now back to the show let me give you some of his uh his little business isms his philosophies okay so and this is again some of this from uh from from Shane Parrish's stuff and dude I can just tell this guy is he Canadians are in midwestern people where I'm from they're the same the same people aren't they yeah it's like it's a species in its own so here's a great line by him I have no reverse gear I just thought that's an amazing line um which is like he's like yeah you know when things got hard and the blueberry crop died and then the factory is empty like I just didn't consider going backwards I did not consider like it was just not a gear I have to either stop or reverse course like I just decided I have to find a way through and the onion rings are the way through um another thing that I thought was interesting which was kind of counter to conventional advice so you know most people who are in uh the business the game of business buffet and all the real estate guys the famous phrase they all say is you make your money on the buy you don't make your money when you sell if you buy it right then you're gonna make money dude I read that line like after I bought three real estate projects that I totally lost money on I was like shit I I'm being serious like I it's not like the fine print by the way this is this is like the first thing you learn like I was like reading a Warren Buffett book and I read that quote and I remember thinking like that was literally the exact opposite of what I thought it was doing the John Bragg so here's John Bragg's philosophy intentionally overpay what okay I'm in so he goes he goes early on I intentionally overpaid for acquisitions and word spread fast if you want to sell sell to John Bragg you'll get a fair price quick close no games which I love that like if I'm I'm gonna put that on my uh on our like little mini private equity shop uh website I feel like he said that advice typically isn't right though well typically not so here's the caveats here's the caveats of you know they say like you know the amateurs learn the rules or the amateurs don't know the rules professionals know the rules and then masters know when to break the rules or whatever that thing is this is kind of when to break it so he goes I will overpay as long as it's something that's only available once because when opportunities are scarce you need to pay what it takes I know many people who tried to nickel and dime and then spent the rest of their life regretting not getting that key asset so I think in the in the in the realm of buying the TV rights when there's only good they're only gonna be up once and whoever gets it's gonna own it um those are that's like a time to overpay um or if it's a key asset that locks down you know a certain competitive advantage don't quibble on price in fact come in over so that you make sure you secure that asset and you develop a reputation he he said something like you can't buy a reputation I was like I think that actually what you're saying is you can buy a reputation it's like oh but here's the reputation I will overpay right like it's like SoftBank and the venture game right now it's like oh you you want a bunch of money and that a huge crazy valuation you go to SoftBank first right and there's actually like some merit to that strategy when you have this like you know this this if you can get the things that have huge upside so was he uh like an M&A guy like or yeah it was a lot of building the empire through M&A and what was he buying other cable companies or other farms both here's another banger of a line so he has 40 to 50 percent of the global supply and about half of that is like stuff that he owns and operates his farms and half his farms he's buying or owns like a you know big stake in and he's he goes here's the exact line he goes we don't want to have 100 of the interest industry that that wouldn't be good politics dude that's like imagine having the choice to have 100 market share and they're like that's that's not polite what a baller here's uh here's some Sam porn for you so focus is absolutely critical probably the biggest single principle you can have in business here's a big mistake people make they make their first million and they think now I can succeed in any business even ones I know nothing about I've been there Sam Sam buying the ranch um yeah and then there and then he goes I just wanted to he goes I wanted to just stick to my knitting figure out what I could do well and then just do more of it um you know everybody else who came into this industry wanted to make a buck I was this young guy who said I'm here to play this game for a long long time this guy's awesome this guy's awesome right I think it's my uncle then he goes uh here's a couple other great great quotes the guy who asked the question to me looks better than the guy who knows the answers I like that done did you get all this from Shane's podcast with him uh Shane's and then there's like a couple other people that have written about him but a lot of this from Shane's podcast which I didn't even get to watch because I was doing the like I discovered this guy this morning it was like on my list of like things to check out and as soon as I checked out I was like oh man this is amazing I gotta I gotta go watch this later so I've actually only like skimmed the transcript and stuff for this um so I might be getting some of the details wrong a couple other things he's one of these like Buffett types where it's like he's a billionaire but the vast majority of wealth came like after the age of 70 so it's like you know just saying the same way for Buffett where they just they keep compounding um he had some other things that I thought were pretty interesting so I would have thought he'd be richer if you own all half the blueberries in the world wouldn't you be richer than 1.5 billion yeah punk yeah weak shit he better be a huge like philanthropist and have given it a lot away uh because I definitely would have thought he'd be richer right I mean I guess I don't know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna knock him um all right so he believes in Buffett a lot he loves Buffett and so he Buffett has this great quote which is I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor yeah so at age 70 he was worth you know hundreds of millions of dollars so he goes to each of the executives at his companies and he says today you're just businessmen you're not investors he gives them 10 million dollars each not as a bonus but as an investment portfolio that they get to run and he said I want them to see how strong companies operate and how weak ones fail there was no penalty for losing the money and no bonus for the gains it was pure education and isn't that like pretty wild to do so he gave uh how many managers did he have I don't know six teams so 60 million bucks he gave them what like a stock portfolio or or he paid them 10 million dollars and told them dollars to go invest go buy businesses oh within the their portfolio sure wow okay that's badass that's crazy and this was at age 70 and then he's like most people stop learning once once they become successful but the outliers never stop being students love that uh resonate with me all right what else resonated with me let me give you one more how about the fact that like I just googled I googled the Shane podcast Shane went to his office uh which is really cool and he's 84 years old doing a podcast like that's that's amazing that he's with it and he's sharp and he's had this pod dude when I'm 84 I'm gonna be in the metaverse I'm gonna be so just like plugged into what everybody's doing in the future I hope all right you want to do one or you want me to go have you read about United Fruit if we're gonna talk about fruits haven't you read about United Fruit is that the Banana King guy man that's a great book I'm in the middle of reading it and it's the story of United Fruit which is uh basically centered around bananas so like you want to do the quick story I think we've talked about it before but it's it's on theme it's on trend in the uh late 1800s I think bananas were discovered I think in Nicaragua or somewhere in Central America and they brought them to America Americans were like yeah we we want every banana we can get our hands on we love it uh it even got to the point where like I think in the 1920s when immigrants would land at Ellis Island we gave them a banana and that was like you're here now this is this American thing and it's sort of American because when you get to Hawaii and they give you the lay and yeah it was like a banana and this the banana company United Fruit it became so big that it was basically a monopoly and they did the same thing where they tried to hide that they weren't a monopoly for years and years and years and Sam the banana man I think his name's Samuel Zamuri he was I think a Ukrainian immigrant and he started out like uh with a fruit cart like walking the streets and his whole thing was he would sell ripes and so the way it worked is a banana train would start in one part of the country I believe Louisiana and it would slowly make its way up over seven or eight days to the northern part of America and along the way it would drop off at bananas at different markets and his whole shtick was uh he was going to sell ripes meaning bananas that were already becoming a little bit brown that they previously thought were uh throwaway bananas and he was like oh I'll buy them for a fraction of the price and I'll just be really fast at getting them to where they need to go and he eventually becomes so big that by the time he's in his 60s he he takes over United Fruit and it's a big well he starts with 150 dollars and by the time he's 21 he's got a hundred thousand dollars and this is way back in the day right so this is like a lot that's a lot of money and he keeps on going and it gets to be and that's you're saying he's basically he starts as just like a dude on the dock or whatever like a dude on the side of the road taking their discarded trash and going and hustling and selling it and by the time he reaches his peak he buys the he buys the whole company yeah where he was initially just like taking their discarded trash and the book is called the fish that ate the whale because he was the fish and he eventually ate the whale but it gets even crazier so sam those the murray he has a lot of admirable qualities you know he's this like hard-working immigrant he's pretty quiet uh and he's like a stoic guy but he's kind of a warlord uh because because uh at one point uh Nicaragua like they have like some type of meltdown and a new president or dictator comes in charge and they won't sell them bananas and so he funds a coup so he basically gets like a small unit of like 10 or 20 people to like help this other guy assassinate the current leader and take over and that leader was like all right thanks for getting our back now you could have some more bananas and uh so that's kind of like the story of samuel zamuri it's pretty badass got that killer instinct let's go um yeah that's this is it's pretty wild right like imagine a story like that today is there such a thing uh i can't think of uh i mean what elon does in rockets is like pretty like you're kind of like dominating another planet like potentially i mean that's like pretty crazy of like the republican party this year like going to the point of like actual like funding a militia i guess like donald trump is doing this like where he's like for shits and giggles i'm gonna like play a joke and run for president and just kind of starts to work uh but yeah i mean it's a pretty crazy story um yeah so it's been great so i did something this weekend and i thought about you and i've been holding this in me like waiting to like talk to you about this but like like a man in lent or or or uh november holding it in yeah oh man uh yeah if you know you know uh so i saw a broadway play for the first time ever this weekend phenomenal wow phenomenal uh it's called oh mary it's basically about uh mary todd who was lincoln's wife and it's just like a comedy it's it was fantastic never been to a never really been to a play honestly my whole life because you judged it or just happened to not go what's the deal yeah i don't know like you know it just went on the list of things to do it just didn't it just didn't it didn't make its way into my life and i finally went the first thing is i thought of you because you had made an offhanded comment a while ago that you cared about like writing a writing a show yeah i just thought it'd be cool i went and saw one and i was like oh that would be kind of a fun fun thing to work on yeah so you had the same thing i did which is like it was like a new art form that you hadn't previously experienced and then you go to it and you're like i understand the appeal now is that right yeah yeah i had gone to a bunch when i was a kid and so i think i liked it from that like i was a theater kid when i grew up so i liked it now how's it related to this podcast well for one if you google oh mary revenue you can see there's a website called broadwayworld.com where they estimate um the the revenue of each show i guess they look at like if they're selling out and uh the average ticket price online and this thing oh mary i think it's been live uh for june of 24 it came out and it's been making a million dollars a week so it's doing quite well and it started off with about four million dollars in funding to to get going and it all reminded me of this podcast that we did about two and a half years ago you you didn't make it but we had this guy named michael harris did you ever look into who michael harris was what was a death row which which record label was he the the guy yes yeah so the short of it is uh some people call him hario because his name's michael uh michael harris they call him hario like harry og gangster so harry was famous because in his early 20s he was basically a drug kingpin and he made a lot of money uh selling cocaine and at one point in the podcast with him i said yeah and i was trying to be nice i was like you know i instead of saying you are a drug dealer i said i read an article saying that the article said that you were selling one million yeah the article said you were selling one million dollars a day in cocaine and he goes i think that article said two million dollars a day uh he's like i told that journalist it was two i was like yes sir uh and eventually at the age of like 32 i think he gets sentenced to life in prison one for attempted murder one for a drug conspiracy which basically is like the rico kingpin law and he had a life sentence and recently i think like 10 years ago trump commuted his sentence and that's how he got out of prison and when he was 32 years old he founded death row records with dr dre and suge knight while he was serving a life sentence in san quinn and that's like how death row got started and one of the reasons why it's called death row is because he was they co-founded it with him while he was in prison and what did they would they want from what was he able to offer them while he was in prison for life money money so his wife his wife was on the outside okay uh and she somehow had funds to fund death road records you know right now how's this relate to broadway well on the podcast that i did with him he said something that i didn't pounce on because i wasn't i didn't know anything about it but he made this comment to me where when he was 29 i think he was the first ever black producer of a broadway musical or broadway show and he kind of told the story but basically somehow he got in cahoots you know he was he was considered uh like well known for being like a drug guy and i hope you said cahoots to him right after i said okay okay he's like how do you end the podcast which button ends this podcast i was like holy moly uh harry oh you dog holy moly harry so somehow he got in the loop with this but he funded denzel washington and early denzel washington his first ever play damn michael harris harry oh was the fund he was the investor that funded this show with a million dollars i think this was in 93 or 92 when denzel he was just getting going and he starts telling this story and while uh while i was at this play i was like holy crap this guy got his way into being the first ever producer of broadway like while i was there i'm like oh my god like he was so much cooler than i even realized if i invested in denzel before he became denzel that's like you know you know how jason calicanis is like i was saying he's the fourth investor at uber i would never shut up about it google um michael harris denzel washington you'll see a photo of them together and michael harris looks like a like a well-to-do guy he's wearing a suit turns out he was only i think 29 or 28 in these photos and he was a drug kingpin kind of amazing right yeah that's that's incredible when he was 26 uh 26 or something was he 26 like i think he was pretty young very young and like allegedly had made something like 100 million dollars selling drugs pretty crazy and when i was like sitting there in this play i was like obviously what do you and i do when we do everything we go to the play and you type in like oh mary revenue on google and i started seeing the numbers and i'm like it's like the play is going on in front of you you're turned around counting how many seats are in the upper bleachers and they're like are you watching the show what are you doing here and this is how i remembered uh michael harris saying that where it all like clicked together where i was like oh my god do you know how much revenue these shows generate i'm looking at it's it's astounding it's astounding the number one this i'm just going to give you the top top five top five highest grossing broadway musicals of all time you have number one lion king grossed over two billion and just crazy just the ticket sales wicked 1.7 billion phantom of the opera 1.3 hamilton which is newer already crossed a billion insane right and of course our guys from south park are they number one they're number five book of mormon number five 850 million dollars on their side that could be us dude it could be us we just need to be talented and hardworking they are missing they are so talented when i was at the show i was like this it's just they're oozing with talent one of the guys um abe lincoln the character was played by uh what's the guy from silicon valley kunal is uh is that his name oh he's in the play yeah he's in the play and it's like it was like famous actors and actresses were like in the plays he's like a jacked indian abe lincoln like what do you mean he played ape lincoln it sounds crazy and honestly it is crazy the guy who played mary todd uh was a was a guy uh so like it's all types of crazy yeah there's a it's a it's a whole thing uh but i just had to like nerd out with you about this so i looked into this pretty hardcore um so it's definitely a like outlier hits business just like it's angel investing yeah it's angel investing because uh and then i was looking at the venues i was like should i own the best venue in san francisco like can i go buy the san francisco like you know i forgot what it's called like the the theater or the opera house whatever there's like a bunch of there's like three or four different um theaters for this and i was looking at them because the theaters make money either way because the shows have to pay rent they got to be like hey we want to do 60 days on stage like great take your money right whether that show becomes a hit or not they paid the money up front so i thought that was kind of interesting then i was looking at the shows i was looking at how much it costs to produce the shows uh because i just seen the one about lehman brothers which i recommend by the way it's like a it's too long first of all it's way too long it's like dude the one that i went to we only went to it because it was 90 minutes i can't sit there for more than 90 minutes yeah less is more guys uh less is more here in the theater but um but it was great and it was bit of it was business entertainment which is what i considered to be my genre and i was like damn if they could take i wasn't even interested in learning about the lehman brothers if they took an uninteresting subject to me but they made it great and i remember the story because of it this is cool this is a really cool format and so yeah i'm definitely uh definitely interested in that if somebody actually knows how to do these things i would love to uh to talk to you email me maybe we can make something make something we were a story in mind but we had um tim ferris on the pod and like the top comment on youtube was like rich guys finally discover board games and like and like that's what i paid attention to the rich guys part i was like yeah hell yeah thank you not no this one's gonna be like the bros discover plays uh like like sam they were singing in the middle of that you're talking one second then they're singing it's incredible it's all part of the story all right i got one more uh cool business story for you so i'm watching a lot of sports lately i don't know it's like everything's kicking out like football season just kicked off tennis was awesome um by the way did you see the have you been following do you follow tennis you follow a little bit like i went last year and like i kind of watched a little bit on tv the the russian gal she's she's an athlete man she's a freak what's her name sabalinka i think she looks like a terminator so i follow uh i've i've gone in and out of tennis right there's many years where i won't even pay attention then there's like oh my god nadal he's amazing and i'm watching these guys and the a great tennis match is up there it's like very thrilling to watch a great tennis match it's like a great ufc fight like there's some sports where um you know the median game is like really good i put like you know nfl in that category but then there's some sports where just the peak is just like peak drama right boxing and ufc are like that we're like the average thing's not that good but the peak the biggest personality is when it's all on the line and it's just two guys going in there and they're trying to take each other's head off like it's hard for a basketball game to match that okay so tennis um tennis is kind of up there in that sense so there's the new the new wave uh of tennis players so this guy alcaraz and um this guy sinner did that happen did the men's final happen it just happened yeah and so um so i really wanted sinner to win because i just like went down the rabbit hole of this guy's youtube highlights and he's unreal and um and the other guy is also unreal but he's he's he's unreal when it's in the sense of like um you know a guy who just like does all the right things it's like he eats right he works out right like he just does it he just like prepares really hard he's very talented he's maximizing his potential he's not like uh there's not a lot of like flaws to like attach with there you know there's not a lot of like it's like oh so you work hard and do all the right things great yeah that's fantastic um in fact they showed the warm-up right before because i think trump showed up at the us open so it was delayed like half an hour or an hour or something like that and so the guys were just in their locker room like supposed to be warming up and alcaraz is like you know doing a side plank in midair with his trainer and like activating his core to get ready and the other guy was playing dodgeball with his trainer and like running around the gym like just throwing balls at each other like two six yeah so i was like i was like i kind of like this other guy um anyways they go out there sinner loses and he just keeps losing to alcaraz he's the he's the he's ranked number one because he beats everybody else but alcaraz has beat him i don't know four out of the five last times that they've faced each other and he's like i and so he had this great quote that i thought like forget tennis this is just like a great like mindset quote so they were talking about like you know hey you know it must be tough you're at the top and then you you're ranked number one but this guy seems to you know you've had some tough matches this guy's got your number a little bit and here's what he said he goes i was very predictable on the court today he changed up his game and the style of how he plays and now it's on me if i want to make changes or not i'm definitely going to work on this you know for example i didn't use a lot of drop shots i didn't do one serve and volley you know you arrive at a point where you're going to play this guy i got to go out of my comfort zone so here's what i'm going to do i need to start playing more unpredictably i might even lose some matches but i'm going to have to do it i'm going to have to make some changes i'm going to have to try to become more unpredictable as a player that's what i have to do to become better at tennis and at the end of the end of the day that's my main goal and i really just love this mindset from the number one ranked guy who's beating everybody else and he's like you know what i'm here but the top of the mountain is still a little higher but this path i'm on doesn't get me to the summit i got to go back down for a bit and i got to find a new trail and that is so hard to do in life it is so hard to go back one of these things where he's like bottom and reinvent yourself he's like i'm gonna i'm gonna learn how to play tennis but i'm really learning how to play the game of life it's like one of those type of moments totally totally like and and to be like i'm gonna lose i'm gonna probably lose some more matches because i'm gonna have to learn this i'm gonna have to experiment with this new style and that's gonna suck but i'm gonna do it and like i've whatever you're doing in life that analogy probably holds for you right now whether it's you as a parent it's you on the book that you're writing it's you at your job it's you and your business like whatever it is i guarantee you there's an element of like if i want to get to the next level what i've been doing doesn't probably get me there and i need to like be willing when the time comes when the when i recognize the moment i need to be willing to go back down the mountain for a little bit and then come back up a new way i uh have you ever heard of this guy named meb gerfluski if you googled him that's a hard name name so no yeah that's a that's a hard last name to google but if you google marathon meb m-e-b you might recognize his face marathon meb m-e-b you see meb i don't recognize this guy he's 50. yeah so i think in 2004 he was the gold medalist in the olympics uh in the marathon for america but he's an immigrant and so when he won it was sort of one of these things where everyone got behind him because he's a nice guy and it was like the american dream type of energy and i think it got to the point where he uh like spoke at obama's a bunch of obama events and and and whatever he's he's a big deal he's uh he's great his brother listens to mfm his brother howie and he reached out to me when he heard that i liked running and i've been friendly with him for a couple years now and this past weekend was this thing in new york called the fifth avenue mile and so they get all these guys these olympian milers and they get them to run one mile down fifth avenue which is basically a huge street and it's slightly shut it down or they shut it down no no no they shut it down it's a big event it's like a huge event and there's tens of thousands of people there and so i went with howie and i got to like be like his like sidekick so in howie who uh he runs a management company who um he originally howie was managing his brother meb now he manages other runners because meb was like can you do can you help me make more money and he was like yeah fine i'll do it and then eventually now he manages i don't know 40 runners or something and a lot of his athletes were running at this race and so i got to be his like assistant basically and he like took me and like i got to meet all these cool people whatever and these guys are flying by the way i think the guy who won ran three minutes and 46 seconds for the mile which is which is crazy and the guy who won what's your mile time dude back in high school a minute slower four minutes and 47 seconds okay ted bundy now what's your mile time now not what's your file time 18 years ago that was not my question uh seven minutes not i mean seven minutes like very like recreationally like average so wait did you run it or you just hung out with howie hell no i didn't run it i was watching i was watching i was just sitting on the sidelines watching and we got to watch these guys run and they look like uh gazelles they look like animals it's like crazy and i was asking him i was like what separates so like because when i was watching the race the winner and the guy who got third they're really close like it doesn't seem very far when you see them but like it's like a second is only it's not that much but it is a lot when you're running and i was like what separates negus the guy who won uh what separates him from from the guy who got last because they kind of look the same they're tall and they're skinny and they look like freaks like what's going on and he was like it's mindset he's like once you get to this level and you're already a nine out of ten what separates the guys that get first versus last in these big races is when they step on the lines they're killers he goes he wants to kill you and he acts like a nice guy but when they when they step there they think i am here to win i'm built to win i am not trying to finish second i'm trying to be the best and i'm trying to win no matter what and i was like well your brother was like a happy-go-lucky guy like he looks like really kind and he was like yeah he is but he would sit down for hours and envision winning the new york marathon and then when he got to the starting line you couldn't talk to him he was an animal he was out to win and i thought that was really fascinating and i'm always finding it fascinating particularly in sports particularly in these uh uh individual sports tennis swimming track and field cycling i think we had lance on and like we talked a little bit about this what separates these the freaks of the freaks what makes you a freak among freaks and it appears as though it is not physical it is absolutely mental yeah yeah uh that's pretty crazy have you heard this um phrase you probably heard it because you're like into running but i i don't don't run i don't do it it's not a it's like motorcycles i just don't get on that um so one of the guys who was filming for us he was talking about this he wants to film this documentary about this woman and she's like this amazing long distance runner i don't know her name you probably do but the point is she he was talking about this phrase called the pain cave yeah we go to the pain cave you go to the pain cave yeah and i was like like not into running but i'll just take that phrase out that was a cool he's like he's like so the pain cave describes like when you're in these like ultra long races 100 mile race or whatever and it's like miles 60 or 70 you hit this just like extreme level of like physical mental spiritual exhaustion and pain and you go to the pain cave and i'm like but what do you mean what does that mean you go to the pain cave he's like you go to the pain cave mentally okay and you basically i mean you probably describe it better than i can but my understanding was you accept that there's going to be this stretch where you're going to be this is between pain you go to the pain cave you know you're there you become comfort you become not comfortable but enough you you become um acclimated to the pain cave and you're able to stay there where others want to quit other and you even want to quit others would quit and then you push through and you end up getting you know to the to the second to the you get your second way and you get out of there and you get get to the end um did i did i butcher the pain cave or did i describe it right no no no and a lot of have you been you visited well i've been on vacation a couple times no i i was training for an ultra before and it was miserable and i hated it and i remember going out for a three-hour run and it just is it's it's horrible it's not a fun experience and like you get to a certain point and what's it's crazy to do a sport or an activity where even if you are winning you go through hell so we had brennan schaub on the on the pod uh who is a former ufc fighter and he said that one time he was fighting on a on a card and the guy who was fighting above him crow cop who was the main guy afterwards brennan uh saw crow cop like on a stretcher and crow cop had just won the championship but crow cop still had gotten hurt and he was sitting on a stretcher holding ice on his head or something like that and he looked horrible like he just got beat up really badly even though he won and crow cop was like giving my thumbs up and brennan was like these animals think that this is winning and that's why i'm not going to be the best it's because even when you win you are beat down and broken and they still are giving you a thumbs up of like yes we did it and that's what separates the winners from the losers is the guys who like are willing to go through the pain cave because in a lot of sports i think it's so fascinating and i honestly i think this way about business or anything really in life that when you win and you get everything you wanted you still have to go through hell and that's kind of fascinating and interesting to me is like the the the mindset of of of these winners who can just eat so much and honestly business is the same way it's not as physical but it's still emotional where even if you think that you're on top of the world or things are going well i don't know if you've experienced this where but where everyone on the outside thinks like oh you're the man you must be killing it i'm like dude it's really really hard and it feels like it's going to fall apart all the time yeah i find that um these phrases like pain cave or whatever there's some there's a lot of power in just having like a label to put on the thing so that when you're feeling it you don't feel like this is this is a bad thing that you don't panic um and you don't feel like it's forever you realize it's like a temporary phenomenon and so i i know that one of the things that people brought up to me is that um this analogy that's been very useful and it's like if you're going to be an entrepreneur um you know intellectually there's going to be these ups and downs if i told you that nobody would be surprised at that idea yet when it's happening you're like oh you got that feeling in your stomach when you're going up and down a roller coaster and it does not feel good and you want it to stop and you don't like it and you think this is bad and then you're like but the thing we talked on the podcast is like you got in line for the roller coaster like what what did you think was going to happen you stood in line you waited you chose this first um you knew this is the nature of roller coasters and that there are no there are no ups without downs and those down ups like you this has to be it's a necessary condition of doing this activity so don't complain and don't be surprised and don't feel like woe is me and don't victimize yourself and don't think this is forever because it's not and so like that's been a very helpful metaphor for people is just remembering like you got in line for the roller coaster baby like you there was going to be ups and downs don't be surprised when they come and a tactical thing that's helped me is i have this slack channel i've told people about it's called highs and lows and anytime there's an extreme high or an extreme low i go immediately i put it in that channel and i put my exec team in there as well and the beautiful thing about it is when you go in there you see something from like four to six months ago that was like an extreme low in the moment or an extreme high in the moment and now it has like no effect you're like yeah obviously if it was a low it's like obviously we survived it was fine and even if it was a high it was like doesn't have that same pull and so it keeps you from in this moment going too high and too low because you could just scroll back and see all the other moments that in the heat of the moment you thought were such a you know such an extreme and now are like whatever you know just random random things in the past how often you're adding stuff to that all right so last one was four months ago and it was oh cool trump just tariffed all of our goods 150 so like imagine a thing used to cost us ten dollars now we pay the ten dollars but then we pay an extra 15 that same item cost us 25 that's the full sales price of some items you know what i mean like oh cool we make no money now oh got it cool uh business makes the money thing out of our control like got it the and then there was another one and then there's a high two months before that when you know this celebrity with six million followers is posting about our brand and it's like oh that's awesome but like now that i look at i'm like who cares i don't care nothing like nothing my life didn't change for either one of those two things my life didn't change we got through the we got through the low and i already forgot about the high you know another one rihanna's manager emailed us asking for product like you know they she rihanna wants her that's cool that's exciting wait wait hold on was rihanna asking for free stuff yeah yeah they always have free stuff yeah really yeah rich people don't pay for things that's insane to me you thought rich people buy things they request things and you gladly give it to them have you dm'd i i think i've done it maybe twice have you dm'd people asking for free stuff asking for free stuff uh no i've never dm'd anyone i think i've been like yo this is a great if anybody wants to send me one i'm happy to take it like that's the i think that's the lowest i've stooped i don't think maybe i have i don't i can't remember ever dm'ing asking for free stuff in fact like we usually we go the other way which is like if it's like a friend's product or somebody we know always buy it we want to be their like first customer and we want to like purchase it to like show because you know like you know it feels good and right seems like the right thing to do another one christmas eve on christmas eve this last year the mexican president blocked all imports so like hey that's cool our warehouse is in mexico and on christmas eve all imports are blocked with no notice and no there's no other thing you could do dude cool this at the port do you have a coup staging team this is just in one business this is just in the e-com business this is not even like i have five other businesses so imagine like if this is probably there's a higher low every two months three months maybe but now you multiply by six businesses that means every single month you're getting hit with a high and a low in one of the businesses i think it was um cool you said something actually that was quite good which is uh it feels nice to label certain emotions because it makes it feel better i went through a period it's sort of what's that that's we always reference that meme where like midwit yeah this is like the opposite of that which is like when i was really young and not very successful i consumed tons of motivational stuff and then i started like doing some stuff and i'm like oh that's for weaklings yeah now i'm like no i actually do like reading about like other success stories and love me a good quote nowadays yeah like i actually do love that stuff because it feels nice to like label something it's sort of like when you read a book and you're like well that was the best books they people said the same thing about them they go everything they said was obvious but it felt nice for them to say it out loud for me to read it and to be told what to do and remind me of the right things to do and that has helped me all the time i that's like i pretty much read like lots of like or it's actually my youtube page it's like only motivational here's the trick so i've rebranded it because liking motivation that's a pretty low class thing to do okay oh that's that's you know very low status no status oh oh i need motivation i'm so so weak i mean it's like i need a blood transfusion it's basically what you're saying you don't need motivation you don't like motivation you like wisdom yeah oh my god high class thing to like all right there i helped you out i listen to tons of wisdom and it gets me fired up my favorite wisdom channel speaker yeah there's this youtube channel called motivation for you best the best wisdom yeah exactly i'll give you another little label so i was reading this book uh another high class thing they do i found this like old book out of print had to like call a guy to get this book and it's like it's amazing it is such a such a thin book and it's it's really amazing what's it called i'm not even gonna tell anybody but it's my secret gem and so in it though he talks about so it's a book about um how to have better ideas so he's like this this is great advertising exec who's basically like he's like you know and somebody asked me this and i laughed when they asked me the question and then i realized i didn't have a good answer for it he's like and then i started thinking about it i couldn't get this question out of my head and he's like i have now come to the realization that producing great ideas can be as reliable of a process as for producing model t's on the assembly line and here's how the assembly line works to produce great ideas and one of the things he says in the book he goes this is just a great quote he goes the brain much like the body has a second wind and because he's talking about like there's going to be this point like pain cave there's a point in the process where you kind of fatigue out he's like just i need you to hang in there for like give it there's going to be another you have a little like 10 15 left you're just going to give yourself a chance for the brain to have a second wind much like the body and literally like for the last two weeks as i've been working i've hit this point where i'm like ready to like stop the thing go be distracted i'll go i want to open up twitter or i want to go like go do go eat some food or do something and it is the brain the brain has a second one let me just give it a second here and then i push through for like another 15 minutes and it's actually like been like very very productive this little once one little simple idea can i make a guess as to who wrote that and ignore this if it gives away too much it was by a copywriter if i had a guess is that right it was by an ad man yeah so he copyrights it's crazy copywriters like there's this weird underground world i don't i don't know if you ever have noticed this there's copywriters out there where they sort of have a weird mystical like wizardry about them and they end up learning about copywriting but in order to be a great copywriter you have to understand how humans think and then if you can if you could be a master copywriter you're basically a master at learning about what motivates human beings and thus you can teach all about life but i've come across all these guys that are like old school internet marketers but also people who are around even before the internet and they often have these weird auras around them that if you find a bunch of their old landing pages they explain some of the things that you're talking about and you get on their web pages and you're like i have to give you my money and there's not even a buy now button i have to track you down but i've come across a bunch of these guys one of them is um bill bonner the guy who started agora so agora publishing is like the billion dollar a year um newsletter business that is quite shady but another one is mark ford do you know who mark ford is no who's that so he has this book called ready fire aim on business and he's pretty under the radar guy i think he's probably in his 70s at this point but he helped make agora really popular there's uh ebon pagan do you know who ebon pagan is yeah double your dating and w from uh ebon pagan was a guy who was one of the first uh internet marketers because he got going in the 90s when the internet was just getting going and he had a an ebook called double your dating and he wrote it under a pseudonym called uh david d'angelo and ebon pagan is another guy where if you google ebon pagan and come across his courses or books on copywriting you get entranced and it sort of becomes like a moment where you're like i used to think this way then i read this now my life has just changed i've been pagan who was one of those guys a lot of old russell brunson stuff is like this um but there's a copywriting world that like you come across these old guys or they're not old russell brunson's not old these guys our age no yeah i mean like underground i don't know how to explain it no yeah it's like almost like they ruled the world but they're not it today they're less uh relevant and on the forefront and up in the center of attention as they were 15 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago there's a bunch of people like that yeah and what happens and a lot of people don't realize it is you can just copy exactly what they do and it still works and you don't do invent anything so i'll give you an example there's this guy named dan kennedy we talked about alex hermosi and a lot of people say this to alex as if it's an insult i don't think it's an insult at all but they'll say you just ripped off dan kennedy and so i started reading a bunch of it's not an insult at all it's totally okay to steal from the the greats but if you read a lot of dan kennedy stuff first of all if you google dan kennedy you're gonna see what he looks like and you're probably you'd probably dismiss somebody like oh what does this person know about business because he literally looks like a cowboy but you read their books and their advice is beautiful so long as you come with an open mind and it's incredibly effective but it's sort of like um we talked about uh books that where you say phrases like oh it's banned in prison because it's too powerful yeah they all have catchphrases like that i love copyright i think there's certain professions where it's almost like um darwinian right so like the only way to survive as a copywriter let's say that was your goal and a copywriter then we'll kind of extend that to like an ad man right um like the ogilvies of the world and the only way to survive is to have these breakthrough ideas and be super persuasive with the written word so it's like a an animal that was on an island and the animal had to develop this shell if it needed if it was going to survive that was the only way to survive in that climate and so if you want to get great at persuasion you want to get great great at the written word you could learn from a bunch of people you can learn from elon musk or steve jobs but those guys in order to do what they did they grew up you know they had to have other disciplines that they were great at and they could be good or maybe even really good at copywriting but there's people who that was the only way that they could make it and so those people like sharpen that and you see this with a bunch of different things so you see this with a lot of investors when we have them on the podcast we're like wow like i wanted to ask you about like stocks and like you know analysis but 95 of the things you thought you think about and talk about is like mastering your own like your own psychology and disciplining yourself and like learning like impulse control and learning how to like be a little you know to think for yourself and be comfortable in your own skin and it's like yeah that's actually what that's the thing it was required in order to be great in the investment world combination of like independent thinking and then like self-control and uh playing the long game and patience right and then you talk to people who are you know maybe comedians and comedians are like wow you're actually like kind of a truth teller it's like well yeah like that's kind of what comedy is it's like basically like seeing things for what it is that nobody's saying out loud and then we say it out loud and then everybody laughs because everybody knew it um and so you realize like well these comedians are actually like pretty wise and pretty like spot on and spotting like the truth the underlying truth inside he's like yeah because if they don't do that they don't make anyone laugh and they get booed off the stage and it's horrible and so the ones who survive are the ones who figure out how to do that one thing at a world-class level and so you could study different disciplines where like the darwinian you know pressure had the natural selection forced them to become like a plus plus at a certain thing who uh who do you think falls in that category where you learn about them and and they've done the same thing to you where you went to them for like let's say writing uh and they changed your life seinfeld seinfeld is the easiest example so i i wanted this year i was like oh like could you like make yourself funnier i just sort of assumed that like you know growing up it's like you either are funny or you're not and in my house like my sister's really funny and so it was always like she's the funny one and she's the great storyteller and i was like the nice kid and so i always had this probably like from a young age desire to be more like her and like today's so funny people would be like from the podcast they'd be like oh yeah you're a great storyteller i'm like you haven't seen my sister my sister's amazing at this i'm just okay but over time as i've grown up i've realized like a lot of these things that seem like you either have it or you don't creativity humor storytelling like no these are just skills you can develop like you if you just try you can get way better at it and so humor was one this this year i went into and i was like all right let me just take two weeks and be like let me just learn what there is to learn let me just see if i can make myself funnier so i went and studied seinfeld so i went for the jokes and then i came out being like this man is wise and has some of like the best sort of like he has this incredible creative process like the way he works has changed the way i work like completely like night and day difference in what way so seinfeld does this thing in the morning you know about this but like maybe other people don't seinfeld for the last 45 years has a morning routine sandfield's morning routine is very simple he's like if you want to be a comedian and you want to write you want to tell great jokes you've got to write jokes every day so he wakes up in the morning he sits down with a yellow legal pad a pen and a coffee and he has two hours where before he's pre-input pre-everything nobody no meetings nobody can call him he doesn't read the newspaper he doesn't check social media doesn't do anything else he's like i'm going to do two hours of this and then i can do whatever i want for the rest of the day and he sits down he does his two hour morning block it's two hour morning routine he's done that every day for 45 years to the point where there's a photo where he took the pages from his yellow legal pads over the 40 years and he laid it out on the street i think in new york no way you haven't seen this no i'm gonna go literally becomes the yellow brick road this is awesome are you kidding me this is so cool so he let to promote his book so he published a book basically of like all of his like scrap jokes that he didn't put into a stand-up um it's called is this any is this anything i think is the name of the book but to promote it he did this yellow brick road of all his yellow pages and you know like for example you know how did i work before this right i'd wake up i check slack i check my email i'd then start to think about what i'm gonna do but then i got kind of hungry then i go do this then oh i had this meeting scheduled at nine so i'm gonna get to my main thing at 11. and just seinfeld's like keeping it sacred of like yeah what's your main thing you spend two if you're gonna be creative you're gonna spend two hours in the morning creating that's it um tim uh urban from wait but why told me the same thing he goes if he goes all i have to do in life is wake up and spend the first two hours writing and if i do that life is amazing and if i don't do that my life sucks he's like and by the way it's only two hours it's not eight hours it's not 10 hours i don't have to keep grinding all day two hours is more than enough if i actually do it so seinfeld does that and he talks about writer's block where they're like but jerry like what do you do on days where you don't know what to write he's like uh like what do you do with writer's block he goes oh you know it's funny you ask because there is no writer's block and they're like what do you mean jerry like of course like we have all felt it there's writer's block he goes no no there's lazy there's afraid there's um having too high of expectations but there's no writer's block let's be clear and he's like here's the security writer's block you ready accept your own mediocrity don't sit down and think today i'm gonna make this great thing it's gonna be so amazing i'm the words are gonna flow i'm gonna make this funny joke because that's what stops you what you need to do is almost an anti-affirmation you need to sit down and say today i'm gonna sit down it's gonna be hard to write the thing i'm gonna come up with is gonna pretty much suck i'm gonna look at it and i'm gonna hate it i'm gonna want to crumble it up and throw it in the trash it's gonna be that bad but you know what i'm gonna put it down on paper anyways because every once in a while there'll be a little nugget of something good and then after i find a little nugget of something good i might be able to polish it with a ton of work later and make it great and he's like this sort of like anti-affirmation right so like i have taken that and completely stolen that as my daily process from this guy i went to to learn about like how to make people laugh and i'm like i learned how to work how to live like he talks about he does transnational meditation they're like oh is that that's really great you love meditation he goes no i just want to write great jokes he's like but you have to whip the mind you have to whip the body he's like so why do i work out to be a better comedian why do i meditate to recharge my battery so i can be a better comedian he's like all the stuff i do is to be a better comedian he's like he's like you'll learn pretty quick if you don't work out you're leaving you know some of you on the table from being able to do your best work if you don't do something like a meditation or something to recharge your mental battery you're going to do worse work like it's just as simple as that right he's got a ton of stuff on that i've been that's so great jerry i listened i listened to a lot of his youtube videos his interviews um because it's the same thing where i learn more about life than anything you know there's a famous one where he talks about like consultants like in in comedian uh comedians and making jokes what's he say about that so the joke is uh he's getting interviewed by i think like harvard business review and they go um you and larry david famously wrote seinfeld together with no writer's room just the two of you guys you wrote every single season every episode and burnout was one of the reasons you stopped the show in the end like you know he uh was there he goes the harvard business review goes was there a more sustainable way to do it could mckenzie have helped you find a better model and he goes who's wait did they really ask that yeah he goes who's mckenzie and they go it's a consulting firm he goes are they funny he goes they go no he goes then i don't need them if you're efficient if you're efficient you're doing it the wrong way the right way is the hard way the show is successful because i micromanaged it every word every line every take every edit every casting that is my way of life did you have this up right now dude i have like a dossier of seinfeld like i told i studied this man like i went deep on this that's awesome um have you ever seen him live yeah i've seen seinfeld honestly wasn't that funny but i was gonna say the same thing i was gonna say the same thing love the guy don't love his comedy actually his his stand-up is his writing is the best but his stand-up for some reason is just fine yeah it's like just okay i've been obsessed but actually it's important why i really love this guy right because he's been touring for 50 years as a comedian 50 years this is unbelievable like lebron james is jealous of jerry seinfeld's longevity there's like 50 years unbelievable longevity as a touring comedian and he's also i think it was remarkable he's one of the he's the first and only billionaire comedian mostly because of seinfeld the show but also like you know comedians of cars doing coffee he sold for like 100 million dollars like he's been really touring for a long time yeah netflix picked it up for 100 million dollars he's a super he's outlier but the great thing about seinfeld is if you see him he's not like naturally just oozing charisma and like talent like there's some guys they could do amazing impressions you're like i could never do that right or there's other guys that are just like they have just this knack this gift for gab and you just see it like the way they grew up like this guy's just so funny and seinfeld is like a he looks like an hr manager right like he doesn't look like he's the most naturally talented guy and that's kind of why i love it like the guy's the most successful comedian he's because he's just this craftsman he like squeezed everything out of his natural talent and i think how often does that really happen like how often do people really maximize their potential very rare i remember when i was starting the hustle scott belski like i cold emailed him and asked him to invest and he didn't want to invest but then i just like added him to the hustle and i started writing uh like extra good emails uh and he eventually replied he's like this is so good can i invest like a very small sum but i just want to let you know like this this is like you're fantastic this is great and he let me hang out with him so for anyone listening scott belski at this point he's known as like a legendary uh investor but before he was this amazing investor he had started behance which he had sold for i think 175 million dollars now he uh he was nearly the ceo of adobe which is one of the largest companies in the world i think now he works at age 24 is that right like the big shot hollywood uh production company he's the like chief strategy officer and something else and i didn't listen to his advice when i when i met with him and i always regretted that i didn't listen to his advice and i didn't understand it until now he basically was saying the exact opposite of scale scale scale i was like i need to automate this i need to hire more people i need to get away from writing this email every day and making it great i need to add more revenue i need to get more advertisers and he was basically like you need to go in a room and just not have anyone around and you just need to write this email every single day for about four or five years and be uh he used the i'd never heard anyone use the word steward he was like you need to be a steward of greatness and a steward of taste for your audience and i didn't understand what that entirely meant but what i thought in my head i was like but you're wanting me to act like i'm a small business owner you're wanting me to act like a craftsman i was like i'm not trying to be some garage band i'm trying to be lady gaga like i'm trying to sell out stadiums what are you talking about being a craftsman do you know what i mean like i don't understand what you're saying why am i going to stay small i want to sell out i don't want like that's the whole goal and it took me years to understand what he meant which was you can become this like huge successful person and also be a craftsman you know who honestly does a great job at this and it seems silly is dave portnoy dave portnoy has his hat and i don't even like the comedy anymore but he's had his hands in it and he's been consistent now for 25 years and he's ridiculous he's a ridiculous person he's sort of obnoxious but you know what he's done it he's done exactly what scott belski has said which is you need to be in the thick of it and you need to be focused purely on creative and you need to be a steward for taste and i didn't understand what that meant until i was about 32 years old i think he told me this when i was 26 and i and i and i was like scott how are you so successful you don't know anything about business you're telling me not to like focus on scaling and all this gaga scott gaga and but now that i know like some of these people who are actually making the most money are actually still craftsmen uh and like and and so like i distinctly remember i'm like i want to sell out stadiums i'm trying to sell out i'm not trying to be a small little like korean family owned bodega like i'm trying to take over the world baby you uh you said dave portnoy uh there's another guy who's like that bill simmons and uh he's probably you know he's probably the reason i'm doing a podcast today is because i was back in college and i don't know what what that was 2007 listening to his to the bs report you know i used to like fall asleep listen to the bs report like it was like that it was that like and at the time podcasts were nothing and he he had been a blogger before that then he was a espn columnist then he did the podcast then he did 30 for 30 documentaries then he went he gets fired from espn because he does the he does the ringer why did he get fired um he was pretty outspoken against roger goodell the nfl commissioner he's like this guy's like kind of covering up and like not like he doesn't care it could be contained there was like a domestic violence thing there was like the concussion stuff and he was basically like he would make jokes but like the nfl's espn's biggest partner and so he was he got suspended a couple times and then they were just like this guy's too hard to work with and so they um they killed his project grantland and they fired him and so he comes back after licking his wounds a little bit he comes back with the ringer which is just the grant grantland again um and he'd been doing this now for like a long time but he ends up selling to spotify for 200 million dollars and there's a great tweet that was going on uh the other day so the tweet was basically a video of simmons and he's walking through the office he's carrying like a chair like a school chair and he's carrying a chair and a microphone and he's like uh and they're like they're like bill what are you doing he's like a trade had just happened in the nfl the micah parsons trade just happened and it's like kind of like uh you know in the grand scheme of things not like a big story but like you know it was like the biggest story that week and his company has like 15 other podcasts and so there's like this nfl podcast going on and he's like i gotta go talk about this so he's just carrying a chair through the hallway and there's a guy behind him like filming him like bill what are you doing and uh he just barges in and he like puts down his chair with his microphone and he wants to like talk about it with the guys and there and somebody tweeted they're like honestly respect this guy's been doing this for like 20 years he's got he's worth like 200 million dollars and yet on a like thursday he can't wait he's literally carrying his chair his microphone and wants to sit with his friends and do do a podcast about this trade like that's kind of goals you know what i mean like that's actually like career goals and um that really like i don't know that kind of like stuck with me like that is really what you want is like a job that's so fun and so like so you that it doesn't matter what's the money in the bank like you really just want to do it you just want to do the thing to the point where you're just going to carry your chair down the hallway and try to find a podcast to go do about it you know i thought that was great where's he now so is grantland still a thing grantland died with espn he's creates the ringer ringer sold the ringer i mean and so it's part of spotify um and he's been you know making bank uh ever since why haven't we been able to get him on here you've talked about him like four or five times as like your number one he's like that girl at the dance i don't want to approach yeah i'm like hold on i just gotta like i'm gonna fix my shirt real quick i gotta take my shirt i gotta go i gotta go get some punch i'm thirsty yeah i gotta do i'll do everything else except for asking him yeah i mean he looks pretty awesome uh i i don't know really anything about him i would love to talk to this dude uh uh he seems great and you've talked about him like he's prolific yeah is he is he yeah i mean to go from a dude who couldn't even get hired by like a local paper basically so he starts blogging early on on the internet parlays that blog into like getting his own section and being the highest paid sports writer at espn but the thing is it's not just that he was the highest it's not that he's successful he did it his way like he created an entire style of writing on on like a publication like esp he basically wrote like a blogger on espn nobody did that he wasn't impartial he was like no i love the red sox i love the patriots i'm from boston what are you talking about i'm gonna write like a fan like i'm gonna write like a fan and sometimes i'll be pissed at what my team is doing sometimes i'll be excited about it i'm gonna make a bunch of references to like mtv road rules the challenge like i'm gonna i'm gonna do what i'm interested in even though that makes none of it is like by the book and then he does podcasting early on then he does the documentary he builds the most successful sports documentary series what 30 for 30 30 for 30.

he like it was his brainchild he conceived it he created it inside of espn like nobody believed in it basically and he you know he's kind of fought for it got it done it became super successful i he's he's epic dude what he's done and still on the podcast he um you would never know so he'll never reference the fact that like he's basically richer than like a lot of the athletes he covers at this point he's super well connected to him but he's tried to like never really he doesn't let that sort of creep into his content also he didn't really rub it in espn's face um which he very much could have because they like literally kicked him to the curb and didn't believe in him and told him like grant land the idea is a failure like that that's a money loser doesn't work and he replicated the same business and sold it for 200 million dollars so you know like he he could have done a victory lap and never did that's awesome i'm a i'm a bill simmons fan no there you go should i interview him without you yeah i think you should i would love that actually so sean's not here today but he's too much yours yours inspiration and you do anything for you but there's a couple of these guests where you fangirl that would be one where i'd be i'd be too much of a fan girl and uh it really would be counterproductive to the podcast that would be great to get you rattled you're not normally uh someone who gets rattled um all right that was a good episode i enjoyed that but uh that's that's the part
