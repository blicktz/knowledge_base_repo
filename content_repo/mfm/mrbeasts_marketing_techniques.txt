Do you know who that is? Love Mr Beast. So if you don't know who Mr Beast is, he's this youtuber who's grown like crazy in the last like 18 months really new he's like a new guy but he's blown past I don't know how many subscribers but maybe tens of millions of subscribers now and his whole thing is he's just like it just gives away money to people well like it does challenges but like he typically he'll give away cars so for example he goes to a used car dealership and he buys 10 cars which each car is probably five or ten thousand dollars so maybe he's in 40 or 50 grand on this thing and people come to buy the car and the and he acts like the salesman and the lady will be like alright this car looks good and he goes okay here and he gives her the keys he goes no it's yours right and they film it and they film it and this the reaction it's kind of like that like it has a feel-good element to it because you see people who are like no way like but it's funny he'll go to a restaurant and leave a $2,000 tip on a $10 bill and they're like people break down crying and then sometimes it's funny where he'll be like he'll take four friends he'll buy a Lambo and be like put your hand on this Lambo first person last person to have their hand on this Lambo keeps the Lambo and they just for two days straight they just have their hand on this thing they're passing out and they you know he may he turns on to YouTube content and he's brilliant because he gets brands to pay for the whole thing so this one brand quit our quid or quit it's not the toothbrush it's like this like stickers trading cards thing on online at least quid quid has given this guy you know they'll just put up the 50k he does the challenge he's he shouts out quid and they're happy for it because their videos are getting like millions of views and so it's way better branded content than usual and so he basically took brand money and parlayed it into being like huge which is pretty crazy yeah and he even did a thing where he raised a hundred million twenty million dollars for trees trees plant a tree and the founder of Shopify gave him a hundred or sorry a million Elon gave a million yeah and he raised twenty million dollars in two weeks or yeah and I have a friend who talked to him on the phone the other day to do a campaign and he was like what friend Jason so Jason Hitchcock shout out to Jason so he was like you know talking to him and he when he got off the phone he's like yeah I talked to Mr.

Beast really cool I talked to his agent or whatever and he described he's like you know one weird thing happens which is didn't plan for this you know sort of success you get the success but the YouTube game is such that you kind of need to top yourself every time he's probably getting exhausted so he's like dude the stress of like okay we gave away a Lambo through this like crazy thing next week what do I do like okay it's just this constant bar raising which is really tough so when we first launched our company I get a phone call from Elizabeth Murdoch you know who Elizabeth Murdoch is Rupert Murdoch's daughter yeah okay just a big shot and she was like hey you guys want to do these videos I'm launching this new thing and I need video content and I was like no that's not what we're trying to do but let's say friends and shoot the shit and she goes okay well I'll find someone else so she finds someone else to do it and they start a YouTube channel and that YouTube channel is now called yes theory have you heard of yes theory heard of it yeah they got five or six million subscribers and I've become friends with them over the years and they have a I mean they're like famous they're like legit famous I don't I have no idea if it's a good business but I bet you they make they could each pay themselves a million dollars a year so pretty good for young people pretty good for anyone and each week they're having to do crazy and crazy shit and they've had to do this for three years now every video is like I went to the most remote island in the world right myself right and it's three guys now and they're like taking turns over doing crazy shit like it's the crazy stuff was like I asked my uber driver if she wants to go to Paris and we went straight to Paris and went there and now they're like doing variations of that it's like oh my god that shit's exhausting it's like if jackass if steve-o and the jackass crew had YouTube and like they would have to do this every week like we were just lucky that they were lucky that the cadence was like you know seasons of TV or a movie because when it's weekly it's just insane which is why Casey Neistat and Logan Paul Jake Paul all these guys eventually they you know they do this daily grind for so long but they burn out like the content burnout is crazy for sure it's not gonna happen to us though well it's not gonna happen to us we just sit and do nothing like having to get on a plane and like or like Logan Paul you gotta like yell at someone or like go break up with a girlfriend every week you gotta go box someone you
