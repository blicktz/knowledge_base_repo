speaking of presidential did you want to talk about bernie is that your first thing up here i have a thing up there but i didn't research enough but i'll talk about it just quickly so a bunch of people on twitter were freaking out because bernie's proposing this tax on vested shares that you haven't actually cashed in yet okay and tech people were like oh okay there goes the startup scene like well you know if you're gonna tax people on vested shares that they haven't actually received the prop like this company's not liquid and so but there are some nuances like it's written here it's taxed on non-qualified stock options of at least 100 000 you know if you have over 100 000 in stock uh stock options that are vested and your employees making at least 130k so it's not everybody and it's not all types of things so it's not rsus it's isos i believe okay so i'm not an expert in this stuff at all and i'm not an expert in politics i know what i believe but i don't know the technical details well let's agree to talk out of our ass for two minutes i'm not going to talk about that actually but here's what i am going to talk about is starting a company and how it worked with us and this will a lot because i do know that a lot of people think like oh the rich are doing this they don't understand things so when we started the hustle i saved up $25,000 to start it with that $25,000 i made 60 grand in profit in six weeks which is pretty good and the first year in business was roughly $380,000 in revenue and most of it was profit because i paid myself uh we were in i think we were in llc i withdrew $2,000 a month in salary salary um and that's how i paid my bills my rent was cheap very cheap hundreds of hundreds of dollars a month um and i lived off $1,200 um beyond that beyond that it was very i lived very very very frugally um and then we decided to raise a little bit of money i raised i think $300,000 from people at a three and a half million dollar valuation and you had to change from being an llc at this point right yep changed to become uh an s corp i think it was an s corp probably a c corp i don't remember i see this i'm not an expert in this yeah um you want to be a c corp if you're going to take investment that's just like if you don't have to study all the differences between them but if you're going to take like traditional investment they're going to want you to be a c corp so we converted it cost five grand to do that at this point we probably had half a million dollars in the $300,000 in the bank account i don't i don't remember between 300 and 500,000 by the end of our first year uh and we raised money at a three and a half million dollar valuation and then once we started doing stock options and stuff like that we signed up to carta and they gave us a uh what's it called a 409a yep where we got um so that 409a just values your company at some number so you guys had revenue so they probably took some standard multiple of revenue yeah so they valued us and you want it to be low at this stage yeah so they valued us in the millions of dollars of range i don't remember it could have been three and a half it could have been six i don't remember the number whatever these types of businesses are that's what they value you want it to be low because that's what your share price is that's what your stock options are going to be if you're an employee you want to get in at the sort of low valuation so when it sells at a high valuation you get this sort of uh increase in value but if they if the 409a comes back high then um you're not going to get you know as much of a lift on your share price and so at this point our 409a is many tens of millions um which is nice that's cool we have a valuable business um but when we started it was single digit millions which was still a lot i was 24 at the time i said i started with 25 000 and i was taking two thousand dollars a month i was not saving any money right okay um i'm not complaining because it worked out but so on paper i was a millionaire multiple millionaire if i had to pay um i think there i forget what this i don't want to like act like i know i'm talking about let's say if i if i had to pay 20 percent in taxes on that multiple millions of dollars you wouldn't have had i literally wouldn't have had any money to do it right even if i wanted to withdraw money from our business account i would have had to lay people off or right i i like so when people say certain people are hoarding money or something like that a lot of times it's not true and i have a lot of founder friends that have businesses that are on paper worth hundreds of millions of dollars right and they have tens of thousands of dollars saved that's a bank account yeah so they're not liquid yeah i think people need to and this also happens if you're an employee um you leave a company you usually have what they call an exercise window which might be 30 days 60 days 90 days um i think that i think the normal is 90 days um so that gives you three months to come up with the money to buy your options or you lose them yeah and a lot of people don't have that money because like you know they leave one company it's a startup and now their shares are worth 80 grand or 180 grand and they need to go they want to go do a different job and um now they need to come up with 80 or 180 grand to buy out their options that's not still a guarantee that that money's coming back and often people don't have that money sitting in the bank so they'll forfeit their options which is a true bummer some companies are being cool about it pinterest uh a couple others i don't remember maybe stripe they increase their exercise window to seven years or six years that's crazy so they're like look cool we know this practice a little bit crazy uh it's hard to come up with that cash and you worked here you earned your shares so we're not going to try to take those back you have the longer window because we might be private for longer which is kind of a cool trend so my company should do that my w2 income so at this point i make money in eight or ten different ways i got loads of things that just it just has added up over time and that's great and i still pay myself a salary i pay myself um not that much i'm not the highest paid person here yeah and i um but my w2 salary we're going to be four years old uh i've been working on this as a project since 2014 we're going to be four years old as officially in april i uh oh next month i uh my w2 salary in year one i think was 24 000 year two maybe 36 and then year three then i started going higher right because the business was established yeah but my w2 income historically has been low right quite low and so when i saw this and i saw people getting mad at rich people i'm like i bet people thought i was rich but i wasn't you know what i mean yeah and you wouldn't have qualified for this because it says you have to be making at least 130k but uh like but if i had to pay 30 tax on my stock now it would be painful fucking hard yeah you'd be in a really tough spot so you know bernie i like bernie but this is a little bit crazy this will really screw up uh the way the startup's ecosystem works but it can also adapt i'm not even gonna take a stand if i think it's crazy or not i just am giving a perspective of my business and i bet and and i think i i now i think i have a lot more cash than even most people who have companies that are huge
