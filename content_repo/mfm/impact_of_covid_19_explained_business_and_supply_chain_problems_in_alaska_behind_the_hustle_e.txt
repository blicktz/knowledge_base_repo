in many remote alaskan towns this is just ordinary life zach welcome back hey how you doing brett pretty good so you've got a story this week that um sounds like it's gonna be pretty awesome you um found this small town in alaska and this is a place that was already pretty remote and cut off from civilization and now even more so um tell us a little bit what you've learned here yeah so you know almost everyone in the lower 48 states has had some kind of running with the supply chain issue at this point whether it's you know you go to the store and you can't find eggs you can't find milk in many remote alaskan towns this is just ordinary life um so i was curious to look at a place where the supply chain is so ordinarily complicated that any extra wrench you throw into the equation is almost devastating and um there are some people finding really intuitive workarounds to these issues this little town that we chose to look at gustavis alaska population 400. uh it's a place where there was no electricity until 1985. uh no cell phones until the mid 90s uh you know no many people didn't have a landline until the mid 90s uh last night i joined a town hall meeting uh by telephone and there were five people on the call so and that was considered a a monumental turnout for the town so that's a quorum um yeah yeah so this um this town usually gets it's it there's one grocery store in town and typically they'll get their groceries by ferry you can't get to this town by uh automobile the only way you can get there is by plane or airplane or by plane or boat so for instance if you wanted to get there from san francisco you would fly to seattle you'd fly to juno alaska and then you'd take a little seaplane from maybe a six seater seaplane from juno to gustavis problem is that a few months ago that ferry went out of commission the state had a bunch of budget cuts the town is almost entirely dependent on tourism revenue so a lot of things just hit the fan at the same time and this grocery store owner had to find a new way to supply his town with not only groceries but rations supplies the local businesses also depended on him to bring over things like lumber and concrete so he bought his own barge uh uh two hundred thousand dollar ship and he bought a car and he started making trips six and a half hours one way between gustavis and juneo alaska to the costco there which is actually the smallest costco in the united states um and bought twenty thousand dollars worth of stuff at a time and he's doing these shipments once a week and basically feeling his entire town on those trips so not every tom has such an altruistic person who's willing to put the town on his back and um and shoulder that sort of burden but this is just not some ordinary good citizen this is somebody who has pretty deep roots in this place and um you're telling me a little bit about his his was it his grandfather can you can you describe this this little backstory i thought that was fascinating yeah so his family goes way back in this town to 1917 um his great grandfather's name was abraham lincoln parker uh his father's name is lee parker and his name is lane parker comes from a long lineage of um gustavus um descendants and uh like many people in the town he he his family probably went up there to seek a kind of a remote lifestyle it's it's a very beautiful place it's right next to glacier bay national park which is um just a tremendous place uh but that that remoteness and isolation sometimes comes with a cost um you're at the very end of the supply chain uh before he started his store there a gallon of milk in gustavus was twelve dollars um so you know you'd you'd buy it you'd get it in seattle uh the shipping company would get it in seattle for like three bucks then they'd have to like load it onto the barge they'd have to ship it on this ridiculous journey across the ocean and all costs considered by the time it got there the markup would be like seven eight dollars um so this guy basically found a more efficient way to minimize those logistics and um reduce the costs a little bit on those goods so abraham lincoln parker would probably be proud um sure well the other thing that interests me here is this is not just about one remote town in a remote place but it's um it's really more a story about the supply chain problems that many towns in rural america are going to start to face as um this pandemic stretches out beyond um the coverage areas of like a lot of people and what they're what we're reading in the pages of lots of newspapers and magazines so there was somebody you talked to it was at kansas state university who sort of shed light on some of the the effect that we're going to see in rural towns can you tell us a little bit about that yeah this is like kind of an extreme example of a remote or rural town this this place in alaska but there are plenty of uh towns small municipalities in the united states like in places like kansas where there are one there's one grocery store in town and in a lot of these places a lot of these places are so small that it doesn't even make sense for a walmart or a dollar store to come encroach on the business there so the the grocery store is is on its own and a lot of time a lot of these owners are very old they've been in the town for a long time they're kind of a town fixture and when they retire they have trouble having someone to fill their shoes um finding someone to fill their shoes so a lot of these grocery stores close people are in a situation where they have to commute 30 or 40 minutes to the next town or the next grocery store over to get their stuff and especially with covid19 right now when people are sheltered in place that's not a possibility for a lot of people um aside from that uh you know the pop the population who doesn't have access to cars or who isn't mobile for any reason um so it's a big issue uh we could see uh coronavirus having uh a pretty devastating impact on rural towns with a single grocery store like this um and and even big shipping logistics companies um freight companies will sometimes bypass these towns because it doesn't really make sense to stop there um so these towns are having to find ways to rely on local economies and farmers ranchers things like that to fill the void but sometimes even that's not enough um so in tandem with coronavirus we're seeing this great ongoing decline of rural grocery stores um that many people are trying to find a solution to it's fascinating well more on sunday definitely open zach's email and uh if you have stories of supply chain disruptions that you want to share then uh send them to holler at the hustle and uh we'll we'll definitely take a look because we're continuing to find these stories interesting and want to continue to cover those uh undiscovered stories for you all right thanks for joining us zach and uh everybody open your email on sunday for more take care everyone
