there's this thing called thinks uh t-h-n-k-s um where is that on here oh it's just right in the middle oh okay what's that so i saw this in a um an instagram ad or something like that i thought it was kind of kind of clever so um b2b gifting so what thinks does or i think it's probably thanks that they're trying to do which is saying thanks oh that's stupid i hate cute spelling yeah cute spelling kind of kind of tripped them up there um so what it does is it's like from your phone you can instantly just send a little gift to any business acquaintance so it's like you could send um you know a bottle of wine you can send a box of chocolates you can send an uber ride you can send 25 you know amazon thing whatever uh so they have a whole bunch of different um digital gifts that are it just looked the in in the ad it looked frictionless of like how easy this would be to just send this little thank you to everyone so for someone like you guys you guys have advertisers we have guests that come on the podcast and i know i would love to send them gifts i know that i should i know these little things go a long way even though it just seems like they shouldn't but i don't take the time to do it and so i think if somebody actually made a really good b2b gifting platform that did both the actual gifting so being able to send it to your contact uh but also they sort of accounting for it so keeping track of it in a spreadsheet and all that stuff maybe helping you expense it um i think that could be a big business i think a lot of sales people would use this i totally agree the way what what are you pointing did he do that um no there's a company called alice and they do uh artificial intelligence powers it's really cool that they just scan your social profile and they figure out what your interests are they send you an example of a gift they want to send to you um like on behalf of the company and then you're able to either donate the value of that to the charity of your choice or pick from the marketplace um a gift of similar value that's badass i like that what i would do uh one or two things the first thing that i would do is i think the way that i would set this up is i would make it pretty heavy on slack or integrate with salesforce so we've built a couple salesforce plugins that we love and other people have asked us to give it to them what's an example of one uh i'm not involved in our salesforce thing but basically uh like one example is we've connected our quickbooks and our salesforce really effectively um which was a previous previously a really hard problem i mean that's real nitty-gritty accounting stuff gotcha but it was really uh frustrating another thing that we built in salesforce was so that we the way that we built our business is uh we can get a line of credit on our invoices and we've synced it all we've synced it all up so our bank knows which invoices we have based off salesforce and things like that right and it's really effective but what i would do in this is i would hook it up to salesforce or slack and i would make it so you could send co-workers as well and basically the boss puts your credit card down and he allocates it or she allocates it so every employee gets automatically like some number of ten dollars to two hundred dollars a month right and you have you can like type in like send henry a gift at san francisco office right and like for example i buy gift gift cards for people all the time where someone has done something really cool or like ed was saying her car's i don't know if her car is messed up i'd be like send ed a hundred dollar uber gift card right that i think that would be fantastic and the way that i would build it is that it would remind every employee how much balance they have left at the end of the month so you for sure know it's going to get right get used that's kind of that's really interesting and um i would also look at uh what's the what's the fruit baskets that are popular edible arrangements edible arrangements yeah i would look at their i would go they crush yeah i think they're publicly traded yeah i would go and read all about how they do it and where they say are the biggest markets for their b2b is it real estate agents who need to you know always be out there is it sales is it um you know i don't know whatever else uh so there's some stats that are on here i don't know who added these but great 89 percent of alan did nice alan shout out to alan 89 percent of c-suite execs believe that gifting brings people closer together okay love it um and then after receiving a gesture of appreciation individuals feel like sort of the what the rule of reciprocity yeah so 56 more likely to reciprocate and um and i think it's i think it's great um i have a friend greg eisenberg who's all about gifting ramon is a great gifter as well he's almost obnoxiously good yeah and so they they just are so thoughtful and uh by little things that go a long way it just makes you love the person yeah so another thing i would do to run this company is i would go to is it uh it was it's a book called influence by robert cialdini he's got this thing called the rule of reciprocity it's summed up in uh basically i can do a favor for sean and he's going to do a favor back to me even if he didn't ask for me to do him a favor and it is likely that he will repay me back in a disproportionate amount so for example there's been times you could like go up to someone and you could be like hey uh you want to you want to can i give you a coke or can i give you a um like this small ten dollar gift and i could be negotiating with you for selling a car and get a deal and get a deal right uh or for example i could say something like hey can you grab my mail or let me grab your mail for you when you're out of town and then two weeks later i could be like hey can i borrow your car for five days and typically people will do it and so i would make the whole tagline of my company which is like i would make i always think of like in terms of headlines and copywriting for sales pages i would make the whole headline all about how you can manipulate you have to use positive language but how you can manipulate people by giving gifts i mean that i would what would your headline i would go to that book uh the rule of reciprocity and uh i would find it find a great in fact maybe that's what the headline would be it would be the definition of the rule recipe like i would make it look like a definition rule of reciprocity like noun or something like defined as inadequate or uh uh disproportional given in response to a gift yeah in other words we help you make more money so so theirs theirs is i just went to their website growing business through growing business with gratitude build strong business relationships through efficient personalized and thoughtful gestures of appreciation that's whack you you you you you you you you
