something that has made a huge impact on me and i think more people need to take advantage of it which is transparent numbers so basically there's a group of people out there who believe that transparency is good um and they share all of their revenue they chair they share their every metric about their business as deep as everyone's salary their bank balance churn how much it costs to um acquire a customer how much a customer stays on for everything some are a little bit less well they'll share how many customers they have how much revenue they have what their bank balance is um more people should follow uh these businesses i for one am totally against that i don't think you should ever reveal that but i'm happy they do and yeah um and so some examples so throw them out so uh first of all my friend encore what's on core's last name he uh runs teachable uh i don't remember his last name um if you google on can you tell me on course i'll say uh founder of teachable okay so he reveals uh on twitter the valuation of every round what is it nagpal yes nat say it nagpal nagpal uh he reveals the valuation of every right every time they just raised like 20 million bucks at uh whatever 200 something really good and he reveals how much revenue they have how many customers they have it's awesome yes i love that the other guy is sahil sahil uh from gumroad shitty business seems like an awesome guy uh he reveals every single month yeah all the you can google gumroad founder sahil it's on his twitter if you he just he doesn't have a tweet lance you don't even have to dive into the books it's like here's 140 characters um joel from buffer he does this they actually just switch so if you go to baremetrics.com or google baremetrics they have like 18 different companies that do this and it's pretty cool and joel from buffer used to be on there they're a 22 million dollar a year company so pretty valuable and they would reveal everything everything employee salaries like name salary equity you know level everything and you know what they're changing they're showing less and less because have you talked to them do you know why it becomes problematic when you add more people um yeah duh it's like you know guy you know creates you know turns his kitchen into a man cave instead gets a girlfriend and is like ah she doesn't like it it's like yeah no man like i could have told you this like when you bought the plasma and put it on the fridge grow up joel people don't like their salary being public what so they still do salary they still do equity people get upset when they see their co-worker who slacks off and works from home two days a week and they see his salary because people don't understand that like different people have different situations it's not like so so they did it i think in a smart way which is they basically were like they used it as customer acquisition yeah it's part of their story because they got their ass kicked by hubspot and so they like uh hootsuite you know this has become a bit of a playbook for small business to business sas companies which is look you know acquisition of customers is hard if my customer is a small business owner what a small business what would bring a small business owner to me what content could i put out there that would make a small business owner come so instead of saying seven tips to have more effective meetings they were like here's our here's our p l for this month and sure enough a lot of people wanted to see that so a lot of people discovered their product through this and so you know maybe this lines up totally with their values and that's why they did it but i just definitely definitely it was a great way for people to discover their business i didn't use buffer but i read all their and if anybody ever needed a solution like buffer i was like oh buffer you should use buffer why because otherwise i wouldn't have even known about them and so this was a pretty counterintuitive thing that they did and they were the only ones doing it and so you always get paid when you're the only one doing it if it's juicy yeah and so one more person who's doing it and his business is way better than buffer i love this guy's business so it's my friend nathan barry i've met nathan a while ago and nathan has this company called convert kit they do close to two million in monthly recurring revenue so 24 million he owns 100 of it right it's probably a hundred to two million dollar company like it's really valuable because once customers are locked in it's basically a mailchimp competitor it's an email that seems high two two million a month you said two million that's for sure that's how much they do so they're doing two million no no that part so so 24 million a year so 24 million you think they're worth what 10 times 10 times that okay maybe it's growing like a weed maybe people don't switch from their email platform yeah it'll all depend on the retention so can you pull up actually can you open it open up their their metrics so just it's high just google like like baremetrics dashboard or something i forgot what the url is but it's like something dot baremetrics.com and it's like their whole company it's like here's how many new customers we got here's how many people churned this month it's like all their graphs and you can use it for your company he even showed how much profit they make i think it's like convert kit uh it's like yeah here it is you gotta zoom in there you go so this i don't know if this is their business or this is like the example thing but it's like monthly recurring revenue net revenue fees yeah that's not it this is somebody else's business you got to do convert kit yeah do convert kit baremetrics type in convert kit revenue maybe if you can't you can't spell i also use convert kit i actually i pay for a subscription because i'm like this product is so powerful i don't actually have many sequences set up i have a sequence of one email right now which is not a sequence it's just an email but um i think it's a great product i love convert kit i love nathan nathan's a great guy nathan's only 26 or seven years old um we talked to we talked about the idea of doing a drip sequence to build a newsletter for uh women going through pregnancy and like week by week and i had a friend or sorry no i had a random listener reach out on twitter was like i'm doing this here's my kind of unique asset i have to go about this and uh how should i set this up and i sent them to convert kit i was like dude your problem is going to be solved in like you know the next 90 minutes um what are people leaving bare metrics or something why can't you find it here you go 1.7 million oh is that it what's the url oh yeah so 1.7 million monthly recurring revenue and you could just look at the it'll say churn so annual run rate doing 20 million in a year which is up 1.7 that's got to be how much this month revenue churn 5.1 per month that's not bad it's not great either well it's because it's a small to medium business like if you're turning five percent a month that's uh like like what's his what's the net growth so five percent a month is the churn what's the new business every month one and a half percent one and a half percent yeah so he's net negative then per month no i think that that churn that that growth month that growth number takes into account churn i see okay gotcha oh okay that's the but this is because it's the the average revenue even says so they make on average sixty dollars is it sixty dollars a month per user right um um and the thing on the right medium business gonna have a it's gonna have higher churn compared to other sass but dude if you're if you're a real sicko you can just look at the live stream on the right and see every minute when somebody pays them it'll say like right now it says 29 paid by you know you know anonymous company um dude he's got a lot of failed payments here get on that nathan what's going on you can't be failing it's three out of the 12 payments here are failed four he has a chart that says which ones fail so these these companies are are badass i so you wouldn't do it no i think what about a part of what you do the email list size the revenue i don't want to share anything publicly um well i'll say like eight figures or right something no i just don't think it brings a lot of good either you know when a company's trying to raise or sell their business because like two months before all these articles will come out just like handing over handing over information yeah why why is that happening because they want to raise their router they want to sell their company within the next six months i don't can you go to the next go back to the google doc no i'm not a fan of it uh one time when i did my first conference when i was younger it made like 60 grand in profit and i told everyone in the blog post and i hated the attention so i'm never gonna do it um you you
