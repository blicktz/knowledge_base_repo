It's only recently that kind of playing the startup lottery, for lack of a better term, has been the successful choice. And so for these, you know, my immigrant grandparents, their attitude was they're going to work hard. You know, my great-grandfather was a factory worker in Argentina, right?

And he worked his ass off so that my mother and grandmother could be schoolteachers so that in their minds I could go get, you know, a Ph.D. or an M.D. or whatever, become a professional.

And clearly that's not necessarily happening. But that was like – that was the life plan for immigrant families in this country for generations was every generation one more level of educational attainment which correlates with one more level of professional success. And only recently has that been decoupled.

Totally. And then so you go to Flexport. Yeah.

Have that experience. Cool. You're now 17, 18.

Yeah. So, yeah, did the startup like 17, 18. Started to go to college.

Went to NYU, a really special program there called Gallatin where you basically make up your own major. And so the whole school is – it's like Build-A-Bear University is what I used to joke about. But it's really like you can do independent study.

You can do work study. You can do classes. You sort of like hodgepodge this program together.

That's cool. And then while I was there, I was helping run Dorm Room Fund, which is First Down Capital's college university fund. It's about a million dollar a year.

Actually, it might be more than that. I'm not sure now. But a million dollar a year vehicle just for investing at PreSeed for student founders..

You. You. You.

You.
