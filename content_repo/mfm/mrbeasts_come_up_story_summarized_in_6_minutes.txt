dude right before this i was watching you saw mr beast went on joe rogan i don't know if you you caught the episode at all i didn't i just a couple of the clips where they said like what do you do with your money and he's like not much he goes i used to have a roommate up until recently and we split our place for 700 but i got a fancier place because someone broke into my house so i needed like some security but it's still like pretty normal of a house yeah i didn't see that so i've only seen one clip and it was basically the clip of like how did you make it on youtube and it's a great clip right like it's what's he say so he goes so he's 23 now and he goes i started doing this when i was 11 and joe's like what 11 he's like yeah he's like i came home and he's like i started doing this when i was 11 and he's like i sucked obviously at the beginning he's like so he's like he's like look at me now i don't look cool now like imagine me at like 12 like i was like you know pimply you know pimply face scrawny awkward mumbly kind of guy and like here i am trying to like make videos and he's like back then also youtube really there wasn't a thing like youtubers wasn't like a thing 12 13 years ago you know so it's like he's like yeah i just was doing it because i liked it he goes i hated school he's i never he's like in high school i just never even brought a book home like he's like i remember doing zero studying my parents got so mad at me he's like and then like when i turned 18 um he's like he's like basically so his his win it went in three phases he goes from 11 to 13 i was trying to make videos but i was like super embarrassed because they were so bad and joe's like do they still exist he goes no i deleted my channel when i turned 13 because like i got like i don't know like bullied in school a little bit i felt embarrassed so i deleted all those videos but i like started fresh uh again at 13 and like whatever i kept going he's like so then from 13 to like 17 or 18 i was just trying to make like videos all the time because my first video randomly got like 20 000 views he's like that was the best thing that ever happened to me i got like this instant hit and i was hooked and then like it didn't happen again for a while but like that first one which was about like he like hacked some video game like here's how it beat this level in a video game or whatever he's like some obscure game and it just like people wanted to know how to do that hack so that's how i got popular right away um or he's like that's how that video got popular and then i got i wanted to chase that that that feeling again so he's like i wasn't making any money he's like finally i got to the point where i was making a dollar a day and he's like yes and he's like so i saved up for like a few months and i bought a microphone and i was like yeah like now i sound good like here we go and he's like i just kept doing that i kept like making a couple bucks saving it and then like buy a camera or buy like you know like a better computer so i could like edit the videos or screen record or whatever and so he just kept doing that for like six years he's like my whole goal was that by the time i graduate from high school can i like just make enough money doing this because i don't want to do anything else what was his number so it did not happen he's like by the time i he's like by the time i graduated high school i was making like 400 bucks a month or something like that and he's like you know it's 300 400 bucks he's like so my mom gave me this ultimatum she's like you know you're moving out or you're like going to community college like you're not going to do this video thing and so he's like uh fuck okay he's like i didn't want to go to community college he's like it's like the worst thing in the world just sitting there listening to this lecture like it's not what i wanted to do he's like so i started skipping he's like every day i would just go to my car and instead of going to community college i would just edit videos in my car he's like i do that all day and i come home and my mom thought i went to school he's like and he's like that created a clock because now she was going to find out like by the end of the semester i had zeros as my grades like she was going to know that i did not go to community college so i had to like i bought myself like one semester more of time he's like and in that time i pulled it off like i got to the point where i could like self-sustain i just moved out and then i could like do this like full-time moving on my own he's like and so that's kind of like the progression of how i did it and i like how awesome is that how awesome is that exactly like a bet on yourself story where burn the bridge behind you right so so you know you uh we say burn the bridges i don't know why we say that it's burn the boats uh like if you want to take the island you got to burn the boats and so he burned the boats when he when he did that and uh and knew what he wanted to do right because like school's great but school's not for everybody if you if you kind of know what you want to do um you're much better off i think competing in the free market on that thing than like competing for your teachers like love and affection you know with writing the essay they want to grade as an a plus right like writing the thing they want you to write about in the format they want you to write in a way that will get them to give you the grade right like that's like that's like not a real market whereas you make videos on youtube you're competing in like a real market or you want to be an athlete yeah it's just that most people think that they're like going to do something for life and they aren't willing to or they don't actually want to i think i think the the rarity here is not is someone 18 and capable it's do they actually love what they're saying they love enough that they're willing to dedicate 10 or 20 years to it right yeah like do you know what i mean are you actually do you actually have a thing you love uh most people do not uh my i remember my sister when she was going to college my dad was like all right well like what do you want to major in she's like i don't know he's like well what's your favorite subject like what do you love to study she's like lunch like you know i just i think i'm not i don't have anything against any of them but like do any of them make me happy not really so what now what and like i think that's how most people's careers go it's like all right well i don't hate it but i don't love it but now what what am i supposed to yeah yeah so i think that's the rarity here is that he actually that he liked something enough um but anyway that's a good story i'll have to go and watch this podcast and które most conmaz受ca and Además because the message has been five to five and a half and it's really funny because i think i think if i know something is happening and that's not a good thing you know it's in your life and it's made his life because i think my marriage and i think that's why I think we could do that I love you I feel like you
