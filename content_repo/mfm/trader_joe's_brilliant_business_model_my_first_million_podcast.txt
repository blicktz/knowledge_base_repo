so there was this great write-up in the trends uh facebook group by this guy morgan or girl morgan i'm not sure exactly but morgan key and it was talking about hey the founder of trader joe's just died i think joe i don't know how you say the last name but joe from trader joe's uh passed away and um you know so he dug into the model and said uh what is it that makes trader joe's work and there's a bunch of really fascinating things where they basically broke all of the rules and i thought it was just like a great example of um of like you know when you want to do something different or you want to like make a splash in an industry like it pays to just change a bunch of the rules so some of the things that they do differently so they go through the rules so they uh most grocery stores have a ton of skews they're like oh people want all the options we got to carry everything that people ask for trader joe's has on average i think 4 000 skews average grocery store will be 40 000 so one tenth uh the number of skews um the next thing that i thought was interesting was they overstaff not understaffed so every other grocery is trying to sort of uh have minimal labor costs and they go the exact opposite direction and try to provide like an experience for shopping they private label basically all of their goods so how do you okay great i overstaffed possible i overstaffed but that's like expensive so where do they make their money back yeah they make their money back by not buying you know not by buying wholesale and selling retail they actually just private label their stuff and have a way bigger margin on their items so what's an example of that so like their tomato sauce for example they will have our salsa it'll be called trader joe's salsa and people will be like oh i love trader joe's salsa and it's actually the same exact salsa that somebody else carries they go straight to that supplier or manufacturer and they say hey we want our own line of this and so it's usually the trader joe's isn't making it no they they go to the supplier but they private label the that that exact item oh i didn't know they carry it they get a much bigger margin because they're cutting out the sort of retailer and they have all this pricing power to go to suppliers with and say hey we have all these locations so we are already a big customer from day one uh we want you to give us our own brand of popcorn our own brand of this our own brand of that and then on the other side that makes customers love it because people will get addicted to this and they think oh that pretzel that chocolate covered pretzel i loved i can only get it at trader joe's that's not the reality because there's no brand on it but they could actually get that same thing they just don't know the brand and it's from some other i have felt that exact same way about a lot of their products and so there was a there was a few other ones that i thought were interesting i'm gonna dig it up but uh talk for a second while i just so i'll tell you guys a quick story since we're talking about scaling i talked to max mullen at hustle con and you listen to this story he told me that when they first started who's max mullen max mullen started instacart okay he goes he goes our first store was trader joe's and they wouldn't let us go in there and they wouldn't give us all their inventory he goes i took it he goes it cost 25 grand i bought everything in the store we brought it to our apartment took a photo of it took pictures of every single thing i love it it was 25 000 he goes one of everything was about 25 grand and he did that with whole foods and then five other stores that's amazing okay a couple other points that morgan brought up so uh no data collection so they're not collecting data on their customers they don't ask for your they don't do sales coupons loyalty or or advertising uh the biggest expense so their marketing is samples in the store so they go above and beyond on samples and don't uh do a whole bunch of other promotional stuff they expanded very slowly so they have about 500 locations after 50 years and so uh they really went sort of slow and steady with their growth sort of like a in and out or whatever and are they owned by someone at the moment private company um i don't think they got bought by a private i think it's literally like owned by the original whoever's uh there's a couple people involved um and so in the end their price per sorry their earnings per square foot in their store so they'll earn two thousand dollars per square foot revenue um and like whole foods will do 1.2 uh k and then you know walmart will do 600k so they're way more profitable per square foot because of our way more revenue per square foot because of these um uh these different changes they made to the standard model of the store i dig that i uh yeah we we should i don't know why we didn't we should publish that i think it's a 10 billion dollar uh company overall i thought they were owned by all these for some reason you might be right i don't know on that but uh shout out to morgan i thought this was a great breakdown uh love it do more of that in the groups we love this stuff and we'll share the information uh because yeah more people need to learn from this stuff so that's actually an interesting take which is what are the interesting components that make something special so we're doing this thing that we're going to publish on tuesday on hotels and i thought that that was really interesting and so it's not live yet so i haven't been able to read all of it but basically a lot of the largest hotel chains what they do is they don't actually own the property i mean or sorry sometimes they own the property but it's all franchised yeah and so 90 of their money is made via franchising hilton's marriott's whatever yeah i had no idea yeah uh and so that's one of like the secret sauces which is you have to do franchising and it's really expensive like could be 10 million dollars to start a marriott franchise right very expensive that's not that expensive 10 000 that's cheap for sorry i said 10 million oh 10 million okay like it could be millions of dollars okay yeah that's a lot it's crazy and so what what we've been doing on trends and what i have always loved doing which is what's like what's like the the thing that makes something special what makes it tick yeah so for example with software typically it's just um uh what makes a great software business is like there's i'm i'm just riffing here but i'd have to find the exact numbers but it's like are is the annual revenue per customer at least five thousand dollars um can you make it so churn is only four percent a month and then there's uh probably only one or two more rules but it's usually churn and can it be at least five grand a year for a sas business you're talking about yeah and so i love seeing those like yeah you want so what investors do is they see so many deals and they talk to so many founders and they do this for a number of years they get to see how these play out they start to do what they call pattern recognition which has pros and cons the pros is great you can recognize a good thing when it's a good thing the con is if you're trying to make everything fit your pattern you'll miss the outliers and that's a that's a big issue but um but it's worth it's still a tool in your tool belt that you should have so i feel like it should this should not just be investors that do this this should be entrepreneurs as well so you should be looking at different businesses industries breaking them down uh listening to podcasts like this or others and um trying to identify the patterns and commonalities and try to characterize okay what made that business tick what made this have a different outcome than that uh what are the sort of uh minimum requirements on let's say churn or customer you know customer value um for a sas business to work and start to get these rules of thumb or like kind of common patterns in place in your brain yeah and what what i've been trying to do is figure it figure out those on on all types of things yeah and that's been exciting you
