yeah we have the big spectacle we have the screens we have the thing when we hit our donation goal there's going to be the big like fireworks or whatever for doing the mo that's the moment so the difference between us and everybody else is that we also care about the moments between the moments all right sean do me a favor go to our document and look at the video that i posted to the instagram to the instagram link so i found this this weekend i was sitting in the bath just chilling watch this right before the pond i watched this yeah does that okay so i was sitting in the bath just chilling watching instagram you ever sit in the bath you know like bath sundays you just kind of sit for a few minutes i have kids dude my bath is very different than yours now well that's true so i just it was sunday bath just chilling going through instagram and i got this video of this lady uh it's a woman from germany i think she's german and a guy and they're running together on a 200 meter race at the paralympics she's blind and he's the guide runner and they win the race and they start hugging and she's all crying is that the coolest video you've seen today or what this i didn't actually understand what was happening it just looks like they're racing against each other uh i wouldn't have even known what this was if you hadn't said anything so she's blind and she's must not be fully blind and what they do in the paralympics is she's like if you're if you're not yeah they put a blindfold on everyone because some people might be legally blind and they could still kind of see a little bit and so what they do is they put this blindfold on everyone and then these women are are like really fast women so like another woman can't be their guide because there's just you know faster men who can keep up and so it's they're all teamed up with a guy who helps their foot into the blocks and puts their hand in the right place and then has to run alongside them stride for stride and they'll say like all right you're in second now or like you're in first like all right we're on the straightaway like pretty cool stuff and it seems really rewarding i'm gonna do this so i've contacted um a track coach you saw this video you got emotional you know the bath bombs started hitting and uh the eyes started getting misty and you just decided this is what i'm born to do i'm gonna be a guide runner or you want somebody to guide you which one are you trying to do so uh so here's the deal i am now i'm still fast enough that i am as fast as some of these blind women i'm not as fast as the blind men but i can keep up with the women a little bit and i probably have five more years where i can keep up with them and so i can't i'm not good enough to go to the olympics i never was and particularly now as i get older i'm not good enough this is my shot this is my way to get into the olympics is to be a guide runner for the for a blind lady this somebody called you out on twitter for this they go he did it the perfect sam backhanded compliment because you were like backhand complimenting myself yeah kind of yourself i don't know the whole sport because you were like like i'm not as fast as i used to be and i'm still fast enough with this to keep up with an elite blind woman that wasn't my point i'm just saying like it's just a fact they're like this lady she ran 23 seconds i can run 23 right now i'm not there's no there's not like not even stretching no and and this isn't even like uh but this is like awesome i think it's awesome i think it'd be way more fun i'm not like making fun of these people you have to be a good person to do this at the paralympics you're not a good enough person dude we we were too rough around the edges me yeah you're gonna get canceled before the race you're gonna say dude i tip like 50 when i go out to eat i'm a great guy yeah that's what you gotta ask yourself where's that coming from what what are you trying to cover up with these 50 tips i'm a good dude man i'm glad you could do this i'm glad you brought up the olympics so um probably don't even know this the winter olympics are going on right now half the people learn that like yesterday they're going on right now the ratings are like the lowest it's ever been all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it because that's who you are uh winter olympics in general are like you know less popular than the normal olympics um some people are super into it my buddy trevor uh he's my roommate he loves the olympics like the olympics would come around he's like clear the schedule 24 7 i'm just watching whatever's on and like i kind of got into it with him i do that too by the way so only for the summer no no no winter aren't real exactly exactly so um you should say that when you're in the winter olympics uh guide bobsled team just be like i can't wait to do this for a real sport um so so i was so i i was watching the super bowl then like after the super bowl just like immediately auto cut to the winter olympics and um and i was watching somebody do like the toboggan and i just thought of a very controversial take this take was too spicy for twitter i didn't even dare put it on twitter because i was like i'm gonna get so much heat for this the toboggan is the person who lays on the sled i thought it was the luge okay maybe i maybe it was a bobsled maybe it was a luge maybe it's a toboggan what was it like one person it was one person they were running different pushing the thing yeah the difference is is that one they go face first and one they go like on their bet on their back on their butt legs first so completely irrelevant to what i'm saying the yes one of those was happening and then i thought i so so our buddy nick tweeted this out during the super bowl because nick likes to just like stir the pot on twitter that's like his character on twitter and he was like watching sports are a complete waste of time you know what i'm doing right now i'm working on my business that's how you get ahead when everybody's zigging you zag and he's doing something like that and then by the way earlier that day he was texting us photos of him partying so yeah dude he's parties all the time like this guy's not like nick lives like the uh the most charmed life he's like oh you know i'm tired of playing golf so i'm gonna now relax right like guys got like i guess self-storage is a pretty hands-off business so you know he's got a lot of time on his hands but he likes to tweet stuff to pop and uh so people started you know fighting about it here's my take that's kind of like that that i just didn't want to get into on twitter the olympics are an example of how to waste your life so here's here's the spicy take so i i'll explain i i understand that's harsh but uh but here's the here's the take i once was uh listening to an interview with this guy max levchin max levchin created paypal which is a pretty important like internet invention ability to send money to each other on the internet so he creates paypal paypal becomes a huge success and for his next act do you remember the company that he started next it was called slide i think slide and uh describe what slide did for the people it was advertising technology or games i forget but it didn't know it was like well many many little mini apps on top of myspace and facebook so it'd be like that's right yeah like you want to put up a slideshow of like photos with some music on it you slide you want to throw sheep at your friend you slide slide makes all these apps that are like you know poke your friend oh we created an app called double poke it's better than they made money through ads i think it was so it was ultimately almost like it was just like a way to get lots of impressions and then ultimately the whole thing lost money didn't make any money if they they ended up selling to google mostly because of max i think i think it was google that bought them um so they whatever it didn't it ended up working but the point was they go max you did paypal then you had slide which which had like explosive growth on top of these really fast growing social networks but ultimately kind of fizzled out you know like what have you learned he said one thing that like has stuck with me it stuck with me which means i i must have been guilty of it many times for this to stick with me this this hard he goes well here's what i learned with slide you can spend be careful because you can spend your whole life optimizing for nothing and um and he's like you could optimize anything to the to the infinity degree he's like so we come out with super poke or whatever their apps were at the time like you know super poke it's like better than a poke and then all of a sudden i have these brilliant engineers from stanford and whoever else and their job every day was to increase the poke per user ratio by this much to get clicks up to get it you know to earn an extra three cents per click and ultimately we spent years just optimizing the viral coefficient of how i can get super poke right across my space it's like and his message was be careful because it doesn't matter how smart you are anything can be optimized to like infinity so pick wisely like you know the the same brain power and energy went into building paypal just went into building these silly apps on slide and i've been like you know there's been my thing my my sort of mountain to die on which is like project collection is everything but you are so wrong but this is the olympics this is the olympics this person who's who's running and then diving into this toboggan they basically to me they got tricked by society society basically told them hey you know what devote your whole life give up everything basically to train every day to become the best in the world at this arbitrary thing that we've made fun of you're not are you gonna make a lot of money from it no are you going to uh you know develop these like you know amazing other aspects of your personality in your life no you're gonna go super single-minded to turn yourself into a human weapon of doing this one random thing sliding your body in a tube down this chute for 40 seconds and your job is to get it from 40 seconds to you know to 39.98 seconds that is your life and then hey when it's over uh good luck just go figure out the rest of life now that you're you've peaked at age 26 and then you know go ahead and figure the rest of life out so i think the olympics are an example of optimizing your life on the dumbest shit okay go all right i'm gonna make an argument to say why you are entirely incorrect and i've got wonderful examples these are right top of oh i thought you were gonna tell me i'm an idiot incorrect you're an idiot and here's why sports represents so much more there's only basically two things that transcend language religion and culture it's basically art and sports i think those are the only two things maybe family but that's about it and so what sports represents is so much more than just optimizing the the seconds not only is it about like the um being disciplined and all that and how those are good qualities but it's it's about culture so think about this in the 19th uh i think it was 33 olympics or 32 olympics in berlin it was in it was in uh berlin and and hitler was in the stands doing a z cal and they were still getting there at that point they just started like you know messing around with the jews and getting rid of them jesse owens wins the long jump and 100 meter dash when hitler's saying like well the arian race is the best race and anything you know outside of that is inferior and jesse owens sticks it to him another example is this woman named um catherine switzer you probably don't know who she is but have you ever seen this famous picture of this woman running a marathon and there's a priest pushing her out of the road so okay so her name's catherine switzer look it up so look up uh marathon woman push and you'll see this famous picture so for a long time women were not allowed to run marathons so there was no such thing as first of all women weren't even in uh the olympics and they thought that like oh women are just too weak to run and this woman came along and uh i don't remember what year it was i think it was the 70s and she starts running this marathon and there's this famous picture of this guy pushing out of the street and that like signals to all women like no f this you could do it all right you got this and then you got guys like this guy who you can't see all the way his name's steve prefontaine steve prefontaine he ran in the 1960 uh 1972 olympics i believe in uh uh munich uh munich and what happened at that olympics was basically a bunch of terrorists took over and they killed a bunch of israeli athletes have you heard about this they took over this helicopter they kidnapped these israeli athletes these wrestlers they threw them in the helicopter the israeli army tried to like capture them and it blew up and it and it ruined the whole olympics and you know what they said the next day they go at this we got to go compete we this is what we have to do we got to compete we got to bring this together and steve prefontaine this guy who's on my wall he was at the olympics and he said these amazing quotes like to give anything less than your best is a sacrifice the gift he eventually inspired this guy phil knight and bill bowerman to go start a company that they called nike and steve prefontaine was their first athlete and this is all because of the olympics and this is all because of sport and the olympics happens just every four years that it's one way to like bring a beginning and an end to the last trailing four years of training and preparing and discipline and accumulates in this thing this is incredibly essential it represents race relations women's rights but go look at the um every year at the olympics they do the the procession where your country comes in they've got this thing called um i forget what they call it but it's for people who are going through war and who don't have a country so for example i believe in uh london i think it was like uh sudan or or the congo republic i forget one of those countries was not considered a country by like they're going through civil war and so they just said hey we're just gonna create a refugee country you now have your own country or when taiwan and hong kong are going through their issues it's a huge deal that for the olympics that they announced well are they gonna have their own country or are they not or uh recently a kenyan swimmer was in the first ever summer olympic swimming this is beyond sports this is a really big deal that's my plea that's why i think this is actually awesome tell me how you really feel that was good right that was good um just tell me one thing who's the who's the who's the greatest um luge uh competitor of all time can you just name them um everything that i just said was only for the summer olympics the winter olympics are fake if you need a judge on your sport it's probably not that real of a sport that's why track and field swimming and all those like races that's why they're like real sports yeah so everything i said no no no that that that it's only every four years so i'm mostly just messing around also i like i like watching the olympics in general i think it's cool obviously i think it's cool if people like excel in things that's that's awesome my point is i think that there's like uh you know like for example if my kid was like had the potential if you told me right now hey your kid has the potential to be the greatest you know like at uh whatever um the greatest third person in the bobsled in uh in the country but here's what you have to do every day every weekend for the you know the the next 20 years of their life is going to go into optimizing their body and mind to be able to do this which essentially is what goes into like becoming an olympian right you're trying to become the best in the world at an arbitrary game that was made up and you have to sacrifice a huge amount of your life and focus and attention and energy and talents you decide to invest into this and the thing you get out is character building life lessons um and you can get that from the boy scouts you know potentially a moment of fame when if you won if you actually did achieve the thing and you have the you know sort of the the the knowing inside your heart that that this was this was good so like you know would i rather be you know steve prefontaine this you know this good looking mustached runner guy or would i rather have been phil knight i'd rather be phil knight i think actually he's the perfect example what did prefontaine get out of you know nike nothing and so he actually uh where's he now right he died three years into funding the company from a drinking driving accident so yeah you're right okay okay that's not so funny it didn't work out wait so he was actually a co-founder of nike or he just inspired them um he he he was he was in their crew and he was their first sponsored athlete and like their fifth or tenth employee or something like that and um if you ask phil knight who you know what's who's nike's mentor or sorry who's nike's mascot they'll say it's prefontaine yeah so anyways my point is uh i think that there's a lot of things that are fun and they're best done as hobbies versus trying to become the best in the world at it right uh i can play you know call of duty and have a bunch of fun with my friends um i can even play you know the competitive side of things just because i like to scratch that itch and i play a couple hours a week but once i try to become the best in the world at it the level of sort of sacrifice and over indexing on that thing and hey you could do it you could over index on anything you can try to become the fastest typer in the world you could try to become the best photographer of brown leafs in the world and you know like you could do all those things so choose carefully choose which one you want what you really want to go into it's like people who dedicate their lives to be an average d3 basketball player it's like it could work you could you could you could go to the nba but like odds are the papers or the writings on the on the wall like it's probably not going to happen so maybe you should actually like study a real major instead of basket weaving or communications right and if you enjoy it fantastic if you're enjoying every step of the way fantastic but a lot of things in my experience are most enjoyable when done as hobbies versus when done with the competitive pursuit of becoming the absolute best in the world at it uh our the guy used to work out of his his dojo he used to tell me that i was like oh yeah i really like this so i might start a business around it he goes oh yeah this dave grows by he goes easiest way to fuck up a hobby he's turned it into a job and i remember just hearing that being like that's interesting i actually never really thought about that yeah actually there are some things that are really fun as hobbies that become really unfun as jobs right it's like working at a cinnabon right it's like oh yeah i love eating cinnabon uh working at a cinnabon smelling a cinnabon eating free cinnabon anytime you want now it's not so funny that's how i feel about business sometimes like whenever i i go to my friend nick ray always hosts these meetup these meetups and i'm his friend so i go and he's like say your name and what you do for work and i'm like i don't want to say what i do i'm sick of talking about work that's all i ever talk about his business like i don't want to talk about that ever again right so i i feel you all right let's do some other stuff um okay i don't know where we want to go we can go ideas or we can just shoot that's all we have i think well i have a couple things i didn't actually put them on this list yet but uh okay so i'll give you a quick idea um i was in a pitch meeting so this founder was pitching me his company and uh he was just like screen sharing so he's showing me a product demo and it was like a it's like a data analytics uh tool and he was like yeah so like check this out if i go to excel and then he like he just opens up the browser i've never seen this before he goes he just opened up the browser he goes sheets.new enter and then he opened up a google sheet like a blank spreadsheet and i go i go whoa what's just what was that and he goes oh yeah i'll tell you guys i'll show you later because he was because he was so annoyed with me just going on tangents about every random thing he was doing like he wanted to show me his product not the fact that you could type sheets.new and save myself like i google google drive then i get to drive then i click new then i go down the menu then i find spreadsheet then i click new spreadsheet then i get to a sheet it's like this like annoying thing i do six times a day and um and so just seeing this was like well that's awesome and it reminded me that there's a whole company out there called go links have you ever heard of go links no what is that so so i saw this in a um or when i was working at twitch the kind of like whoever the i don't even know his job title like vp of everything the kind of that number two guy at twitch um my boss this guy dan he was like he's like god we have so many documents in this company and now i just have bookmarks and tabs just with like all these docs open at all times in this company he's like and if i ever want to look up like oh the annual plan it takes me like five minutes every time i want to find it because i don't know why we don't just use go links and what go links does is it lets you set up a thing that's like go dot annual plan or like you know you could just basically type in like a human readable link and you could anchor it to any doc and so let's say you know you that's anchored to the 2021 doc oh now it's 2022 cool we just swap the link out we just are so we like we could still always type go slash you know uh annual plan or go slash plan and go slash pan will now take us to the 2022 doc and i saw this i was like wow this is actually so useful to just be able to quickly find and like revoke access properly to to different documents and so um so i really like this most people haven't heard of this and i think it's a very expensive tool i think it's like a pretty like enterprisey tool i see at the top here they raised a 27 million 27 million dollar series a okay so doing pretty well obviously so i think somebody could build this is like a very simple product i think somebody could build a go links for like the startup level world more like you bro indie hackers i just invested in one oh really what is it yes so i'm not a setup too i swear i i told you about it uh it's called nira and oh i'm in this too i'm in this too oh i i so that's the same thing right so this is this is slightly different i don't think they do the the shortcuts to the links maybe this is a feature they should add what they are doing what nira is doing is we all companies have all these docs and then people get fired or they move teams or whatever but people still have access it's like oh yeah i still got this link it just opens up the like the numbers for the company or like yeah this contractor we hired still has access to all of our files but like who the heck can go audit and keep up and scrub the access for this thing that's like it's like a very big problem like your company's most sensitive data is all in the cloud and then the cloud like access is shared amongst like so many people and there's no central place to see who sees what and so nira's building that they're building the who has access to what yeah but i think the link thing is a feature maybe yeah maybe it is a feature i'm saying i think it's a feature that can be standalone because adopting something like nira is like something that's going to go through my like you know chief security officer type of thing like this is going to go through our cio or cso whereas this go links thing is something that like you know me and my one person who i work with like we're both just irritated with these super long ugly google google docs links that like um you know like we can't find anything it takes forever to find stuff they they have a free plan nira does no go links oh go links does yeah yeah i think yeah i don't know what at what point they they do this but i don't know why this is not more popular this is like a like a real problem and then this also just got me thinking like what else is like this what what are the other problems that are like these like i call them paper cut companies so um you know death by a thousand paper cuts so like what's a thing that's irritating but you do it so often that it's just a constant paper cut that just annoys you screenshots is another one that like sharing screenshots was one that was a big paper cut uh i invested in this company called bubbles that tries to make that better loom is it working better i remember bubbles is it working uh i don't know i haven't caught up with them in a little while i know it was working initially they raised much money uh from that but i feel like it hasn't taken over like you know the loom market yet but maybe it's going into a different market i'm not dude the screen the screenshot one's a good idea also the copy and paste the copy and paste i've been thinking for years how can i optimize a copy and paste yes a better clipboard i've been thinking about that for a long time um it's been that's always an interesting thing to me is is is the clipboard that's really intriguing but the the problem with these types of products is you have to truly be inventive i don't particularly have that muscle to like be that creative so people who invent things like this or like even like um what's that guy named howie who's got the huge company uh air table air table uh creating something like air table which is basically kind of like excel but different and better or even creating like a notion i don't like these people kind of are geniuses who can like come up with like these weird product features and like they just know that like if you hover your mouse over this it needs like that they're so complicated they're so complicated it's pretty amazing yeah they um they're big on details and i'll tell you the the best thing i heard about details like this i'm i'm not detail oriented like if if this camera showed my desk you would see like yeah i'm obviously not organized or detail oriented like everything is sloppy even my camera right now is actually slightly crooked but i just don't care i just don't care about details and pretty much anything i do so that's why you're talking with like your neck a little yeah that's why i often do this i end every podcast with a crick um but you know like i'm not a sweat the details person but i remember the first time i used slack i used slack really early on it was like in beta i should have invested in it i just wasn't an investor back then i didn't think about it that way but i used it and i remember the first thing one thing i did was i i was telling our designer hey uh yeah here's the color for like our logo or whatever or they sent it to me and they just sent the hex code so like you know hex you know like pound cff or you know 373 and it just cre it turned it into a small tiny color swatch and i remember thinking why the fuck did they do that like what level of care went into caring that the hex code would just auto format with a little swatch next to it that's what i mean nobody would do that unless you were like a real product designer who sweat the details who used this product all the time and just dedicated yourself to like anytime you could just scratch your own itch and irritate you know like remove one paper cut from your own user experience you're gonna do it and so this is why also working on your own products working on products that you want to be the user of helps because you'll get so annoyed at the paper cuts you'll just get rid of them yourself all right let me give you an example of another one so i'm only bringing this up because of colors so i've told you about this company called wgsn they make 90 million dollars a year and they tell it's a bowl it's like an info product all about colors i don't want to talk about that but so ben go to so it's called coolers.co c-o-o-l like cool o-r-s.co coolers.co so basically whenever i'm creating a new product or a new website you have to pick like a good color scheme oh this is great this is badass dude it's so good so basically let's say that like for me mostly i'm just like a black and white guy i want the text to be black i want the background to be white but then you still need like some radiant of gray and then you want the links to be some like gradient of red what goes good with that what goes good with this color of blue and so what you could do is look at the very bottom where it says um when you see the lock button when you see so basically it shows you five colors you can randomly select one or you could tell which one you want and let's say you like the blue you click lock on that and then it shows you four more that fit that then you click lock on the next one and it shows you three more that fit that is this golden is this website amazing or what that's amazing that is so good and i love when i i've been going this for years and years and years at first it started out just like this tiny little project now it gets like five million monthly uniques according to similarweb and it's got a pro version it's got all these amazing versions so yeah it's five million monthly uh monthly uniques it's got a figma plugin a chrome extension it's got all this amazing stuff and they have a pro version that i actually don't know what you get with the pro version but how neat is this this is a paper cut problem that actually i bet has turned into a business that makes many many many millions of dollars a year and this is the type of company that you could own for like 30 years and it probably would make pretty consistent seven figure profit every single year yeah how does this one make money does it uh charge for anything so they do a couple things if you look on the top you'll notice that they have a squarespace ad so they have it has ads and then they they have a pro version so it's only it's billed 36 a year which is stupid and you get uh lots of different um features um but i would charge like way more because you already know that this company has like a like a basically what you would do is if i own this i log on i look at all the email addresses i've ever collect i do like a control find uber adobe whatever like companies that have bought it and i go and upsell them on some like crazy high thing right can i tell you um the philosophy again i'm not detail oriented but here's a philosophy i heard that i was like oh this explains why some things when i was i'm from some products some experiences some hotels when i go into them i'm like this just feels good what's going on here i can't even put my finger on what feels good about it i was talking to scott harrison he's the founder of charity water and charity water puts on dope events everything they do is dope so like i think when he was starting it he heard some quote that was like um isn't it sad that charity is marketed with less um less like um less design and style than um you know the the 73rd brand of toothpaste it's like yeah it's like true it's like you know like a crest or like you know whatever right aqua aqua whatever it's called aqua fresh you know like the they put more design and marketing and energy into like how that looks and feels and the colors and the the typeface and all that than a charity that's saving children would put into their brand so he decided early on all right i'm gonna build an epic charity brand because i think it's gonna matter i think people are gonna donate more if we come across if we do better marketing like we can't just like say that that's only for rich companies and we're this poor non-profit that always has to look crappy and so he does he he's a photographer so he takes photos they put on epic events so at their events if you ever go to one of their events it just flows it's just nice like every everything just feels good right he was a former club promoter so he gets it and he goes my i go i go dude what what is it about your events i was like because you have the big spectacle like at any event like every time he does an event he tries to up it from the year before so there's always like this like spectacle where it's like there's 10 000 screens and on every screen is one person from one village that we are gonna fund tonight it's like okay that's the spectacle and that's always cool but i was like dude it's the other stuff that like i don't know why it just feels different what is it he goes my wife victoria she's the brains behind this she has a phrase for this she goes um all the magic is in the moments between the moments i go what she goes it's the moments between the moments and i was like what does that mean he goes yeah we have the big spectacle we have the screens we have the thing when we hit our donation goal there's going to be the big like fireworks or whatever for doing the mo that's the moment so the difference between us and everybody else is that we also care about the moments between the moments what's it going to be like in between those moments everybody else only puts their energy to those we focus on the moments between the moments and i just started i was like i still don't really understand how to use this but it became this like kind of mantra so anytime i really want to pull something off like today's valentine's day i'm trying to pull something off it's like what are the moments between the moments that i could just level up here because that's where to the other person they're like oh you didn't have to do that like this took extra care to like to think about you know the walkway between the two rooms and not just what's in the two rooms now that i'm a hotelier i'm reading the biography of the guy who started the four seasons and he talks about he started in the 60s and he was like before then like people didn't necessarily have like the fanciest mattresses so we went and just got the best mattresses that money could buy or like you couldn't get your um shoes cleaned at a hotel and so we just hired a guy to clean shoes or um the showers weren't necessarily good so our showers were just almost as good as every other shower but we just got the best shower heads and he was like oh we just focused on all these really tiny things and it added up and made it amazing right do uh have you read this the the main guy for hospitality there's like the shake shack guy i think he's written one danny meyer his book's called setting the table yeah i read it it's awesome and then there's uh that guy chip you know this guy chip have you heard of this guy chip uh conley yeah he had a hotel business is it called hotel zephyr i think no so it's a boutique i think that's one of his hotel that's like the specific hotel his group is called something else uh he has a couple like a bunch of boutique hotels i guess he's chip conley yeah yeah he was like worked at airbnb for a long time right that's right i think he was like the advisor key advisor special advisor to like the founders of airbnb so in um in masters of scale did you ever listen to master scale episode about airbnb the about the five star experience thing oh yeah go ahead tell it so so you should do this for your airbnb so i do this for i do this for all my startups i'll do this at one point in time for everybody it's an amazing framework so founder of airbnb brian chesky goes on and they're talking about like okay what makes air what made airbnb special he goes okay we do this exercise i think he calls it the 12 star experience so he goes all right um he sat down with the team he goes okay uh a guest is gonna stay at an airbnb right that's our product our product is actually not the website where you book the thing it's the experience you have when you go to the place we all agree on that everyone's like yeah we all agree on that okay cool so uh what's a one star experience with airbnb it's like oh i i booked the place and my card gets charged twice for no reason now i gotta go contact support and then i never get a message from the guy so i'm uncertain when i get there about how i'm gonna get in um and then i get there and it looks nothing like the photos and there's cockroaches everywhere and the bed is you know the sheets are dirty whatever that's a one star experience okay cool what's a three-star experience so they they define a three-star experience it's like all those little moments but they're a little bit better and he's like all right what's a five-star experience and this is where the team the first time they do this exercise the team's like all right five-star experience is like you know um super easy to book on the website um you get there and the keys are in the lock box and it just opens up and uh you know it looks just like the photos and you're feeling good and the the host leaves you kind of like a bottle of wine on the table or like you know some mint a chocolate on your pillow let's put it that way he's like okay great that's a five-star experience everyone's like yeah that's five stars they're ready to like leave the meeting great we need to find it he goes cool what's a six-star experience and they're like oh boy what do you want us to say they're like okay instead of a mint you know chocolate on your pillow there's a bottle of wine he's like all right what's a seven-star experience and they're like all right seven-star experience you know they pick me up from the airport there's that they're standing there with a name on my name on the sign and they i don't have to go figure out the uber in the city they drive me home and then they you know on the way out they hand me you know a little cheat sheet of cool stuff in the neighborhood that i can go check out he like keeps pushing the envelope he's like what's a 12-star experience and he forces them to think through what the most magical experience could be using their product and he's like okay cool now we know what's possible now we know in the extreme scenario like we took the ceiling from here we blew the roof off and now we can go here right we took the knob we turned it to 10 and then we said no we want the volume to go higher and now we can take the volume up to 15. and sure we're not going to be able to deliver that every time but if we hadn't even thought about it like we couldn't ever dream of translating any element of that into our into our experience and at the company there was a time pre-covid when when they didn't have you know what the when covet happened like things change and like we got to survive just like most businesses but prior to that for a long time brian had been tinkering with building an airline and the reason being is the 12-star experience is basically well like what if we flew you there and you know the moment you booked we picked you up and you're on our flight and you know a perfect 12 star would be like it's your own plane this and that yeah and they were even tinkering with either opening an airline or offering flights right and that and that's an example that that that example didn't come to fruition because a bunch of stuff but that's an example of like man that actually could have been a reality from that exercise but other things did so for example the airbnb uh what's called experiences or whatever where okay you get to the city now what well my stay is not just the house i'm in it's what i do outside of the house well cool wouldn't it be awesome if we could take you on a wine tasting thing that could just be part of what was already booked for you it just turned out to be amazing it's like a local person guiding you through this thing not just this uh corporate you know um you know tour bus but like somebody who really actually like works at the winery who just does this in their spare time wouldn't that be an amazing experience and that actually became a part of the product and uh you know what if the photos weren't so crummy right so like all these things they they they like put effort into doing them to me that's how you translate the moments between the moments thing into real life so whenever i do this with our companies it's like cool so what would be a great experience oh you get the product and it works okay what's a what's a six star experience well the packaging actually our packaging kind of is weird it's like hard to open it'd be awesome if this just was easy to open i didn't have to go get the scissors and fumble with this oh yeah okay what else well it'd be cool if inside every package they also was this other little thing that would be awesome right and then like what if the founder followed up with like you know like hey how was it two days later and they you know they actually cared what i thought okay what what else and so this like this exercise of take your team through one star three star five star seven star nine star 12 star experience is like it works in any business not just hospitality damn yeah i i remember hearing this story years ago i think this he did this in like 2014 or 15 and it's always stuck with me yeah um can let me tell you about a company that i think i think i could i could start one of these and i think i could i could knock it out the park so there's this company that i've always talked about well actually no i'm gonna tell you about that in a second i want to tell you about one other thing there's this guy named sam ovens you know sam ovens uh is this the uh very like slick backed hair guy uh what's his thing consulting.com so he all right so this guy named sam ovens he rubbed me the wrong way for a long time and looking back i think i was actually wrong and he seemed like an all right guy so he had this website called consulting.com which if i had to put it at its worst it was basically a course that was like two thousand to ten thousand dollars that taught you how to start a business at best it's like it like it's a accelerator and the reality is it just like is a way to like it's like a community and a course on starting a company and he scaled it to like 30 million in revenue and it was just him and he hired all these people and built this office in new york and he was posting on social that they're doing 50 or 60 million in revenue and then he vanished and he had a youtube video come out today that says and he and he just says i'm back he's like for the past two years i hated life we scaled too quickly and so we were spending like 50k a day on facebook ads and we weren't even making that much profit so i decided to change everything and over the last two years we've crushed it he goes for example in january uh this course he goes we got rid of like there was three courses now we only sell two or one and last month in january we made eight hundred thousand dollars in revenue and our expenses which includes payroll and buy and paid ads was sixty thousand dollars and so basically this guy and and then he launched this new company called school which is basically like a facebook groups alternative because when he was launching courses he was like he stink so that is a different story that's actually cool but this course business this guy has now basically let's just times it by 10. so eight million in revenue with six hundred thousand dollars in expenses is that nutty or what is that crazy yeah but it depends is that sustainable and also is that going to grow so for example i know i don't think it's going to grow but i think it's going to be sustainable when i did the like all access pass it was like i was making whatever 50k a month off of the newsletter that paid newsletter making 50k a month what were my expenses it was like you know 300 a month for convert kit uh you know like a va for 500 a month whatever so look nutty but like that's because i had an audience so i could just sell into that if i wanted to grow it i would have had to like you know my expenses would have had to gone way up right you know like so it depends where yeah maybe his ad spend is really low now is that because his ads are ultra efficient or is because he had a lot a big list that you know they said that they don't they don't spend ads anymore but previously they had spent millions and tens of millions of dollars of ads so the website definitely already has yeah uh traffic traffic yeah so yes it's not like i talked to somebody who worked there um pretty early on so i was like is this guy legit they go he's legit he's good um they're like he he lived in new zealand or something like that he's a digital marketer uh then he has consulting.com which is basically like they had a course they had a consulting accelerator and they're basically teaching people how to start their own business their own consulting business and uh they said they told me at the time that there was like 10 million dollars of free cash flow a year and they said that um there it was about 30 million or something in revenue and he said like half of that so like 15 16 million was coming from one product which was a two or three thousand dollar course about how to start your own consulting business and then from there they upsell you into the five thousand dollar course about how to create a course and then uh once you get to five hundred thousand dollars in consulting revenue then you get to join a mastermind that will help you get to a million dollars plus and that'll cost you 25 or 50 grand or something like that and so that was their you know that was their model but you know half of it was coming from that kind of like entry level two to three thousand dollar course um where they like kind of sell you close you on the phone to like get you to buy the course which is yeah i went through the funnel to like so i got them to sell me online or to do the phone call and i was like i want to figure this out and it's pretty good man and i gave the guy a hard time because he's just kind of weird he just comes off serial kill he kind of patrick bateman he's kind of like the patrick bateman of our of our friend jack smith like the american psycho version of our friend jack smith and so he's like just like a little off but that's actually really incorrect of me to say because i don't i think he's just an oddball which is totally because i don't know the guy well yeah and i don't know him and i think that my judgment is just totally wrong i think he's an all right guy you're like i think it's wrong because it's all based on his haircut no i watched a lot of this guy's videos and i was like something is off here and i he was he was aggressively selling he is it was the type of guy where he's selling like a private jet uh like a video on a private jet right so that's not wrong but it's it's it's you know your cousins with wrong um and so i think that that it was just kind of odd but i thought that was interesting i thought you get a kick out of that all right but the second thing so go to board google boardroom insiders okay so this company was just bought the other day for 25 million dollars and it was bought by this company called euro money and so basically what it does is boardroom insiders provides executives with help on uh it helps them with their sales marketing and recruiting teams uh if your audience is a c-suite executive basically it's just a database that lists all the executives you can think of and for a bunch of big powerful ones it has in-depth profiles on them and it helps you map out who they know and um uh you can like follow an executive and it could like tell you like oh this person recently changed jobs and they claim that none of their information comes from scraping i don't buy that but it could be true and they also they say that base so so let's just assume that's not true and then we'll assume it is true in a second but assuming that's not true that means they get all of their data from basically these editors who are just scraping the web not scraping but like monitoring the web and manually creating this database of tens of thousands of executives and then selling it for tens of thousands of dollars and i think that's pretty amazing and i think that's interesting because there's this company called pitchbook that did something similar to this and what pitchbook did they pitchbook is owned by a publicly traded company they do like 200 million in revenue which means they're probably worth well over a billion at this point and what they did was they hired these huge teams of people in the philippines and they would basically call vcs and ask them if they invested in this particular company and then they would create a list of like all right here's we we triangulated this to this company raised this much money at this valuation from these five people these five people also invested in these things these things these things these 18 companies are growing at this rate based off their headcount growth on linkedin these fascinating databases is this is this interesting yeah i always like kind of i kind of admire a product like this i put this into beautiful businesses category why because um what's the product the product is data uh you sell it digitally you collect it through either automated scraping or outsourced you know kind of phone phone sales scripts you get every every bit of data you add in makes your whole data set more valuable and um and you could sell this thing for a very high price because the people who need it right like borderman insiders for example who needs it it's who needs access to the profiles of executives at companies it's like you know executive recruiters um they are willing to pay because they make a ton of money when they place a cmo at a company it's executive sales or executive marketing and so it's like people who are who have big budgets who spend a lot of money and they they don't have the time to like go figure this out themselves they'll they'd rather click a button and get the get the list and so um so yeah while i don't think these are the most fun and exciting business to build or like not like that good for the world you know uh i don't like admire them for those reasons they can be if you if you cared about it i think if i think there's a and there's not like i am fairly passionate about the pitch book version crunchbase is also a cool version that i'm like oh that's actually pretty sick i think there's a world where it could be cooler yeah yeah maybe it doesn't look like they have kind of like a lot of stuff on the person so it's like you know i'm i'm on one so this is doug yume he's the head of retail business they have like sample profiles on their site he's the head of retail business at amazon okay personal interests are golf and greek letter organizations rats i don't know i don't know what that's about and it's like here's the summary he did this before that he was working on this before that he was working on this it's like a resume doug likes golf and boofing let's go hire him and then it was like hey he was born in south korea grew up in kentucky it's like yeah you want if you want to build rapport real quick it's like here's his wife's name you know hey how's the wife how's how's young young nim you know like how's uh you know what here's what he's focused on are he he's bullish on retail business because on the q3 earnings call they said we're bullish on retail business okay yeah some of this is kind of like you know who's typing this in here uh but some of this could be useful i could see why this have you seen uh on the office michael takes notes on all of his clients and he's trying to get trying to teach green how to do it yeah he goes and dwight gets to know and he goes hello mr smith how is um greg 14 year old homosexual son how is your gay son yeah he's like it was written in he's like it was on green he's like and michael he comes to my he's like green means go i said do not go there that's what this reminds me of oh my god that's great um yeah so all right so this is this is a cool little website that's it can i tell you something uh interesting i saw so um the one the 0.01 rule so nathan barry came on the pod and he was cool so he's the the founder of convert kit he came on he was telling us about some blog posts that either he's written or that others have written that he liked so i went back and i read one of them and i saw this thing called the 0.01 rule have you seen this no okay so i'm pretty amazing i'm gonna pull up this uh where's the blog 0.01 rule wealth let me see if i can pull it up here um okay i'm not gonna be able to find it real quick here but i'll put the link in ben if you can find it or search nathan barry wealth ladder 0.01 so basically the way the guy's thinking he's like he's like you know um he's like he talks about price sensitivity and he's sort of like you know as you get more rich you um you know the way you think about money should change right this is like when i came to your house and you had like cvs receipts in the glove compartment because you were like saving them for like the three dollar thing you're like hell yeah and i was like dude you just sold your company for like many many millions of dollars uh what are you doing with these cvs receipts you're like ah i just like to do it it's a habit and so this guy talks about like the richer you get um you should sort of he's like he's like this works for when you sell something to somebody or yourself as you get to that level basically below 0.01 of your net worth so that's you take your net worth you multiply by 0.000 whatever you know one so it's like uh 0.01 of your net worth so let's say you're worth um let's do 100 million so 100 million what is it times what use 5 million right i'll use a little bit more of an approachable number here so um so that would be 500 for if you have five million dollars in net worth 500 is the threshold below which you don't really feel it you don't really care or feel it you're gonna become a little bit price insensitive below that point so that might be like you know opting for the you know the nicer hotel or like you just really don't give a you can just ball out at a restaurant you really don't care uh and so he draws this little curve and he's like at um at the first level of wealth it's like he calls it like level zero level one of wealth where it's like you know your 0.01 is like a hundred dollars or less than a hundred dollars at that point well a million dollars yeah a million dollars would be a hundred bucks yeah so he's like you know at that point like you know if you're at the grocery store and something costs an extra dollar like you care you don't want to buy the eggs that cost a dollar 99 more you care he's like then the next level the next jump up is you're like well i don't care at like you know it's the way he draws the chart it's like what are restaurant prices then the next one's like what are vacation prices it's like you don't even really care about how much your vacations cost the next one is like you you know you could fly first class and then the final one is like you know or the next one is like you can buy a crazy house you know you don't really get you're not really feeling uh house prices as much and then the final one is like you know what are prices anyways like you know this is when you're worth over 100 million dollars like at that point most things don't cost anything to you and um you're pretty insensitive to the cost of it so i'm just sort of summarizing the idea the the exact you know you can quibble about what you should or shouldn't care about but i thought it was kind of an interesting number and the reason i bring it up is very few people that i know are like properly price sensitive so there's a lot of people i know like my dad who no matter how wealthy they've got like the sort of like the trauma of not having money is so deeply ingrained in his body that like you know starbucks he's just like he's like pissed off when they charge even if he buys the coffee and like he's angry at the price he's like oh my god 4.99 like i could make this for so much less and they're like sir you're welcome to do that he's like oh like what's going on and you know he's anchored to prices from like the 80s when like you know that's why like he thought movie tickets should cost x and also you know it just like hurts him to spend more than some amount regardless of what's in his bank account and so he's kind of on one side of the spectrum too cheap and then this other side of spectrum which is where more where i am where it's like dude you should really kind of like pay attention to this you're kind of spending like pretty crazy and uh you know completely price insensitive is on the other side and then there's like whatever the sweet spot is and then school they don't really teach you how to how to like gauge that or what what those kind of like what even should be a good number for this what should i spend on things so you you don't get nervous like i i freak out a little because as an entrepreneur like some years i just like knock it out the park and make so much money other years i make nothing uh i mean hopefully i don't think nothing will ever happen again but like there's times you don't get nervous about running out no actually like two months ago i was like oh my god i have like no cash left no cash on hand left i was i was investing in everything i saw i was putting money into startups into crypto into stuff i was then i was spending a bunch like my payroll expanded and i was like oh my god i have like so little cash in my account i felt that way too it was under i had 60 grand in cash and i was like i feel low yeah i think it was like 38 000 was in my like whatever wells fargo checking account i was like where'd all the money go this was like well and i was like oh yeah i guess and i looked at the like out outgoing thing and it was like it's not that my spending had gone up i was really just investing a lot of money but i was like wow i should uh i need to manage cash for most of the time for me it's like i need to send my invoices for like things you know like i was like all right i'm gonna teach a course and i'm gonna invoice you know for the podcast and i'm gonna like do the things that bring in like cash today versus most of the things i invest my money into are like long-term illiquid things or my own businesses right like uh maybe i should take a withdrawal out of my business and like put money in my bank account and so so you know it was just like a reminder of that but no i i don't really get too worried about that um and maybe you know again i think i'm too far on the dial of like willing to spend on whatever ramit safety this is pretty much what his entire uh not course but his entire image and content is about which is like he's got this podcast where two people couples argue like we have we're worth three million dollars and he got into a fight with me because i spent eighty dollars on this silly thing and ramit's all about that it's i have i'm more like your father than i am like you like and i think it's just rooted it's it's rooted in like trauma like just fear uh i've got the same thing where it's like it's like it bothers me so much like for example um commenter coffee um i they sent me some for free it's so good but it's a dollar fifty per cup and compare that to like your bean coffee i'm like a dollar fifty sometimes i don't even drink the whole thing and so like i've been really struggling with like is that worth it is this worth it or the backsplash on my sink in my kitchen we need to replace it and it's eight hundred dollars and i've been fretting over it for over a year now i'm like uh eight hundred dollars to replace that like you can't so even though it will add value to the home and also make me happier i understand why your dad thinks that way it's really it's real i think it's challenging when you're it's like it's like you know it's proper trauma i think of like you felt one way for years and now you suddenly like things are different yeah maybe we actually need money therapy uh money therapy specifically i think that's actually a good idea here so therapy is this broad thing that has like a bunch of associations with it and mostly is like stigmas and blah blah blah i think somebody needs to spin off and ramit sounds like he's kind of doing this which is money therapy is a great idea financial therapy um and it's like yeah i have a money coach or you know you probably need to switching therapy to coach is the is the hack to like oh i'm focusing on performance and not like uh you know fixing a a broken part of me uh but in reality it's that i tried finding people like this and when i met them i was like look we're just getting to know each other not a financial advisor different thing no i know i thought when i i would go to therapy for a lot and i would and i would go when i whenever i trying out a new therapist i'd be like so i'm not gonna like i'm not trying to sound like a douche or big-headed but like i'm a high high achiever like i want to like conquer the world and like do cool shit and so i don't want to talk like this is this is the the the place that i'm coming from like i'm high octane baby can we can we make this happen do you have the tools necessary or no or do you like specialize just in like you know like traditional what what were you really trying to tell her you were trying to tell her that my problems are not like i'm not broken i'm trying to like just achieve a higher level of success or were you trying to know what i'm an a player are you an a player therapist is that what you were trying to ask her what were you trying to ask him no the blunt way to explain it is i've got rich i'm i'm complaining about some rich people problems and like i'm just like mostly just insecure about certain things and i want to like use that to like conquer the world i'm not verified on twitter yeah and like i'm gonna complain about stuff that sounds super weak because like on outside like everything's going great but i need you to like empathize that like i'm trying to like go places and i don't need you to tell me that like well you made a million dollars that last year isn't that good enough like no dog that's not like i need you to understand like what like what's at stake here you know what i mean and sam what is at stake here that's like you're better i'm gonna be i'm gonna be your money therapist but you know what i mean like totally it's so like i would meet people and i'm like oh you've only worked with like a certain type of person you have like i don't think you understand i don't think you'll be able to help me yeah yeah exactly i i know what you mean it's the reason tony robbins gets paid a million dollars plus per client because it's like his clients are serena williams and ray dalio and you know or whoever yeah and he himself is successful and his other clients are you know objectively very successful but everybody everybody um you know can improve the you know the little voice in their head dude while we're on the uh random random random topics did you watch the tinder slender no but i saw your picture with it so what's the what's the like the the okay so you guys don't okay so here's here's what happened it's kind of an amazing thing um there's a guy so the document it's a documentary about this guy who goes on tinder and his tinder profile looks like uh you know he's kind of like a normal-ish looking guy but he's like clearly living a cool lifestyle like lots of travel in different climates kind of wearing very nice clothes that's his profile all right so girls swipe right on him and they start chatting with him and he he basically what he ended up doing was he ended up conning women out of money and it was like a ponzi scheme so what he would do is he would meet a woman on tinder take her out on a date kind of wine and diner make it look like he's this baller of a guy and he you know is just like like a prince out of a fairy tale he just loves her the average looking girl who's average job just from an average city and then all of a sudden he's like come on my private jet and come do this with me and they go together and there she's like oh my god it's all happening i am that princess that he picked and he cares for and so he he starts talking to him and his backstory is that he um his dad owns a diamond company and he's the son of a billionaire and if you google you see that this guy's a son of a billionaire so he kind of like had created this profile around that and um and then you know sure enough a month in he's like um hey you know like he's he's like oh you know he sends a picture of his body he's always with the bodyguard he's like my bodyguard got attacked oh my god and she's like oh my god is he okay he's like yeah but you know they're telling me i can't use my credit cards anymore because they're tracking my location you know like these are enemies for our company the diamond business is a ruthless business and he's like uh can i borrow your credit card for the time being while i uh you know because i can't use mine yet and she's like uh okay and he's like cool just make sure you get your limits raised because like i have business meetings and all this stuff so these women end up going like 150 200 000 in debt as he racks up credit card debt then he's like hey go get a quick loan and send me the money i need it because you know my enemies are after me and he's like my enemies are after me and so you the documentaries the first half of the documentary is these women talk about how they fell in love and the second half is like how they got conned basically and he's like a ponzi scheme so he's well he'd fall in love with one woman or he'd get them to fall in love with him get them to start giving him money and credit cards he'd be using that to wine and dine the next woman and then he would be doing this with multiple women at once telling them all the same things and then he was living this like extravagant lifestyle on all these women's dime and um and then you know so that's that okay that's the core of the movie quick reaction to that then i'm gonna tell you some other stuff well what happened to him so how does this end it ends with he gets exposed so the women are like oh my god you know they they go to the credit card company they're like look i have to be honest like my kind of boyfriend you know or i don't know what's going on this is the guy he's tricking me and like they he's there can we see a picture of the guy and he she shows a picture on her phone and the two like agents from like amex or whatever just look at each other like it's him and then she's like what it's like we've been after this guy for years uh he does this with tons of women they're like there's other women he's doing this too and so it's like they feel cheated on plus conned and um and so he but technically what happens is is he breaking the law he's not breaking the law they are giving him money they're sending him money willingly and they are um you know they're giving him their credit card and they're calling the credit card company and saying no no it's me can you please raise my limits yes i'm traveling i'm in i'm in the i'm in abiza right now and so they're like uh you know you're in a kind of a sticky spot you can't really say he stole it you clearly gave it to him uh in fact you kind of committed fraud but like well whatever we'll leave that aside but like yeah you do owe this money like this is not um this is not you know a stolen credit card and so anyways how much did he get he ends up getting a 15 month sentence for not even for this it's for like something else that he did like associated with this um he serves five months he gets off free he's out there living he's got a new model girlfriend he lives somewhere else um the girls kind of like exposed him in the press because they were like okay look law enforcement is not doing anything or it's going to take too long he's going to keep doing this in the meantime so they go to the norwegian press where they're from and they they kind of like expose it then netflix turns it into a documentary and uh and so the guy's still out there and one of the things in the movie is he goes to a plastic surgeon and he's like i want my eyes cheekbones chin mouth all restructured and this guy's like i'm not gonna do this only a criminal would want this surgery and so he's like trying to change his face so he could keep it going but he can't change his face and now he's like you know kind of like public enemy number one but a lot of people who watch this are like dude these girls are stupid you yeah you were just with him for the money and then he conned you for the money you got what you deserve so the girls are getting a ton of flack for it no that's stupid that's that's that's dumb but i was just thinking what a waste of talent by this guy yeah that's pretty amazing all this energy it's like a it's like a you know what's funny is like leonardo dicaprio played the same character in catch me if you can and it was awesome yeah he's became like a hero when i see this guy i want to punch him in the face yeah exactly he that was the problem it was a documentary instead of a movie about the con man itself where you sort of fall in love with this smooth guy uh yeah if a different if if like a lovable if like if like matt damon played him i would be all about it yeah you gotta watch the thing it's super punchable face this guy yeah um and the memes are just amazing uh around well i saw the meme with you with your face on it yeah yeah yeah i had somebody i was like hey photoshop my head onto onto this photo where it looks like i'm with the guy and i just tweeted out like oh i'm with my sister's new boyfriend like is he american no this guy is israeli dude screw this guy man i i uh i'm happy they made a documentary about him how did he get all the uh so he's in a private jet and a bunch of these pictures how did he get that because he's using the previous woman's money to fund his his lifestyle so he would fly private yeah yeah so he's actually flying private i don't know all the time but at least some of the time and uh it was just really wild in fact a lot of the numbers don't make sense like he must have been running this on like tons of women at once to fund this lifestyle because these like the jets and the stuff that he was doing like okay he called this woman out of 80 grand but 80 grand it funds like one month of this lifestyle you know like that's not very long so he must have had a lot of people at the same time or the documentary is a little inaccurate i don't know but how much money did he get they said that he had conned women out of millions of dollars uh over over time um they didn't say exactly how much they don't know you know how much of it what was there but but i just feel like he did this all wrong like if you're gonna do all this effort you gotta be more intelligent right like okay what could he have done um could have just married rich could have just seemed rich married rich divorced took half right like that would have worked uh way way you know put more wood behind fewer arrows here and he could have just gone one very wealthy person if he really wanted to do this that's my first critique of him uh my second critique of him is bro all this money to just party partying is exhausting like he just wanted to fly private and go to these clubs and do table service like you know you couldn't pay me to do that i don't know you gotta diversify your assets dog yeah you should have you should have owned some own some crypto like buy something buy a home do do something with this money you just blew all the money on overpriced you know like bottle service at the club like wow all right that's critique number two um number three go b2b bro corporate swindling would have worked way better so you know he could have been like you heard about the guy who just started sending invoices to microsoft and apple and stuff and just got paid like millions of dollars just he was just sending an invoice to accounts payable or whatever and uh and then they would just pay some of the invoices did what he just did like like ap at microsoft.com yeah he was like he's like hey you know this is for the uh blah blah blah and like and then they went back and they're like what the hell is this who is this vendor that we paid 1.1 million dollars to this year like nobody knows who this is i don't think that's illegal either uh i think it is because he was like you know uh well whatever they were going back after him you know these companies have a lot of money so that's the downside of going b2b i feel like there could have been a b2b way of doing this should have actually just started a diamond company could have made a lot more money if you're this good at getting women's emotions tied up in your your lifestyle just actually sell the diamonds it would have worked use their money to fund a diamond company that actually could have worked this guy needs to be needs to be in the facebook ad manager instead of tinder that's my that's my critique of this guy i'm looking at him now the all those these women who he scammed they like a lot of them look like models like he was killing it also like you forgot the other option which is like just marry one of these ladies if they're rich enough to like if they're these beautiful women who could wire them 200k like i don't know man bro maybe you got to keep her well in this case he's like he was telling him like go take like a kind of like a collateralized loan or a payday loan and like super high interest don't worry he's like i'm gonna wire your money back in four days and then he would like not wire them back and they'd be like hey did you want the money he's like oh sorry they are like the bank was closed okay and then he would like show them a statement he'd be like i sent it should arrive in a couple days he's like hey it hasn't arrived yet what's going on like the interest is building up on this like flash loan you had me take he's like oh my god let me call the bank another two days go by he's like called the bank they said this thing got frozen i gotta i gotta deal with this i'm so sorry here uh you know i'm gonna send you one of my watches in the meantime you can just sell this watch is worth a hundred thousand dollars sends him a fake watch and you just buy time doing that it's like these women didn't have the money but like i think he could he could have totally gone for a richer woman and then been like you know what baby like i love you i'm not gonna make you sign a prenup you know me i'm a billionaire uh i come from this lineage but i'm not my dad says sign a prenup i'm not gonna do it and then she would feel a little bit of pressure would be like okay i guess i can't really ask him for a prenup anyways this guy's richer than me all right i guess i also won't that would have been a more effective con if this guy were in jail do you think he'd be popular or hated i think popular sadly you think popular i think i think popular i could see this going either way man i could see this i could see this going either way i think like dude the swindler in prison would he like all right so bernie made off i heard in prison was like a god which i get i get that you know like he could teach people how to like corner like the chocolate chip or the chocolate uh hot chocolate market like in prison like he could like you know or he could like you know dominate the commissary and he could like teach you about markets i get that and also there it wasn't a violent crime so no children or women would hurt like this guy is he i would see this guy being unpopped uh i don't know that's a good question he's got kind of like a douchebag aura to him so that's the problem that's that's where he's gonna get in trouble but uh bro the swindler the swindler would do well in prison this is a good guy i guess i'll watch it how many episodes well he's not in prison he's out and about he's he's living a nice life right now oh screw this guy man and he sold a couple million dollars yeah i think i think about i think this documentary is good punishment though that's fair i'm okay you not serving time and you have this documentary about you our buddy jack butcher pointed something out that i was like oh wait a minute that's true he's like yo netflix is gonna make a lot of money off this documentary pay off these women's debts they have like a gofundme going it's like yo netflix you need to pay off this woman's two hundred thousand dollar debt that's true you did well on this documentary so that's the uh that's the real call out here netflix cancel netflix if they don't pay off these women's debts that's a no-brainer you don't think they're going to well nobody said anything these women are doing interviews everywhere there's a gofundme out there i feel like i feel like they could have said or they're just you know swindling people one good thing that you know we didn't make a lot of money off this but netflix actually generously did agree to pay off the debt you know uh blah blah that i feel like that story should have come out if they did it if they didn't then fire either fire your pr person netflix or pay off this pay these debts you have two choices that's actually a great point how many likes did that tweak it that jack said uh probably not that many because now everyone's just looking at jack for like nft oh my god um all right that's a good episode
