skill set or thing that i've learned in business that pretty much shocked me i really only learned this in last year but looking back at it people have told me this forever which is there's a massive difference a massive gap in skills and a lot of people cross it but there's the gap exists of starting and managing so when you start businesses a lot of people think of mark zuckerberg and they're like this college kid started this thing he was 20 when he started it now he's only 30 or he could be 25 still and he manages 10 000 employees he hired the best people in the world from princeton and stanford and harvard and he stole people from amazon the brightest minds on earth and you think yeah that's just how it goes well managing those people and the business it's incredibly challenging and oftentimes the people who are creative and crazy enough to start companies a lot of times the skill sets they needed to start it are not only different but oftentimes opposite of what it takes to run when you start something you could look at a lot of spreadsheets and you could kind of like guess your way there but a lot of times not all the time but a lot of times starting something it's completely irrational on paper things may or may not work and you just got to be creative and you got to do shit you got to move fast and you're not going to have meetings you're not going to talk to people about stuff you're just going to move quickly and you're going to execute you're going to do it and it's a very creative process it's almost like creating a piece of art like maybe there's some equation that says like the perfect rectangle looks this way but every but a lot of times there's just picasso who just says fuck it this is interesting to me i'm doing this and sometimes it works that's kind of what starting a business is but managing a business is a lot different and so at our company i did a pretty good job of getting us to about a million a month in sales but towards the ends of that i was breaking i was doing horrible i was not good at managing it and i was very unhappy and so we hired one of my first hires was this guy named adam who i went to high school with and he's now president of our company and he runs a lot of the day-to-day stuff so i kind of i kind of i'm like he's like sam sandwiched in the middle whereas i'm really good at thinking of these really high level ideas and i'm also really good at going in at the very bottom and just being an individual contributor and creating interesting things i'm not always great at managing the day-to-day of of what's going on it's i bet i could get good at it but it just really doesn't interest me and that was really hard to learn and i struggled with this for years i like i said i hired a ceo coach i had we have a handful of really great angel investors and i kind of talked to them and i'm like i don't know what to do here and it wasn't until i realized that adam is one of the best at this he loves this he's the type of guy who was the captain of the football team the president of student council he loves leading people and it kind of hit me i'm like man the way that i sometimes don't understand why people are unwilling to start something or how on earth they're afraid of starting i am kind of like that on the other end with managing there's people who it whether it comes naturally to them or they've just worked on this skill set they're really good at it and so in a way i was wearing this backpack that was full of weight and i hated carrying it on my shoulders i just took out some of the weight and i put it in adam's bag and he loves carrying it and so through this process i mentioned earlier we have hustlecon speakers through this process i actually talked to a lot of people at our conferences and that was one of the major things that i used to ask people which is do you have a right-hand man or a right-hand woman do you have someone leading the day-to-day because i'm struggling with that how do you do that and there was typically two answers which was yeah i don't like it it's really hard and i could sense that these people i'm talking i mean i don't want to i don't want to call anyone out but go and just google like hustlecon speakers or something look at all the people who we've had at our events and those these are this is the type of person or those are the people who told me this which was they would say like i am horrible at managing this or oftentimes they would have like one of their assistants or like a keeper or like a handler like with them and i would be like hey what's this person like as a manager and the answers were pretty consistently pretty bad this person's not good and so the the first answer was i'm not good at it i'm really struggling with it and a lot of times those people would say i wish i had someone who i could replace myself as ceo i i would hear that all the time and you i was shocked by it and the second answer that i got was yeah i hired a really good coo or a really good president and this is my right-hand woman or right-hand man and they run a lot of the day-to-day and it allows me to focus on what i do best and the people who said number two were way happier and oftentimes i think a lot more successful now there are these rare occasions where the person who started it is just they're they're they're also a great uh ceo or a great people manager um that that definitely happens but often it is not the case i'm looking at a photo of ted turner ted turner is one of my heroes he was pretty notoriously a bad manager he was a great leader people wanted to follow him in battle but what he would do is he would come up with these great ideas so ted turner came up with the idea of cnn and he launched it but before that he had other businesses and when he came up to cnn a lot of people think ted turner you're the guy who started cnn well yeah he is but he also there's another guy named reese and reese was the guy leading the day-to-day ted would come came up with the idea and then he went away for three months and did a sailing competition um so having these right-hand people are is very important and a lot of times i feel like i'm the right-hand person at this point but i think that it's really important to understand the difference between starting and managing i mean for a long time for a long time um it was normal that they would call them gray hairs it was normally get a gray haired leader to come in for a startup so these young people would come up with this idea for this great tech company and then the investor would say all right let's go hire a ceo and that is not popular right now but i think it should be i think it's actually quite effective maybe not ceo but you definitely need this team of experienced people and and so the reason why i brought this up is it's a it's something that most people i found struggle with but there's not a lot of resources out there not a lot of people talking about it and so i think it's really important to learn this ultimately um the skill set comes down to delegating and there's four resources that i'll have that i've liked the first one i don't like the name of the book but it's very helpful it's by a guy named felix uh felix dennis felix dennis he was this um he's dead now he died a few years ago maybe 10 years ago he was he's kind of like richard branson but more vulgar he was a british entrepreneur he uh started dennis publishing which launched maxim magazine which launched a ton of great titles it's still like a 200 million dollar a year business he also launched micro warehouse which basically before amazon was around it was like amazon for software and it was a huge multi-billion dollar publicly traded company so very successful uh entrepreneur close to a billionaire and so this is why i don't mind his book being titled so horribly it's called how to get rich and the reason why i don't mind it is because he was really successful he wasn't just like get rich quick guy and uh in that book he does a great job of of talking about delegating and that book i use it as a reference book i read all the time about how to work with people that that's my go-to the second one is i like the one minute manager just google it you'll find it it's a great book on on managing the third thing is is the five dysfunctions of a team and so it's a great book that looks at what successful teams and people look like and what they don't look like more importantly and so you in order to oftentimes the best way to be good at something is you find out the bad ways of doing it and you just don't do that and the fourth thing is one of my investors is this guy named tucker max tucker max if you're a man and you're between the ages of probably 28 and 40 you probably know who tucker max is he was famous because he had this blog called i hope they serve beer in hell and it was very controversial it was basically about his frat days and he was just this wild partier and drinker so he has a really controversial opinion but after he's in his 40s now so he's no longer a kid but he's really thoughtful at this point he's kind of turned his image around and he um has a great blog where he a talked about firing himself and replacing himself as ceo and he it's maybe like a 12-part blog it's really good i would highly recommend everyone reading him and uh he's one of my investors and he's kind of a mentor to me you know he him and i are kind of similar in that we try to be macho and or at least we started that way of wanting to be macho and show no weakness but he's actually done a really good job of being introspective and talking about his feelings a lot and he's done really good about talking about managing people he tucker also has this great book on uh how to create or this great um document on how to manage a company or uh um like create a culture and you could google uh tucker max culture document and you'll see it it's free or this is a greatetti eranie of the video which you really want to hear from the view yeah Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah Isaiah
