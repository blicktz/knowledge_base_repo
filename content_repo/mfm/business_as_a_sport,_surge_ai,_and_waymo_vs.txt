dude manifest is out there's a new word uh what generative wait is high agency are we selling high agency we're selling high agency at the top right now we're spacking high agency it's gone taking that cash and we're plowing it into generative all right what i miss how was the week week was good uh what did we do we had chris corner that episode's popped off it's over 100k on youtube so that's going well and uh dude there were so many replies to one idea that was in that episode i don't know if you listened to the episode the golfing one the golfing one yeah i got literally hundreds of replies of people who are like i could do this right here in my hometown people are sending powerpoint decks people are doing drive-by sending me videos of the lake where they think they could do it they're reaching out cold it's very intense uh how many people have replied to this and now we're going and what was the idea was it was about betting as to where you could hit it no so basically on the way there's a place in new zealand on the way to the golf course just kind of side of the road there's like there's a road that's driving by a body of water and if you just stop on the side of the road there's this thing called like whatever the hole-in-one challenge and you buy a bucket of balls and you're going to try to hit this hole-in-one of this little golf hole that's floating out you know 100 100 yards away in the water if you hit if you get it you get 10 grand and so it's just like a fun thing for you to do with your buddies like on the way or to or from a golf course and he was talking about like you know sort of napkin mathing what he thinks it's making based off of the available information he's like i think this thing does like 300 to 500k you know in revenue and you know the costs are pretty marginal it's like person standing there with an ipad uh there's a scuba diver that goes in once a week and fishes out the balls like that's it and so people got we we basically said hey i think this idea could work in more places than just this random roadside thing in new zealand let's bring this to life and who wants to do this and a lot of people have come come out and so we're gonna we're gonna make it a mfm project we're gonna see what we can do with this so i like all the comments were like this is what i've been missing with mfm because like we started a lot with that and then like our interests have grown and so the content has grown to be or evolved to be a little bit different sometimes and one critique is like um uh what is this my first billion because we talk about like uh like you know bigger ideas and um i was thinking i uh you know we've become um acquaintances with joe lonsdale who uh because of this podcast who's worth i don't know billions some amount of billions and i was uh with him recently by the way if you need to pick that up let me know if you need to pick up that that name drop uh did i drop did i drop that something here did i drop that name drop somewhere uh no but he uh and he was telling me like oh man or i was with him when i got my twitter check like you know how you get like twitter money now like you're like right for example i for some reason my twitter was a thousand dollars last payment and uh like the month before it was like six hundred dollars and i was like man this is crazy i just got paid six hundred dollars for tweeting which is insane he's like yeah i got like four hundred dollars and he was joking about how it feels uh just as exciting every once in a while to get like a 400 thing and it does however much money he's created in his lifetime and i was wondering do you feel like when you're talking about these things like you just lit up when you talked about 300 400 thousand dollars when that may or may not i mean i don't think so that's not going to really move the needle for you in your life um but it's kind of exciting isn't it yeah not because of the money it's just i think it's awesome uh i think the idea the idea itself is fun making it happen sounds like it's going to be fun you know actually i was just uh watching um an interview with a guy who they the nba finals just ended they had game seven the thunder one and there was hey i watched it i watched it there was this interview with one of the guys so they they asked jade up they're like you know when you look back on this year what's the what are you going to remember what were the high points and he goes he's like it's weird dude he's like i remember if you think if i think about this year he's like i remember being chet we would go to our hotel room we would do film sessions but back when he was coming back from injury to get it going or like these team dinners that we were having he's like i couldn't even tell he's like i don't even remember what happened last series like i don't remember in the the recent games what happened but those kind of like those inputs on the journey are like just like are so vivid to me and this has been a very common thing where if you talk to pro players after their career is done and you're like what do you miss the most and you expect them to be like the big pressure moments that those big games and of course they do like those but the thing they talk about always is the team bus rides the locker room the it's all of the like camaraderie stuff that happens along the way it's like the kind of the build-up is the stuff that they miss the most and um i think i think there's that for entrepreneurship too uh i think there's that that's a huge amount of the fun of it and it's what you get excited about you need the number to sort of justify it the number gives you some air cover for why you're acting like a little kid you're so excited about something the numbers help because why are you taking this silly thing so seriously but uh i think we would probably all do it without the numbers as well or if the numbers were half as much or whatever yeah and i've noticed the best the the people who love mfm the most and the guests who you and i love the most are folks who um uh you know i hung out with a friend of mine um and she was like because she was from a bad neighborhood now she's rich she's like you know i'm so good at going really high and going really low i was like what's that mean she's like i can hang out with like my homies from where i grew up and we could just like shoot the shit and kind of be a little like hood ratty or i can go hang out with a billionaire and i could i love that too i can i have so much joy doing that as well and i could blend in and get along with everyone and i think that's like that's like what the pot is it's like you like talking about these smaller things as well as the big things and it's the same type of person who loves both yeah exactly also do you think about business as like a sport because that's more and more become my mental model is the way that because you meet people and a lot of people we know have now become successful but they're still doing it and obviously for many of them i i call it they've already made the last dollar they'll ever spend right let's say you make 30 million dollars at that point you've already earned the last dollar you'll ever need to spend especially once you take into account that that 30 million could just sit in a whether it's a simple interest-bearing account or the s&p 500 and it'll just it'll double every seven years so 30 becomes 60 60 becomes 120 120 becomes 240 and that just all happened over the course of you know something like 25 years and so you've you don't need to go earn the next dollar but why do they anyways and part of it is i think it feels good to be good at something and if you're good at something it's hard to stop doing it because the feedback loop of being good at something is strong but i think in that same way if you think about business not as a mechanism to make money but as a sport as uh as a sport you play then it's like oh of course just because you're great at tennis and you won a tournament doesn't mean you'll stop playing tennis why would you do that that's your sport you love to play the sport you'll basically play the sport till your body breaks down and doesn't let you play the sport anymore and it feels good to manifest it feels good to have an idea and to see it in the real into reality and it's really fun flexing that model manifest is out there's a new word uh what generative generative what does that mean this is this has happened a few times to me now i uh wait is high agency are we selling high agency we're selling high agency at the top right now we're spacking high agency it's gone taking that cash and we're plowing it into generative okay so generative i was on a podcast and i was like at the end i was like how was that and you could tell me the truth because i do podcasts all the time with guests i know it's sometimes hit or miss like give me the from one podcaster to another what was that like for you and he's like it was great because you're extremely generative he goes what and he goes it was also hard because you're extremely generative like what does that mean he goes i'll say two things like i'll give you one topic but you can almost like bloom that or expand that into like a story a framework of this a related idea a simple example you just generated all that content off the cuff right away and he goes you know biology is like that biology is extremely generative you give him one thing and he's able to like take it from like the origin of man to you know to 100 years in the future and he can connect all those dots so i heard it once and i was like okay that's cool i don't know if i just got insulted or complimented being called generative but i'll take it and then james courier said the same thing he goes he's like he's like the reason we get along is because we're both extremely generative he's like we like being around generative people and he's like you know why do we admire elon it's not because he's rich it was because he's the most generative of all of us right and he's the least fearful and that's why he's able to be more generative he's he's like he literally generates businesses like the boring company and neural link and spacex and tesla he's like he's generating kids he's generating ideas he generates a president he generally he's just doing so much and that's admirable to somebody who is generative and so i started using that little lens i started looking at people being like how generative is this person meaning if you give them an inch could they take a mile and what is their overall level of output in their life you know like how generative are they with like for example james courier it's not just businesses he's generating he you know at one point he also started a church in san francisco he like started a new religion and you know then he created this uh like sort of incubator this fund then he created a podcast he's just constantly creating things because it's extremely generative and it's whether it's with his kids life or it's his business life or whatever so i started to realize oh yeah i'm really attracted to that i like people who are like that and i i want to be like that and figuring out a way to make that work is um is a fun challenge it's a generative is the new word hey i got a quick break because i want to tell you something cool so our sponsor for this episode is hubspot but instead of the ad telling you about hubspot they just want to do something that's useful for you so they did some research and they found that a bunch of people in our community have side hustles they start a business on the side they get it going and then it becomes their main hustle over time and so instead of just telling you about the features of hubspot they wanted to give you something that would be useful for your side hustle and so they have put together a database of ai prompts so things that you could put into chat gpt or your favorite ai tool that will help you with your side hustle so check it out it's going to save you a bunch of time i think it's a prompt database that you should be using to make your side hustle more successful and you could use this as your little personal little cheat sheet your tool set to be a better operator with your side hustle so you can either scan this qr code that's on the screen or get the link in the description to get the ai prompt database all right back to the show have you ever heard of this book called the inner game of tennis i've heard of it but i've never read it is it good yeah who's the pro who's it about okay so the inner game of tennis i randomly discovered it because i was at the airport and i was just looking for a book to read on my kindle and i wanted something short and i for some reason you're like i'm in a bookstore we're looking for books to download separately no like i i don't remember what i was just like i think like i was on amazon on my phone and like a sports psychology book came up and i was like okay that's intriguing what are what's like the top sports psychology book there is or something like that and i randomly came across the inner game of tennis it's about uh it's written by a guy named timothy galway and it's one of these books that it's about life and it just uses tennis as the analogy and the premise of the book is that you have two selves self one is your person so like when you say like um uh when you're playing tennis and you hit you do a bad hit you go uh why do i suck so much or like like that is self one the critical self and then self two is like your animalistic self who doesn't um who doesn't uh think too much and it's just your body and that learns by observing and it's all about how to be generative uh and by by ignoring self one and letting self two do all the work and it gives you all of these tips and tricks on how to listen to self too and this sounds very woo woo uh and it is a little bit woo woo but the book was written in the 1970s and the coach of the seahawks writes the forward what's his name pete carroll p carroll yeah and like every new edition they still are like they're still releasing new editions where all these like who's who of leaders are writing about it and i think i i didn't realize it but after i started reading it was like oh wait tim ferris talked about this book it's one of his favorite books of all time and i've been reading it a whole lot and it applies very much to business i think it's only 150 page book i've been reading um i'm almost done i read it in like two days i the the it's very similar or very applicable to business which is what you said about elon of he's not fearful and things like that this book actually gives you like a set of frameworks and a way to communicate yourself in order to not be fearful when you are coming up with new ideas this is incredibly fascinating dude this is awesome i love this type of book it says the inner game of tennis the classic guide to peak performance introduction by bill gates and a forward by pete carroll isn't that crazy i didn't know that that i didn't i don't have i don't have the bill gates one so i didn't know that so he wrote the the introduction that's wild and so have you used any of this or give me like has it have you found a way to kind of apply any of these yet well so like a very simple example is like for lifting weights or for going for a run when you lift weights you're like okay i have to lift this weight for three times and it's the heaviest weight that i've ever done so i'm really scared you don't listen to that at all and instead you just get under it and you go i'm gonna let self to do all the work i'm gonna trust self too and if i fail i will not be judgmental i'm not gonna say you suck i'm said i'll say uh you know your knee moved in a strange way so i'm just gonna objectively acknowledge what's happening and then i put and then i when i want to lift three times i get it up on me and i just observe the weight on me and i only go for one rep and i'll be like all right how does that feel self two let's just do the second rep so i basically am talking to myself sort of like an objective machine not an emotional person so the whole i'm fearful i'm fearful i'm fearful you just set that aside and you go it's self two time there is no room for that it is only room for uh objectiveness all right i did something similar to this in this in this vein that i didn't even plan to talk about but i'll just tell you this because i think it's kind of similar so one thing i noticed is anytime i go into a project uh you know i obviously have a lot of excitement and have a lot of hope at the beginning correct that's obvious and then the second obvious thing is that i'm going to hit some sort of obstacles walls plateaus something that i don't want to happen is for sure going to happen i've never once experienced a project that i just simply started everything went as planned and it had a happy ending like this literally just never happened for me to expect that to happen would honestly be a little bit foolish it's like why would i think that that was the case yet at the same time as soon as i hit those obstacles on those walls i'm like like i wish this didn't happen i don't want this to happen why is this happening and i waste all this energy on something that was inevitable it's like playing mario and being like oh my god i can't believe these goombas are walking at me it's like dude that's the game like what do you mean like you wanted to play this game without anybody like trying to bite you you know i don't understand what you thought this was going to be and so recently i was doing a project and uh last week i wrote out a thing in advance i'm just going to kind of read you this so i basically wrote like a simple letter to self for like two months down the road and by the way three months down the road according to tim according to the inner game of tennis when you have that feeling you don't you do not judge it as positive or negative you say now this is a challenge okay noted and then you just keep going do you know what i mean there is no why like this is horrible this is awful why me that that that there are no emotions you do not judge you think you don't judge the the emotion you're feeling you don't judge yourself for feeling it or you don't judge the thing both so you uh you only objectively acknowledge it so you say like uh so the ball was out okay right noted the ball was hit too hard and then you're you trust self too to adjust but you don't you know you know what i'm saying you do not acknowledge or judge it as i hate this i suck this is bad it's just the ball was out so i'm just going to give you a little sense of how i wrote this so i was like i was like hey it's me from the future i'm writing this to you three months from now first congrats thing you did so good turned out amazing i'm really proud of you slash me and i said this is a letter that is guiding you to some of the entirely predictable upcoming road bumps that are headed your way not only is it predictable that there will be road bumps i could probably tell you right now what they're going to be all right because like that's true so for example i was thinking about this isn't what i was doing but just to make it a simple example let's say you're trying to hire a head of sales there's some entirely predict like you know you want to do it you know you'll you'll be able to do it but there's some entirely predictable road bumps which is like um you know you're probably going to procrastinate starting it a little bit because it's the idea of finding that perfect person's a little bit hard and you might put it off a little bit then then you'll talk to some candidates who are disappointing you may even run into a candidate who's really great but the offer doesn't work out maybe maybe they don't take it maybe it's not the right time in their life etc etc so you can basically up front tell yourself yeah these four obstacles are probably going to be here i've played this level of the game before or i could just see what's coming and so when they come it takes the emotional edge off of it because it's like yeah i know there's no i don't feel betrayed by this i don't feel surprised by this like i knew you just say hello to it here you are i thought i'd be seeing you soon and i also had already kind of thought about like what i would do to get around that before it hits me and i'm in like an emotional state so it's like yeah i'm probably gonna meet a bunch of people who are kind of disappointing and it'll probably feel in the moment like god am i ever gonna find somebody great but of course i will i only need one and it's a numbers game and i should i should probably just expect that i'm going to talk to about you know 30 to 40 people and that 25 of those people are going to be truly just a waste of time uh you know in terms of the interview but that's okay that's that's part of the process and you tell yourself that up front and then as it's happening you're like yeah well i already i already addressed this i don't need to like react to it again because i already kind of pre-reacted to the whole thing and what uh is this project that you're doing like big or like do you recommend doing this for a small thing or only a big thing i don't know this is my first time actually doing like the corny step of like writing it out to myself i'm like dear sean yeah and then it's like ps you're pretty lame for right this yeah exactly it's like all right that's three pages now this was cool when it was a paragraph um i think it was it was very helpful i will do it again um i will do it again i mean i don't know how much this actually like it doesn't it sort of blunts the pain but the pain's still there you know what i mean it's like when you get a shot at the doctor it's like if you really are looking at it and hyper fixated on it and you start hyperventilating about it yeah it's kind of a worse experience if you look away you might still feel a little prick but you know you took the edge off of it i think that's what this has done for me i have um all right so we're talking about like big and small do you want me to tell you about a small thing and a big idea that are to me are equally fascinating okay go to patronview.com so i was with nick gray this weekend so i did this amazing vacation where my friend david owns a home in utah and about eight of us or maybe six of us plus our spouses and our kids all went and hung out and uh it was amazing and nick was there and i was looking at his computer and i said nick what are you doing he goes let me tell you and it was very fascinating and so it's called patron view uh patronview.com and so nick used to own this service called museum hack where it was kind of amazing that it existed but you would pay a hundred dollars and nick or one of his tour guides would take you to uh the met and give you a sort of gorilla uh tour of the um of the museum and it was amazing and so that's where he got really into museums and he became buddies somehow or somehow got uh uh in with the guys who do the fundraising and because he's a business person he was like oh wow it's so fascinating that one person is donating a million dollars 10 million dollars 20 million dollars to these museums and they do it every year into tons of different museum museums that's really amazing and so recently with a mutual buddy stetson blake they built this website where it's pretty amazing where all he did was if you go to the met or one of a dozen or hundreds of other museums they every year they have to put out a pdf that explains who donated money and how much money that person donated and so he's aggregated all of them hundreds or maybe even thousands and he used ai to upload all of them into a database so if you are fundraising for a museum i believe if i had to guess you're going to be able to pay his service money to find out who the whales are you know whatever and it's crazy that because of ai he was able to make this he told me uh for two thousand dollars i'm just going to read the about page it says uh we're a research platform dedicated to documenting cultural philanthropy i've never actually heard that before which is just shows how like much of a noob i am about philanthropy but that makes sense so people who donate to things that are about culture and then it says where and then it says the data our research is pulling from annual reports 990 tax filings institutional publications official documents and proprietary sources this lets us present donor information that's never before been displayed we like to think of it as celebrating philanthropy and enabling development departments pretty cool right awesome it's great right like i was i was like nick what's your deal here like you want to turn this into a business and he's very nick is happy like he's not looking for anything he's like i don't know i'm just tinkering and in my head as someone who is probably less uh you know content than him i was like oh man like nick you could do this you could do this you could do this and that's like how the entire conversation uh came about but isn't this pretty cool that he's like building this and this is his hobby and the fact that ai has made this so easy yeah dude this is great i mean nick i've already you know really shouted him out on here a ton of times because he's somebody who's made a big impact on me just seeing the way this guy rolls through life i'm like he just does things for his own amusement he does things on his terms and i think he does things with high intentionality and he doesn't see and he basically resisted the rat race i think those are the people i admire the most of all is the people that have resisted the rat race like i think he neither chases money nor status um and if you think about the people who are talented and successful in your life how many do you think actually truly are resisting money and status very very few i know probably two people him and jack smith yeah so it's pretty crazy and so you just sort of watch their moves and then you look at them and you know you can kind of learn from them so this is this is extremely cool like and what's funny about nick is every two or three years or something like that he likes to uh find a publicly traded company that he loves and he'll make a big bet on it and right now his or for the past probably four or five years actually his bet has been cloud flare like for some reason i don't know he's got all this analysis he like loves it to the point where like when he hosted an event he specifically hosted his event in the cloud flare uh event space because he's like so loyal and he'll wear cloud flare t-shirts whatever um like one time there was a race uh like a like a 5k or a marathon through austin and he'll like hold up a sign that says like cloud flare rules like this because he wants that you told me like at his birthday party he had his birthday party at the cloud flare office and then midway through the birthday party he ran upstairs and got like two like a product manager like a marketing engineering yeah to come down and be like hey everybody quick word from jack from the marketing department why don't you just tell us about the great things you got going on at cloudflare the guy's like uh yeah so you know before and before he brought that guy in he goes i need everyone to treat jack from cloudflare like a celebrity and so when he walked in we go oh my god is that jack are you the vp of engineering at cloudflare oh my god he's here he's here the stock is the stock is up 400 in the last five years so he's done pretty well he's done well and if you click the about page i know for a fact so he lists an area that says technology patron view is built with modern web tech to ensure fast reliable access to data and he only did that so he could list that he uses cloudflare i know that's exactly how he thought um but the reason i'm bringing this up is i think that if you're like just starting to build a business or something you should follow patron view or like go there like go there once a week and i and i would bet that you're gonna see like it evolve like uh you know it's sort of like measuring your kid on the wall like you're gonna see like the measuring like like that's what's gonna happen this is cool too i think another another cool thing about this is this fits into like a genre that you know personal software so uh or maybe social software so basically uh when the internet came out before pre-internet the only people that made media were media companies you know you got your media from the new york times and the huffington post whatever like newspapers magazines tv etc and then when the internet came out and you got facebook and twitter and instagram and snapchat then social media became a thing and everybody became a little broadcaster right everybody broadcasted little moments of their life or their content or their their interest whatever it was and there was this explosion like you know a sort of like 1 billion x increase in the amount of media that was created because everybody was doing it and like one clear thing i see that's happening in the world today is that that's now happening with software so software used to be something that only software companies and software engineers could make and you know there's only like i don't know there's less than a hundred million roughly software engineers like proper like professional software engineers in the world so you know 100 million out of 8 billion people could do the thing and you know if in terms of software companies there's even less maybe a hundred thousand uh software companies i don't know order of magnitude roughly and now with like repli and v0 and all these different tools it's going to be like social media we're like oh i have i carry in my pocket a thing that can make media it's like i carry my pocket a thing that can make software so a guy like nick who before this probably couldn't have taken his idea and made it into an app because he would have to either a learn to code or b go hire like expensive programmers to make this happen like he did most of this with ai and so you see personal software this like you know this personal software category which was like didn't exist three years ago or five years ago um isn't now going to have the same sort of like 1 billion x you know increase just because anybody who's got an idea can now make their idea now today it's like broken three-fourths of the time doesn't quite work but like every six months that number goes down by 15 and so you know within two or three years that number is going to be like zero right it's going to be like when you have an idea you make your app everything that i've been making on replit and lovable and cursor it's basically just like a figma replacement like i'm just like it's basically just like drawing on paper yeah it's just like a mock-up and you still need someone to like actually do the work but it but it's a sick mock-up yeah like it looks yeah somebody called it minimum viable promise so it's a minimal viable product it's like it's not really a product but it's like it kind of has like you make a promise you can see the promise of something and i think that's what a lot of these tools are able to do today have you heard of a guy named edwin chen edwin chen i mean there's like you probably have there's probably six thousand of them on my facebook feed yeah i went to school in beijing i think i got a few edwin chens in my rolodex edwin chen might be the like if you uh did like a chart of like richest slash unknown slash youngest person in the world i think it's gonna be edwin chen is this the guy who's doing surge so yeah so edwin chen uh in like 2018 2019 he worked at facebook facebook and the story is is that he was tasked with like making some type of yelp style product and what that meant was he had a list of 50 000 vendors and he needed to figure out which of those 50 000 was a restaurant and which were a grocery store and so he went and hired a firm uh some company to like parse it out and it's like manual you you had to do it manually like you had to like hire some firm that had a lot of uh offshore talents to go through and do it all manually by hand and he was like it took us four months or six months something like that which basically just meant we had to sit and wait like we couldn't do anything until we had that data so i just had to sit and wait and so he had this idea where he was going to make a better way to do data labeling and the data data labeling is important now because that is what a lot of ai companies use which i had no idea they they did that and i'll explain how they do that but basically when a company like open ai uh wants to figure out if a certain reply is unethical so like for example asking like if is it okay to like hit someone or i don't know like whatever like questions you would ask it a real person and actually not just a real person but like a really smart person uh even someone who like does engineering or philosophy needs to spend time going through all the potential answers and to tell open ai i think this one sort of fits what you're going for but anyway edwin had this idea of i'm going to create this massive workforce of philosophers of engineers of ivy league grad grads who can go through and label all of these answers as good or bad so ai companies can kind of i can be like their offshore talent and so he's done this uh and it started in 2020 now he has a hundred thousand people who are in the marketplace working for him as these data labelers and this company is completely unknown so if you i think it's surge ai i believe is the url so if you go to surge ai it's a landing page with one paragraph that's an amazing paragraph if you want you can read it do you want to read it what made people like hemingway callow and von newman's so extraordinary their life the books they read the stumbles they had the reinforcement every time friends laughed at their jokes and every time they didn't it's the people that met the police explored and every decision they made along the way data does for ai what life does for humans it elevates the neural networks that know nothing about the world into the intelligence capable of providing new art sending rocket ships to mars etc our mission is to shape agi with the richness of human intelligence curious witty imaginative and unexpected brilliance we wake up every day trying to produce the data that makes this possible amazing right romantic it's romantic and then this guy made like a giant fleet of overseas data labelers sound like the army from 300 yeah yeah it's the it's the best and so the way the business model works is they have a hundred thousand of these folks and they train them on different standards and whatever and then they've also made software so uh they can show the the the basically homework or tasks to their folks and a company like open ai or uh google whatever whatever is going to pay uh surge millions and millions of dollars and surge is then going to take something like 30 or 40 percent of it and give it to the annotator to do the work so this company is only five years old and it's uh it was leaked that they did one billion dollars in revenue in the last 12 months and this guy edwin chen he's only 37 years old and he owns 100 of the company they have not taken any outside funding now listen their biggest competitor is a company called scale scale is run by this guy named alexander wang i think alex alex wang i think his name is and it recently sold for something like 30 times revenue i believe it they were doing like 800 900 million in revenue they just sold half of the company to facebook i think it was for 28 billion or 30. yeah 30. which mean which means this guy uh edwin who's 37 and has a five-year-old company presumably is worth something like 30 billion dollars and you can't find him on twitter he has no blog you can't find photos of him he used to have a blog but you have to go to web archive in order to find it because he took it down and his customers are like edwin is not online you can't find him anywhere and we like it that way his born his business is very boring the branding is basically non-existent and it just does a very good job and compared to scale who's like you know the hottest kid on the block like alex wang was just on theo von's podcast he was at the inauguration he's kind of like kind of like uh the the it guy right now these guys are the exact opposite you're not going to find them anywhere they only have 100 employees they're totally under the radar and uh it's super super fascinating dude this is uh this is wild uh i i did not know that he bootstrapped the whole thing i i also had never heard this company until scale got bought i'd never heard of this company so their their company is is killing it now because scale got bought so because scale got bought is now owned basically by facebook google and a bunch of other companies they go ah we don't want to we don't have with you anymore we go on straight surge but they were already winning they were at a billion in revenue and scale was at 750 billion and the reason why they're winning is because they are they charge a premium and they're uh they he's like i don't we got scale but it's like i wasn't trying to get scale meaning i wasn't trying to grow big i was trying to hire the best people and to train them really well and i charged for it i charged three times what scale charges and the results have been better and people really like us because of it and this whole table data labeling industry i had no idea about this i i didn't know that people were behind the scenes making these decisions it's kind of wild i mean this is one of the best like uh picks and shovels businesses so if you've never heard of picks and shovels it's a the idea is like anytime there's a gold rush who makes the money yeah it's the the few people who find the gold but the more reliable way to make money is just to sell picks and shovels to everybody else who's rushing into the gold rush and scale and surge were the best picks and shovels businesses maybe besides nvidia because what they were doing is saying cool everybody everybody wants to compete to become the you you want to make agi you want to make agi you're all raising billions and billions of dollars well all of you have this same problem and i will sell the data labeling service to all of you and this is so funny that now that facebook is buying uh scale it's like there's all that revenue has to find a new home like this that is crazy that that's the best news ever for this guy and there's another company called handshake so if you go to join handshake.com previously or it still might be this but they were known as a company that helped recent college graduates get jobs and so basically they're a job board or job network for uh 22 year olds dude yeah this was for college kids okay well listen to this they noticed a few months ago uh that surge and uh uh scale were using their service to find these these data annotators and so they go ah we're gonna do that now and so in a very short amount of time they pivoted and that business that they have is gonna be at a hundred million dollars a year in the next couple months in a very short amount of time because what they did was they went and just said oh you are looking for a data uh annotation gig we got you let's uh let's go ahead and get your train and we're just gonna provide that service to folks and so handshake is uh building that business now dude that's so crazy i remember using this because i was like oh it's interesting that nobody's really built the the kind of like one place to go hire college interns or college like fresh grads and they built this like marketplace where you could go post on a job board at my local college here and i could get but it was like kind of crappy dude it was like it wasn't great it was very like little liquidity in the market but i remember thinking like this is an interesting idea somebody like it's a marketplace i like marketplaces somebody should do this right and um i remember they were kind of like puttering along for a while it seemed like and uh this is so funny that they pivoted to this and now we're gonna just explode yeah and if you google handshake data annotation you can find the blog posts that they uh that they wrote on them announcing that they were doing this and so it basically just says that for the past decade handshake has changed how college students started their careers and then it goes on to basically say we're changing the company to like just hire just do this thing and it's already making and they don't actually say this but like it's now making 100 million dollars a year and you know i don't know how long this stuff will last like you know this might be a business that i think in like seven to ten years you may not need this anymore like it seems like the way ai is going you may not need this kind of human in the loop to label all this data either either they label they label enough data where then the model learns how they label data you don't need humans doing this or they use a thing that doesn't have the r rlhf right like you you just do reinforcement learning without human feedback and i think some people who are kind of pure believers in ai think you won't need the human feedback um at a certain point so this might be a get get while they're getting good type of business so let me let me tell you a a potential counter to that so tim westergen founded a company called pandora and i think he started it in 1990 uh uh maybe 98 so it was like pre-iphone um wait when the iphone come out oh wait oh six yeah so it was like probably like 2002 then and anyway uh he told me this story because we had him talk at one of our events where he was like i raised seven million dollars and all seven million dollars of that went to hiring basically ex-musicians or musicians who were teachers and didn't make a lot of money and for two years i had about 150 of them listening to music and i gave them basically a scantron of all types of attributes that a song could potentially have and so if you're listening to the beatles you would fill out like okay it sounds like it's at like uh 90 beats per minute it sounds like there's guitar like it's melodic it's light-hearted whatever and after two years of doing this he put all the data basically scantrons into this algorithm that he built and he started playing like uh he told me a beatle song and then and then he clicked next and it would suggest new music that was similar to the one that the beatles song that he originally played and he said the bgs came up and he was like the bgs and the beatles they're not similar at all what the hell and then he kept clicking next he's like oh wait they have the same melody or they had they all like have the same like they make me feel similar and he was like it's working it's working and so originally his idea was i'm going to create kiosk at best buy so you could say i'm interested in beatles but here's like five other songs that best buy could show you and you will buy those cds while you're there and then the iphone came out and he was like oh my god this is actually the exact way to apply this and so this idea of data data labeling has been around forever and i didn't when i was reading scale or about surge i was like oh my god this is exactly what tim was explaining to me how pandora started and so this has been around for 20 years and so you say i don't know if it's going to be around or not but i don't know it's been around for 20 years so far yeah that's true but uh it's kind of like like self-driving which is coming out now i've taken the waymos in san francisco and robo taxi in austin the tesla the tesla self-driving just launched in austin um i think like two days ago or something but they took two different approaches so waymo basically has this really expensive car i forgot the all-in cost but it's something like 150 to 300 000 is the cost of the car with all the sensors on it so they have this really expensive car with lidar and in addition to the lidar they um hard code and hard map the roads so you know for for years they would drive around and basically like map the road physically and they could only launch in cities where they had mapped the roads and tesla took this other approach which was basically cameras only no lidar and we're not going to hard map the roads we're gonna let people drive around and then the car needs to have a brain that's smart enough to figure out a road even if it's never been on that road before and uh it was this interesting bet because elon was like lidar is not only we're not doing it it's stupid and that's a dead end path and everybody else was all in on lidar everyone's like lidar makes it safer it's better you can't do this without lidar and elon's point was we humans drive with just eyes we only have cameras we don't i don't have a lidar in my brain and i'm able to drive safely right and lidar is what lidar is uh uh like you're shooting some type of signal and it bounces back you can see through things so i don't know exactly what's the difference with lidar radar and all these different things but like it's another version of basically scanning that allows you to do what a camera can't camera can't see through an object lidar can it can sense that there's another another object behind it so let the classic example is like you know you know maybe you're gonna do a turn there's something obstructing your view but then there's a little old grandma walking on the crosswalk but you couldn't see the grandma until you started to turn visibly but lidar would know that there's just something there's an object there that's that's moving point is other sensors besides cameras whereas elon was like no we're just gonna put like whatever eight cameras on the car and that's gonna make it work and for a long time there was a big debate some experts thought elon is wrong some were just like elon is correct and elon we trust and very smart people were on both sides of the debate and it was like a very high stakes debate because self-driving cars is one of the most valuable prizes that there is uh like self-driving cars i don't think people really realize it i think because it's i think because people talked about it for a while they got kind of numb to it this actually happened with ai too people have been talking about ai maybe machine learning deep learning for a long time people didn't really realize when something actually had changed and then suddenly like wait it's actually here and the same people who had been tracking it for a long time were almost late to the party because they mistakenly wrote it off as yeah yeah yeah i've heard this before and so the same thing's happening with self-driving cars or sort of like a yeah yeah yeah but it's like wait a minute it's actually happening now um it's because it's an extreme game changer both like for society for tesla's business right like tesla's business is now going to be if you own a tesla when you're instead of 95 of the time your car just sits parked you're going to just tap a button say go make me some money please and like a dog it's going to go fetch it's just going to go out there and it's going to start doing rides for people and it's going to start earning you money passively uh all the time dude i think uh i think morgan stanley or chase one of the big banks like last week was like wrote wrote this report where they had to say what the world's going to look like with self-driving and it wasn't like um it was far more grand they're like the economy is going to look radically different because people are going to have so much more time like it was like at a macro scale it was like oh like the world will change because of this but it was also like there's 60 i think thousand car deaths a year like what's the world going to look like with with more people like like it was like a pretty meaningful like it was like a very grand way of thinking about it wasn't just like oh wow i could play on my phone while i'm walking or driving to work right it was like no everything changes i i asked last night i asked grok i said what are the second order effects of self-driving cars here's what it said so it's like cities are going to look completely different right now parking lots itself occupy 30 of all urban land um in some cities and this is going to you're not going to need parking lots because the cars aren't going to just sit parked they're going to be running around you're going to need way less cars in a city plus they don't they're not going to sit still so you don't need all of the space just look around the city how much space is dedicated just to parking like we're going to look back and that's going to look sort of like a cavemen style thing it's like in the future those are going to be parks yeah it's going to be like it's going to be smoking in a restaurant yeah exactly and so like the good version of this is that's like you know green spaces and affordable housing but like who knows maybe maybe it actually gets co-opted for some other purpose they all just become like you know drone delivery uh you know parking units where amazon keeps like 10 million delivery drones um the next one is labor so right now there's three and a half million truck drivers alone let alone all of the like uber and taxi drivers and you're just not going to need that job period like and i don't know what happens to that but there we go uh the next one is you know basically i think the average person spends something like 90 minutes a day just commuting and so you get you know of your wake time let's say you're awake for 16 hours you're going to add you know what is that so let's just pretend it's two out of 16 you're going to add like you know 13 more time to everybody's day where they can now sleep eat work play right you're going to sit in a car and you're not going to have to think about the car you're just going to be able to do one of those things which also means the car becomes a new place for entrepreneurs to build experiences right like today there's no one out there being like i build car games right there's people who build mobile games and xbox games but there's nobody builds car games well car games is going to become a thing because people are going to sit in cars and play video games people are going to sit in cars and they're going to relax recover they're going to work and so you're going to build tools that that go in them uh another one is insurance it's like the whole insurance system like you know buffets big bets and geico and all those things it's all based on human driving and so if humans aren't driving anymore like both the risk and the the risk reward ratios change but also who are you insuring you're insuring the software company versus like individuals like how's this all going to work and so that whole and all the whole insurance industry uh changes um and then basically like car ownership so today owning a car is both like utility but also status symbol so it's going to be kind of interesting like you're a car guy like i wonder when they're self-driving cars and basically transportation's just on tap like flowing like water right you just you push a button and in 30 seconds a little car the car of your liking pulls it's just going to be like uh it's going to be like people who like horses now like it's going to be a small group of people who are passionate yeah it's just like oh you're passionate about it and you are lucky enough to have enough room or enough money to like afford it but uh like maybe i'll like buy a groupon and can go experience that once in my life like that's what it's going to be yeah or like you know like horseback running is like therapeutic people like to like brush a horse or pet a horse it's going to be like that with a car it's going to be like male therapy to just like get in there and just be behind the wheel have control over something in your life yeah it's good or like weak punk yeah you're gonna like feel the noise and like smell the gas like it's gonna be um it's gonna be like a hobby yeah it's not gonna it's not going to exist i don't think i think it's gonna be a lot longer um but like in 20 it could be 20 years 25 years it's not gonna be in the next five years but yeah it's gonna be a hobby are you sure about that why do you think it's not gonna be in the next five years waybos are now doing 20 of all the rides in san francisco because that was zero like dude have you like have you ever like a large percentage of people of americans have to have to drive um let's say 60 miles one way to to work or they have to like pull stuff or carry stuff i just don't think i think that for the urban there's it's not um um there's good there's going to be like a there's probably going to be like four sections of users so it's like young urbanites and it's like yeah you guys don't need a car at all like you're you're you're doing probably already there with uber yeah and then like the far end of that spectrum is like uh rural people who have to actually tow stuff you know even though everyone has a truck very few actually use it but there's like that section and there's like the people in between and there's gonna be like a timeline because like if you ever you can't really tow anything on an electric car right now uh it's like it's they you say you can but go talk to someone who lives in rural texas when you have to like be driving around all day it's like impossible so i think that there's gonna be like um it's gonna be like for um you know what's that early but when you say it's not gonna be five years are you saying it's not gonna be meaning self-driving is not gonna work no it's gonna work it's just not gonna just the user adoption it's like it's gonna it's gonna take a minute for that for the whole spectrum of people i think for the urbanites and people like that it's it's tomorrow we're gonna do it i think yeah i mean that guy towing probably still doesn't he still has an aol email address right yeah yeah like so i think it's pretty safe to say that that person's not yeah it might be 40 years before that person it's gonna be a long time but then like you know there's like a lot of you you know people like i'm one of them like i'm romantic about my gas vehicle i had an electric car and i got rid of it and i'm like in my head i'm like i acknowledge it's better i acknowledge that like it's the future but it sucks i want it's like our vegan friends it's like i get it yeah we shouldn't kill creatures but it just tastes so good yeah but when you dip them in ranch but i'm excited too what's crazy is in austin i think or sf people are actually paying more for the waymos yeah yeah it's not it's not that much cheaper yet that was but people are people want to not be around someone and uh that was unexpected so like when i was when i drive my my i have a b&w that has self-driving stuff i feel way safer on that than if it were just me uh and i think that there's like 20 of people and it's usually men i've noticed i've noticed women tend to hate everyone i've talked to hate self-driving and every man i've talked to likes it and uh like have you have you do you have any self-driving now um no well i don't i don't have it so i haven't had that that level of a i haven't had a sample size to no i've noticed that i'm curious if that's common or if you're just like indexing on three people no it's well yeah i am but uh yeah it's like five of my friends like the husbands use it and the wives are like nope i don't mess with that i don't use it right but i feel way safer with it um you want to do one more thing or you have something well i have a so i tweeted something out that elon replied to over the weekend and how did that make you feel did you like did you like clap and like scream no so i first of all i played it so cool you wouldn't if you had seen me you would have thought i might be under the weather that's how cool i was playing it and actually what happened is um i just texted my wife and i was like oh not elon replying to me and uh and then i just i forgot about it next day i didn't even think about it i moved on my mom calls me she's like sean what did you say i'm like what she's like sean what did you say elon what'd you say to elon and i was like what my wife put it up on her instagram story and i was like oh my god i'm trying to play it cool over here and then you made it like you know lame city so that felt interesting that i got like multiple phone calls from people and i was like that's like the only time your wife has shared something that is when another person replied to you yeah exactly and so i thought that was interesting how big of the reaction was but the thing i had said was i wrote within a couple years years not using ai while you're doing your job will be the equivalent of coming to work without a computer like if someone just turned up and they're like no i didn't bring it today you'd be like what the hell dude like what what are you planning to do what what is the what's the plan here that's how it's going to be if you're if you're trying to do your job and you're not using ai constantly to do your job yeah that was good he was like you know sooner probably and um and so that was like and so i started thinking about that and i started thinking about um somebody else said this thing they go pretty soon being a doctor who's not using ai as a co-pilot like you're let's say a radiologist and you're just trying to eyeball every every mri and you're not also running it through ai that'll be considered malpractice because like you put the patient at risk by not at least including the second layer of ai diagnostics and i thought that's pretty interesting it's like the flip is going to go so much from this doesn't work you know something we don't do we don't even use it to if you're not using it it's considered malpractice whether it's corporate malpractice or medical malpractice my doctor friend admitted to me the other day he goes open ai is a better doctor than me and uh he was like and i knew this was going to be popular because for years he's been a doctor for 10 years patients come to me and said well google says this or web md says this and he says over the last six months the only people who have used that reasoning is with open ai and i said well according to open ai yeah chachi pt said this uh and he goes and they're right a lot of times the diagnosis is right dude i got in a fight with a doctor recently about this did i tell you this what did they say my mom had to have a surgery and but she was on a trip and so i'm like calling in to the doctor every time the doctor would make her rounds she would like facetime me in um she's on the other side of the country and so the doctor would come in and like doctors doctors are very hit or miss i love some doctors but a lot of doctors i'm like wow this is an extremely underwhelming experience and so this one doctor comes in and she's like yeah your levels were fine and then i'm like i actually read the test through chat gpt and the levels were like high for this and she's like well which level and i'm like i tell her i'm like whatever the thing then whatever the term was and she's like yeah that was high but you know um it depends on the exact number so i go what was the number i i would have to check i'm like you're the doctor so yeah you would have to check like you know what are you what are you talking about and i'm like you know they basically chat gpt said if it's above this then you should consider doing this like additional additional step like do you believe that that's like do you agree with that like do you think we should do that that step she's like well i i mean you're putting me on the spot here and i don't have the number and i'm like and she basically was getting pissed and she's like well if you're going to ask me questions then i'm going to need to go look at the number and i literally was like yeah you are going to need to go look at the number then because i'm going to ask some questions like what are we doing here i don't understand like why are you offended by me asking if you if you have seen the data from the test the test you just said to run and now you're coming back to discuss the test results and you don't want to look at the test result i don't really understand what's happening here well i think what's going to happen is that you know how have you noticed so uh have you ever been to a doctor now with an ai scribe so like they have like for okay so for a long time oh i was humiliating her in front of her ai scribe is that what happened well for a long time they could have been human scribes and so like have you been to a doctor and seen like a person on an ipad like literally it looks like the doctor's facetiming typing notes yeah yeah and that's like a scribe now they have ai scribes and i think what's going to happen it's like the ai is going to like talk up and be like actually ma'am he's right uh like like i think that's what's going to happen and if i was an entrepreneurial doctor i would 100 start a new practice all centered around we are ai first so we work with our ai you know and i don't think that you we aren't we aren't at the point and maybe we'll never be at the point where you totally trust it just like you always want the pilot even if autopilot is still a thing right but i would like go heavy on that uh of leaning into like we have all of the contacts here uh we have all of your files uploaded to our chat gpt or whatever it is and have an ai first because i think that a lot of people like you and me and people listen to this podcast they have the similar sentiment where they're like oh no i trust a computer way more than a human being but i would also want the human being to put their stamp on it it's also and i want to sue them if i'm wrong because it's not even that like oh the ai found the problem and the doctor didn't sometimes it's just as simple as like cool the doctor came in they talked kind of fast they didn't fully explain i still have more questions and so you go and you ask chat gpt to explain it to you maybe simpler or you ask some follow-up questions maybe you're not as embarrassed to ask questions you feel like you're not like you know the person's not like in a rush to get out of there like a lot of doctors are and so sometimes it's not even that the ai doctor is better because it's smarter sometimes it's because it's infinitely patient or it's an infinitely better communicator or you know it knows um you know maybe other things about you or you know you could ask some follow-up questions you don't feel silly doing it like those are other components of the doctor experience essentially bedside manner that ai is better at yeah and uh so i'm like very eager to see how this works i go to um i go to a doctor now a concierge doctor and it's not very expensive but the reason i go there is the average at most doctors they have to see four patients an hour so they're at 15 minutes right and is that insane i remember i went to a doctor and like i had an earache i'm like guys my ear is killing me and uh like he spent no time like trying to like help me like figure this out and i went to a concierge doctor and the average time is 45 minutes so we can like thoroughly walk through things and so if i can just use all the information that they have and then go and ping chat gpt to further the conversation it is pretty brilliant um i'm very eager to see what's going to happen i like people act like ai is amazing for a bunch of different stuff and it is but what they're doing with medicine and drugs and cancer and things like that is like pretty astounding and i think that's going to be the major breakthrough in the next couple years dude the other one lazy ass parenting so your kid's a little young for this but it is amazing dude i'll open up gemini and it has like a camera mode but why do you use different ones you've said claude or sorry you said uh grok and now you're saying gemini and then we also refer to so you use different ones it's like you know you go to your different friends for different questions you only ask me certain questions sometimes you go to jack smith and sometimes you go to your you know you go to joe you go to different people for different things so like if you want to be if you want something that's a little bit more real and objective i think grok is better if you want something that's uh either code or creative writing claude is better you know they the catch all is chat gpt and then gemini has some like advanced features so this is what i'm saying like gemini has the thing where you just turn your camera on like facetime and i think it's for like maybe you're supposed to like show it your car be like how do i repair this and it like tells you what to do but i just pointed at my kids and i'm like hey we're playing charades guess what they're doing and then my kids will like get on the ground and start like crawling and it's like hmm seems to be a boy crawling maybe it's a snake is are you a worm and it like tries to guess it and they love it dude and so i'm able to just straight up chill and let them play with ai it is amazing another one i'll do is i'll just be like hey i have a five-year-old and a four-year-old here and they want trivia questions they like animals they like paw patrol they like um you know they know a little bit about pokemon but nothing too complicated um ask them a bunch of questions cheer them on when they get it right if they get it wrong tell them the right answer keep track of the score here's their names go that's the prompt and it plays trivia endlessly with my kids and they love it because it's all audio which kids can do they don't have to like be on screens to be able to do this and uh so i'm just discovering like game after game i can play with them like i'll do like basically replaced kuman with hey i need um advanced kindergarten math which like i don't even know what that means but it's like gets you for whatever reason those three words give me the sweet spot of like the question that that kind of works for my kids and um it's like a tutor right it's an infinitely patient tutor with them and it's not perfect in the sense of like you know sometimes it like starts and stops its audio because if you make any sound it thinks you're talking but damn it's pretty it's pretty good and it's like already usable for us i've not seen i i didn't even i didn't know much about gemini gemini live i had no idea what this was is this google this google gemini is like after summer break you know that one kid who comes back it's like they're kind of like hot now but you still have the old image of them like their reputation is still being like not hot but objectively they're hot now yeah nobody's really on it yet that's what gemini is gemini was basically out of the game this google's ai tools out of the game it's like i was just chat gpt grok yeah she changed yeah and then she changed and she like it's like wait like she got contacts and like she learned how to do her hair she like walked it watched the makeup tutorial it's like started rollerblading which was like surprisingly good cardio and now like suddenly gemini could do things that like the other ones can't do but nobody's on it yet which doesn't really actually give you any benefits wait so gemini is hot now gemini's hot now google's hot google's hot yeah i don't know man that's hard for me
