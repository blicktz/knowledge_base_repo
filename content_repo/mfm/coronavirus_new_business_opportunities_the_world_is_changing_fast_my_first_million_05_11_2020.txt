guys like a Satoshi Nakamoto of boring businesses so all right cool what's up how are you man oh yeah your video went blank for a second I'm great I upgraded my internet hopefully it looks better called Comcast now paid 60 bucks a month and just called them and with a click of a button I paid them more money and my internet was supposed to improve we'll see if it happens like magic great great business to be in I'm excited to talk to you I feel like it's been a little while I got a bunch of random topics to talk about I don't know how about you do you have anything that was top of mind for you yeah well I know about all this stuff that you are a lot of the stuff that you have in here right like I know it to the point of I wasn't sure if I wrote it or you wrote it that's the best okay great okay so I'm gonna start with let's pick one that's that's interesting okay so how about how about we start with this one so somebody was somebody tweeted this and I saw it and I was like this is pretty smart so a lot of people right now are talking about coronavirus how does the world gonna change and lots of speculation I think everybody sort of agrees okay handshakes you know might go out the window for a bit live sports you know it's gonna be a little tough so there's there's some things that we know we're gonna change and there's some things that you can't really predict they're sort of second-order effects and so somebody reached out and they had put together this they had like a group of people had put together this thing called the second-order effects of COVID I thought it was great I'm gonna find the PDF and I'm gonna link it in the description here I know one of the creators was this guy that I've met one time super super smart guy he created are you a Harry Potter fan no but I know I mean I'm not not a fan but I don't buy the stuff I've seen the movie so he created the site back in the day called muggle net which was oh yeah I know that guy he also created a oh oh my god pop or what was it he's a viral con not a OMG pop but he's yeah yeah yeah I know all about him tell me his name I'm trying to find it I can't believe I forgot it everton's wife so they started sports media yeah yeah yeah I know I know about him well I think his business is the one you're thinking about that's right so he started a chain of viral websites and they got really popular but like everything in that era I bet it just cracked right and but if I met this guy once and I was like oh my god if I could just bet on this guy's like lifetime earnings I would bet right away like this case this guy's really really sharp yeah he's um he's kind of like a almost a little genius II yeah I like when you say genius because it means like kind of hard to talk to like he's a little genius II but when I read about I'm like dude why are you doing these viral sites like you do anything yeah and I bet he will I bet he's gonna be one of those people that transitions from like yeah I first created these you know the Harry Potter fan site that became number one then I created this viral Twitter account and these viral meme websites oh and then I like solve climate change like that's what this guy's career should look like right all goes well he's cool so anyway what about him and a group of people created this thing that was like second-order effects they were basically like okay you know for example what's the second-order effect so everyone knows a first-order effect is coronavirus they you know is wild first-order effect you shelter in place okay but the second-order effect of that is like are people gonna have more babies our divorce is gonna go up because you're at home is grocery delivery gonna take off because of that and then there's like a third-order effect okay if grocery delivery takes off they need to you know instacart's hiring hundreds of thousands of delivery people okay what happens when all those people go to that job now they need a health care system for a gig worker becomes more important so there's like these these knock-on effects and so for a business person you want to think about okay oftentimes the biggest impact to the biggest opportunities are in the second and third order effects because you can start doing work now and then as this plays out those things those markets are growing rapidly but you can kind of predict them so a classic example of this was you probably know this better than I do there's some story like the highway system was built for for something like it was built for I don't know I forgot what it was like military purposes or something like that but the second-order effect was that like Walmart basically it was like oh people are gonna exit and want to get you know buy stuff get little you know get food get drinks blah blah so the whole retail cars got faster yeah cars get faster the retail system takes off because now there's a highway interconnect system blah blah blah so there's these second-order effects so one of them that I just thought was kind of interesting was this idea of drive-through and drive-in so now that you know movie theaters are like sort of going bankrupt because all their chairs are so close to each other that people like people aren't gonna go back to the movies movies are already kind of struggling and this might be the knockout blow and so people are talking about drive-in theaters is that gonna be a thing I could see it I could see you know sort of rising on top of that you have drive-through so how do you sort of minimize contact well drive-through caffeine so there's some coffee shops that are like the photos I saw on Twitter you know the line is out the door I've never seen a line this long except for chick-fil-a and so like what's this for and it's basically just drive-through caffeine and so I'm pretty bullish on this if somebody was you know right now they had like nine franchises but they were doing well and there were a drive-through coffee concept I would you know be very very bullish on this thing expanding and going from nine to 200 locations over the next two years because I think the need for this is gonna go up what do you think about that okay so what do I think do first of all are people gonna change their behavior forever let's let's talk about that right like our shaking hands gonna go away certainly now like I don't want to do a lot of that stuff but is that gonna change your behavior forever I don't know um what's the what's an announcement like what can we compare this to like World War II I mean September 11th like when I see when I hear low planes I get scared so like no no TSA clearance right so like you used to be able to just walk into an airport take a ticket that didn't even have your name on it and board any plane and it took you five minutes to get from the you know check-in desk to to the gate and now it's like yes you know security buffer in an hour you have to have your ID it's got to have your name on it if your name sounds a little sketch hope you're gonna come to this special room and get checked the world changed forever from that sure but we're also talking so the September 11th was definitely like a lot of like force change like TSA but then what we're discussing is like unforced change like when you and I see each other are we gonna hug are we gonna high five are we gonna are we gonna like you know what I mean it's like yeah so like how far away are we gonna say so I would imagine that some of these consumer behaviors are a little bit more analogous analogous right so that I don't know man will we change I think so I think that at least for three years something is gonna change the question is what's gonna change and to how long is it gonna change or is it gonna be sort of a temporary precaution that goes away well so look you how long did you live in China for two years maybe not long enough to maybe maybe long enough to when when they went through they've had not I don't know if they've had pandemics but they've had a variety of outbreaks of things like this has is their behavior yeah like the masks is a great example so like masks quite common in Asia to be you know something you just generally wear out and nobody even bats an eye or seasonally like when it's flu season yeah everyone masks up I'm not trying to get the flu and you know you don't see that here but will you maybe you will like I I would I would expect but do they go to crowded movie theaters they do yeah there's something there's crowds everywhere in China you like can't avoid a crowd but you know yeah like a billion people in a small city so it's very you know there's crowds everywhere in China but people do behave quite differently than they do here gloves you know gloves are very sort of common there that that people here don't wear gloves just on their day-to-day life right so but yes I do agree I think things gonna change I think specifically big cities are gonna I mean I'm biased because it's directly impacts me I think cities are gonna our cities are different right I do think that work is gonna be different we we're getting rid of our office in San Francisco yeah exactly so you know there's all these sort of second order third order effects example of a second order effect of the TSA so first order effect is TSA second order effect is people selling toothpaste in three ounce bottles because that's what you need now to get through that right that became a market where before who wants this tiny little bottle and so you know from I'm just trying to keep it from a business perspective because you know from a medical scientific and cultural perspective you know don't listen to me listen to other people but from this perspective I think that there are it is worth you know taking a pen go into a whiteboard and starting to map out okay if this then that and then if that then what and the what is where your business opportunity lies and if you're looking for that it's also just a good way to guess and check even if you're not gonna go do those things the only way to get your gut to be good is to predict a bunch of times and be wrong or right and go revisit those and so I often do this we're all predicting also let's talk about some talk about some of these predictions here I pulled it up so some of these predictions here are so gyms are gonna go away or significantly go away and which means innovation and home exercise obviously that's like you're looking at the doc that's not we link it to you real quick that's yeah that's like just yeah that's um I mean that's not even a question right well I don't think gyms are gonna go away necessarily but yeah people are going to whatever the home exercise market was versus gyms it's gonna eat more share are you exercising at home yeah but it's you know I exercise at home as much as I do at the gym which is like weak on both fronts um have you oh how about that's interesting funerals I don't know um cities will become uh less popular that's one of his predictions suburbs and rural become more popular like bill girly came out today and was like you know camping and rving is gonna go on the rise because people still want to travel but they're not gonna want to travel you know in dense areas staying in you know maybe maybe staying in hotels or uncleaned airbnbs yeah I just rented an RV um so I'm gonna do a three-week cross-country trip for my birthday in June um so I yeah I'm I love that uh I completely agree I've never understood that in the first place anyway Americans are kind of interesting whenever they like want to do a gap year or like travel for a honeymoon or whatever they always want to go outside the country and I'm like dog like let's you should explore here it's way easier and we have everything I mean that's what's interesting about America is that we have every time I think we're the only country that has every geography uh or every climate uh so anyway um another thing that he talks about is virtual tours and virtual museums um so on trends we had talked about um a company that was crushing it with virtual museums and we also talked about a company that was uh doing uh what was it called the vr thing uh I don't remember the name of it but I know what you're talking about sand vr or um is that was it sandbox uh and I yeah so I I think it's great they're struggling though with this right because sandbox vr you have to go to a physical place wear a headset that somebody else wore an hour before and um you know do this in person and and they place their locations in malls and they're supposed to be foot traffic from the malls so foot traffic is dead nobody wants to wear a device that somebody else just wore and um you know in general this is like sort of a fringe behavior anyways and so I talked to you know I heard from them that you know they had to be really conscious about how they're going to do this I think they did some layoffs and whatnot but they you know they have to figure out how are we going to survive and what does the new world look like and so unfortunately some great ideas and great businesses uh you know some markets got punted back a year or two four years whatever it is and some markets got pulled forward like is my friend uh Chris from first base and they do remote work setup so you you know everybody's now at home but this wasn't the case when I started advising him when I started advising him it was like hey I think companies are going to be going remote more and if you have a remote employee they need a desk and a chair and they need a webcam and they need a microphone so they can work effectively remotely maybe companies will pay to give them a home desk and I was like I don't know maybe they'll pay maybe they won't and then boom this thing happened and like his waitlist has exploded thousands of companies signing up and he can't handle the demand and now every company has to have a person like you know at the head of HR or whatever that is planning how are we going to have so many employees remote and also hey this is actually this remote thing actually kind of works why are we paying so much for our office um let's just do this this is way cheaper and so you know the the world has changed for him his market got accelerated by four years yeah I uh that's incredibly fascinating I uh what I think we should do is we should just link to this this document is dense there is no way that we can yeah talk about all this but I think it's cool I think it's cool that somebody did this and that they just published it as a google doc that anybody can access I think that's just like a cool way of going about things um and also one that I like on here one more that I like is um church so like you know church was one of the super spreader type of places where everybody congregates people often hug or shake hands or touch and um it can spread throughout a community rapidly if you if you have churches open and so how are people going to do this right is church going to go away no are people going to go and six feet sit six feet apart maybe I don't know and so I'm of the opinion that um church like live streaming for churches is going to be a very big deal um I've been in the live streaming space for a while so maybe it's one of those situations where you know to a hammer everything's a nail and for me everything can be live streamed but no I I you're definitely right church is one of those things that's every Sunday so people can build a habit and um you know the experience of a live stream sermon is pretty much just as good as being there it's not that much worse in fact in many ways it's more convenient and you have all the sort of community features like chat or donations I mean that's like what the twitch product is for example and I researched and there's a platform called church online now or something like that church online platform some some horrible name like that I just it looks like a pastor who learned programming in his spare time and like you know sat in the pews and and coated this thing up like it is it is so uh you know unbranded and backwards in a way but he said they have seven million members or something crazy and um you know I guarantee that's not the best thing that's out there so for me you know digital faith is a big thing whether that's sort of like a next door for churches I don't know what that means but sounds provocative I like it uh is it is it twitch for churches is it you know what is it and so I would be if I was if that meant something to me if religion meant something to me I'd be like now is my time I need to combine technology with community building and religion and I need to bring these these real world institutions online I uh I'm very excited to see what happens with all that stuff um speaking of this corona stuff you have on our sheet that you want to talk about outdoorsy um I would love to talk about that as well you talk about it because I don't really know about it I just put it on there because I'm like oh interesting and I didn't do any research so you tell me about it okay let me uh the good thing about us doing this remotely is my computer's right in front of us okay so outdoorsy it's a uh it's a peer-to-peer market this is the exact description peer-to-peer marketplace to disrupt the 32 billion dollar recreational vehicle industry okay so they've raised 75 million dollars they've raised a lot of money is this what you use to rent your rv clearly you said you just rented an rv no because i i think i'm going to drive from san francisco to new york and then maybe fly back i i have to i have to figure it out um i i technically haven't rented i have a lot of uh outgoing quotes so i've got people who are going to be sending me back quotes so i think for outdoorsy it's kind of like airbnb where you submit it sometimes you got to get approved um and so anyway outdoorsy is interesting if you want to learn about this industry there's actually um what's that guy's name who's on that tv show called uh profit marcus something isn't the name yeah marcus something yeah marcus the prophet i've watched like eight episodes leonis yeah yeah that's right or no limana something like that well anyway a lot of people don't know this but marcus is actually i don't know if he's the founder i think he like uh aggregated a bunch or brought a bunch of companies together so he's the ceo and chairman of camping world good sam enterprises gander outdoors and the house board shop basically all of this is around rv and camping and you can actually go and read about this company um and a lot of their information is public so you can kind of see huge business many many hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars in income and so what outdoorsy is doing is basically is basically kind of screwing up that model and i love it um i don't know right do you know what their revenue is um i don't know outdoorsy's revenue i think it's uh quite high if i remember correctly it's over 100 million let me just do a quick check let's see yeah look okay 325 million in 2019 jesus christ okay but there's a difference between revenue and is that their revenue or the gross bookings that might be their gmv uh let's assume for a second it's their gmv because marketplaces love to do that um so let's say you know they're so you take 10 of that exactly 32 million is their take maybe yeah so they're just exploding right now eh yeah this is i mean this is a great uh business and you know we talked about before hey marketplaces are great um what are the fringe or niche marketplaces and this is one of them right renting rvs um you know and now now is the time and so they you know so i think they're going to ride a wave of um interest as people sort of crave being outdoors crave travel but need to be away from others how about hip camp are you familiar with hip camp yeah they're like the same idea right they're like a turnkey glamping is that right camping camping experiences camping in the way that i would do it where i'm like all right do i want to learn how to camp and like go get an rei membership and buy like hundreds of dollars of stuff and then be like wet all night like no i'm not interested in that but this is like hey you know sleep in this instagram worthy tent is what i remember of it yeah it can be as easy as that or it can be as difficult or you can make it as difficult as soft or hard as you want right yeah so you could just like go and rent like a cabin which isn't probably camping but or you could just like get a plot out like an area and like land and uh apparently they're booming as well so they've raised about 50 million dollars and what's interesting is if you told me about hip camp about two years ago i'd be like this is not interesting but it is kind of interesting and there's a i don't know if this is a company but okay so like i am like i'm like a uh habit i keep referring to this type of stuff but what i always like to do is i like to look at comparables and i like to look at public information so do you know what koa is never heard of it okay so koa i don't know what it stands for actually but what it is is it's a uh it's a it's a non-profit and they have campgrounds throughout the country and if you go to um like in colorado they're all over the place you'll be on the highway and you'll see in the same place you see signs for food you'll see a koa sign and what that means is if you're a member you can um for i think it's like 20 a year it's super cheap you can camp there either for free or for five bucks a night right it's really cheap and um i used to uh use it all the time when i was traveling and so according to uh some analysts or i think they're privately owned they're not a non-profit they do about 40 million dollars a year in sales and they charge like five bucks right it's like dirt cheap um and so if you want to learn about that business look up koa that's probably the best comparable um it's a i can't believe sean you've never heard of koa never like i'm looking at it now it looks great seems like an obvious idea fantastic but the what's interesting to me what i love doing is i love looking at these older things uh like koa like boy scouts and it's like show me the demand and that kind of gives me an idea and then if you just like add add-ons and operate it in a in a way where you prioritize revenue and profit then things get super interesting um and so koa is a really cool one uh to look at it's yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting group and i also think that in terms of rv i would look at uh marcus leona leomas's companies right and you can a lot of that information is out there i love it i love hearing about businesses that i've never heard of that are uh successful i feel like there's a like my brain i feel like is organized like there's a set of hangers and every hanger i can just hang another like business or business model onto and then that's just mapped in my brain and then when i see something new i'm like oh is this a new hanger or do i just attach this to one that already exists and i start to see a pattern of like oh yeah there's five things that are just like this and so that's what i see when i love hearing about new things because it's just another thing to hang into my brain have you um updated your home at all while you've been at your house i had built a home office right before covid because i was planning to work remotely anyways for the much of month of march which just happened to be like covid um so that's been like the only home upgrade and then started breaking my dishwasher broke my dryer broke so i'm like that's not an upgrade um yeah that's it i started going to the park every single day and i bought these little like tiny fold out uh park chairs and i've actually seen several friends buying this same product it's called click cliq it's a um it's like you know whatever a park chair like you go to a soccer game you want to watch and you just want to unfold but the key is how small and discreet can you make the the fold in uh versus like oh i'm carrying a chair all the way to the park and uh i don't know it's going to arrive soon but i've seen like i've seen three different people i know mentioned this thing and i bought it myself too before that i have began spending so i've i think i'm saving like matt i haven't i actually um ever since the the stock market crash i have refused to log into my accounts dude everything's up right yeah i sold though okay i was like hey dude good news go log in so like my philosophy was i was like man there's going to be like dead bodies in the streets of new york and that's going to scare wall street and someone's going to take a picture of like a body in the like a in the like an open van with bodies and it's going to flip people out and they're going to like say sell sell sell and that happened there was like videos of like these like ice trucks with like uh bodies in there and nothing happened and that the day i saw that picture i was like i'm out right and it took off a week after and so i'm still sitting on a lot of cash and um i've lost a lot of money and i hope well i don't hope this but if it goes down and i yeah if it goes down and i get back and i so i anyway i haven't logged in i usually use i use personal capital and i log in all the time to check my finances i've not logged in so i don't uh entirely know what's going on but i uh the other day i went and bought like eight or maybe a thousand dollars worth of artwork because i'm like i haven't bought anything in forever i'm just gonna buy exactly what i want because i'm normally pretty cheap and uh i just haven't been buying have you been buying yeah i buy it like crazy dude because i shop online and now i lost track of like time and space so i'm just buying things and then there's stuff arriving and it's like if you can't go anywhere the next most interesting thing is like someone comes at your door and leaves a mystery box at the front you're like oh what did i order nine days ago i don't know i'm excited to go see what it is it's like this moment of fun um so i keep giving myself that gift but yeah buying a lot of stuff also all the delivery stuff is like super expensive so i'm like postmating and instacarting and it's like you know 400 for groceries or something crazy so i don't know if that's just an sf thing or i don't know what's going on can we all right i want to talk about this mark uh leonard guy who you have but before we get to that i have a good segue which is i i'm gonna get rid of these uh map i have okay so little people listening i have a background and i've got maps and which apparently is like a super basic thing to do i didn't know that uh but i have st louis yeah it's like the most it's like basic with a capital b uh st louis nashville or no st louis new york san francisco me and my wife are from those areas and uh i'm going to switch it up so i have a a wall of people who i inspired by so yeah so let me tell you who i have i have steve prefontaine you know who that is never heard of him who's that um there's a movie about him that's really great you don't have to be a runner to like it but he was uh he was a runner at oregon he was the first person to wear nike so bill bowerman was the coach of oregon track and field his uh pupil his his athlete was phil knight together they partnered and made shoes together steve prefontaine was probably the first person that wore them he was or one of and he was definitely the first sponsored athlete and he was kind of a badass runner where he was like um he was like kind of like a full clip so he would say like uh to give anything less than your best is a sacrifice your gift he said all this inspirational stuff but he died when he was 20 26 and he was just kind of a rubble without a cause then i have wait hold on how did he die uh he was drinking and driving and flipped over and crashed his car and suffocated crazy okay so pretty very very tragic but he lived fast died young and uh he uh it was real tragic because he got fourth at the olympics when he was a favorite even though he was only 23. anyway it was a big deal he's also like really good looking so it's like easy to like admire him um props to you for admitting that that's part of the appeal all right great yeah he's like he's like you know uh romantic kind of that type of thing like you kind of look good um then i have easy e and dr dre okay they're interesting to me because when easy e was only 23 24 25 something like that he created ruthless records which went on to become a huge business like hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales and he was just like a kid from compton who knew nothing didn't deserve to be there or you know like on paper like what are you doing here anyway they achieved it and dr dre fucking changed culture in in a in a variety of ways uh then i have felix dennis and ted turner ted turner started uh cnn i like him felix dennis he started a media company and he was like richard branson but more vulgar google him and then i have um i've got three more i've got mike tyson i love mike tyson he's screwed up so many times in his life but he's done a good job of being ferocious and kind of coming back and then i've got tupac and then um i think that's it that's amazing uh great oh nate diaz nate diaz all right so you have like i love nate diaz you have like the intimidators row dude like i'd say like the majority of your people fight for a living or like should fight for a living not intimidators row but i'm incredibly fascinated with people who are bold people who on paper should have done nothing and they did a they were really good at having bold ideas but then also were having fun along the way right so uh that's what i like like ted turner i think he had a he was a southerner he stuck out and but he had a bold idea and he laughed along the way so i'm always fascinated by that i went to uh sully's house our friend sully and he had this on his wall i was like i was like who are these people why do you have these pictures this is not your family and i was like because if the first one i saw was hillary clinton i was like why didn't you picture really clinton on your wall he's like oh these are people i admire and he had seven photos and i only knew like three of the people told me the other the four uh in the story and it was like hillary uh i don't know it was like whoever you know malcolm x or martin luther king or something like that and that was a cool idea i was like you know i guess that's cool like you know you walk out of your bedroom every day and you know go to your office or wherever you're going what does he admire about hillary clinton hillary clinton and sully don't see he loves hillary clinton i have no idea why he just thinks she's awesome okay i guess so i mean not even to say like that she's not awesome but i didn't think that she was wonderful enough that's exactly what an indian entrepreneur in san francisco cared so much i was like i don't want to sit here and hate on hillary i don't hate hillary but i am so surprised she made it to your wall like that doesn't make any sense i definitely disagree with that one yeah so yeah it's just like mediocre maybe um so let's talk about this guy constellation so i know a bit about them sean put this on here as billy of the week his name is mark leonard you want to yeah so in the background we sometimes do this billionaire of the week so the billy of the week is mark leonard constellation software so i had heard about this from a few people because uh they do something that you know we had andrew wilkinson on here and he buys internet businesses and sort of has this conglomerate of small internet business that he's collected that are now you know let's call it a hundred million dollars worth or maybe a little more a little less and um that's a fantastic success so this guy mark leonard did that like he's andrew's daddy you know like he his company's worth 31 billion dollars what they do is they buy software companies and they roll them up sort of um and they're they try to be a perpetual owner so they're not like they're not private equity where they're doing a leverage buyout and trying to flip you know cut it skin it and flip it or whatever um they tried to just own the thing for a long period of time and have the cash flows and so what i like about this guy what i thought was cool was this guy's like a satoshi nakamoto of boring businesses so he nobody knows about this guy you can't find a photo of them really wait what's that reference is that the bitcoin guy yeah you just don't know a lot about him all right yeah so so this guy you can't find photos of him he doesn't do public appearances he doesn't really talk he writes his annual letter um and you know but so i was reading like kind of the definitive thing about him because i wanted to learn and it's like all we know is this guy's born in 1956 maybe in south africa maybe in england and i was like what the we don't even know where this guy's from and you know he wrote on his bio he's like he was a vc but before that he said i was a banker evaluator a mason a grave digger a dog handler a bouncer a sapper and a wind energy researcher i particularly enjoyed the bouncing but an early retirement was necessary so i love it that i don't know anything about this guy but what he gave me i love um and i think half of those are like a joke but here's their business so they buy in the early on they buy they bought businesses that were you know two to four million dollar acquisition targets so very small acquisitions which is which is on paper you would say that's asinine why on earth would you ever do yeah chump change you know okay you know small ball but small balls turn into sort of big league returns and so um you know this data is out of date now because when the article i was reading was like hey this guy has uh you know done really well they did last year they had 1.2 billion in sales 20 margins they're doing 10 to 20 acquisitions a year um and at that time the market cap was 5 billion i looked at it while i was reading the article it's now 31 billion and so if you just invested in these guys they have a 31 billion dollar valuation and only 1.2 and so that was the old one when they were at 5 billion market cap now they're at 31 billion market cap so you know if the ratio sort of held uh held the same it'd be whatever six seven billion in sales we can see we can see what it is now but um i love that this guy's mysterious i love dude it's only it's only it's three billion their sales were only three billion dollars so a lot of money but that's interesting they got a good little i wonder i wonder why it's been on such the run-up because you can see the stock chart is like you know it's going up like crazy and then they can use that money for for acquisitions um and this guy he writes these annual letters that are actually pretty interesting so like if you're like me you i like to read bezos his annual letter i like to read warren buffett's annual letters um this guy is a new one i'm adding to the sort of arsenal of annual letters and he has lots of really interesting sort of views on business none of which are like totally groundbreaking but he does something that i think most people fail to do which is the same thing warren buffett does which is take a very simple principle that everybody would nod their head and agree with and then like actually stick to it and do it for like 40 years um and that's like a winning formula most people you know nod their head and then go do some other shit and they they get their lack of discipline and lack of focus and so uh i also like you know i was trying to read a little bit more about the company and you know they have sort of a a focus on what they call vertical software so they'll go for like within one vertical or sorry they looked at they said hey some companies are horizontal like a slack every company can use slack as a messaging service and slack will be a multi-billion dollar company but what about all these vertical things that are like better software or specifically tailored software for uh you know what if you're a golf club and you need to manage bookings tee times memberships and whatever else every golf club you will pretty much use whatever the best software is and they'll pay for it every every month reliably and they'll never churn so they'll buy like that clubhouse software they'll buy healthcare software public transit software law software and that's been their focus i don't know if that's changed over time but when i was reading about them they try to consolidate vertical market software which i thought was a pretty interesting approach what do you think of this guy so i love it i'm reading about what you have here so i i i love doing these things and i love what what he's doing and i actually i'm going to bring up a different point and i don't want to address it yet uh but i want to uh ask your opinion of it in a second but more so what i'm interested in is and i i don't want to refer to like things i tweeted that sounds super lame but i was tweeting earlier about how i hired an operator so basically adam ryan works at the company and he kind of handles a lot of the operational stuff and i work sometimes down in the weeds sometimes high above revision stuff and uh it's hard finding someone who's competent to run a business and so if this if this guy if if he might have does it say how many companies he has it could be like 200 right so i don't know if their model is if they keep the existing management or if they replace them i'm not i'm not 100 sure what they do i'm sure there's some some mix and blend there um one thing i saw that was interesting was uh so they like berkshire hathaway the execs of the companies do not get share options as their compensation which basically you know um incentivizes you to just boost the share price as you as much as you can which is often somewhat short term um so instead they take you know 75 of their after-tax bonus and they can buy shares on the open market and then those shares are held in escrow for four years so if the shares if their stock is overvalued because they are sort of temporarily pumping you know enthusiasm energy or doing buybacks or whatever they're buying overvalued stock and so um i don't know if this is perfect because maybe the other thing happens where they actually you know when they're about to buy they sort of you know bad news dips the state share price temporarily they could buy it on the discount so i'm not sure if any incentive system is perfect but i thought it was interesting that they've thought through how should we compensate everybody and and not sort of follow the traditional playbook so i want to dig in more i've only just scratched the surface of this guy i think there's a lot to learn here but i wanted to bring it up because i think it's very interesting and i like that he's a sort of mysterious character i think that adds to it so here's an interesting takeaway and this what i'm about to say actually kind of changed my business game and i'm going to name drop here but when tim ferris invested in us he told me he goes one thing that i've learned from i don't know who he learned it from but he goes uh there's this thing that i like to use called um did he i think he called it inverse incentives um or but basically the idea is if you when you incentivize employees to do something you need to actually have an opposite incentive that make sure it's balanced so for example if you're gonna tell your sales team you have a quota of this number and it's huge you also have to have an incentive it's kind of like revenue collection which means you only go after quality people who can pay bills or um retention which is you only get paid if you sell people and you are you treat them well and they want to go back basically and so yeah counter incentives i think that's what they called it um and that actually changed the game for me a lot because what i've noticed is with people if you give driven people incentives the right type of person will kill to get that done and you want those and you you want those people but you actually really need like that second incentive in order to make sure that it's quality and quantity um and so i love this incentive um but what i want to know is how on earth do they recruit all these people who are talented enough to run a business i've hired ceos for a handful of small businesses that i've had most all except for one or two have been horrible um and which maybe i'm bad at hiring but i think it was also it's really hard to find these types of people and so in my mind this company constellation they're more like a recruiting company than an innovative software company yeah you know i think that that is sort of the make or break we we i think you also invested in in our friends who are doing enduring ventures uh and so uh these guys are basically starting a a modern day version of constellation or what andrew is doing or whatever um where they're buying companies to hold forever that have strong cash flows and they want to own great businesses and um you know they've already closed they bought the first business they bought was a business called up council um ironically i believe this was sort of outside the model which is you know to my point earlier uh say a simple thing nod your head and agree and then go fucking do it um i think that they did not do that with up council because up council was not a great business it was a it's a potentially great business but it was currently sort of um in rocky waters but they got that at such a great deal and they structured the deal in such a smart way that i think they'll still end up making a lot of money from it um but anyways you know they're doing the same same sort of thing and their biggest challenge is is how do you find operators so when they bought up council you know the ceo that they placed was you know uh you know somebody that xavier had worked with and knew knew very very well anyways they brought in a team of operators but you know they're pulling from their personal networks that's what andrew said he did as well which was he pulled from people he knew or you know had worked with before in the past but i think that is the the largest challenge with this business model is being able to uh maintain a keep a great business a great business by having good operators in place because when you buy out the owner sometimes you may lose that great operations and if this interests you i think that there's a few giants that you can look up and one of them is alta vista or not alta visa that's a uh not that uh vista equity it's owned by this guy named robert moore i believe he's the richest black man in america uh he's the guy who's famous for or i'm the richest wait what i wish um he's well he's the guy who's famous for paying the tuition of everyone at morehouse when he gave a uh uh an address he said by the way all your guys's debt paid off so he's he's cool but that's what he does he does the same thing as does trilogy software so look up joe lamont who we've talked about um all right you want to talk about um oh here's what i was going to talk about okay so there's these companies like tesla and basically a lot of stuff that elon does which is like this like super sexy stuff i mean i'm not interested in in it but it is quite sexy to say you're gonna send a a uh you're gonna go to mars or you're creating these cars that are neat and fun and that whenever i think about these companies they're like the coolest companies where you create a hype video at the end of the year and you see everything they've done and you're like oh my god that's so sick like when they created like a video of elon celebrating the one of his rockets taking off i was like oh my god that's awesome um and so anyway constellations not that he doesn't do a video of him like looking at his golf club software right and it's pretty boring um but it's still fascinating because it's like a fun puzzle how do you sean balance like where are your aspirations like do you say like i want to do something that's full of excitement or do you find excitement in the boring stuff so i used to be uh pretty hardcore about this where i was like dude the only thing worth doing like if i'm going to spend my time and i used to be really like uh dismissive of people who were wasting their time doing things that uh were not sort of the peak of the peak so i was like okay um if i'm gonna do why would i do a job when i can own my own business then i was like why would i own a small business when i can own a big business they're both kind of take up all my energy and my time and it's like if i'm gonna do a big business why would i do a boring thing might as well do an exciting thing and that that train of logic made sense to me and i did that so at monkey inferno it was we are here to try to create the next hit consumer thing we're like we don't give a that that's low odds of success we want to create the you know michael had created bebo and which was like sort of like almost facebook he had like come within sort of inches of creating a facebook but instead ended up in the myspace pile and um you know did well financially but he didn't change culture and so we were like dude we can do this we can change culture and so we tried every you know messaging apps live streaming we tried all these different consumer things and failed like crazy you know even things that like kind of worked uh they ultimately were not successful because there was they were so home run driven they were grand slam driven so i backed off that and i backed off that maybe because i'm just burnt dude i just want to get wins like i don't need to change culture like i need to change my bank account and my lifestyle like so i don't know to what extent i'm um it's it's like i can frame it either way am i more mature because i'm like look i don't have i'm not as attracted to the sexiness of it i just want to build you know great things great businesses or am i just uh fearful and burnt out from failure it's hard to say for me right but my view definitely has changed where now i'm like oh that elon path i don't know that sounds like a lot of effort why don't i just do this simple thing that's going to like work yeah and part of me is like okay i i agree and i i agree and i am the same and then the other part is like yeah dude but you're just kind of being like a puss like what would the 12 year old and you like think is awesome um and every once in a while you got to listen to that and so i don't know how i feel like because the other day i was thinking about making a purchase and i um i sound like a like a kind of entitled rich dude right now which i'm not implying i am either of those things but i was gonna buy like a car like a cool car and it wasn't expensive it was like a ten thousand dollar um car and it was not practical and i was like weighing the like pros and cons of it and then i was like yeah but here's this pro which is like this is fun and cool and i want it right um right and i'm like when did i could become such an old man like where i'm not just doing just because it's exciting and i do think that like you we have to give into those urges a little bit more um elon recently was asked about uh this i think on i don't know if it was joe rogan i don't know what it was but he was i was talking about it he was like yeah like warren buffett um like he's like i'm not a huge fan of the guy not the biggest fan but he didn't say he disliked him but he was like you know what he does he's a capital allocator like he spends his time trying to figure out do i buy pepsi or coke it's so boring to me he's like yeah he's like he's figuring out to put 10 billion dollars into pepsi or coke he's like that's like that's boring to me like i want to change the world and you know i'm going to make cars electric so we don't have to depend on fossil fuels and i'm going to get us to mars so we're interplanetary species and i'm going to do neural link so that our brain can control you know you know our brain can download information and upload information like we're a computer in the brain and i'm going to do boring company because i hate traffic and i want to get you know from place to place and you know 15 minutes rather than two hours and i'm like okay you know respect like when you hear that you're like yeah that does seem like the maximum of winning um but you know i guess my view is my views have broadened but i'm like you where when i hear myself say it i'm like don't be a pussy dude just like come on go for it don't do what you would do at the beginning you know like uh don't don't lose that sort of uh dream um just because of practicality so i'm a fan of motorsports and motorcycles and i like i'm like some of these adrenaline stuff i like old porsches and all these exciting things and i see these guys on youtube like ken block and he's got this like compound or i'll see like travis pastrana and he's got this compound it's just a grown-up playground and i'm like oh one day that would be cool and then i'm like no no no no now like why why can't i just do that shit now and i so i constantly have to battle that in my head and so it sounds like you do the same it is about i have what's prudent like prudent versus like excitement uh and the balance between the two um okay let's let's leave with one or two uh little ideas real quick all right so i have one idea so are you familiar with pin duo duo okay so this is one of the largest companies in china um i think like a 30 billion dollar company that grew in the last i don't know four years or so all those numbers could be wrong but you get the idea big ass chinese company so um what the hell is pin duo duo is like groupon but it's with your friends so what happens is uh you go on pin duo duo and there's like an item the number one selling item tissue boxes number two selling item is like a vacuum or some um but it'll be like tissue boxes here's these tissue boxes you can get them for let's say you know twenty dollars you can get these tissue boxes but if you buy with your friends you can all get them for eight and it's like create a team to buy and so you see the item you want you create a team uh the way you create a team is it just gives you a link and you share that link through wechat or whatever your messaging apps are and if your friends are like yeah cool i'll join the group i'll buy at eight um like i'll pitch i will contribute to the cause helping you get a lower price and i get a a lower price too and so there's these team buys basically so this thing has uh become really really popular in china and i don't think it's become popular really anywhere else i know there's a couple of companies trying to do this in india as well and like you know god knows indians love a good discount so i do think this will work in india as well um but i was thinking about this so i was like okay you know if i was an entrepreneur uh you know just sitting on my you know at my desk and there was nothing on my desk i would just write the word pin duo duo 4x and i would just figure out what the hell x is i would spend a day on that brainstorm and so so i love it can i can i give you i'll let me i'm sure you don't want me to just talk to one hour straight so i know i like listen to it while you're talking i'm like in my head my brain's buzzing so you know tilt.com tilt got tilt fault it was what's it called it was called um crowd tilt so james tried to launch this he raised a lot of money it crashed and burned but no no no no no no no no no no no no and then another crowd tilt was um crowd was not a discount it was just hey we need 500 for a kegger everybody pitch in your 10 bucks if you're going to come to the party so it was a way to collect money but it wasn't discounting you're right so let's get rid of them um drop do you know drop formerly known as mass drop they do this right so i have yeah kind of it's similar you know you know i think to make this work it's all about the packaging and the positioning like so mass drop and this other company can offer the same technology and do the same thing but you really gotta it's it's really you gotta get that angle exactly right i think and uh mass drop has is trying this and from my friends who have inside information which i don't have they claim that mass drop is booming mass drop has raised close to 50 million bucks and um everyone i talked to who knows about the space says that it's a sleeper and it's um doing wonderful and they do a little bit similar stuff so i think that that's cool another bit of information is um something like master class so master class actually allows you to share passwords to one or two people um and someone someone in our trends group um posted about it and said like hey does anyone want to split master class with me and it was our most engaged post ever right and so i completely see the validation here uh this is incredibly so so yeah and back in the day i think woot was like this and there were some others where it's like hey this tv is you know cheap and they it wasn't exactly like it wasn't exactly the same i think the magic of this is that um it's your actual friend group that you use to do this so with the problem with groupon and all these others is you get these deal hunters so there's just this population of deal hunters they're getting everything at a discount and um they're not necessarily like the best customers long term they're not retaining long term all that stuff what's cool about this is you know one of the challenges for any business is you have to acquire customers so here's how i would do this today i think you can create pin duo duo for shopify what does that mean so there's all these shopify stores i don't know let's call it a hundred thousand shopify stores every single one of these shopify stores wants more customers they'll try to get those customers through either google seo or facebook ads two primary ways and then word of mouth let's say let's be on that um so you know they go and they go to facebook and they'll pay 15 for a customer uh to come purchase from them and if they want another customer they got to go pay another 15 dollars and that's unfortunate right and they'll offer discounts and they'll try to do a referral program or whatever but what i think they should do is um one of the largest sort of booms in shopify is this thing called afterpay or a firm which basically says hey when you're checking out instead of paying 85 for this you can do monthly payments for nine dollars and that increased the checkout rate because people can pallet nine dollars a month better than they can do ninety dollars today up front and so adding an afterpay button increased sales so i think if you added a buy together save together button you would increase sales so the way it works is you're about to check out and it says great you can either have this item for 80 but if you get five friends to buy you all get it for 60. um you all get it for 50 or whatever it is some discount there and you basically are saying rather than paying 15 per customer in facebook ads i will pay you know 15 i'll pay 10 right now to discount this item for you um because you're going to go acquire five customers for me right so like if i reduced it and i'm you know i'm basically reducing my cost by or my revenue by 20 20 bucks um per customer i'm able to sort of acquire customers through a new channel besides facebook ads which is sort of steadily price rising over time and also the way that if you get introduced to a product through a friend i think you sort of sort of have a better relationship with the product and uh better experience better retention than if you are only being advertised through by the company so i would try i think i think this is i think this is the best um it's very hard very hard because you have to you're building something from scratch here and it's all about like this is that this is definitely a uh all or nothing type of thing in my mind um where you have to get the positioning really really right and but i think if you do you're on to something huge right and i also think you know it's kind of it's kind of like a live streaming thing it's like live streaming isn't like hard to make i mean there's so many of them but you really got to find that angle that gets people this is more big business than small certain success uh big business most likely to fail the other thing that i think is interesting here i think when i was thinking about shopify and i was like okay what other buttons would i put at checkout that i could basically offer oh that's a great that's a great framework so like for example in mobile games they do this all the time you run out of lives and it's like hey you could buy another life you can share this with a friend and get another life or you can watch this 30 second ad and get another life so mobile games are like you know it's like a little you know wizard sitting inside a slot machine just trying to figure out how to take your money your time or attention and uh they've optimized the out of this and so what can you learn from that so maybe if you're at shopify or you have a shopify store maybe there's a plugin that you can add to your checkout which says hey if you want an extra you know dollar off or two dollars off just click this button and like us on instagram and boom now my instagram is growing with every customer that joins or whatever um yeah there's a bunch of there's definitely a bunch of tools that allow you to do that but i understand the most popular one is email like give us your email and you get a you get a 15 off or whatever and i think that's cool that's like level level one but like this idea of team buying of sharing to your instagram liking us on instagram i think there's just more things that you could do at the checkout page that would say how do i get your time money or attention um in some way that you're not currently giving me um and so i don't know there's a lot there because shopify is so big now that if you build something that works on shopify you can build a you know 10 million 20 million dollar business pretty quickly because every store will just adopt these like best practices fairly quickly i think um that first thing you're talking about group buying is incredibly interesting i've always thought that groupon uh i love groupon i think that uh their valuation is shit and i'm like that there's gotta be a better way to make that happen and i love groupon i love groupon i'm also familiar with app sumo which does group discounting for software and then um social stack i think it's called great companies what else could you do group buying is there any other like sort of space like app sumo is a great example where they're like okay cool sort of software um are there like i don't know could you do this yeah i mean like like where could you do this you well so a lot of this stuff has been tried and it doesn't always work but you definitely could do it i mean this is what kickstarter is right you do with a brand a brand they're like you have to tilt we have to cross this threshold and i don't know what it could work for i'd have to really think about it i i just i feel so ignorant on what it works so one way of thinking about it is it works better when the thing costs the maker nothing than when the when it costs the maker something right so uh software is great because every incremental sale of a piece of software costs the maker zero uh versus like if it's a physical item and it's like well now every tv if the more people that buy this the more people more tvs i have to sell at a loss and so i think digital works better than physical um that's one like premise i would make i would i would hold um when it comes to this and um and the other one is like where maybe i don't know if it works better for low price probably higher priced items because a the discount matters and b um maybe there's just more margin you know to be captured even after discount versus a low price item so maybe you'd be looking for sort of high price digital digital services software yeah i mean i think that you could definitely what about using it so what i would want to use it for what businesses buy um so like for example i want to buy a pitch book but it's 20 grand a year and i'm not going to use it that much but i would love to split it with someone so i think that's incredibly interesting one weird idea is i think that i would want to figure out a way to use it for lawyers so instead of having a legal firm um be my lawyer i split a lawyer with you and five other people right and that by the way that's a great name split it or split um would be a great name for a company that was trying to do this it's like hey you could do this but or you want to you want to split it with four others and uh hey you all save you have to have a ton of volume to make this work the other way you could make this work is if you make it to that cool let's say the price is 100 bucks and if i'm going to split it with five people i think what ends up happening is that everybody gets it for less than 100 but the total adds up to more than 100 right like uh like the total like i i end up making more than i would have off of a single customer paying full price by by letting you great you both split it first for 70 and now i get 140 and you get 100 right it's like how personal trainer does group training they're like if you want one-on-one it's a hundred dollars an hour if there's two of you guys who each pay 70 bucks an hour and it's like i now make more per hour that's a great idea that's a great idea i love split it i'm never going to create this because it seems way too hard but i understand the need and the problem and i would love to be involved in as a customer or some capacity great all right split it's a bounce um good brainstorming we'll be back in a couple days with another brainstorm um people said you can't keep up this pace how can you keep coming up with new ideas every week twice a week are you crazy but they don't understand they don't know how this brain works if you spend enough time doing it which we definitely don't always do but a lot of times we do it is not and if you lower the bar on what you call an interesting or good idea so you have to simultaneously lower the expectations and practice that is the uh that is the criteria it's that easy leave us a review tell us what you think tweet at us whatever we'll talk to you all soon
