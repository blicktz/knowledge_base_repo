mobile uh podcast and video studio buy like a few vans kit them out with like a pretty fire setup just in the back of like a normal size van doesn't even have to be an rv for like two to three people could fit deck it out with like a few good dslr cameras that can do the recording like dual camera setup so you have like a few mics hanging off the sides and basically go and post it up in a couple of major cities like one van in each major city and rent it out for like 500 bucks for two hours to do podcast recordings or like you know a couple hundred bucks to do like people going in and filming instagram shorts tick tocks like that like if you put one in la and you put one in new york city i bet you could kill it what's going on who's who's the guest sean we got sahil here the man who answers the question what would happen if sean was better looking smarter harder working is here definitely not smarter yeah but don't dispute those other two i'm just screwing with you so what's up guys happy to be here how often do you get your hair cut let's start with the most important question uh you know like every other week at this point now my wife is making fun of me for this because like it used to be that i'd go once a month wasn't a big deal and now i'm going like every other week because i like to keep it tight and she keeps giving me because we have a little newborn at home and i'm like oh i gotta go gotta go um so yeah it's becoming an issue you don't call it a hair appointment that's the only thing you can't do if you say i got a hair appointment then you're out as a guy the place just can't be called a salon that's always been my rule it's gonna be a barber shop you seem like you seem like a salon guy though the person look at you man you're wearing like you got like a werther sweater on you look like you're getting ready for christmas it's like it's 85 degrees in austin texas today yeah so are we at your like book reading for your for your book right now sam what are you doing it actually does look like you should have a fireplace in the background and you're gonna be like reading us nice stories in a soothing voice i'm definitely drinking tea right now uh so basically like your bio is pretty easy you were a nobody private equity guy the pandemic hit the pandemic hit and you're like i'm gonna be somebody in a matter of two years you got famous on twitter what do we what do we have nine or eight hundred thousand followers so you got famous on twitter and basically transformed your life all because of twitter and covet is that right i mean the nobody private equity guy designation is not unreasonable i mean that's like i think that's totally fair i mean there's a lot of nobody like finance guys that are making bank out there though right like that would have uh that would have stung but now you're like famous and stuff so now it's okay to laugh at it i mean i don't know like do you think it's things like the if you're making pretty good money doing something like that i mean vps and private equity at this point if you're doing well like you're making seven figures as a vp in private equity name four of them yeah what about dude i hung out with some pe guys the other day and i didn't know them well enough but obviously i just in the back of my head how rich are you and that's like just what i wanted to keep asking are if you own a pe shop is it safe to assume that you're just wealthy and how much do they actually earn yeah i mean if you are if you are a gp so like one of the principal owners of a private equity fund and you've been doing it like across multiple funds that have performed well over a period of time it's pretty safe to assume that you've got a net worth north of 50 million dollars because i mean you just like simple math on it right most of those funds are taking like one and a half to two percent management fees on you know if you're running a big fund 500 million plus a billion plus if it's like a real substantial fund so there's you know 20 million plus coming in a year on a billion dollar fund uh and realistically most of them don't have that many employees so they're not having to actually pay out a ton of that in terms of like you know operating costs and then you have carry and they're taking you know 15 20 25 percent uh of profits above their hurdle rate whatever that is eight percent so you're like you know you're talking about if they double the funds there's 200 million dollars plus of carry to go around and so the principal owners of those are taking the lion's share of that i mean if there's 200 million and their principal owner owns 20 30 of that it's a ton of money and i think that i've always i can't decide if it's jealousy because i'm like you guys are making a lot of money for what feels like not a lot of work or if it's actually i dislike them because i feel as though they're just like excel sheet monkeys and they're like not actually creating value where's the reality no i mean they work crazy hard man i i don't um i don't know anyone that is a long time gp uh in private equity that doesn't work you know 70 plus hours a week of like stressful work i mean it's the type of thing sean would absolutely hate like you think about like people that care about leverage on their time it's like pretty piss poor leverage and it's high stress work because you're putting a bunch of debt on these companies typically and you know during a downturn like right now right it's hugely stressful because you're constantly dealing with like breaking covenants on the debt and having to restructure and you know like basically what ends up happening is you spend 80 of your time on the like couple of losers in the portfolio and the winners you just like kind of get to set and forget it because they're growing they're you know you're getting like a levered upside on them because you put you know 70 leverage to buy the company 60 leverage to buy the company and you're just like eating off those couple of winners but you're dealing constantly with the ones that are losers so sean and i have our hand in this world where like we've definitely sell and have sold courses and information stuff we also have a podcast and so that that's like this like personality world but then we also have built uh nice size companies and we will continue to build very likely much bigger companies and so we have our foot in that world for you you have your foot in like the pe world as well as the thing that we're in this information thing where do you think do you think that one do you think that the information world or whatever we call this thing is actually a uh is it an equal uh revenue or net worth driver as like some of the traditional company building or pe stuff yeah i mean like i think you have to think about it in terms of like your uh you know profit potential multiplied by like the freedom and time freedom that comes with it right to like get to like kind of an adjusted profit that you can generate from something doing it in pe and like making 50 million dollars in pe from a time adjusted standpoint is a is a pretty grindy way to go do it it's like high certainty if you're just on if you're at a good fund and you're rolling with a good fund and you're like going to be a partner there and you're going to get more and more carry across you know bigger and bigger funds it's a pretty low beta way to go and generate that type of you know that type of net worth but you're going to be working your ass off until you're like 60 years old doing it versus you know you go on the information side uh into the information economy and you're like doing newsletter doing podcast courses stuff that you guys are doing where you're like you know sean might do his course and in a week make 300k uh and then be able to chill for you know two three months if he wants to because who cares right it's like it's just a totally different time leverage um so i don't know it's it sort of depends on like what you want to do in that regard dude what's your what's your job now i mean i kind of do like 10 different things um i've got the fund you know like so i ended up raising the fine and do the rolling fund like sean but i've got a 10 million dollar venture fund that i raised from you know a handful of institutions and then a bunch of like the gps at big funds invested in it and basically like kind of share deal flow um i've got the newsletter which you know monetizes like but we can talk about it but like you know with newsletter sponsors now it's 125 ish thousand subs and you know it makes anywhere from like three and a half to six thousand dollars per send right now and i send it you know eight to ten times a month so um you know pretty nice just like business that scales to your point on like time leverage i write the same two newsletters a week and it's pretty nice business um and then i had this agency business that frankly like started just because it was like something that i saw you know as an arbitrage opportunity early in like 2021 and it ended up scaling into like you know order of magnitude probably like close to six figures a month um gross revenue business with super high margins and so i kind of just like kept doing it and kept walking into different areas with it and i don't know if you guys talked about this already but you had come to us or you were kind of talking in our group chat about like the fork in the road moment you had you were like we said before no name private equity guy uh making good money and you had started tweeting out stuff like pretty regularly i would say i don't know six months or a year before that um and you it was clear you had momentum it was clear you were good at that uh you were getting followers maybe had a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand followers maybe at that time i'm just rounding around and uh but it wasn't you didn't have all these other things like this clear like i have a fund i have a newsletter that makes money i have an agency that makes money so you didn't know exactly what was on the other side of that hill and you were debating what should i do should i you know the the fork and there are a lot of people have should i stay in my job that's a good cushy job or should i uh take this leap of faith into the unknown give us like the two minute story of like you know how did you think about that and how did you decide and was that the right way to think about it yeah i mean i um like a lot of people had the like coveted moment of what the am i doing with my life um and you know am i happy doing it like you know all of a sudden for the first time in my life after i guess it had been six years working in in private equity which at the time you know it was like 80 to 100 hour weeks right so you don't really have time to look up you don't think about because you're just working and you're you know you're making more and more money and so you're like patting yourself on the back things are good you're you know you're indian sean like indian mother thinks it sounds impressive you know things are good she probably wants you to go get an md but it sounds pretty good uh is that what your mother wanted you to do sean uh my mom yeah she was yeah yeah that all those things she she definitely was like don't leave a good paying job that was just like a general rule or general rule of thumb i mean my mom to this day still asks me why i didn't go to medical school or why i didn't get a phd in all seriousness like the indian mother thing is sort of a meme but it's also very real the like you know you should go work for mckenzie if you're going to work in uh in professional services that's the only place that is uh that's respectable um but yeah man i mean i was doing that covet hit all of a sudden i was like ah what am i doing with my life um had time on my hands to actually like think about other stuff for the first time in my professional life and so i started i mean the twitter thing i just like i started writing and i didn't ever think of it as a potential way to like go make money or get another job or do something else but as it started to grow and as it started to spiral you know we were in this like group chat together right and i started seeing friends from the tech world how they were leveraging uh you know platforms twitter etc to make money i was like huh i wonder whether there's a way that i can actually uh you know build like a little side hustle with this you know like whether it was courses or whether it was an agency business or like whatever it was i never really thought about the fund or investing side at the time um and then candidly like i had a conversation with you sean that i remember being really impactful where i was like at a real crossroads and i thought i was gonna i thought i was gonna kind of just like go join another type of investing firm and we were gonna move back to the east coast to be closer family i was gonna do that and i remember you saying to me like it sounds like you're just gonna go do the thing that kind of sounds like it sucks instead of doing the thing that you actually get a lot of energy from which is all this new stuff and that feels scalable and that you're you know you're fired up about so why are you making that decision and until someone just reframed it for me like that i had never thought about it i was just gonna like inside continue down the path that felt safe um and so it was like a stupid conversation frankly but had a pretty big impact you had described it you were like i'm thinking about path a or path b but the way you described it like path a sounded like like sounded super hard and not that much fun and path b sounded like a lot of fun with just like you know some unknowns but like definitely good was gonna come of it and i was like how is this even a decision like it sounds like you're saying i'm choosing between a bad option and a good option go with the good one funny story about path a so at the time that path a this is real was to join like a crossover hedge fund like a hedge fund that also does investments in private tech companies in my final interview my final interview i had to pitch a stock and the stock they gave me to pitch was stitch fix and i had to decide like i had a week and i had to decide whether it was a buy you know or a short like if it was a long or a short and i did like a week of research like made this long deck like did all this work i mean it was miserable did all this thing it was trading at the time at like 46 dollars and it had come off um you know it had gone up to like a hundred in the whole like archegos you know bill huang was like pumping up stocks by doing like buying the swaps pumped all the way up and then it came down to 46. and i pitched it as a buy uh got rejected because my pitch was shitty and now that stock is trading at three dollars and 56 cents so i would have taken path a and i would have gotten fired within six months for sure dude so something that's interesting is like i get and i know sean does too i get asked maybe five times a week if someone can like write tweets for me or like cut videos for me and all this stuff and it's pretty crazy i don't know if it only happens like what the popularity level is where you have to where you start getting those inbounds but i get it's so often that i get this and you like it's oh there's like this weird i get people asking me all the time they go are you in sahil or are you in this person are you in that person is sahil friends with this person because there's this like weird circle jerk of a twitter world and it feels feel as though that like you are connected to like many many many tens of millions of followers and reach and like there's this like weird behind the scenes thing going on with your agency it's the dark underground cabal that runs twitter now uh no i mean sean you actually remember this right didn't like some kid hit you up and say that he ghost wrote tweets for me and then you you just texted me and we're like does this dude ghost write for you and i was like no i've never heard of this kid in my life he was just lying and then i hit him up saying like yo why are you lying to this person and he completely panicked um but yeah man i mean the like the world of of ghostwriting tweets has now become again like it's become a meme because what was it like business insider wrote an article about vcs getting um getting ghostwriters to write tweets for them that wasn't at all how my agency thing started it started um in like late 2020 because i had started to figure out that threads were the way that people were growing on twitter and keep in mind like you know sean you were around the group chat at the time but that was like before threads had become the like thread boy meme that they are today and so there was like legitimate arbitrage in writing quality threads and i had all these startups that i had invested in the founders of which were like wow we see a ton of value in having a platform and a brand can you help us think through how to do this because you've done it like i had at that point gotten to 75 000 followers or so and so i was like yeah let me you know i basically like started an llc like an advisory business basically and i started giving like strategic support to these startups on how to think about content and then like how much would you charge them i was charging five grand a month um to a startup for basically like you know it was like texting and then maybe like one call every other week and it was like so low because um it was so low on time from what they needed for me because it was mostly like the founders didn't want to actually spend a ton of time on it they just wanted to be able to like kind of understand it and then they would have people on their end that just like went off and did things what was the high level like one two three bullet points that you would tell these founders so that they could just be better at this it was basically like you need your two or three pillars of content that you're going to be able to talk about consistently that are like valuable for you as a startup or as a founder so if you're a founder i mean at the time it was like if you're a founder talk about you know building companies and things you're learning along the way which now is like ultra saturated on twitter right there's like a million people that aren't necessarily credible writing about that at the time there weren't that many founders doing it like i don't know if you guys have seen the like copy ai founder i forget his name paul um you might be an investor sean you know that business uh sam is not me okay yeah and he was like the first one sort of that was like really building in public quote unquote and like sharing about their journey and the things they were learning so i was basically telling founders you have to establish like what are your two or three pillars that you're going to be writing about maybe it's you know building in public maybe it's the industry you're in um you know maybe it's like sharing l's along the way and like vulnerability because people find that endearing it's like uh it's called the pratfall effect have you ever heard of that it's like uh when when people who you perceive to be perfect show like chinks in their armor we find it as humans very endearing and we it actually makes us like them more and so you're like you know playing on that you're like sharing your l's along the way um but i was basically telling them you know versions of that on a regular basis and like helping you know kind of craft and advise them on the content they were putting out and it was like five grand a month probably had like five or so clients i think they were all like startups i either like the founders i knew or i had invested in the companies and so i was kind of around and it was you know beneficial to me to like see them continue to grow and do that like invest in the companies and they give you that money right back i like that yeah it was a good way to hedge them i mean this was personal investments at the time so this was like you know i might invest like 25k in a company if i was making that back in five months that was a pretty good uh cash on cash return on the original investment but then like you know like after um you know the ghostwriting thing was interesting because basically like early mid 2021 i had a few of those clients come and say like uh you know the biggest struggle for us is that we don't have people that can write this content like we don't want to build out a content team when we're focused on product and engineering and all that stuff like do you have people that can write and right at that time i had done the course with julian shapiro our friend um we did a maven course on like how to build your audience and it was mainly how to build your audience on twitter and so half that course was about like how to write good threads and how to write for twitter and so i had this pool of like 400 students who had gone through the course learned the principles of it knew how to do it that then i was just able to sort of be a connector between like freelance you know writing talent to then support these startups and you know the the kind of fundamental of any agency business for anyone that's starting one is effectively that you're like creating price arbitrage where you're like charging a client 10 grand for some or 5 grand for something that maybe costs you two and like you know the reality for most these people is you can pay a thousand to twenty five hundred bucks a month maybe depending on the output and you can easily charge you know a startup or a brand five for that or you can charge like a you know a founder or an entrepreneur who's doing really well and just made a bunch of money five for just like the fact that you're the connector between the two points so that was when it like i would say like really started to scale but it was never for vcs for me like i've never i mean i've never had a client that was a vc it's it's all been founders and it's all been like like half tech founders and half just like nuts and bolts like meat and potato type founders like sam's guys wait am i a meat and potato guy or a nut in a bowl no you're a meat and potato guy sean's my tech guy you're my meat and potatoes guy you know if something's like cool or interesting then it's kind of more of my thing and if something's like really boring and like you know generally correlated with like obesity it's your thing right so i want to ask you a bunch about like kind of your your big vision because you're going to be president someday i don't know if people know this is a future president sitting with us but before we do that people always tell us they're like yo you got to do ideas with the guests meaning they want to hear okay you're sahil you see a bunch of different things you see a bunch of different worlds what opportunities do you see that you think some somebody should be doing or a cool startup idea cool business idea niche opportunity something maybe you're not doing or whatever do you have any kind of ideas on your cheat sheet yeah i've got three for you guys okay uh let's go through them so so first on the agency side just because i think there are two really obvious ones that like honestly anyone that's listening could probably go action on this if they wanted one is um like linkedin growth agency stuff um massive opportunity here i mean like you you guys know a couple of our friends me and a couple of friends are starting like a spin-off agency that's just going to focus on linkedin because it's a massive arbitrage opportunity right now in audience growth twitter has become a lot more saturated because of the like thread boy thing and how many people are going and doing it linkedin like i mean you can go post a few things and immediately be like getting to 10k plus and for founders and like business builders there's so much business on those platforms it's huge for recruiting so basically if you were to go start this the way i would do it i would go like go to someone who has a twitter presence and you can go create like tweet pick uh pik is the like web service that i use for it and you can basically just turn tweets that are like proven with social proof into these like carousels on linkedin that are the big growth hack on linkedin and if you go do that for them and just say like look i'll take over your entire linkedin presence you never have to open linkedin because people hate opening linkedin and you just go and create carousels for them off of proven tweets and then go post it for them like two three times a week off their tweets yeah off their tweets um off their tweets or off of like other writing that exists that they've put out like say they've written blogs like i don't know i mean if you went and found uh you know say it's like ryan holiday and he's written a ton of blogs that are all over the place but doesn't have a massive linkedin presence you can go like turn his blogs into just shorter form writing that you put into posts on linkedin and say hey i'll post for you three times a week you never have to log in don't even worry about it and we'll grow you to like 50k by the end of this year either pay as like you know charge as like a success fee like if you get to this level you pay me this or you just say like pay me five grand a month and i'll do this for you two and a half grand a month and i'll do this for you and the amount of time it would take you is literally like i mean you could probably do like an hour a week to cover a single person to like you know call it four hours a month and make five grand it's like an awesome awesome arbitrage opportunity so that's one like any thoughts on that sam i think i think it's awesome yeah i've been doing a similar thing so i hired this guy as a content remixer for me and um basically it was take content from the pod or or twitter and uh remix it into content on other platforms and i focused on link i focused him on linkedin because i thought thought the thing you just said i had kind of a hypothesis that that's true and uh i'm now at 38 000 followers on linkedin and i haven't opened linkedin once so if you see something on linkedin it's not me writing it it's me i mean the same thing happened to me but it's not me writing that but hold on sean so you got 38 000 let's say that you post a by the way this is like in two months or something like that let's say you post a product that cost or your power writing thing let's say it's a thousand dollars and you sell a thousand dollar thing to your 38 000 followers how much revenue will you make from that i don't know i haven't tested it uh sahil you might know better but i also haven't been doing it for long enough i wouldn't expect to be able to get value because i don't think i've given enough yet like with twitter same thing you know like people see oh man you guys just you can sell a course you can just like say you're doing this new thing you get a bunch of signups it's like yeah but but doing this podcast for three years do you know 300 episodes you know the hundreds of hours of content that somebody's listened to so yeah they trust you and they know they've come to a decision whether you're smart and interesting or whether you're full of and they've do they they've done they've made that that they've done all that work and i've done all that work beforehand so then when you make an offer it's just a simple yes or no um it doesn't fit their life does it does they think it'll drive value they already trust that you could do it on linkedin i wouldn't bet that that would happen yet because it's just been so uh recent yeah i think you have to get i mean there's like a there's like a low there's a bar that i think you have to get over from a follower account standpoint if you use that as a proxy before you can like conceivably harvest value you got to like you know plant enough seeds over a period of time to sean's point i think like 100k is probably the point at which you can start harvesting value from linkedin justin welsh is this guy that you might have seen on twitter or linkedin he was like kind of like godfather linkedin influencer and i think that dude now is making like 100k plus on not even cohort based courses just like auto courses that he generally just promotes through linkedin he like he has a newsletter now that he's built through linkedin like built on the back of linkedin and now he's bigger on twitter because he's managed to like cross across all of those but he's doing over 100k a month in uh in sales revenue on his um on his courses which are just like you know they're just they're they're not cohort based so he's like putting in no no time now he's got them stood up this is interesting sean have you seen what sahil's been doing on instagram on instagram no so basically your boy's blowing up so listen to this so uh around the same time dad content no listen it was just hair it's just mostly hair and shirtless and uh abs thirst traps but uh around the same time so sahil and i uh both around the same time we're like all right let's take instagram seriously so i started doing it and i was beating him nicely adding a thousand people today i think i started with 5 000 people and i got to like 48 or 50 000 in a very short amount of time and he was doing his thing i was like you need to post twice a day i think and he starts doing that and then he just kind of like has rocketed past me now he's got to 62 000 followers in a very short amount of time adding one or two thousand people a day and he's doing this exact same thing where he's taking his tweets that do well and just posting them on his instagram and like so two points here one there's a world where this is just total vanity nonsense and a complete distraction from people who have like their main thing on the other hand what i'm curious about is how much revenue can this drive to people if their goal is not to be a famous person their goal is just to sell more of whatever their own they own already and so i'm curious sahil is of you if kids well this does this actually drive revenue for things other than yeah i mean right now right now it's generating about a so instagram this past month i think generated a thousand newsletter subs for me just through the link in my bio um and that's like you know on average i probably had 35 000 followers um during the month and it generated that many so conceivably as it continues to scale it'll drive you know well north of that as it uh as it moves and if you think a newsletter subscriber for me is worth you know just off of my sponsor revenue probably like three to four dollars per sub and then if you take into account my book that's going to come where it's like extremely valuable to me if they buy a book um i mean it's a bunch of money a month that's coming off this that scales over time right and that's just instagram and you think about linkedin that's another big driver um you know all these platforms so i'm like i mean there are ghostwriting agencies there are people selling products mostly on instagram without ever posting like their face these guys are literally like making carousels of images and stuff and they're doing 50 to 100k of revenue through it what's an example of that there's this guy uh dakota robertson like wrongs to write i think it says like twitter handle and maybe that's his instagram handle too um and he's got like i don't know 250 000 followers now on on instagram and like blew up real fast there just from posting his viral tweets over to over to instagram like almost never shows his face um and dude is has a thriving ghostwriting business through this gotcha i'm torn because on one hand uh you are like perfect execution of a strategy that i now hate and so i'm like respect to you but i'm like i don't even want to talk about this because i know what's going to happen is there's now going to be 9 000 new people who go this podcast is going to breed 9 000 new people that are going to go be like this is my thing i'm going to do this he said i can make you know x amount of money per month and their execution is going to be nowhere near yours um and in general this is like a it's like a pathway that definitely works but it's like um like the soul sucking the soul sucking it's like it's like getting it's closing and it provides well i think the window of opportunity is closing that's an important point yeah i do think like look i mean when i started writing the threads i mean sean you were the same way right like any thread you wrote would blow the hell up early on because there just weren't that many of them and so it was like it's like a market it wasn't saturated now it's pretty hard to get a thread to like really take off unless you're doing the like 10 youtube channels that will change your life for free yeah but that's his point which is the things that it's like getting fit through power walking is power walking gonna burn calories yeah yeah for sure are you probably not gonna get injuries yeah but like you have to look like a doofus doing it in the process everyone in the neighborhood is gonna know you as that weirdo power walking like you know what i mean and i i'm guilty of this too right like i did this strategy as well of being like oh i'm gonna create content for for you know for fun initially this podcast twitter that sort of thing and then oh okay if i kind of sell five percent of my soul or ten percent of my soul to the algorithm i think i can get this bigger okay i started doing that and then it's like oh i can make good money doing this and i you know make some money doing that and that feels fun but like i just want to say as a public service announcement there's some people who are going to go do this but let's say you're somebody who's awesome i'm just going to say this now this was awesome to do when it wasn't figured out now that it's figured out this is certified official small boy stuff and i do not recommend this to anybody else uh and i myself have stopped doing this too i haven't posted a thread and but if you are interested in this lame ass ass is the guy saw hill is perfect execute that's the difference though anything like i i've tweeted i'm sitting in this house because of it i i tweeted this it's a lovely house it's a lovely house i go i write no i mean look you do you have to figure out what the what the area is where you're going to do it that's not crazy saturated and cringe and and to your point like you got to figure out what percent cringe are you willing to be like if writing a thread is 10 cringe like what level above that just natural baseline are you going to figure that out are you talking me what no i'm willing to accept that um already like 10 of people just immediately see it and they're like oh this is super cringe and then you just have to decide like what level you're willing to go above that if 100 is like 10 chrome extensions that'll change your life and 50 is like uh you know here are like the ted talks that changed my life what's like 20 is it some of the stuff i post probably and like if that helps a few people out there and like a bunch of people get pissed and think that it's not for them i don't really give a shit personally like if i help one person and you know someone hits me up and says like hey that changed my perspective on x y or z that's what gary vee's been doing for decades man that guy's a legend of putting out content that's like listicles and like you know like motivational stuff tony robbins like grant cardone these guys like they get hate because it freaking works and it helps people right so i don't know the thing i would say like have you ever been to a tony robbins event yeah and uh i'm sure if you went to like you went to what like an unleash the power within or something yeah great uh i went to loved it thought it was amazing i don't know if you liked it you could give me a quick reaction but i have a different point yeah uh i love it i mean i love tony robbins stuff me too and he gets on stage and he's doing all the things that you could criticize somebody for he's he's clapping he's saying get up and jump he's saying what i say uh you know he's gonna ask a very basic question and the only answer is yes but the whole crowd says yes like a cult and you're like oh he's doing all the things but he's doing it at like an a plus plus plus level he is totally probably in my opinion the best public speaker i've ever seen uh and i've seen a lot next to like obama yeah yeah he he is he i think he's even more powerful than obama because obama is smooth but obama doesn't get people tony robbins to get you to walk across coals and like shout your greatest fear out loud i've never seen obama control a crowd for 12 straight hours like tony robbins will do at an event but here's what happens you look around in the crowd and you're like there's a whole spectrum of people at the one i was in it was like there were celebrities there you know the the guy from 300 what's named gerald butler he was there he was like right two rows down from me i was like wow this is interesting there's some interesting people here and then in the hallways i would meet a bunch of people that thought they were the next tony robbins and they were life coaches and motivational speakers and they were you know change consultants and every cringe name you could think of and then you go look at their stuff and it's the same concept but not executed at that level because they didn't have the hard one life experiences that that guy had to actually like create this content they didn't have 40 years of sharpening their craft and becoming the best they didn't have the natural talents and charisma and you know larger than life presence and so you can you can look at the best you can look at the gary v's and the tony robbins you can look at you on twitter and say that's dope you know i could do that and some people a very small amount of people can do that but for most people they will fall into the pit of cringe because they're not going to execute it at that same level they didn't have those hard-won lessons of actually knowing what they're talking about and uh and they're going to end up in this like weird middle ground and uh i think that's the scary part i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better i mean that's kind of like um that's like any market though right like you know someone starts a company and it's the a plus version of some like a restaurant chain someone starts a restaurant chain that's like the a plus of that thing and then a bunch of people come in to try to mimic it and it's like the b plus version and you know like whatever like say in and out is the a plus burger version and then someone tries to come in and start the like five guys or whatever next i'm probably gonna get hate for saying in and out it's better than five guys but you know whatever like you kind of have the diluted versions and the question is like a do you care that you're the diluted version of tony robbins if you're making money doing it and taking care of your family because like i know a lot of people that are just like i don't give a like you know i grew my audience super cringe stuff and i'm making 25 grand a month i was making five doing my prior job or 10 doing my prior job i'm making this sitting at home and i could spend time with my kids what do i give a if a bunch of tech people think that i'm cringe like i'm making money it is what it is and so i kind of i appreciate that too the other thing i would say is like what game are you playing like what is the long-term game you're playing and for me i was always thinking about like what is the thing i'm trying to build long term like i wasn't trying to be you know a twitter thread like a thread guy like that's not my long-term vision of what it was it vaulted me from being a nobody private equity guy as you said to like i signed a book deal last month like a big book deal last month you know like i raised a fund i never would have been able to raise a fund as like this nobody vp in private equity and so to me it's like what are you actually parlaying that into as you continue to go if you're able to find the thing that you think you're a plus at even if it's for a short period of time like how are you using that to vault yourself into that next level where you're like i'm not even in the same class as these other guys that are doing the thing i was doing previously because i moved into whatever that next you know that like upper echelon is dude are you worried about uh elon screwing it up for you not really you know it's funny well did you see what he really quick he he like said something and then steph my old co-worker said like does this mean that like the thread boys are going to go away and actually forget his reply what did he say but it sounded like he was saying i think he did like a crying emoji i mean yeah like i think it was something about he said um you know you could basically like put a long form text onto a tweet so you don't have to like people were used to take a screenshot of like their notes app on their phone to post a long form thing i think all that stuff is good i mean like look i've already benefited from being early to a market like i grew to a big level i built a brand that now extended into things that i own like the newsletter you know that's gotten quite large and is growing faster like the fund or like the book whatever it is um i would be more worried if i was like just starting out in any one of these things and like had dedicated all this time you know if you've rewound me a year and i was like just starting to get all these things going i'd probably be a little more worried um but the reality is it's like eat or be eaten man if you're if you're not like figuring out the new way to to uh you know be on the front of something and be building in these other areas um you're in for a tough time no matter what let's talk about this newsletter thing um so this is the second idea um biggest issue i have with my newsletter is i want to write it like i love writing that's my number one thing that gives me a lot of energy i freaking hate thinking about and dealing with any of the like business or growth side of the newsletter the business side is very easy to outsource there's like i mean you know there's there's ad agencies now convertkit has an ad network where they'll manage the whole back end of your newsletter they'll bring in sponsors for it they'll send you the money it's like super super easy it's amazing nathan crushed it getting that thing out there but the like growth side of newsletters is completely untouched there's no one out there that i've been able to find that is like a full suite growth service for your newsletter and when i say growth suite i literally mean like i want someone thinking about my landing pages and optimizing that i want someone thinking about referral networks newsletter swaps i want someone thinking about paid ads you know seo for my website to drive subs how to optimize it across my different social channels literally just someone that's sitting around thinking about growth for the newsletter so that i can just focus on writing and i'd literally be willing to pay i mean my willingness to pay at the size of newsletter that i'm at now and given what newsletter subs are worth to me is very high like i would easily pay 10 grand a month to someone that could figure that out and do it in one place on top of whatever i would spend on paid ads etc do you think that that thing workweek is going to do that uh no dude i mean like uh i i don't know how much you guys know about work i don't know a whole ton about workweek but from what i can tell it's mostly the like back-end services of newsletters and there's another one called smooth ops that i think spun out from morning brew didn't workweek spun out of the hustle didn't it not spun out they uh they worked for the guy was there yes same thing with the morning brew um smooth ops like my understanding of all of those is that they're much more focused on like helping you monetize and um you know managing your like business that you can focus on writing i literally just want someone that just all they think about all day like a an absolute killer that just all they think about is growth i mean sean did you have someone i mean or was ben like that at milk road my guy was right sean no ben ben was the guy who woke up every day and just said how do we get more subscribers and like you know that's that was his mission and that's what he did so uh you know that's the but you know we needed it's like if you don't have a that was like more of a company uh whereas like you know most people's personal things are not like you're at a size where there's just not that many newsletters that are at your size um that can afford to pay for something like that um you know how many people how many people could afford to pay 10k per month to try to drive growth so i think a lot so my hypothesis is so i tweeted this and a bunch of people were like replying saying they would pay for it in different ways my hypothesis is that there's a ton of like successful founders and entrepreneurs that want to build a newsletter an owned list or like an essay type thing like what sam altman or paul graham have where they have you know seo and newsletter you know like emails that are coming to them and they're willing to pay a lot because they actually have been successful and just have a bunch of money they don't need it to be revenue generating out at the outset um and i think you i mean i bet if you developed some sort of core competency and basically like partner say someone partnered with me and proved it out over like two three months hey i drove this and then were able to use me as a case study maybe i own a percentage of it you know on the upside and so i'm incented to like bring them new referrals i bet you could grow a pretty big business there quickly yeah you only need like 20 clients basically to make this like you know worth your while yeah i mean if it's a personal business you don't even need 20 clients i mean you can get 10 at five a month or 10 at 10 a month and you have like you know it's 80 80 plus margin probably business if you're just running it simple but are you having the headache of having a service business yeah i mean yeah it's definitely not productized like i've thought about starting an agency like maybe 20 times of my life and then literally five minutes later every single time i'm like don't go in the service business don't go in the service business now i did we have several friends that have done it right like you know andrew wilkinson did it with metalab our buddy greg is doing a great job with it with late checkout you're doing it now with your thing so you know maybe i have the wrong bias here what do you think i mean what you have to do is hire a great operator if you want to be the like owner of some percentage of it and not have the headaches you got to just recruit a killer operator who's going to run all of it i mean that's what we're doing with the spin out agency that we're doing now around linkedin stuff is like just going to hire someone exceptional and give them like 15 of the ups and just say like you're a hustler you're a killer you can get a whole ton of what man that's my finance team man really oh that's the that's the uh that's the no-name pe guy coming out of me right there um i thought a earlier guy was a guy who likes to lead a dodgeball and recess like that's what pe is to me earlier he was talking about beta and i was like you're talking about nerds i don't understand what what the hell is beta it is a good thing yeah hold on you're talking about beta as like a good thing i was like i don't understand what that means you're kind of a low beta guy actually sam if i think about it like you kind of you're kind of like even keel like i feel like i know within a band what i'm going to get out of you any any given day i i i think you're complimenting me but i don't know yeah i i you know you like you show up you tweeted about that recently you hate when people say they're going to do something and then not do it like you so you take pride in being low beta like people know what they can expect from you on a given day by the way what a what a stupid thing to tweet yeah like i like long walks on the beach and movies like who who likes somebody who says they're going to do something and doesn't do it what an obvious tweet yeah first of all give me the clout that i deserve like don't hate what did what did saha say don't hate number two i'm not saying it's like people who say they're afraid of heights it's like yeah everyone's afraid of heights but like you just like some people that just like i you know it's like what's high on your list i don't think that uh i don't know like like there's a lot of things that annoy you sean that that don't annoy me and vice versa like what's what's one thing that annoys you sean that you don't think annoys sam i don't think anything annoys him nothing annoys me that's the beauty of it wait really you don't think anything bothers you no i think yeah now i want to dig into what bothers you i uh i guess what what bothers me is only usually things with myself so like if i find myself in a bad mood or like getting annoyed with something or getting bothered by something or getting impatient with something that's actually the thing that bothers me i'm like oh man i let this get to me like for like that second that's the thing that gets to me right so usually it's not something that frustrates me or annoys me it's usually either impatience or boredom or um feeling cranky or tired or something like that you know like and i'm like oh no i i don't want to be that way that that bothers me so for years i used to say that sean i was like i was like i think i'm gonna have a pretty steady path to wealth creation and sean you either gonna like it's not gonna be as extreme i think we joked around with mr beast where like you know six out of ten times if you were reborn you would be a degenerate like gambler or drug addict and like four out four out of ten times you'd be successful with sean it's not that bad but it's like you know you're gonna you're you're the type of guy who can roll the dice and like you might actually hit it big there's a good chance or you might like just be only okay for a long time and now uh so i was basically saying yeah your likelihood i think of being a billionaire is actually higher than mine um but your likelihood of being like a degenerate is probably also higher yeah high beta yeah but here's the problem with sean i've just realized over the past handful of months he is too emotionally healthy to probably be incredibly successful he has this problem that few people have which is he's just happy you know what i mean he's got this it's just this is it depends on your definition of success man i would argue that sean is the most successful then man if he's like super happy yeah if you define sex by success by these superficial things like happiness and well-being and all that stupid stuff yeah i do i will say that sean has had more like high highs and low lows this year at least for my like perceived view of but he's not upset by it and like and he's totally unfazed like sean i mean flashback to like you know like crypto crash right i'm like yo sean's down bad i'm texting sam i'm like is sean okay like sean's texting the group chat totally fine i'm like yo is sean broke like is sean getting margin called right now like i have no idea what's going on and then sean's like yo i sold all my stock and i was like holy sean sold the bottom sean sold the bottom like markets roaring in june and then the market crashes again and sean's a genius trader that like sold the top of the market or something this dude is just like does that stuff bother you at all sean like first of all what uh prior to selling a business recently but what uh was your network down just a significant amount yeah probably i mean it's hard to calculate that sort of thing so but let's say liquid of the liquid stuff so not counting equity in companies uh you know it's probably down 50 or something like that i mean i most of the investments i i i didn't keep much cash this is my investment strategy pre 2022 right so my best strategy pre-22 was cash is trash and you know fist bumps all around to my boys who thought the cash was trash then um oh dude is there a safer investment than amazon this blue chipper right like yeah that's my version of of safety is yeah i'm gonna put it in some boring tech companies you know the amazons google's facebook's of the world what could go wrong and um and then lastly you know then you know a huge amount of startups that were uh that were you know getting marked up like crazy fist bumps all around getting my ups my ups was going ups and then the last thing was crypto and i was like oh well see your boy's a genius and moved a huge percentage of his net net worth into you know bitcoin and ethereum and um oh and then this luna that's popping i'm doing great so you know that's that was me before so basically every single thing i had invested in has gone you know what's my you know what's that thing like my terrible horrible no good very bad day like i was basically having that for this year in terms of investments but you know whatever did it bother you well i didn't like losing money but like you know did i let it bother me no like you know i basically lose sleep no i took steps i was like okay well what matters here like okay let me just first get perspective uh you know am i in any kind of hardship is my family doing poor no they're good they're fine right secondly what should i actually do do i need to make some adjustments was i wrong about certain things or should i do some things to give myself more comfort so why did i sell i sold i basically margin called myself i was like you know what i think things are gonna go lower and i don't want to sweat this all the time so i'm gonna sell this amount here so that i don't have to worry about anything i'm gonna move more into cash and i'm gonna book this loss because i think that'll that'll offset against some gains that i have this year and um you know then i won't have to think about this stuff for a little while i will focus on these other things that i want to be focusing on because i'm not a trader i'm not a like investment genius so that's not going to be my goal and then um yeah it'll just i don't know i i never got my happiness from when it was going up so why would i get my sadness for when it's going down it didn't make sense to me you must have felt good when luna like i think you you originally plugged luna in milk road at like 40 and i like i bought some i was like you know sean's pretty smart he knows this crypto shit hands down and so i like i bought a bag like i you know i'm not like i'm not really a degenerate crypto guy but i like bought a bag of luna and that went up to like 118 and i was like yo sean is my god like uh sean what other what other ideas do you have and then i we were supposed to interview on our old pod we were supposed to interview doquan like i'd hit him up on twitter he's supposed to come on the pod on like a thursday and on that sunday like luna had been wavering like it had come down to like 80 or something and i get an email from his assistant that just says uh unfortunately uh doe will have to reschedule the interview for this thursday and i'm sitting in bed and i'm like i got a little bit of the heebie-jeebies like i don't know what this is so i go downstairs and i sell my entire bag at like i don't know a small gain like not not good i sell the whole thing next morning i wake up and that's at like five like the whole the whole thing unraveled overnight and then i get an email from his assistant saying like he's gonna have to cancel the interview and i'm like yeah well this dude has a red notice out for him no he's not coming on our podcast at this point yeah that was that was a bad day i was on vacation i was in hawaii with my family and i'm watching my and i'm like i don't even have i'm not even at my computer like i can't even get to my crypto like it's not like on my laptop or whatever so i'm like well couldn't couldn't make a move if i wanted to uh so i guess i'll just like you know lose all this money here and uh you know just enjoy this vacation there's nothing else i could do at this point you were remarkably cool about it i remember texting with you that day the um the framework you've talked about in the past that i love around this stuff is your um local versus tourist thing i think that's so good of like you know uh tourists like freak out when the seasons change and just bounce yeah and locals are aware that there are seasons and that you know it comes in swings and they're aware of the environment so they can stick it out and be fine through it i've always just thought there's a third one which is the like stubborn local like the dude that lives in the coastal village and is like oh global warming's not real and then he's underwater and like drowning and he's like global warming's not real as he drowns and so i'm always just like how do you make sure that you don't go from being the like the local and you're proud of being a local to the stubborn local that just sits there until you die yeah that's the hardest thing and i remember with startups this was always the question because you'll hear a story like pinterest had no traction for over a year and then finally started to work because he walked into an apple store and like started putting pinterest as a default home page on these you know he hustled he was determined and it's like oh okay got it so determination just keep going even when all the data is telling you that this ain't working and then there's like the exact other advice which is like yo you got to be super data driven feedback oriented you got to listen to the market all that matters is are you making something people want and if you have no users you got to like you know make adjustments you got to pivot and so the hardest question as a founder is to know am i being the right kind of stubborn right so am i being stubborn because i'm right and i need to you know just tweak just make small adjustments and just stay at it be determined and be persistent or am i banging my head against the wall and i need to listen to the to the signals and i need to be changing my mind and nobody can give the generic advice about when to do what it's super it's like super context dependent super circumstance dependent same thing with investing right like you know am i should i should i should i still believe in something even you know do i believe in facebook stock now that it's getting crushed right and for me i went and bought more recently because i was like uh you know what do i believe about this company and has that changed so the tourist first local right is you got to ask yourself like does the thing i believed about this has that changed do i have new information that makes me update my thinking here um do i am i you know am i holding on to this position just so that i don't feel like i'm wrong right like you know am i am i willing to upset except being wrong you gotta ask yourself all these questions and be able to be honest with yourself and has that changed uh with crypto has what sorry has your opinion of crypto changed and your conviction um no my my opinions and my conviction has stayed the same but that's about crypto as a whole right then on each specific maybe project or coin you might have like a slightly different opinion you know it definitely well what's what's one thing that you think is now that you didn't think was a year and a half ago so i'll give you an example where that's not true then i'll give you example where that's true so the not true one is like let's take luna for example the the bet on luna was always knowing that there's this the way it was architected was this thing is going to rocket up because the sort of the what they call the ponzanomics right like the game theory incentive uh yeah but people don't understand like basically it's just like economic a series of economic extent incentives and so the incentives were were aligned such that this thing should go up during the during you know when as certain participants behave a certain way and from the beginning there was always these blog posts out there about what does the death cycle look like so what if this reversed course would this not because luna's the collateral would it not cause it to you know collapse really fast and the question was like will that happen won't that happen so even when you invest in at the beginning we wrote our little investment memo to ourselves about like here's our one pager why we think this is a good idea and why we think this could go horribly wrong when it crashed it wasn't like something we never had never thought of it was oh yeah that downside scenario we talked about that's exactly what happened right like basically there was a giant you know cell pressure that that car caused that cascading down cycle yep that we always thought that could happen we had hoped it wouldn't happen we had thought that maybe there was a you know there would be a way to to put buy pressure back against it but nope it wasn't going to work and so this is very fast example of basically just because it turned out bad doesn't mean that the um doesn't mean i changed my position because actually at the beginning we said well here's why i'm not putting my entire net worth into this right i put 250k into it that's not like a a massive bet for me uh it's a solid size bet right so it's like you know i put an appropriately sized bet because i thought it had upside and i thought there was some some key risks with it the thing that i would say i've changed my opinion most on is i thought man if people start to worry about inflation and they look at man you know i have the same 100k in my bank but it just doesn't buy me the same amount it used to right they'll realize like people will become more aware that the money they have is diminishing the cash they have the us dollars they have is diminishing in value that they will probably look to go to a monetary system that doesn't have that problem and so the idea that bitcoin will do well if people start to if if inflation becomes something that people are more and more worried about with the us dollar and that hasn't happened inflation got as bad as it's ever been but people's response was more conservative than aggressive people did not make a change to the bitcoin monetary system which would not have that problem um they sort of you know sort of stuck with it and actually the us dollars gained strength because other currencies got crushed even worse and so the dollars gained strength so that was one that i had thought that this was this is what would happen and it makes me reassess was my logic incorrect or um or something else you know what what did i get wrong about this idea that in a high inflation environment bitcoin should be something that people start moving more into i mean the bitcoin one is actually pretty interesting sean because i thought about that a lot too of is there is there something just like in the segmentation of how the price went up that is impacting that because i still think basically my assumption of why that didn't happen like why that you know scenario of high inflation and people flood into this is that most of the price increase was actually just driven by this like number go up you know crazy uh you know loose monetary policy people just pump into into speculative you know high risk assets and that it wasn't really driven by like believers like you who underlying were like oh there's really good fundamentals the technology really makes sense driving it up it was mostly just like my random friends who were like haha bitcoin number go up this is great and then they freaked out when it went the other direction and and pulled out you know interest rates rise and you pull out i wonder whether like if you segmented it somehow of like the true underlying technology believers my guess would be that the picture would look different like people that really are like thinking about the technology and thinking about the underlying um you know kind of like monetary policy that exists on the network my guess would be those people think that this is a great time to be accumulating and buying yeah i think you're right um i think you're right but basically it's just in my mind it was like a very simple picture it was like you're playing one game and the rules of this game are that the bank gives you some money it's my game of monopoly where the bank gives you some money but every year your money becomes worth a little bit less by design they're trying to make it two or three percent worse per year but sometimes i mean it's ten percent worse per year right or nine percent worse per year right that's the the game is is set up that way and hey oh yo there's this other new edition of monopoly that came out or that doesn't happen to your money my assumption was like oh people will just start to move to the new edition because they're not going to like when their money becomes less valuable over time uh but i i don't think that's the message that's gone across it was basically bitcoin's how you get rich or bitcoin's how you lose your money and that's the narrative that actually like played out uh because it was more it was more aggressive uh bitcoin will make you rich was an easier sell to people yeah and it was also the reason why they'll start to sell their bitcoin when they really when they feel like oh bitcoin's crashing by the way i've got one more non-agency business idea for you guys non-services but maybe it's slightly not that much services more product uh mobile uh podcast and video studio yeah man dude it's such a pain in the butt dude huge pain in the ass buy like a few vans kit them out with like a pretty fire setup just in the back of like a normal size van doesn't even have to be an rv for like two to three people could fit deck it out with like a few good dslr cameras that can do the recording like dual camera setup so you have like a few mics hanging off the sides and basically go and post it up in a couple of major cities like one van in each major city it has like dope backgrounds cool lighting like you know know whatever do the neon signs and shit in there and rent it out for like 500 bucks for two hours to do podcast recordings or like you know a couple hundred bucks to do like people going in and filming instagram shorts tick tocks like that like if you put one in la and you put one in new york city i bet you could kill it on a cash on cash return on one of those i just joined this gym called the collective in austin and it's like this like fancy whatever like and everyone there looks like an instagram model and they have uh like co-working there as well but they also have three studios for podcasts and picture taking like they just they just really don't know their audience and i went there and everyone looks like they're the type of person who is like if you follow a shirtless rip guy on uh instagram and they live in austin they're probably a member here and i mean if you catch them on bad lighting they don't even look that good but like somehow in that lighting you'd look unreal i i i think you're making fun of me uh i don't know the lighting makes a huge difference with uh with these like instagram models right so like you just get good lighting on one of those things i bet you could kill it i do think these like mobile studio though you could crush it let me ask you i'm looking at these uh u-haul box trucks so how much do these cost to buy so it looks like you could buy a used one of these for like 25 grand right so 25 grand and let's say and you only have to put five down yeah you put five down you're probably going to need to put another five into the kit like to make the the thing work uh and you probably need a dude operating the thing but maybe maybe you could get rid of that probably not you probably have to have an operator on site so i think that's the that's the tricky part where you got to sell it as a as a membership basically it's got to be a gym membership uh so it's like you can use the studio you can just book it when it's free um but you got to be like a monthly member if you're you know if you're doing 500 a month or whatever and you have a a studio on demand that's a genius idea to do it as a membership actually because dude the thing that made me think of this is like in new york now there's these couple of studios where people are doing all like in-person podcasts like there's this like what the media is one of them yeah i go to the stream and they're like they're solid they're not great but they're having to pay new york city rent to like to do this and so i can't imagine the economics are that great if you got a truck and you just bought it you could go post this thing up in a parking lot and every two hours just move to a different parking lot and like you never have to pay rent you're paying the you know like carrying cost of the of the truck and you're paying the whatever five to ten grand it takes you to actually we're gonna get the truck we're gonna call it moodio the mobile studio moodio the moodio boys that's we might get a branding agency to work on the name but yeah wait let me ask you something about branding deafening silence as feedback on your name but it's not how let me ask you a question so sean and i are trying to get popular on youtube right now with this with this thing and one thing that's kind of the elephant in the room when everyone talks to you i mean i know sean talks about this constantly is that you are just ridiculously good looking do you think that this shtick of yours of having good hair and being good looking is is that image working for you and what aesthetic shtick should sean and i have first off calling it a shtick is pretty hilarious to me um you know this shtick you have it's like oh i'm so hot yeah yeah whatever you got in between your ears like that shtick like let's talk about it the platforms that are visual it obviously helps to like when people are scrolling through things for like people to stop and say oh the person is like attractive right like it just when you're scrolling through tick tock and you see attractive girls you're saying you're hot it helps oh so you agree was that a mean girls reference do you just drop a mean girls right dude i'm a millennial through and through the fact that i knew that it was a mean girls reference is just as telling um no look i mean for you guys uh you're both good looking dudes am i going to sell you short sam you've got like a little look with the like fake glasses i don't think those have a prescription on them so it's like a little bit of your look they're definitely fake dude and then sean sean's got the like you know my favorite line that sean ever had is uh you know if you're not going to be good looking be interesting looking and i tell that to like everyone that i give advice to but sean's not interesting looking right now he looks like sean's interesting looking man look at this beard he's got the salt dude he's wearing a dude hoodie like he looks like literally every single person who shops at like a generic grocery store in the suburbs what's wrong with that man that's a that's a vibe a little bit like in the tech world that's a little bit of a vibe but that's not interesting i don't know man i mean i think you guys can play up the whole like your shtick of these two guys that look completely different that are like somehow friends like you guys are like cat dog man you remember that show back in the day you know what we're going for we're going for like why are these guys famous that's what we need to do if we just get over the hump so accessible this these guys that there's nothing special about them but that's our thing though that there's nothing special i don't think you have to be that good looking on youtube by the way like you guys don't need to be like models on youtube um if you like look at the people that have crushed on youtube it's not like hot dudes and hot chicks on youtube necessarily not that you guys aren't hot i don't want you to come away i don't want sam to text me later being like hey man what you said that wasn't nice because i know i'm going to get that text later tonight from sam wait but you're wrong i don't i don't hot dudes do better on youtube i don't think they do better i don't think that's right but i'm not on youtube yet i'm going to get on youtube here soon and i'll let you know whether we think that's true so you're saying you think you're hot yeah you got this real burden you're carrying my friend well like alex from osi's got the thing where he wears like those stupid cut off jeans now and and he's just like yoked that nose nose strip and like the nose strip level of uh being being muscular that's perfect example of you don't have to be great looking you got to be interesting looking yeah dude he's peacocking hardcore and it's kind of just a look it's a look man and like each of you guys has a look and if you can just stick to a consistent look it's like chris sacco with his cowboy shirts like you need your thing yeah i've been actually i've been thinking about this for a long time i've been needing a uniform i tweeted this out ago i'm looking for a uniform i want to look the same every time i'm on this podcast so i need something that from here up like a robe is is gotta be yeah maybe a robe it's gotta be signature and um i'm in the market so i'm taking suggest i'm going to put a bounty on this actually i'm going to give a thousand dollar bounty to anybody who can help me develop my the the chest up look that's what i'm looking for i kind of want to see you do like traditional indian attire for it like it could be kind of fire if you're wearing like a dope like kurta or like you know some sort of like indian you know up top i think that'd be kind of fire sean puri it could be part of your whole like angle with the name and stuff that's true okay you're eligible for the bounty uh right now i might i might throw into it i also might match it just because i think it's going to be funny to see whatever your next thing is so i'll throw in a thousand i'll throw in a thousand on top of it before he's on the hook for a thousand yeah no i'm not i don't i don't give it to peer pressure you're breaking out give me the peer pressure this is the stupidest thing ever i'm not going to give someone a thousand dollars they can tell sean what t-shirt to wear like you have a signature look already so it's easier for you to say yeah what my muscles are kind of like no you've got like a little like the pretty boy thing going with the like non-prescription grandfather who's sweater not a grandfather type of thing yeah it's good yeah you are going to be like you're going to be a quintessential father you're going to have a lot of stern talks with your child i already know it's coming uh i don't know what to say to this thank you yeah yeah i want to hear this before you go what is the grand plan what is the grand vision for yourself so you went from no name pe guy that as we established to to legendary thread boy to uh now cnbc contributor book deal guy author i think you're going to be president is that i i joke about that a lot but i i genuinely believe you could become the president someday if you wanted to do you have a grand plan for yourself what's the vision i could see that being in the cards long term running for public office i don't know if president is a role that you necessarily want i think it's like probably one of the hardest and worst jobs in the world don't guys go in like obama went in looking young and then he you know leaves all gray like looking you know looking rough it's like the highest stress job in the world running for governor would be i don't know that could be pretty fun to be a governor of a of a state do you know anything about politics i've never known you to be i studied public policy i did uh i did my master's in public policy dude oh yeah so that was always like what i wanted to do i mean i took a class on basket weaving like that doesn't like what like you know what i mean you think the people that are serving in public office today know a lot about politics it's like what is it's sort of like the naval thing of like you don't read a business book to know business like there's no such thing as politics it's like you know are you a reasonable thinker do you have the ability to change your mind which right now politicians do not and can you inspire people do you would you get people to move on things which party would you be i don't even know i'm an independent man so i mean i've voted democrat i voted republican in prior elections so i actually i actually don't know what party i'm probably i'm hoping that a third party rises over the next 20 years before i actually go do this because i hate the direction that you know like polar politics has gone um you know it's just like the loudest minority on each side i could see you being a good politician because you pretty much never take a stand on anything kind of like what you just did you're like i i always call i'm like you're pc like the rock man you never say anything inappropriate like you you you you are like the rock you're like well yes but sahil he never takes a stand on anything he's always he hedges
