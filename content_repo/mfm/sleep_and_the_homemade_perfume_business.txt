so on trends we released this on tuesday two things were interesting that our guys found or steph and our guy so men and women found um which we only have two people so uh so your guy and gal found that two things uh i'm like thinking about all of it uh first everyone talks about meditation being like the most popular like being a huge trend right now um people searching for sleep is actually significantly more like like sleep products and not and this makes total sense because calm i'm a subscriber to calm sleep stories they're they're pushing sleep like crazy yeah sleep stories i think was the breakout product for the breakout feature for that's crazy and so i didn't realize this until they like pointed it out and i'm like oh yeah that does make sense sleep is way bigger than meditation and meditation is huge sleep is also um a lot of people search for it because um uh so for meditation you're trying to teach a new habit sleep everybody does also for sleep a lot of people have problems sleeping so they will actively search for and pay for solutions that will help them sleep i pay for a bunch of them i pay for uh what's your sleep an alexa app called uh nature sounds and they have like 26 sounds and i pay extra money to combine them so my the one i sleep to is winter railroad and so what does that does that sound like it's a train it's a train going through the mountains in winter what's the winter part what is the sound of winter you hear like wind okay i love it oh you shared something very personal there i love it winter railroad i go alexa play nature sounds or sometimes i'll do ship in winter because it sounds like an icebreaker and then alexa turn off in 20 minutes and this is also like one of these um you know hackathon projects where some developers like okay watch this just say two words and i go search the internet for sounds and i smash them together and it makes an audio thing yeah like this year at furcon's next hackathon they should build this like uh i don't even know what it could be like chickens in china street exactly what happens to sarah she doesn't like does she like the same sound down with it she's down with it um so do you take any sleep aids like like uh like a vitamin or supplement or cbd or something melatonin melatonin yeah does that work help or yeah it does um if i really can't sleep i'll take one of those uni did my computer die i think it died one of my um uni uni gel is that what it's called unisoft it's a it's basically like a mild dosage of uh nyquil without the medicine part oh that's good so okay so it's the way some people take nyquil just to sleep and so this is the just sleep part it's just i don't have a cough yeah it's just a light version you don't take that stuff uh i uh i heard this phrase today i could sleep in a ditch uh so i just when i would decide to go to sleep i instantly fall asleep and i do not wake up at night um ever and so i'm blessed you i am typically like that as well but not as bad um there's this guy that we should profile he um he uh he's a japanese billionaire or sorry uh chinese billionaire and he started uh uh uh so he's a he's a big shot now and he owns like half a bank and all this other shit and he got rich by creating a melatonin he just took melatonin and rebranded it and made it sexy and called it a sleep aid and whatever it got huge and then he launched the zynga of china um and he ended up buying like the building that they lived in just like zynga and or they worked in and it became this huge thing we'll have to do i'll have to bring him up because i love him because he's reckless and he's built a fortune and lost it all like three times right yeah you love that i love those guys um okay and then we also talked about uh do-it-yourself perfume uh so apparently that's a huge community is do-it-yourself perfume and there's not a ton of companies in the space so what's what's happening what are these people trying to do they they don't want to buy perfume they want to mix their own at home yeah so basically perfume is a huge business um paris hilton a lot of people forget about her she has sold roughly five billion dollars of her perfume cycling back to the porn conversation earlier okay paris hilton yes yes and let's say her stuff costs a hundred dollars which it doesn't it's typically 90 margin yeah incredible so huge fat margins and everyone now knows this um and so the idea here is that people are trying to make their own perfume at home and it's got there's a lot of sub uh subreddits around it a lot of communities who discuss different perfume like how to create your own perfume but there aren't too many companies that are making it easy to make your own perfume and formulas and things like that dude that makes a lot of sense um this is like one of those industries where when you hear about the winner later you're like oh okay it was set up for success so for example warby parker you know uh one of the reasons warby parker worked so well was that the existing eyewear eyeglass you know industry was all owned by this one conglomerate exotic that had price pricing power and was marking shit up like crazy so they didn't have to like invent something to lower the price they just had to not be greedy and be like okay yeah we can offer this at a fair price and still have margin and so um and so you own cologne i own cologne and um so what you're saying is basically cologne vastly marked up in the same way razors are super marked up and dollar shave club came in but instead of somebody just making a dollar shave club version of cologne they're giving you a diy kit and then there's like probably reddit communities of home brewers uh for perfume yeah it's actually pretty great and there's an infinite number of recipes and scents so you're gonna you're gonna try a bunch is if you took it a step further an interesting sense could be sold already yeah so you could create a marketplace where you could sell yours just even to your own friends and family you could create a kit for people to do this and make a better kit i'm sure there's one that exists another idea you know we were talking about kid stuff earlier um like my niece would love to mix her own perfume she would that would be like a great afternoon and my my sister would buy her you know this little kid friendly perfume making kit um it's like one of the arts and crafts things that she gets to do and she makes it then everyone who comes over she gets to show him show her show them their yeah i think you could do this for kids and it be a big deal here's another angle that we found in trends is soap do it yourself soap big thing people want to make their own soap and uh what was the third one uh um juice but we already know that's right juicing yeah okay um that was pretty great i like that i would have never known about that that's uh pretty fascinating to me in fact i'm going to tell my sister to start this business with the diy perfume for kids you
