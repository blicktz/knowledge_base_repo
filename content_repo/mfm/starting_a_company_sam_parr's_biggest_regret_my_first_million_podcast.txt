what's your biggest regret in the way you set up or organized or structured the company i wish i wouldn't have raised money and i would have just owned it all and why's that because i would be greedier and richer um you didn't end up needing that capital it's hard to say because it worked it worked um if i wanted to start fresh again i would have been able to do it i can start now what about advice a lot of people think oh this person's so successful right you raise money from a bunch of cool smart successful people either in media or not in media yeah so that was helpful was that truly like so did you get your sort of values worth on the advice component yes because i don't i'm not sure that that typically plays out that way but i think yeah it works okay so look our network is so fucking powerful me and you our network is so powerful i have i think 35 investors ranging from tim ferris the founders of nerd wallet which is who knows what that's worth billions of dollars um um the founder of the chive founders of bleacher report um who else um just look it up a lot of people and i text them i just write them i'll say you get a lot out of them and i'll tell you two things that you do that gets a lot first your investor updates which you send you used to send more frequently now i send quarterly but before i for monthly right 36 months i send up every single month every single month and the it was so well organized it was basically like um hey here's all the key metrics you don't beat around the bush it's like this is how much cash we got in the bank this is how much we made this month this is how much the email list grew this is how much our open rate was boom that's number one number two and how what was your second sort of so i would i the way that i set it up i was like oh numbers i go just here's the numbers there's no interpretation right all right let's get into it numbers boom okay then i go uh and then i do things that are going well things are not going well i need your help yeah yes or no yeah it was great and um you sent that to so you did the work to keep them engaged and stay top of mind do not under underestimate this if you're doing your business if there's people who are willing to help you out you got to find a way to stay top of mind um and and part of it is you you share frequent updates and there's a very good sign if you're an investor if you're one of your companies stop sending their updates for a bit uh that company is about to die or they're on their way to dying and they go into a shell and paul graham has this great post which is just like um as an investor when you see that you know it's time to go check in and as a founder ironically that's when you need the help the most yeah so don't go quiet when you need the help the most that's when you need to be talking and asking and uh maybe you actually won't die if you if you could keep that going what other mistakes have we made um so i always regretted the um i think that the the normal way that people give out equity is a little too founder greedy um so i wish i'd given more equity to my team um and so like you know basically i wish i just negotiated it better between what do i get what do the investors get and what does my team get i think it was imbalanced i think some of what the investors got the team should have got some of what i had the team should have got uh because really like the people who are there as person four five six really they're taking just as much risk as you are in a way like they were there when it wasn't obvious that this is going to work and so for the all-stars i wish i had given more and next time my next company i'll do just that i will make sure that core four core five people i'll make sure it's not like like typically in a company with the pool be so i don't know exactly what the pool will be but let's say let's go what's typical so typical company two co-founders you start 50 50 you're going to raise some money they might end up taking 25 to 30 percent of the company um depending on how it goes let's call it 25 and so you know as the founders you you've diluted down you're at i don't know my math's bad but let's say you're both at uh what is that 30 something 35 each now and um and so you you know that's where you're at and then your team the option pool they typically say is like 10 to 15 is your sort of option pool yeah so the first few employees might have like you know the key person might get like one to three percent and then everybody else is below that is below one percent essentially and i just think that's like a pretty hard skew so i would try to get multiple people in the sort of one uh one to four percent range uh i would try to have like my core my core team all be in the over one percent range for sure and whether that means i take the haircut or investors take the haircut that's what i would do if it's a tech company i think this is very different if you're not a high growth tech company would you start it in san francisco again though i'd start it wherever i live and so if i'm if i wanted to live here yeah i started here um if i wanted to live somewhere else i'd start it somewhere else now you can start it definitely anywhere so it's just about your preferences i if i was going to start again another thing that i would do is i would go and get a job somewhere and just make like when i started i hadn't i didn't i was always self-employed mostly um i wish i would have worked somewhere maybe for a little while before you did it or you mean as a do something as a side hustle before oh you just get the experience yeah i think it would have been nice and to save money that's interesting i wouldn't have thought you'd say that i think it would be helpful um to to understand how things i think if you did it for three months you'd be like okay i'm done it would have been i got it stack some money away yeah that's fair but hey it all worked out okay
