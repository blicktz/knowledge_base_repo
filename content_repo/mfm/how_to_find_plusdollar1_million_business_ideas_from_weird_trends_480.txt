this is an example of a business that is um what i call one chart businesses i'm full of catchy today one chart businesses so what's a one chart business there are times you can look at one chart and one chart alone can be your business all right we're live what's going on i haven't seen you in a week i know what's going on forever um nice jacket uh by the way that's fresh wearing white is i appreciate that why is just a it's a choice it's a summer move it's a choice it's a summer move you're going to ruben's party or what uh no i i don't think i'm i'm not on that was it last year that you were in the hamptons when rick rubin was having his party and you were like what's this and you didn't wasn't there some story like you hung out with all the limo drivers the uber drivers yeah parking lot instead of basically the b the beach that i went to was five doors down from his house it's a public beach and there's a parking lot there and my me and my family were just there hanging out we drove by we saw like you know henry henry kravis the founder of kkr you know like 50 billion dollar guy like pull up at his two billion dollar or two million dollar bugatti we park in the parking lot and i see all these huge escalates all black escalates and i see like these it's mostly like these you could tell their drivers they're in suits they're playing soccer and eating sandwiches and drinking soda and i walk over i'm like what the hell is this and they're like oh it's this guy named michael rubin he throws his party i go well who are you driving and they actually tell me who they're driving and i'm like i just seeing how as i am i i go like all right like what's the what's the shik on them like are they a good tipper what's their deal and they like spilled the beans on like what's like he's like oh this person's actually broke you know like he always haggles with us over 500 or yeah so i hung out in the parking lot in michael rubin's party most uh relatable blue collar thing to do is just to go and be like hey pass the sunflower seeds and just start kicking it with these guys in the parking lot i saw it was like a movie a little bit it was like they were just like playing soccer and drinking coke yeah by the way the way you described that was definitely like straight out of like a favela in brazil you're like yeah they were just uh drinking coca-cola and eating sandwiches while playing soccer in the park and the gravel that's really what they were doing i mean it was it was it was like but it was fun and you know it was all like these long island guys like hey what are you doing you know like that type of thing i saw a video of that party and i think the reaction when they post that video for most people is like oh my god like so cool i you know i hope one day i can attend this the white party at michael ribbons house i gotta say i saw that thing and i was like this would be my worst nightmare it'd be very uncomfortable right having to look cool just that alone is already i have halfway to hell having to look cool dressed up for a thing you're wearing a mic you're sean's wearing sean's wearing a mickey mouse t-shirt right now just fly yeah exactly uh by the way i bought this recently this is new this isn't like some old thing in the closet this is i bought this during my trip just now um so having to look cool and then going to a place with a bunch of people who are super famous and then having to like be in tell a story in conversations and like try to get into conversations and then be in those conversations i just want to go home i didn't i just i already want to go home and i wasn't even invited so michael rubin you could lose my invite is what i'm trying to say yeah it's like you'd rather play their their characters in madden than actually hang out with yeah i would just start cleaning i'd be like i'm just gonna make myself useful here because the the rest of socializing is not gonna work i'm just gonna i'm gonna marie kondo this right now and like start taking out trash and like i'll just join the serving the crew like serving appetizers because i'd be like i know i will have more fun doing anything besides this where do you want to go from here i was looking at a company called after after.com you ever heard of this after.com a very good uh domain so an amazing domain so after.com is cremation as a service basically and you could pre-plan it or you can do it after somebody passes away the the reason i actually want to talk about this it's an interesting business on its own this is an example of a business that is um what i call one chart businesses i'm full of catchy today one chart businesses so what's a one chart business there are times you can look at one chart and one chart alone can be your business plan so for example have you seen the rise in the popularity of cremation no popping off nowadays cremation is like uh it's the new tide pods uh it's in right now so i saw this chart i thought did not everyone get uh cremated so basically cremation um in the united states in like the last i don't know 20 years or something like that has gone from like 10 of the population chooses cremation to over 50 i think it's actually it's almost 60 or 70 now which is like kind of insane i had no idea this was true um uh so burial rates uh are going down and cremation rates are going way up um and you just see that one chart alone you're like okay in 20 years this the the thing has shifted where it went from the super minority to the majority all right that alone tells me there's room for building interesting business in this space it's a one chart business and there's actually been several of these that i've like encountered over the years like one chart uh one chart can tell you tell you a full story um and so this is this is one of them and uh these guys have built a really good business on top of this i don't want to go into too much detail about their actual thing but i just thought that was crazy and this is like where like what you guys had with trends was like kind of a cool business because you guys would identify trends like this you would say okay yeah in the 19 in the 1960s cremation was three percent and then in 1990s it grew to 17 and right now in 2020 it's over 50 percent um if that's true then what what are all the second order consequences of that who are the providers for this who does the b2b e-commerce of this who has the highest seo ranking for this and that website's actually getting way more popular than than they realize because um this is growing over time and so you take that one chart and you can actually run a whole business plan off wow so do they i'm a yes you're right and b i'm looking at after.com they i don't think they've raised money they're they're they're mormons they're based out of provost uh provo utah um uh this is this is wild how did you find this uh they reached out because i was i told people i was buying minority stakes in businesses and investing in businesses and i think these guys were raising money or wanted to i think they were raising money they're not trying to sell uh these they're i think they're trying to go big fundraise so um they reached out this definitely could be big it's 2500 their tam is everyone right on earth we're all getting there eventually dude but they don't own like uh uh an oven do they like they just like it's the logistics so basically what they do is they get the lead they then book the kind of like the they either take the prepayment if you're going to do it ahead of time or um afterwards they say okay we will be your provider they can do like kind of like the full logistics so basically you know like the domino's pizza tracker right pick up drop off delivery like they do the whole thing um you know and you can see kind of step by step where you're at in the process this is wild uh so to to your first point um our good buddy jack smith you know he started bungle sold it for 750 million dollars it was making a million dollars a day in revenue he told me i was like jack why'd you start bungle he was like well i just saw that uh mobile like like games on your phone were gonna be really popular i just saw like a chart i think he said from forrester research report he's like i just saw this chart that says like oh mobile games are like taking over the world and he was like what can we make on top of that uh like and that's why he came up with bungle which was ads in a game and so he built an ad network and it was the same thing where he's like oh that's a thing let's just get on that tidal wave and like just like it doesn't matter which surfboard we pick let's just pick a board and hopefully it will catch and and that was like the same famously jeff bezos says this is how he decided to quit his job in uh i think he worked at some private equity firm uh that's famous and he quit his high-paying job and was like i'm gonna go to start i'm gonna go start a uh internet company why internet company he goes i read a stat during my research for at the firm that the internet is growing uh 2300 per year and that blew my mind and if that's true then i'm gonna go build an internet company that line is a beautiful line so we actually use that quote on the front page of trends where he goes i started he goes uh he goes i saw a report that said the internet was growing by 2300 per year nothing grows that fast unless it's in a petri dish uh and he's like that's what i knew i had to start something and so i wrote a list of ideas of things that we could possibly sell on the internet and we just so happened to choose books yeah exactly they chose books because he was like oh i what is the advantage of the internet you could have infinite selection because there's there's no shelf space limit right there's no physical shelf so he's like what has wide selection okay what also won't go bad can't be perishable it has to be durable um and then what all what is easy to ship and so he's like you know those three and he's like there's market demand for it cool books books will be the place where we start um by the way i just found uh steph smith so former you know writer of trends had a great um tweet about this actually so i just pulled this up while you were talking while i was looking for the quote and she said uh famously jeff bezos had this stat that made him quit his job what are the generation defining stats of today here's number one here's what she had the cost of mapping a genome has fallen by a hundred thousand percent over the last 15 years so it went from like a hundred million dollars to less than a thousand dollars um so mapping genomes if that's true if the cost is dropping like like a rock what what what could be done off that the second um college tuition has outpaced how much people earn by 10x here's this one chart that uh that shows you know people's earnings over time and the cost of college over time it's like college going way up that's a one chart business right there cyber insurance loss ratios have increased for years despite exponentially growing rates your loss ratio is basically how many claims you have so cyber security is becoming an exponential issue the percentage of men under 30 not having sex has tripled in the last decade so before um men not having sex was like you know 15 now it's 30 of men are not having sex under the age of 30. before the age under the age of 30. so you just made it nice um so yeah um a couple other ones she had it here it used to be that eight hours of sleep was the norm on average now people get 6.8 um so the sleep industry and the like effects of of not sleeping are going to go going to go up um the electronic system in a car was five percent of car costs now it's 50 of car costs um it's not just self-driving cars there's cars there's cars are basically rolling computers dude those are brilliant yeah you like i've i've definitely have started stuff because i've seen things like that i remember sitting with one of the founders of calm this guy alex too and we were at lunch and he just burst out laughing out of nowhere and we were like what he goes i just realized that there must be like 10 million people a day dying on facebook yeah what he goes like facebook must have so much churn just due to death he's like they probably have millions of users churn because they died every day that's insane and he he just starts he starts laughing and you're like hey alex like you freaking autistic weirdo like he's just laughing so hard can you be normal can you imagine millions of people churning because they died every day from your product he's like he's like what do they do with those profiles how does that work he's like what what there's a team of people just like the morgue at facebook just cleaning up these dead profiles they should sign up for after more people died during lunch today than use our product you know like more people on facebook died than have ever used our product he's just laughing uncontrollably yeah you're like yeah that's hilarious alex that's that's so funny so this is my first time recording back in austin so basically most summers between like may and october i go to new york because i have family there and we like to stay there this time we only did it for like six weeks and i'm back and every time i come back i get this immense amount of stress because typically when i go i'll go for three months and i only bring a carry-on so i basically bring um a pair of crocs a pair of workout shoes and one nice dress shoes and then i bring like two workout shorts two workout shirts and i just clean them regularly crocs workout shorts a box of captain crunch and a switchblade yeah that's called summer ready with the yo-yo like those little little pager things on my belt yeah i got my yo mega my crocs and some bubble gum and i'm good okay so you so why do you say you're stressed out what do you mean you're stressed stressed about what because all right so i i bring nothing basically i bring very little stuff and i rent a furnished place and then i in my book bag i bring two lights for the podcast an extra cell phone that i hang up that's my camera and this microphone and i come back to my house and i realize i've got a closet full of stuff i've got two cars that i gotta go and like all right i gotta make sure that like the battery didn't die i have a motorcycle i gotta make sure the battery didn't die the tires are full i've got this cold plunge where i gotta go like make sure i filled it with water and i gotta clean it i just have like shit like there's just stuff there's stuff to like maintain and i saw a picture of our friend sahil and he had his baby uh roman a beautiful baby but in the back he had literally three barrels they were barrels they were not buckets they were barrels of toys and i see all this stuff that i have now and i'm stressed out about this stuff i've got to go ranch an hour and a half away i got to go check in on i have all this stuff and i'm freaking out about having kids about all this other stuff i'm gonna get sarah's making like a uh baby shower registry and i see all this stuff and it's so much stuff it's freaking me out man i don't want any of it and i'm wondering i don't think you freak out over this because i think you you probably have a lot of stuff i got all but i for one freaking about it have you you you don't live lightly at all bro living heavy might be the title of my autobiography i mean what are you talking about living lightly um yeah i indulge uh our kids have tons of crap that's what kids do they they bring a bunch of crap into your house i got a dog dog's got some crap i got some crap there's just stuff everywhere i literally have a ball pit and a tent and a fort and uh like you know i have so much stuff in every single room if you saw this room i'm in right now you would want to like pass out but i gotta say i'm not i'm no therapist but i kind of feel like what you're having is actually um like fatherhood fear and you're just redirecting it misguiding it and pretending that you're worried about the stuff i think this is some underlying life's about to change i'm about to become a parent i'm about to lose my freedom and i think it's expressing itself in some weird ways like when you get hives because you're worried about your math test well i get a little nervous and you might be right but also i get a little bit nervous just about all the stuff i have in general so i was talking to my buddy dennis and he's got he's a single guy he's got three cars and he's like i have all these cars and like i gotta go like run them to make sure like because i haven't driven this thing in a month i gotta go like drive it around i'm like dude it's like we all wanted this and then we all got it and now we realize we just have to go take care of it and like if i see someone with a ferrari i'm like man if you get a flat tire that's like a ten thousand dollar like repair to like get that to where you need to go where you got to repair and you got to fix it and everything right it just takes so much mental space and so what are you gonna do you're gonna give it all away you're just gonna cry about it what's the situation now the situation is you have to be a conscious consumer i think which is like my woo-woo phrase of the week but basically i have to be really really careful and so i'm going to the baby registry and i'm like if it doesn't like if it's not a book we we shouldn't ask for it and we should actually like basically say to people don't buy us anything but like i'm just i'm trying to say or if you want something and they sell it at target you have to walk there and get it otherwise because i don't want all these boxes around the house we got like it's isn't it crazy that we buy stuff it comes from amazon then we have to pay 1-800 got junk to come and we have given 300 to go throw away all the stuff you know what i mean like the boxes it's it's weird so i'm just gonna buy less stuff that's basically what i'm gonna do i think is that not the answer i think you're on the right side of history um although i think with kids is a different game like for example one of the reasons i got a lot of stuff it saying you're on the right side of history is such like a woo-woo way of saying i agree like it's like the right side of history is what like uh political people use you're on the right side of history you know why it works because you're talking about the most minor personal pet peeve so i gotta elevate it by saying you're on the right side of history making it feel a little more grand okay that's a little trick you don't i i think it's weird that you don't experience this i think a lot of people are experiencing this right now and they're and like when you go to some people's homes they have a basement full of stuff and i'm like dude a cluttered a cluttered room is a cluttered brain in my mind i threw away i hired a guy to come over cleared my calendar i hired a guy to come over and he just took so much crap out of our house uh like we just removed everything out of the garage he took a whole dining table chairs a rug that i didn't like just took loads of stuff away and it felt like you know the satisfaction when you like pop is it or something like that it felt like that yeah i popped my house is it it does feel great when you get rid of stuff and you lighten the load but what i would say is one of the reasons i had a lot of stuff i have a lot of stuff as a as a parent is because you end i don't know not everybody does this there's better parents than us but we bribe our kids a ton and it turns out that like the thing you want more than like a neat and tidy home and foot light footprint is like 13 minutes of relaxation and you know how you get 13 minutes of relaxation you stop at freaking dollar general or whatever and you buy some crap that your kid's gonna be excited about playing for like 30 minutes and like that's all you need and you if you have that all right it's worth it we'll get rid of that later and so having stuff that your kids can play with is how you get to be on the internet and if you don't want to be on the internet cool keep your minimal house and you can go and entertain your kids with your bare hands but if you don't want to do that you better buy the ball pit and the slide and the nugget and like all these little things so that they have stuff and the target you you've got the target grocery cart checkout because then i can say oh let's play grocery store you go shopping and buy everything and i'll be sitting over here on my laptop and then they do it and another nine minutes passes and i'm just nine minutes closer to freedom to the day that they're old enough to go to school and so you know this is uh it's a really it's it's a tool for survival is what i'm trying to say yeah and the last thing on this is the reason i love going to new york is when i go is because i say like san francisco in new york where i lived in san francisco for 10 years you're you're outside of san francisco now new york as well it's a land of ones and tens meaning everything about that place is either a one out of ten or it's a ten out of ten the beauty the energy the excitement ten out of ten the crime like seeing the homeless people do stuff like like like feeling like it's a third world country sometimes that's a one out of ten austin is a land of six and sevens everything's mostly pretty good mostly all the time it's never going to blow you away with inspiration but it's always going to be like oh this is nice i feel nice whereas you know you walk around the city of new york and like some of the time you're like this makes me feel alive you know like this is like i just like inject this shit my veins and then the other time through there you're like i need space i need quiet like i'm freaking out you know what i'm saying and so what i'm trying to figure out is what's a good life is it surrounding yourself with ones and tens or is it surrounding yourself is seven all the time and that's something that i that we're debating at the moment i mean this that's a big life question what do you think the answer is i don't know yet i don't have to make my decision yet but i was wondering if you've ever thought about that uh i'd never thought about it as as well as you just put it what i would say is that anytime uh i learned this thing a long time ago which is one choice is no choice right because if you have if you only have one choice that means you really actually have no choice yeah just inertia two bad choices just tells you you need a third choice and so i think what you're actually saying is you need a third choice um like you know the thing that worked for me was live in california but live in the burbs so you don't have the crime and stuff like that you do lose a little bit on the energy and the like kind of ambition around you but you can kind of hack around that a little bit um so you get kind of the weather the beauty the the sort of the the california sunshine all that good stuff um without the the the downtown san francisco crime and um you know recklessness lawlessness i think what i'm going to do and we could wrap up here i think what i'm going to do is i'm going to we're going to rent a place for one year in westport connecticut never in a million years did i ever thought i'd say i'd live in connecticut but i met this woman who i'm going to talk about dafina smith and she goes i like i met her through hampton and she was like i know what you're going through i i went through the same thing we found this place called westport connecticut 60 minutes outside of new york city it sounds crazy but come and visit me i went out there and i was like this is nice so i might do westport connecticut but i can't believe i might be a connecticut person but i think that's what we might do speaking of what you want me to talk about her yeah tell me the story uh i met this woman at a hampton dinner set next to her uh basically her name is dafina smith and her her store or her company is called covet in maine so you can check it out it's a covet like you want something so c-o-v-e-t and then maine like hair m-a-n-e are you on the website yeah there's just uh like you know i don't want to go rick rubin's party but this party that i'm looking at right here looks amazing this is just like beautiful women running through the like just holding hands and running through the sand which is just hilarious dude so check this out so she started out in real estate just doing normal stuff but her parents owned a beauty supply uh like store like a brick like a small store and so she starts helping them out and so she starts saying like oh let's create a website and we'll sell hair extensions online um so you i don't know if your wife uses hair extensions my wife does sometimes hair extensions basically it costs sometimes two or three thousand dollars for really fancy ones sometimes cheaper 500 to a thousand dollars and they basically like weave this they basically like sew extra hair into your hair and it makes it look really nice for a woman and she starts selling this online she's like this doesn't really work that well the way the way that i thought it was going to work so instead what she does is she invests around 100 to 150 000 into starting this business and what she does is she starts hollering at different um beauty stores and she creates like an invite system where she's like look we don't have that much inventory and we want to like onboard people effectively uh so you just apply and then if we can like make this happen we'll start sending you our product and our products is really high quality and then also we could start sending you some customers because we're going to do really good with the marketing we're going to send people who want our particular type of hair and hopefully when you go and get hair you'll tell your friends oh i got this brand of hair you can go to their website and see who deals their stuff well anyway she only has six employees in her first year of business they did four million dollars in revenue and they're in year four or five and they're doing tens of millions in revenue by year two she was already in the tens of millions uh year four she's doing many tens of millions they have like two or three agents agencies who work for her but only about six full-time people and if you go to their website they're killing it and i was like how what are you doing so well she's like man we host these like meetups where it'll be like tons of uh women who own these beauty supply companies so or like you know like literally a brick and mortar like beauty store and we do like these parties where we like teach them a little bit about how they run their business we'll have speakers who like have best practices and then also like if they happen to want to apply to sell our product we'll do that and that's like basically how they're getting most of their customers and it's a super fascinating company because a it's just a simple ish website i mean it's nothing like crazy fascinating her the uh the hair is of high quality which by the way do you know how they get hair from this no is it donations it's real hair it's usually no it's from it's from india so like there's i guess in certain parts of india it's like holy or something to shave your head or they go to china where you can pay people and they'll cut their hair and you buy their hair from them and so it's real hair and so it's like a process to get like a high quality hair extension but she built this company on on on on this on this idea of like going after these hair slots and it's super fascinating because a this is an industry that i knew nothing about and b i actually think things like this could be pretty huge because it costs two or three thousand dollars to get this done in some cases so i forgot i actually went down this rabbit hole a long time ago because a guy i did dinner with once uh you know when i used to host these mastermind dinners um worked at this company called maven did you ever hear about this company yeah they they raised too much money i think they raised like 30 million dollars from andreason horowitz and serena williams and jimmy ivine like you know every cool person you can imagine and um so they raised all this money and this guy taylor came to dinner and he was i think like the coo or something like that they're based in oakland and he was telling us about this he was like uh is you know basically one guy explaining to like five other guys who've never like done hair extensions about how crazy this business is and he's like yeah like you have these stylists the stylists are basically like you know these kind of like independent contractors people follow them from like salon to salon like wherever they're working they're trying to book them and then the stylist has to go and procure the actual hair and so they go to like these warehouses or these wholesalers to go buy the actual hair and then they get the hair from india and i remember going on a youtube rabbit hole of like how they get the hair from villages in like india or china or places like this because that's where the bulk of the hair gets imported from and how they get paid you know whatever dollars for for their hair and it's like kind of a controversial thing about like you know is this like is it exploitive there's like rumors of like people being forced to do it which is not great um and so there's all all kinds of stuff in the supply chain about ethically sourcing the hair and there's some great videos on youtube about this if you're curious i you know i recommend this is like a fun fun rabbit hole to go down um i don't know what happened with maven because i think they raised a lot of money and i haven't heard about them in a long time and um it looks like they raised 40 million more to go into walmart i mean it looks like so 76 million in total they've raised 76 million dollars a lot i don't know why and i no no offense to uh to taylor uh no offense to taylor i hope they hope they succeed but there's something about companies with this pattern of like um cool idea usually underrepresented founder going after a space that that you know white tech startups ignore then like raises mega round from celebrity investors and then you kind of don't hear about the fruit like maybe they raise too much money like too much money can break companies this happened with uh like that tristan walker's company like walker and yeah the walker brands they made like a razor for black men to shave their head i think uh yeah or their beard or whatever and i think that was a great idea um i was a great like model but when you raise that much money it puts so much growth pressure on the business it can sometimes break it and so i hope that this didn't break it but um i've just seen this happen several times now start to start to notice a little bit of a pattern yeah uh it says in a press release that they have they've done it says they did 120 million in revenue but they phrase it in a way where i think that means the company's lifespan they've done 120 million in revenue but yeah it's stupid i think your cap table is like one of the very few things in business that is an irreversible decision it's very challenging to make up for that mistake and so this is why this woman uh defina like when i met her i was like i started talking to her i'm like are you on social media she's like a little bit but i haven't decided if i actually want to go all in on it and i was like you're if you google this lady you'll see her name's dafina smith i'm like you you could be you know you could be like a huge deal if you wanted to like you what what did the kids say you got the riz she's got the riz she's like this like very charismatic very pretty tall like composed like when i see her talk i'm like oh man you're like a proper ceo like you got the it factor uh and she's like he's like i don't know if i actually want to be famous or i don't know if i actually want to go hard that way where i'm like well whenever you want to i think you'll kill it and so i saw when she started telling me her story i had no idea that this stuff could be this big and she told me some of the numbers behind it and i was like flabbergasted at this type of business uh yeah that's crazy um so so her model is this kind of like direct to stylist model there's a few other businesses that are like this have you heard of style seat yeah i like style seat uh my wife used it for a little while what exactly is it though there was a period of time where like or this happens a lot in business where there's a period of time where one idea like when an idea works it can work across like a couple of verticals not all verticals but a couple of verticals and if you figure it out it makes sense so there was a time when like uh mind body online was getting uh popular it's basically like this idea of sort of like directly booking online booking of yoga classes online booking of pilates classes and then the fact that there was like this rise of the instructor like the celebrity instructor this happens with peloton it happened with yoga happened with pilates there's like people started there people realize that you're not coming for the venue you're coming for the specific instructor and the same thing is true and by the way that that mind body company so mind body was software for yoga classes originally i think they went public i think it's like a wildly yeah it's like a billion dollar company um and with very like old school software like it wasn't like slick new fresh blah blah blah um but people started to realize that like same thing it was true for stylists like you don't go to the hair so some people go to the local you know like me my selection of where i'm getting my haircut is like what is the closest place to me in that moment that i have 30 minutes right like i'm going there yeah yeah which great clips is available at the moment who's got a big enough bowl to put on their head i just got a haircut in la i went to this fancy la place because i was this is the nearest place i went in and i sat down and then i'll go he started cutting my hair he's like oh what do you want blah blah i was like i don't know can you cut my hair like the standard dude cut um i don't even know what it's called and then he's like uh okay i think i know what you're talking about he starts and i go he fake i go i was like um i was like oh shoot uh because he was going so slow he was like cutting every individual hair with his scissors like make it awesome and i go actually um different instructions can you give me the best haircut you can in 15 minutes he's like what i was like yeah i only want to be here for like 15 minutes could you just do your best inside a 15 minute time slot and he was like i don't know if i should be offended or like this is exciting he was just like all right 15 minutes he's like can you put a timer on i go yeah i put a timer on and then this guy like cut the out of my hair for 15 minutes and i was like wherever you're at when you're done let's just call it he's like you can come back later he's like you can come back later today man and you know i'll finish and i was like it's hair it'll be it'll be it'll be back where it is it's all right he's like he's like i won't charge you i was like uh you couldn't pay me to come back you know i'm done i don't want to spend more time on my hair dude i go to these orthodox jewish guys in brooklyn nobody cares about my hair i go to these i go to these jewish guys in brooklyn and i love them because it's all about efficiency and then i'll end up just sitting down at the chair anyway just be like tell me about uzbekistan i want to hear some stories but like i want a place where they're just going to call me bub and there's going to be a a handwritten sign that's hopefully misspelled that says haircut 28 beard trim eight dollars like that's what i want like you you better have scotch tape in that drawer of yours like otherwise i'm out if you take credit of course i'm out yeah so um anyways i don't know how i got on that anyway style seat made it easy to book a stylist and i think they got valued at one point like in a nearly a billion dollars and melody the the woman who's been running it she's been doing this for like a decade now um i'm really curious to see how that one that would plays out she also raised a bunch of money and and kind of was going for it but this this hair salon barber thing is kind of big like i don't know if you've seen squire that's another billion dollar company in this space what's squire squire is the same thing for barbershops so it's basically like barbershop booking software um so you know it's a it's an app that lets you book you know book your barber mobile barbers were always like you know pick up the phone they're cutting someone's hair they pick up the cordless phone they're like yeah come on in uh what's your name and they're like can't even write it down because they're cutting someone's hair at the same time so squire just kind of like streamlined that process and i think they might do payments as well um so like people providing software to these brick and mortar um like small businesses is really it's a really really hard niche but when you if you can do it if you can get the product product market fit the scale is really big because there is a lot of these small fragments like it's a giant fragmented market and there's so many of them that if you can actually figure out a product that works in a sales model that works which is the two hard things um these things can be a lot bigger than they sound because it sounds like oh software for hairstylists who cares um well it turns out it's actually there's a lot of them yeah and i would never want to work in that industry because i think it's it does seem impossibly hard but uh if you're into it it can work our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better let me give you a blue collar side hustle so uh we haven't had one of these blue collar side hustles in a while so uh we're bringing it back but you like you like took one flight and you were around blue collar people and you got inspired i left my house and i you know i was around somebody who listens to the podcast so uh shout out to brisha she uh owns this amazing restaurant in la i don't know if you know this so she listens to the pod and she's like every time you guys shout out you're like four female listeners i'm like yeah that's me like you know i feel so good and then dude a lot of women are offended by that i don't say that anymore i still say it because i say it with with endearment um you know lead i lead into the joke um the problem is the joke's not that funny so you know it may not be the right thing to lean into but but i'm committed um so anyways i go to her she has this restaurant in la how'd you meet her she had taken my power writing course and um she had volunteered to like i do this thing where i'm like okay show me your website and we do like a live teardown of it and so we had done one of her website uh because she sells these like mitzalata like drink things um like this kind of like mobile or this or this little like uh she has like a restaurant but then she has like this e-commerce side of her business too so anyways okay i had done a teardown of it didn't pay much attention to it after the fact but ben um business partner ben keeps in touch with anybody that i meet he's just like somehow has tabs on everybody he's like yo she's blowing up in la i'm like what do you mean he's like she got this restaurant um she's blowing up like the restaurant's getting really popular her brand is getting really popular she's got a podcast that's getting kind of popular um and he's like yes what's her full name let's get we'll give her a proper shout out what's her full name brisha lopez okay so uh she and she's got a cookbook like she's kind of like doing her thing she's got a lot of a lot of stuff going which i think is pretty fun she got a book called asada the art of mexican style grilling by brisha lopez um i met her and her brother so anyway so she invites us she's like hey you're you're in la you're having meetings anyways come to our restaurant and uh like you know or whatever we come to her restaurant she serves us this amazing meal you know we talk about restaurant owner energy she had it she literally has restaurant owner energy like we walk in we're in her place she's like sit down food just starts appearing we're not ordering anything she's literally like making my plate by hand she's like she's like feeding me like i'm a baby she's like try this was it free did you have to pay i wish i could have paid she's like your money's no good here and um wow and so the restaurant owner energy was flowing i loved it uh i literally when we walked out our buddy was like wow is that what it's like to own a restaurant i i and then our other friend was like this is how every entrepreneur makes the mistake of owning a restaurant because they experience the one percent amazing feeling when you host people at your restaurant and not the 99 of actually you know running a hard restaurant so she um anyways we're hanging out she's like i love the pod she's like i love the blue collar side hustles and i was like oh yeah i haven't done that in a while she goes i got one for you like what is it she goes the lice lady oh the license lady what are you what are you talking about and so she goes she goes dude uh she's like i have kids that are in school and um if you ever if anybody in class gets lice everybody has to get checked for lice and not just not just all the kids like your whole family basically has to get checked for lice and she's like i'm thinking of like the pigeon lady in the park who has pigeons all over the place is this i guess i was thinking like it's a woman that just has lice all over like hanging on her shoulders that she feeds them crackers like go to uh go to like one of these i don't know like lice treatment la.com it's a mobile lice testing service so what she's what she said about she goes yeah basically somebody inevitably gets lice in school everybody then has to get tested before you can't come back until everybody gets tested clean certified clean so then you can either go and do it like or if you want them to come to you because it's time consuming to like go and book an appointment somewhere you can basically there's a lice lady you could just text in la you text her and she's like cool i'll come out there it's 300 bucks for me to come out i'll test you and your whole family plus like i don't know 50 bucks a pop or something like that 100 for like your certificates and it's basically like she makes you know like whatever 500 600 for doing this like test for the whole family to get them all cleared and she serves like these like eight districts in la and it's like that's her territory and there's like another lady out on the east side and she serves her territory and they don't cross paths otherwise there's a bit of a showdown and so um she's like yeah this lady's making tens of thousands of dollars a month just booked she's booked out with these lice inspections and life treatments i was like wow this is awesome this is i mean who would have ever who would have ever thought uh you know like this is amazing because you know she comes over she got to check four or five people in your house and it's a whole it's a whole deal dude and a lot of them have like pretty cute branding this one's called the lice lifters.com and then there's like hair helpers.com the hair angels.com and they're all just made on like pretty simple wordpress sites if you go to similar web they get great they're getting traffic and then uh they've like just crush it on the google review and the yelp review and some of them have like i'm at lice lifters.com they have locations in florida texas pennsylvania uh new jersey it's almost like a like a franchise this is super fascinating this is really fascinating very cool right like it's uh you know lice busters here we go you know we'll come get you um it's crazy yeah they they this is like a little model that i think works locally if it works locally you could do it in a bunch of locations if you're doing a bunch of locations you could even franchise it out or go nationwide if you if you really got aggressive with it so i kind of love this this little uh this little blue collar side also and it's one of these like hidden in plain sight niches right it doesn't take a genius to uh to pull this thing off dude if you go to licebustersusa.com the one you're on i mean i made that up by the way is there actually yeah i just googled licebusters like licebustersusa.com they have a couple dozen locations uh no this is a really a super fascinating thing um yeah this is cool how much does it cost to have a lice buster come to your school i bet you it's like a thousand dollars for the day or something none of yeah exactly none of them do like clear pricing on their website which is how you know it's kind of a rip um but like you know they got you in a hard spot too right it's like a locksmith right they come over they're like well uh this is a 1988 it's gotta be an extra 500 you're like well am i really gonna tell you to go home call another locksmith to price compare like impossible right like no one no one has more power on earth than a locksmith when they're at your house like it is over at that point you know you know that's like a huge scam right have you ever read about locksmiths so i knew this guy from israel who ran one of these things and he was like if you google locksmith nashville he's like there's like eight of the ten listings on google they're all different branding i own all of them and i basically like i have like indentured servants so i got like my friends who come in from israel i say you have to work for me for two years and he basically sends them leads and the name of the game is you go to the person's house you tell them it's 200 on the phone you actually charge for 400 and it's like known for being one of the most shady things there is is the locksmith industry have you not like ever heard about never never met an honest locksmith uh guy comes to my house he's like ah you know first he takes it forever and it's like basically it takes so long that you're like by the time this gets there you're already worn out it's like a negotiation without him even being there and then it's too late to call somebody else you just want to get into your damn car or your house and then they show up and they're like uh this is going to be trickier because the um this is a house and we're like yeah of course it's a house it's like yeah it's got studs so we're just gonna be i have a stud fee and i'm like stud fee what are you talking about bro he's like oh like this oxygen in the air oh i'm gonna have to charge you for that oh it's made out of wood and literally what happened the last locksmith the guy came and he tried to charge us 600 and then we were like no way just out of principle no way you stand here i'm gonna break this door down with my shoulder and get it repaired for double what's he like all right fine 100 bucks no he stood there and he watched us break the door down with our shoulder and then we paid 1200 to get the door repaired um i gotta tell you never felt more satisfied paying the 1200 because that sheet didn't get my money what did he say when you smashed the door down very alpha of you he was just laughing well dude imagine the intent imagine the moment of anticipation when i'm about to charge and i've only ever seen this in movies i have no idea how much force this is going to take and if this fails if i get slam into this it doesn't shoulder i hurt my shoulder and fall down absolute worst case scenario now we got to pay this guy and i got to go to kaiser instead it's like i must get through this wall and like you know like moms can lift cars when their children are in need like my ego was trapped and i had to break this door down and there was no other option and of course i came through in the clutch um so you know it ended up working out after two or three solid banks the key was i didn't fully commit to the first one i gave it like a tester just kind of like uh let me yeah i'm gonna do it over here on the side and like when we get to the edge then a middle middle is the way to go right like where's the point of weakness i can see you standing there like looking at your finger to see which way which way the wind's blowing like it's just like calculating like you got a piece of chalk and you like do a little math to figure out like where the best like point of entry is yeah just doing things to stall i just like took my shoes off like i don't know why like i was just like let me just hold on and i was just thinking like okay what am i going to do to get this door down and you like warm up your hands i don't know why i needed to perform for this guy like i could have just told him to leave and done it in my privacy but i had told him like that's a rip off i'm gonna break this door down all right so let me tell you um this is actually a good segue to a topic i wanted to talk to you about i didn't know how we would work this in but it worked out perfectly so there's this phrase that i love which was um i'm looking for that i'm looking for a triple a locksmith it's a triple a locksmith what's a triple a locksmith so back in the day when they had the phone pages people would the yellow pages people would go to like find a service like locksmith and um it's like doing four four minute ads instead of seven minute abs you know you gotta yeah exactly you could differentiate on many things you could say we're a locksmith uh company we're honest we have we have good pricing we are like nobody knows that they're just looking at the yellow pages they don't know how to find you find out anything more about you they're just going to go based on which locksmith stands out guess who stands out the most the one at the top and so i call it the trip triple a locksmith idea because people started to game the system they're like oh instead of calling themselves smith's locksmiths like then they're far down the list they would call themselves right a locksmith and then some other guy was like no no we're double a locksmith so a a locksmith they would show up first in the like the list some other guy comes in he's like no no i'm a a locksmith triple a locksmith because they're going to be first on the list because actually that's all that matters first on the list is going to get 80 of the dials and so i love this this story because it showed me like you want somebody who like i always said when we were hiring engineers i want to hire triple a locksmiths which is somebody who could do the job on the engineering side but they have just enough of their mind just 10 15 of their mind is going to think about hey how do we get more customers oh if i just put two a's in front of my name i'll be at the top of the list dope i'll do that that that that immigrant it's like that immigrant house yeah exactly so i want the engineer that's got just enough of that that that little that moment of micro hustle where they just figure out oh this little thing is going to help me you know help me get a little bit further in life so i was thinking about these micro hustles because again i left the house start to observe things start to notice how broken some industries are so i'm at a dinner how long were you gone for five days an eternity okay um i go to dinner and uh sitting with some friends and the this happened five times so we went to dinner every single night while we were out while i was in delay every single night the same thing happened at dinner we eat at the end waiter comes up and he says um can i get you guys a dessert menu dessert everybody want dessert dessert and then you know his voice is going up like a hot air balloon and then everybody at the table awkwardly looks around i you want did you want any did you want dessert i'm good i'm good that's a that's a that's a rookie waiter move you set the you just set it down even if you just set it down same sort of thing so i said i said okay what's the micro and and so i was thinking about i was like what's the micro hustle move here if i'm aware so i'm looking for these moments where you because i meet a lot of people that are like love the pod um yeah i want to do my own thing someday but currently i just have this job and like the gap between the current job and running their own successful company feels large in their mind and here's the way to shrink that gap well the real way to show you have to just do it but let's say you're you're not just doing it yet yeah teach me about some teach me about some shrinkage let's go yeah you're an expert maybe you should actually explain this yeah yeah yeah preaching to the choir here so um so i'm like how do you start to think like a business owner think like a little bit of a hustler when you're in your job find the moments where you can hustle inside inside your job and i'm not talking about pitching your boss an idea i'm talking about just going rogue in making some happen learning how to be a triple a locksmith how to use human psychology to your advantage so the last dinner i see this guy and this guy's a little more clever one guy he goes he takes instead of instead of saying dessert menus anybody want dessert should i bring a dessert menu um and instead of just putting down dessert menu and then hoping for the best this guy comes to me at the side of the table he goes um he goes he goes he goes i'll leave this with you to order dessert for the table uh nice oh that was smooth as a mother and i was like wow like i guess i am the hand of the table but the man of the house i do need to provide for my my friends here you know i do need to to give them an experience and he just whispered it to me like this is our little secret you just tell me what you tell me what you want we'll surprise them so i was like that was a smooth move and i started thinking what could go even further and so i started everywhere i was going i started brainstorming this little micro hustle moment so then even with this dessert thing i said it would make it more fun i said what if what if they actually set down a thing because most people when it comes to dessert they it looks like there's two answers yes or no but there's actually a third answer do you know the third answer when it comes to dessert no what i'll have some if you want some that's actually where everybody lands it's like yeah i'll do one if you're doing one right like this is how people feel with things and so i i thought somebody should actually just set down a little thing in front of everybody say all right here's a restaurant at the end of the meal there's three little buttons i can put in front of you button number one no thanks i'm fine button number two hell yeah but number three i'll have one if everyone else wants one and uh on three we do our reveal we make it fun you do the reveal if anybody says yes and anybody says i'll have it if everyone else is having it say no more would you guys like the brownies or the truffles oh okay truffles yeah let's go and you could get i think you could add on like 40 to every ticket if you just did it this way dude i love i love those games like that it's like it's like in and out secret menu yes you know what i mean like i love these games at restaurants that's my favorite thing i think a lot of life is just played in your head and if you're just sitting somewhere the challenge i give everybody is how do you play a little game in your head today where you say all right let me add a little showmanship let me add a little restaurant owner energy to what i'm doing right now let me add a little psychology to what i'm doing right now and if you do that every day you become a different person like i fully believe this you literally become a different person and you have more fun versus just going through the motions as you were before so this is my little rant on finding that little micro hustle uh being the guy who figures out how to do the dessert menu in a way that makes everybody feel good and actually gets everyone gets everyone eating dessert because there's a version of that for your job whatever your job is the mini riz a little mini riz you did this at the hustle we talked about when you did the uh everybody gets a hundred dollars let's go to costco and let's see who gets the best thing right like yeah it was it was the best yeah that was our team building activity was we had i think we had 12 employees we gave everyone 50 bucks we said you can team up you can do it on your own but at the end we're gonna vote we're gonna have three characters or three awards which is most useful gift your favorite gift and the most tasty gift and you have to try to win one of those awards yeah and i love these stories of people who just take the ordinary and uh and sort of like add a little extra to make it extraordinary all right anyways that's my rant who who were you at dinner with or who'd you go to la with and did you did anything amazing happen a lot so many amazing things happened i wanted to actually write my notes and send them to you so that then we could do an episode just breaking the whole thing down because there was so much uh so much were you recognized a lot do you get recognized not at all actually really la's got real actual famous people so um maybe people don't know that you're like 6-1 i think because a lot of people i think would be surprised how tall you are when i go to la i mean i i get stopped a dozen times a day uh i think maybe i just stick out more than you do maybe but it could be uh i'm shocked by that or you're just super unapproachable which i could see that as well yeah i think that's actually more of it um i must have just like you know whatever resting bitch face or something because uh yeah nobody's really coming up to me that much it happens actually here in the bay area but when i was in la i don't think it happened one time so that was good uh you know it's always good to go with your roots as i say you're not from la no i mean like but okay non-famous fruits yeah where uh who'd you go you went with ben probably sully anyone else uh no it's just me and ben went and then sully lives down there so he joined us for half the trip well i want to hear all about it so i guess we'll have to wait uh i got some other quick ones i want to i want to hit you with some some quick hitters so this is i'm going to call this my weird ai tool of the week i don't know if this is going to be a recurring segment but it might be because a lot of weird ai tools so click this link there's a company right now in yc that is called roundtable roundtable.ai and i saw this post on hacker news um it wasn't the most popular post but i found it and i uh that was fascinating so this guy goes because that's what you do that's what you do you got to find you find the good exactly so i was i was i was deep in the bag and i found something so um they posted this lube video that says hey check this out we are roundtable we use ai to simulate surveys and they go um they go you know research user research and market research is really important but it's expensive takes time to design and analyze and run the run the research so here's what we do we use ai to simulate a survey and they go yeah basically like llms the new tech that's behind like chat gpt is great at um simulating what something something like a human would say and these guys just took it to the n degree so they go you write a survey with a bunch of questions you define your audience like i want people who are 45 years old or older right and so you could say um for example are you interested in buying an e-bike um and it would say yes is answered 28 of the time but if you narrow it down you say let me filter only people who own a tesla now yes is 52 of the time and you know for example if you say um where do where did you learn to code um okay you could ask that question people will say one thing but if you say how old are you if you say only 45 years old or older then everybody will say books if you say younger than 45 70 76 percent of people will say online um and so you know it's kind of crazy that basically like and you can say what what's the most important factor for you choosing an airline to fly and like five percent of people will say legroom but if you filter it say people who are six feet or taller it jumps to 20 percent of people saying legroom and so i saw this and i was like what the hell like does this defeat the purpose of the survey like you're literally just gonna make up the answer and give it to me but then i guess humans are actually a lot more predictable than we think this thing is trained on like the entire internet's data set and i just thought this was remarkable and i couldn't believe like is this actually going to be the case that you can actually just ai could just fake answer your surveys and tell you do your user research for you doesn't that sound absolutely bizarre so it's not there yet because one person he goes hey look i had i ran a survey i said was the moon landing fake option a yes option b moon 94 of people voted moon uh and but that said uh i actually do think the same results would actually come if you actually asked people that exact same question like most people would be like oh it's not lamp you know what i mean like oh i think i know you're saying you're saying you meant to put yes there uh so but but this is like a really thought provoking idea yeah and honestly i haven't even spent enough time like actually figuring out like is this literally a joke or is this like the next big thing if that's kind of interesting anytime you get something that's like either it's satire this was actually started by the onion or it's genius it's like you driving around being like ah it i'll be a taxi did i ever tell you about the time that i ran um the disco that's not how uber started just in case you didn't know one man just deciding i'll be a taxi but did i tell you that i used to do that no so one for two two new years in a row my buddy joe and i we rented a zip car minivan and we wore if you google this you'll see photos of me doing this we wore fake afros and disco clothes i'll try to find it but we had the it was called the um disco frisco taxi and we would drive around uh if you look up disco frisco taxi you'll see my name you'll see disco taxi and we would drive around be like hey guys where are you going you want to go to this place all right cool how about uh 30 bucks and they would say all right cool they would get in and be like all right you entered in the disco frisco taxi spin the wheel you can win a juice box brought to you by the writers of the touchy feely wheelie which is the thing i do monday through friday yeah it's like all right your destination is my house my home all right yeah let's go so you basically made your own like cash cab and you would just what charge them like yeah dollars because it's new year's and they're like desperate and we would be like how about 50 bucks and they would say all right cool uh and so we would make like a thousand dollars a night on new year's i was it was the disco frisco taxi so i don't remember where i'm even going with this but uh yeah round table cool into it um really good really good i like that where do you want to go from here are we wrapping up uh yeah let's wrap it up all right that's the pod we done so so so so so so so so
