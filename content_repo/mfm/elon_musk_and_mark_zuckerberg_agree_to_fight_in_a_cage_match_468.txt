he needs a hold me back guy you're at a hold me back guy you're in a fight and you're like hey listen i'm gonna go after these guys i need you to hold me back so i'm not i'm not actually trying to fight this guy i need it to look like i'm trying to fight this guy and i need you to hold me back and it's got to be off these guys weren't holding me i would have kicked your ass he needs to find a hold me back i think elon's hold me back guy his hold me back guy is going to be a hard sneeze he's one hard sneeze away from getting like a backsmasm you know what i'm saying like all right we are live what's going on dude amazing hoodie sick hoodie you like that hampton yeah that is uh very nice i had a team off site we had all of our employees get together in brooklyn and the ceo my ceo jordan organized this lovely event and he gave us all hoodies that say hampton and then our city that we live in you're um you're a stressful dude to organize an event for i've never had to do it but i've been a part of events where um people are organizing for us and i'm like they're like oh yeah um by the way it's everything you know the venue changed and we forgot you know there's only one chair on stage i'm like it's cool all right no problem and then you're like what the hell and so i would be very stressed if i had to throw a off site or an event where you were um my like kind of core customer of it is that fair let me yeah yeah that's fair but let me explain my reasoning behind that and this is very business related number one i believe the way you do one little thing is the way you do everything so what that means though is once you have but but if you've proven to me that i can trust you i'm all in and i don't question anything and so until you've proven that to me i question everything and if there's not a good answer behind it i doubt you and once we get past that stage i'm good the second reason there is no second reason i actually forget what that was a good reason oh i know the second here's this here's the second reason and we could actually talk about this for a second if you want but basically the second time around you've done something everything is so much calmer because now my entire reputation my entire net worth it's not tied up into this one entity which is what many things i've done in the past have been so i'm much calmer i'm way more uh subdued uh this time yeah i think that's true uh for sure and do you find yourself thinking bigger as a kind of like the way bigger now you know this is uh you've got one win under your belt um what was the phrase that justin mayor said once you do whatever you got to do to get your nut and after that go for your noble mission um so you know you've gotten your nut now you know you're you're financially secure you're safe do you not only are you calmer but are you more i don't know ambitious or long-term oriented in some way yes 100 i used to criticize uh founders if they would sell secondary so you'd read about this a lot you you typically only read about it when it's done in a bad way of which it's done in a bad way many times you'll see this company which is going to go bankrupt the founders took 50 million dollars off the table and it didn't work out the reasoning behind that i think is great still uh which is you give uh an entrepreneur five or ten million dollars and they're like wow i i can i can live a really nice life now i think bigger that's definitely the case with me i think significantly longer term so i think like what's this like in 20 or 30 years as opposed to next quarter and i don't care if it fails which is actually a good thing meaning i'm able to try more within it i what have i said treat them mean keep them keen it's like that with with trying to find a date and make money so like you the less i care the more it happens yeah the way i think about it is like because you see examples on both sides you see when somebody had no other option back against the wall that's when they when they when they rose to the occasion and you can also hear the other other scenario which is because i was secure i was able to play a long-term game and i was less emotionally um invested in the ups and downs of it therefore i was able to make better decisions and blah blah blah and you could see both examples so which one is it and actually i think the reality is that success is not based on either one of those it's not based on how much money you had in your bank account when you had zero or when you had a bunch people tell themselves stories about it either way i think fundamentally if a person is driven intrinsically driven um it doesn't matter whether that fuel is because they're a technologist and they just love technology they're trying to make something good for humanity or they're insecure because you know in seventh grade uh rachel dumped them and it's like well either way it doesn't matter uh you know like it doesn't matter what your driving force is as long as you have a driving force and it's different for a whole bunch of people there's there's examples of people on on on all kinds of um you know uh like with all kinds of you know chips on their shoulder i think you do need to be driven and it's just a question of by what and i think everybody's got a different by what are are you more calm now that you've had success i'm definitely more calm uh but i was pretty calm before so calm i would say is not really the word i guess the way i would put it is um i'm less desperate and yeah i think that has ups and downs again like i said like when i was desperate to prove myself like uh you saw that i worked in that really fancy office i also slept in that office i think basically it was like one year is like 275 days out of the year i slept there and like it was nice to sleep there it's really nice they had an apartment built into the office so it wasn't like the it's not like i was sleeping under my desk on the like concrete floor but nonetheless that just sort of means i just didn't have a life i didn't want to have a life i didn't want to care about friends and dating and other things i cared about just making it i just wanted to be successful really badly and i was like it's not even that i was super productive all those hours but i was like look i'm gonna throw all my hours at the problem i will sleep here i will wake up here that just seems more efficient i'm just gonna do that i did that for several years but now i would say that desperation has been replaced with um you know a different asset okay i lost the desperation which was serving me what do i have now which is like i can operate more out of a like i can choose things that are like i'm actually driven towards like i have a purpose even if there's no short a little more offensive as well yeah there's no short-term path to like right now for example i'm writing this newsletter uh every day i write this thing every day there's no ads there's i subscribe no small boy or a small boy yeah small boy and i'm writing this thing there's no ads there's no premium there's no upsell there's no business model so why am i doing it and i'm like because i really like writing and more than i like writing i like finding interesting shit to write about things that you know scratch my curiosity so i'm able to do something and then as i'm doing this thing that has no business plan that has no whatever i'm seeing all these extra opportunities open up because that i that i couldn't have seen at the beginning and so just by doing the thing i really kind of have drawn to i'm most interested in i'm doing my best work and when i'm doing my best work these unforeseen things start to open themselves up and i'm like oh i would have the 24 year old me would have never been able to do this because 24 year old me was desperate and needed i needed a payoff quick now i don't need a quick payoff and so i'm able to do things differently and i think that has a different advantage can we talk about um is there a new chip on your shoulder now now that you and there's been a very well you tell me is the feud that you're experiencing right now your internet feud is that has that even made it to the point where you bring it up at the dinner table no no no my wife is not aware of it but she's like hmm how come he's looking at his phone for like an extra 30 seconds longer and it's because i'm coming up with a a badass slam in my head what's actually happening i'm wordsmithing a seventh grade insult right now and uh i don't know what does my kid want what do you want hold on daddy's busy i'm coming up with a yo mama joke to jason calacanis right now background of this is there's a podcast called the all in pod they're great i think they're good but they're different than us and we uh we uh a lot of people will listen to both of ours so maybe there's a little definitely some competition in there but we can all win and last podcast sean challenged them uh basically to a hundred thousand dollar poker bet uh heads up poker but there was some more there's more detail behind it but i shared that uh on the internet and jason calcanus i thought he was coming hard at me too but he came hard he said sam you're great sean you'll still learn and he gave you a head pat and he said uh smart of you sean to punch well i don't know if he so the background is uh while we were i forgot what we were talking about i think we were making fun of him a little bit because he um in the rogan debate people were like uh you know it's raised two million dollars for this uh the scientist to come debate this guy like a kind of a a famous internet challenge here and he's like i'm in for 10k which is funny because the answer for the record was doing was 100k plus i've never made fun of jason if it comes down to it i you have my loyalty i will i'll die for you but i've so far if you want me to i'll i'll gladly hop in i've stayed mostly neutral this is a you thing yeah yeah yeah yeah that's fine i by the way i like jason for the record i have nothing against jason calcanus uh i i'm uh i've listened to this week of startups for a long time i don't listen anymore but i used to listen like back in the day i like the all-in podcast uh it's sort of like two thoughts that are both true um i like their content i have nothing against him personally i've met him a couple times um in passing uh you know whatever no no no no no totally harmless there's no no no no ill will there also i think some things he says are funny and cringy like funny kind of laugh at you not with you type of thing and cringy like when uh the thing i think the joke i had made that he didn't like was that when um i said all in is billionaires talking about billionaire mfm is millionaires talking about millionaire and somebody goes actually it's more like three billionaires and jason calcan and their friend jason calcanus and he go he came in for his own defense and goes actually i'm a senti a centi millionaire i just thought that was cringe as fuck which objectively and scientifically it is and so i think he might have might have taken offense to that and uh he didn't he didn't fully like it but i would say my poker challenge to them is only for fun i just think it would be a fun thing to do i think it'd be a fun thing to watch um i'm just looking for some action i love playing poker they say they're great at poker okay let's do a little celebrity uh but no no celebrity challenge nothing's been settled you're not doing it yet well they didn't take the bait i think you know he was sort of just like well you know you're not famous enough for me to do this challenge i have more to lose than i do have than i have to gain uh out of doing this was sort of the the vibe i got which honestly the problem with that is that that's not entirely true do uh are they are they more popular you could argue that for sure for sure but but there's a ballpark and uh you know it's there i'm in the stadium yeah it's not like calling uh you know what do i say it's not like calling a 510 guy tiny you know what i mean like you got to be at least five six to get that nickname you're 510 here you know what i mean not small enough yeah yeah but the funny thing is as i was talking about yeah we should like on the podcast i was joking i was like oh wait is this fake internet beef i would love to have some fake internet beef that's you know this is how rappers for generations have been getting famous you know they just have fake beef we should do this as podcasters with other podcasts and so i think that was the the sort of like the the the the the fun behind it we got one upped big time just when i thought me and jason calcanis were getting some some fake internet beef palmer lucky comes off the top rope the founder of oculus and andrew comes off the top rope and just body slams jason people love that and then while that's going on elon musk challenges mark zuckerberg to a fight and now i don't even give a about my own poker match i need to see these guys fight uh let's break this down we have to do this story yeah so basically i don't actually don't know how it started you know how it started but what i do i'll fill in when facebook actually facebook officials replied with a beautiful response well there's a few steps to it so i think the first thing was um i guess the old i think the origin of this was a presentation leaked out of uh facebook that was talking about the facebook's coming out with a twitter competitor i think it's called project 92 or something like that and it's a twitter competitor and their pitch was sort of like yeah it's a twitter competitor um instagram people will be able to immediately have their instagram following on this so if you want to if you're already famous on instagram you can just start sharing short form text like twitter on our new thing and um you know it will be run by like run in a sane way like it'll be managed in a sane way i think was the something that's something with the word sane in it and so essentially implying that twitter is sort of insane and the way elon's running it is is uh reckless so that got out that that present internal presentation leaked um maybe intentionally maybe not i don't know and um so elon started making fun of of zuckerberg he's saying like you know zuck my blink you know like you know he's just sort of like you know tweeting stuff like that and then somebody somebody was like you know watch out zuck's been training and he and elon replies and says um i'll fight i'll fight zuck in a cage match so he says this and zuck screenshots it and posts on his instagram story with the caption send me location which for those who don't know is a iconic ufc slogan by khabib uh one of the the great i think i think one of the greatest uh ufc fighters of all time who was when he was fighting with conor mcgregor and mcgregor was like oh he's scared he doesn't want to fight me blah blah blah and habib just goes brother i'm not scared you want to fight me okay just send me location just send me location like basically where do i need to go i'll fight you anywhere and so zuck hits elon with the send me location and this triggers a chain of events that i thought was a joke so i thought first of all i've never seen zuck talk trash that was already kind of an amazing moment he he he did a heel turn which is awesome the second thing is i was like okay well there's no way this is serious and then elon sees that tweet and goes or sees that story and goes i'm serious i'll do it if he's down and then people are like wait what i don't know if you saw this today sam do you see that dana white's involved so dana white who's the president of the ufc comes out because again i'm sort of um you know my greatest fantasy would come true if this uh if randomly two tech billionaire ceos went and decided to do a ufc match that's my two worlds colliding all of a sudden dana white comes out he says i talked to mark and elon last night both guys are absolutely dead serious about this um he goes this would be the biggest fight of all time floyd and connor was one of the biggest fights of all time this i think triples it there is no limit on how much this could make he said it would be in las vegas it would pay-per-view and it would be about a hundred bucks pay-per-view and you would have 51 year old elon musk against i don't know like 39 year old mark zuckerberg who's 100 pounds lighter than him and uh dude what is happening is this is this real and then the verge reached out to facebook and a facebook official which is replied and they just said yeah and they go the story speaks for itself which is another like basically there's a guy in the ufc that always says it is what it is and that's exactly what what facebook just said they said we're it is what it is it sounds it sounds serious and i thought that was a pretty baller move i think this is hilarious i think this is awesome i love a freak show assign me all right so i have i have some rapid fire questions topic number one most importantly do you believe this will happen yes or no and why um i believe zuck will do it and i and i and i think he would do it i think there's not a chance that elon would do it i think elon would get very hurt just trading for it and i don't think there's a there's a there's not a world where elon does so you think it's a no uh no because elon i yeah 100 agree with you i hope it happens i'm not saying it won't happen but i would just if i had to guess i had to guess i would say it doesn't happen because elon realizes that he's gonna lose a lot he's gonna lose first of all if he does that he's gonna get destroyed he's gonna get he's gonna get tapped out and if he if he does it um i think he realizes that it's a pretty bad look for him to lose to zuck his cool factor is really high and he needs to find a uh wiggle out he needs he needs the he needs a hold me back guy you're at a hold me back guy you're in a fight you're like hey listen i'm gonna go out to these guys i need you to hold me back so i'm not i'm not actually trying to fight this guy i need it to look like i'm trying to fight this guy and i need you to hold me back and it's got to be off these guys weren't holding me i would have kicked your ass he needs to find a hold me back i think elon's hold me back guy his hold me back guy is going to be a hard sneeze he's one hard sneeze away from getting like a back smasms you know what i'm saying like he's not the guy's not fit you know he's a he's a he's a charlie horse away from quitting yes uh winner by noogie mark um all right so so that's my second question which is how do you think let's say let's say our dreams do come true this fight does happen what do you think would actually happen like predict the actual fight what would what would happen fight starts what happens i think that look so i i i i box for fun and i spar and what i've learned is it doesn't really matter that much it matters a bit but it doesn't matter how in shape you are it doesn't really matter how tough you are if you don't practice that skill set and you go against another person that doesn't have that skill set it's just it's just you're light years away from one another just being comfortable getting hit i think zuck would uh finish him within two minutes he would probably uh get him on the ground and elon would tap from getting uh his arm injured or something like that yes um now the counter argument would be but elon could train are you counting elon out this guy's proven he could do anything he could train what's the counter to that he won't i don't think he'll train and i don't think any amount of training look you can't make a overweight 51 year old fit in any amount of time the magic powers of ozempic he's already on his epic he's already lost like 30 pounds on ozempic it it's it doesn't matter it's keep in mind zuck's still only 39 i think or 38. no i i don't think that elon can train i don't any no amount of training so get him here's some here's some extra data uh people were on twitter were like elon we love you but man i i think zuck would handle you here's what elon said he had three things that he said oh i saw the one he said i don't work out except for sometimes when i pick my kids up and throw them in the air so he doesn't work out at all he doesn't exercise yeah forget about fighting the guy doesn't exercise um secondly he's like i'm so much bigger than the guy uh you know just for reference elon's like six three 200 plus pounds you know zuck is probably five nine i think five five eight five nine maybe five ten max and uh it's probably giving up easily 50 pounds in uh in a fight here so weight classes do matter and elon says i have this move called the walrus uh yeah i'm just like a walrus i'll just lay on them they can't do anything they're just pinned this is this is his plan none of that matters it doesn't matter what the guy does jujitsu people want to start on their back with you on top of them it doesn't matter i i'm not a practitioner of jujitsu but i've watched it enough that i feel i feel confident at least in this call it was so one-sided exactly it doesn't matter by the way training like uh you could if you're a beginner in jujitsu you can go to a jujitsu gym for six months and you'll still be getting your ass whooped by like you know people who are just like you know one year ahead of you because the learning curve is very steep to actually get good at this stuff like you you don't pick up boxing or jujitsu very quickly boxing i don't think would be a factor i think the fights go to the ground uh both guys are too uncoordinated nobody's knocking anyone out both guys i think would look very unathletic and would end in zuck tapping him out by the way do you see this picture i put in the doc look at this uh the picture of elon wrestling a sumo wrestler you seen this oh yeah he said he's briefly done karate briefly done judo and uh and done a little bit of jujitsu is what elon has said in the past if i had to bet on elon versus mark on most everything i think i would choose mark zuckerberg yeah like whether business or fighting i think both a good hang i think zuck would be a better hang i think zuck it would trump him and just about everything don't you agree i mean good hang i think a lot of people would pick elon they think elon's looser and more fun and it's like oh he he smoked weed with joe rogan he must be awesome right like this is like how much oh i think i i think he would be an awkward hang i think it'd be very uncomfortable i don't think i think zuck is is just zuck dude they're both podium on the in the awkward olympics i mean let's be real yeah yeah yeah but it's a duck like you know he reads books on where to place his hands when he meets people like he's like place on shoulder you know what i'm saying like and he actually like studies it you know i i think that zuck is gonna win in every aspect you agree i agree i really hope this happens there's this dana white thing gave me a slight hope but there's a famous people don't know this dana white is a like he's a world-class liar um in fact if you ever go into like the ufc communities on reddit whatever like one of the most famous like taglines of the community is don't believe his lies because he'll tell you he'll sell you anything he's a promoter um he will he will try to drum up interest doing whatever he's got to do and uh and and try to pull things off like that uh this might be by the way this might be the hail mary save twitter uh thing you know like uh mayweather mcgregor did like 500 million dollars if he thinks this is going to do triple that let's let's just pretend dana white's not lying for a second here if this fight did like a billion dollars and elon took home you know 200 million dollars out of that net hey that's you know just another few months of runway for twitter which is currently uh you know unprofitable and uh you know depending on who you believe could be could be bleeding advertisers i i have to imagine that there's also like a life insurance policy that these guys have like i wonder if it's like you have to have security with you you can't you can't ride a motorcycle they're just gonna do what billionaires do they're gonna just send in like a proxy like here's my bodyguard versus yours right like in history isn't this how like conquerors fight they don't go fight themselves they send in their best gladiator like the top engineer at facebook and the top engineer at tesla need to go in and fight for the i would still i would still bet on anything zuck does do you want to um can we talk about beehive yeah let's do it tell me a little bit about the background of beehive all right so what is beehive beehive is a piece of software if you want to create an email newsletter beehive in my opinion is the best way to do it i'm biased because i invested in it but i also used it before i invested in it we used it for the milk road we built our whole business off this i basically saw what you had done with the hustle what the morning group guys had done and you guys had all done almost like what i'll call like the homebrew version of beehive which was like when i asked you i said hey what should i use for this you're like well you know you're gonna here's some things you care about you care about deliverability you care about how easy it is for your writers to write you care about a referral program blah blah blah there's five tools and what beehive was was and it's complicated and it's complicated and it's expensive and what beehive did instead was the guy worked at morning brew and he built out their like referral and growth program i think he left and he basically was like how do i productize the internal tech that we kind of had at morning brew so that it makes it easier for anybody to create a newsletter brand so and this is a constant discussion that we had at the hustle and my constant answer was no let's just focus on this one thing and that's true i made the right decision because it's so challenging for a media company to be a software company and vice versa it's hard when you're doing one thing to like i had ad sales people i'm like you guys can't sell software it's just different and he has proven that i actually predicted i was like no because we're not we need to focus and also because i don't think there's a market for it so far i think i've been proven wrong but i i haven't been proven wrong totally we'll see if it actually works he spins it out he are so he creates beehive it's basically you go on you click a few buttons you've got a newsletter you got your templates you can create segments you can do all the features of a newsletter great um it's good we use it for the milk road we build our whole business off this thing we sell milk road after a year or so along the way um i got pitched by him probably when you did it was like hey i'm thinking about this beehive thing uh we're raising money big fans you guys would love to have you involved and i i had the same opinion as you i was like i don't know it seems small it's like i think i think there's some newsletter brands that will be big but um i don't know if their underlying tech is going to be that big i don't know if there's i don't know how big that platform would be as a software so we passed uh and i think the first valuation we looked at was maybe 10 million ish um yeah you passed too at that time right for the same reason market might be too small and at the time i was saying no to most stuff but really i also thought i i don't think this can work i don't think it's i don't think it could work at a venture scale and there's a classic lesson here which is like you sometimes there's such a thing as knowing too much um often the people who know the most about an industry are uh either a too much scar tissue they just don't want to be involved with it anymore they just want to go do other things they just don't want to think about that because there's too much like i spent seven years i left a piece of my soul over there and i don't really want to want to worry about that again and the other is you get too defined by like you know uh how things are and you don't really see you're almost too too deep in you don't see where it's going this is why very few breakthrough innovations come from traditional industry experts they come from often beginners um and why why would a beginner be able to create a breakthrough not an expert um because they come in with a fresh fresh perspective and blank slate they don't they're not limited by you know the prevailing wisdom so that's that's happened many times over so we pass we start using it though i'm like i'll be a user so you know that there's that i'm not gonna invest but i'll be a user so we start using it and what did you think of the product and at first it was good but i kept running into these limitations and i would be like hey uh oh my god they don't even let you filter by x or wait you don't even have analytics for my growth side or the referral program only does this you know like i would find these i'd bump into the limitations this was very early on we were like one of their first users i think and his reply i bet was the best reply on earth because that's what it seems like it was the perfect reply as always which is uh i hear you we agree already working on it but let me see if i can get you something a little sooner um you know we're planning to release this in two months but let me see what i can do here and what they would do is either he would manually do a workaround for us it'd be like look uh we don't have this analytics thing yet but here's what i'm going to do i put a button on your dashboard it's ugly it's gray nobody else can see it it just but it's an export it'll email you a csv and then can you just run the run the analytics yourself for now until we build it so he would give me a he would take three hours and just make my life better he would understand he would also ask me a bunch of questions like so what are you trying to really do here and let me just confirm i understand this like a good product person would do he's trying to really understand the needs the second thing he would do is then they would actually ship the feature so he'd say that's two weeks away i remember telling ben many times then be like oh yeah they said they're coming out in two weeks i was like dude are you a rookie like no way startups say anything they don't like no what engineer has ever hit a timeline like this never happens sure enough two weeks later hey they would proactively reach out hey the feature's out test it out i want you uh i think it'll work for you guys now and we would go do it and he just did that three times so over the course of about three or four months i was like changed my mind called tyler we need to invest in this thing i was like but what about your concerns about the market i was like i don't know still might be true but here's what i do know this guy's an animal he's making a product that's really good and um you know what this might be an example where the market is bigger than you think which has been the case for many big winners like you know what's the market for you know private black town car on demand or crashing on someone's house as an airbnb right like these things can become a lot bigger than you sort of initially look at if you sort of squint i've heard so many people say the same thing about him and i've noticed because i found him online i've only talked to him once or twice i've noticed online of him changing like quickly moving quickly changing the product quickly and whenever i saw that i i thought damn he's gonna do it he's he's gonna i don't know how big but something's gonna get pulled off here that's that's like you you could tell that right away and this is uh so two things on this one there's a framework that we had in my very first startup we realized this we were in the we were doing that sushi restaurant in the restaurant industry there's this weird phenomenon which is provide what's expected no points mess up their order minus 10 points but fix the mess up plus five points so it's like i was like hold up if we had just given them the right dish they don't care they just as move on as expected if we mess up their order they're angry but if we fast fix and we not just fix their order but we give them the freebie with it or we ex you know we really make come back and make sure that they're all good or we take it off their bill all of a sudden they had a tremendous experience with us and they'll go tell their friends and i was like what's with that and i came up with this sort of like the fix it theory of restaurants which is actually mistakes they're gonna happen anyways and actually what you need to train instead of a mistake minimization it's how fast and how like thoroughly can you fix it because that actually creates like a higher net promoter score that's beautiful this guy's doing this with software basically did you make this up yeah i'm sure there's um some i'm sure there's some name for this i don't know this was like a whatever or you know discovered by the hard way but like i'm sure there's a fancy name for that i just called it the fix it theory right like if we fix it it's it's all about how you fix it and the fix it's where you get the like diehards so that's very good i noticed that and um so he was doing that i'll give you one other little beehive story which is like i don't know a little dark maybe doesn't want me to share this but like you know at some point i'm bad am i right this the cto passed away right his cto passed away so we were a biggest jerk of all time he says the two week thing something didn't happen in the two weeks one time and i was like dude come on you said whatever where's that feature we really need it don't you understand how important my newsletter bubble i'm being like you know i didn't say those words but like i'm playing it up in a way here we were we were just like oh god complaining like it's not ready yet he's like i'm so sorry we're just dealing with something right now his co-founder or cto had passed away during the startup and they were you know that's a very hard thing for any entrepreneur to deal with yeah he handled that like as well as a human being can handle it meaning was totally you know like gracious and empathetic around what was going on but also understood that like you know he's got it he he's got to keep moving forward in some way and he's gonna have to figure this out and it's not an easy thing to figure out i mean like all kinds of crazy you just don't know the passwords to have the things right like it's like all kinds of stuff that you don't even really think about because knock on wood this never happens but you know just seeing how somebody overcomes adversity and deals with really tough situations is another thing where you sort of see you know characters revealed in moments of difficulty and adversity you see how somebody handles something you think you know what i think they're going to figure things out fast forward to i think he's really young too right he's like 20 he's he's in his probably 27 yeah something like that yeah he's he's pretty baby face i don't know he seems seems youngish um i'll tell you two other interesting things so yesterday the reason why we're talking about is yesterday they announced we should probably should have led with this yesterday they announced they're raising uh they raised a series a 12 12 and a half million dollar series a from lightspeed at like a 50 million dollar valuation i think uh is what an article said yeah i think a little more than that so they they raised uh this money and it's uh and they he posted a graph of their arr so their annual recurring revenue and it's uh hockey stick curve it's three million in arr and like i don't know how long let me let me check i think it's sort of like uh um yeah through three million ar in like 12 to 18 months maybe something like that um just really really really impressive and so he um uh the run rates i think four million he's like and he said in the thing we're trying to end the year at 12 million and uh super impressive and the end this year so go go from four to 12. that's what he's trying to jump that's what he's trying to jump he says currently at a four million dollar run rate um they have three million of recurring revenue from their subscription product plus another million of revenue from their like because they'll help you let's say you want to sell ads or you want to monetize your newsletter they'll help you monetize your newsletter too so they have like other products now um wow and it says uh yeah i forgot he boasted the chart but i think it's like roughly 18 months to two you know maybe 24 months at the max uh that it did that oh you got a call out in the in the tech crunch article it said used by milk road hell yeah that's right i'm in the ballpark baby um so so you know you know i think that this is a good good um an interesting example i'm curious to see how this plays out i could see this still honestly going one of two ways you know i'm an investor but i could totally see this being a great business that wasn't venture scale meaning like he might sell this thing for a hundred they might get to 25 million in revenue and sell for 200 million dollars i think that could be that's probably the expected outcome to be honest it would that be would you be happy with that yeah i'd be happy for them yeah i mean we would make some money wouldn't be like the type of return we would like you know that you would like in a startup portfolio you're obviously looking for these like billion dollar plus outcomes but hey you know like that's a win's a win and i would be really happy happy for their team so you know i think that would be life-changing money for him to be a great outcome i think that's like that's like the the the like if they do well if they execute well i think that's on the table i think what's the question is how big does this kind of newsletter media thing get can this get to the scale where okay if they're if they're trying to get to 10 million an error this year they're at four trying to get to 10.

if they get to a hundred right if they 10x once from if they 10x from there over the next you know five years that's now a billion dollar company the question is like can it become that um what would they need to do to do that i think that's going to be be the challenge of the big question for them i don't think that's going to happen if i had to bet i think that there's a nine-figure exit that's going to happen here that will make them wealthy and be a huge success i don't think a billion dollar company is going to happen um i think it's too challenging i think that um i'm an investor of convertkit if you google convertkit and then the word bear metrics you can see all of the revenue and the churn on convertkit convertkit's been doing it for eight or nine years i think and you there are a little bit more focused on small businesses as opposed to beehive which is like freelancers turned one man two man companies and you can look at their turn of convertkit and i would think it's better than beehive and it seems very challenging to get to a hundred million in revenue in a venture times in a venture time frame yeah i think that's i think that could be uh totally totally totally the case so on convertkit their mrr right now says basically three million a month so 36 so it's 30 36 million a year 36 and look at the churn i think it's four percent a month yeah 3.5 percent a month um so does that mean that most people turn out after one year is that what that math means no uh i don't know i don't know i can't matter to public math definitely definitely don't try to do monthly compounding into into extrapolating that for 12 months that's not easy for me um but i think through you know three and a half percent churn per month is uh you know obviously not great but uh it's also not like bleeding in in in sas metrics no not at all and i think that i would rather be nathan barry and own 90 of that company of course nathan probably had money or had some income coming in so we have like the ability to do this and like you said everyone's got to get their nut and get it how you can yeah so i think it's going to be massive success i just don't know if it's going to be a billion dollar company but i think that the takeaway here for myself for you and for the listener is the speed of shipping new stuff and making iterations and more so talking to your customer constantly and hearing what they have to say and asking them why not what do you want but why and i'll come up with the solution i think that's the takeaway here i think the fix it menu thing is or the fix it framework is really really really good uh is that what you call it i'll give you i'll give you two other little frameworks around this so one is from paul graham paul graham wrote this essay once where he goes um a thing i've noticed like you know in successful entrepreneurs paul graham created yc so he saw you know whatever thousand plus entrepreneurs try to come through there and picked picked very well he goes one of the things i would say is most commonly linked with like success he goes can you describe this person as an animal and what that means is not oh he's like a giraffe he's got a long neck no it means could you just be like dude that guy's an animal right she's an animal uh it's basically just just just describes the sort of tenacity intensity and speed with which somebody moves and just figures things out and gets through obstacles and breaks through plateaus and that one piece of like kind of like investing advice has really stuck with me and like served me well because it's really easy to get analytical about the market about the product about the industry about the competitors and uh you should that's that's good look at it from all angles but whenever i'm like this person's an animal i'd make a bet for better or worse i'm just like i'm just gonna err on the side of betting on people when i think when i can describe them as an animal uh because that type of person could figure things out and i think on balance it's just a higher predictor of like outside success um and also the opposite is true i've had i've made some mistakes in investing when i'm like oh love this market love this product and i'm sort of projecting if somebody was just a beast and took this on they would just crush it and i kind of overlooked the fact that the person going after it is sort of soft and timid and seems to lack aggression it doesn't seem to know their shit they really know their numbers about well when i ask about the customers they don't post on linkedin a lot yeah they keep wondering about stuff and when i ask them what's going on three weeks later they don't really have clarity on like what's changed what's better what they're focused on um you know when they hit they get overwhelmed easily and it's like i've also talked myself into market uh you know market investments and i i guess for me early stage investing i think that that is the person an animal is just a very important test that's one our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better i got an update from a company i invested in and they were talking about their new like linkedin content series and that was like the main thing you know and this is a software company and i was like okay but how about revenue profit and like how fast like you know what i mean i was like i i don't care also i don't care about the new hires frankly 100 i'm gonna on my own portfolio this way i would i i said this the other day i said to to my investment partner romeen i go i mean man like i feel like maybe 15 best case 20 of our portfolio writes good updates i said that makes me worried because i was like really there's two buckets there's people who just don't write updates at all or they're inconsistent you know they pop up when things are good or they need something and then they disappear for nine months when things are going tough and paul graham also has written about that which is um when you stop talking is when things go bad um like the people who survive are the ones who continue being in communication even when things are tough and when you omit information when it's like exactly hey so why didn't you just put how much you you told me how much your burn was and your law why don't you put your cash balance in there exactly uh like like you know i could do the math we invested in one company early on that's a pretty famous company in silicon valley it was really hot for a period of time and now it's like people have gone sour on it i know what you're talking about and they said uh they like would write their first when they were when it was really hot they would write these very surface level updates like oh we hired this vp and this person and this person and we brought on this new investor it's like cool but what about the business how's business going and you're almost like it's almost like don't ask about the business let's see what's going on why is that the feeling and then sure enough 18 months later oh bad news coming out we had to do layoffs and there's bad hit press article and all this stuff and we're just you know we need to raise money but it's not looking good it's like what's your burn rate oh we burned three million a month i was like dude what and why haven't you been saying this right like it's an unbelievable and then and if you ask them like okay what's the problem right now it's like oh the problem is you know the funding market right now and this that's like no the problem was you were burning three million dollars a month for a long period of time without the corresponding like you know reward for that burn um you know you weren't growing in proportion of that burn and you were reckless with money right like that's the reality that's the honest lesson out of it you might be telling yourself some other story um similarly with our portfolio i'd say about 20 are writing good updates and a good update is here's anatomy of a good update i might actually just release a template for all on this but it's basically um hey guys as a reminder we are hampton what we do is this right like first just like say what you do uh not that like your investors forget but it's in general you're not top of mind for people and you should have a real clear punchy thing that you're drilling in this association whenever this whenever you think of this word think of us whenever somebody has this problem think of us and so like first start with that then say last month was and your answer you're a great month uh good or bad answer that question and then write the kpis and the kpis got to be revenue active users or active usage active customers in some way the negative of that so some churn or you know cost number uh associated with that net burn maybe cash balance you know how much cash do we have on hand and then you want to write the number for we have to write the number for what it is in parentheses you want to write how much is that up month over month and what is your goal right how are you doing against your own goals because our annual goal is to get to 10 million in revenue or get to 100 million in revenue and to do that we need to be doing x and we're actually either above that below that or on track that's the honest way to start an update below that you can write whatever the hell you want to be honest you got to write that part first the next part you should write is why that happened so revenue's down because blank revenue's up because we tried this affiliate thing and it's actually working pretty good we're going to double down on it revenue is down because blah blah blah users is flat because you know we didn't do xyz or we are doing xyz and it's just maintaining we're going to figure out how to get to the next level so you have your your sort of two sentence commentary on the metrics then after that you could put your ask like here's what i need from you and below that you can put in whatever the hell updates you want honestly i don't like the fluffy stuff yeah what you don't want to do is what a lot of people do hey um we have this article can you share that's the you know the start of the update um just a quick update on our end good month for us um we made these four hires i want to welcome you know steve it's like why are we talking about steve your vp of marketing um you know they just go on you know steve used to work at visa but now he's over here and that's really great uh blah blah oh on the product side we released these new updates it's like dude that's not where you put patch notes um like your investors care about something and um you don't want to go over here and wave your hands about all this other that's not actually like the core relevant information and i think uh it's just wild to me that people don't get that i i refuse to like i'll die on that hill that's how investor updates should be written and it's crazy to me that people don't just do that consistently yeah when i see that i just think you're lying about something this is goes back to what i said about the way you do one thing is the way you do everything if you're not honest if you're not honest about it i think that you're lying about other stuff and i just and so i think it's really important to do these things really in the right way i used to do this all the time at the hustle i felt i think you used to get mine right you used to send me your updates and they were phenomenal they were perfect it was exactly in this format and you were like you know you're just the university of common sense it's not like you were like getting mentorship or advising or your fifth startup it was just like all right what are people going to care about like obviously the key metrics how i think how it's going what i think about those key metrics and what we're going to do next that's that's basically what your update was i think what i understood is that like people basically want to get rich they want to get laid and they want to have power like most of my things in life are rooted in like knowing those three things um and the problem with a lot of silicon valley companies is they think that like the answer of but i learned a lot is good enough when it's like no man i give you my hard earned money i expect a return and you need to be uh uh what are they scott belsey told me he goes you need to be a steward of capital and i heard that and i was like oh my man you make it sound so official i sound like a knight like i'm just like deploying like money i'm like a i'm like a knight in shining armor to do this and so there's like that and it's basically like i'm a small business owner trying to make money and my business is investing in your company you just took money out of my family's mouths and you know food off our table that's how i feel and so if a person isn't doing everything in their effort to give me a return on my investment i get pissed if they do really hard they work really hard and they fail or if they make errors i'm cool with that because i knew that i'm playing the lottery here but if they do this soft and they don't aren't honest about it it kills me so you're saying honest in the sense of lying i actually think that's the minority case i don't think people are actively lying i think if they're lying to anyone they're lying to themselves i think what what actually it's like it's lying through omission it's lying through omission is what it is so so i think it's there's three scenarios either you know the situation and you don't want to say it bad or you just don't even know the situation you're not on top of these things really bad it's usually the first or you know it you don't want to say it and you're intentionally withholding the information in order to mislead or misrepresent or whatever the worst and so it's really bad bad or batter right like you know the bad bad or bad it's it's like there's really not a good explanation the only good explanation that i will accept is that there are some companies that are doing so phenomenally well and they know that investors are actually kind of a leaky a leaky bucket and they don't want they want to get ahead they want their rumor mill to go ahead now let me tell you the number of times it's that out of 100 is one out of 100. i had that happen to me did i tell you have i told you about this so all right so the hustle was supposed to sell the deal was supposed to close on february let's say 5th february 5th was the uh their earnings call was also supposed to be supposed to be on february 5th and that's a big deal for a variety of reasons but there's like legal implications here uh you know the sec is involved so it could be it's as simple as like if i told someone that we were about to sell our deal wasn't big enough to do this it did happen but it wasn't because of us but where the stock price can change significantly at the announcement and if i told someone and they make a big trade which has happened multiple times not with us but multiple times there's insider trading that's against the law you go to jail that didn't you know so there's like that implication there and there's also like other implications around like you know it's just not like cool it's it's not like it makes you look bad well anyway we're supposed to close on let's say february 5th someone told axios on february 4th i get an email from sarah fisher i think her name is someone leaked it to her i had only told i told a small amount of people who are helping me i think i told you who are like guiding me and i also had to get like some people to sign some paperwork and i explicitly said don't tell anyone this is a big deal i think i told them this will ruin the deal if you tell people which isn't true but you know i told them i could have and february 4th the day before i was supposed to announce it i get this email from sarah and she goes i have a source saying that you guys are selling and she told me a bunch of facts about the deal that i was like how on earth do you know this and it didn't back it leaked and i have we're not a big company like we're not we weren't big enough that this is like i don't i don't know why this should be gossip but it happened and it freaked me out big time and so i understand that perspective of not telling people certain things with my company now with hanton things are going well i'm not going to talk about it too much when things are going well shut up i think that you should shut up yeah shut up and push shut up yeah yeah so i understand that perspective but it happened to us and it it drove me crazy and i was i i have i suspect it was one of three people to this day i hold a grudge with that against all three just as preventative measures just preventative and i just stare at what they do and i'm like i'm plotting i'm plotting to a get to find out intel that they did it and b i already have my revenge plan and i'm just waiting and i check it i check what i check up on them constantly and those people probably know who they are because they see me looking at their linkedin all the time i want to like i want them to know that i see them they're like oh i love us you know keeps he always keeps tabs on me what a good guy oh i'm looking i'm looking a lot and so i have a feeling who uh who it was but can you tell me about this uh black rifle story because i have a little bit of information about them too yeah this is a kind of fun moment so we so a few episodes ago we did this what's black say what black rifle coffee is black rifle coffee it's a coffee brand so it's a coffee brand that i would describe as like it's like kind of patriotic it's like an amer it's like has an american vibe to it and um the customers are mostly middle-ish america or southern and uh they uh they they are probably right of center which is like a target it's kind of like a you know just to put it in a box which i'm sure they don't they don't love but like whatever just to for for for simplicity's sake um started by veterans i think so it has three or four three of the four guys or four of the five guys were former you know military marines whatever something like that and so they and they're hampton members by the way oh there you go and so they um so they they start this thing and there's a kind of interesting origin story to this uh it becomes a it becomes a really popular brand in fact like not only do they sell a lot of coffee um they sold enough they sell enough product that they basically they went they've gone public so uh let me see their stock as i think it's three or four billion dollar market cap still it's a little less uh now maybe the whole market's gone down so uh current market cap is 1.1 billion so they built a billion dollar ddc like a ddc brand basically consumer consumer package and you know do you know how they started one of the owners had a bunch of facebook pages i think he had like 30 facebook pages ranging like it was like for moms to like veterans and he started selling a ton of stuff he was like looking at all the stuff they were selling and they were like damn we should make our own thing and that's how the coffee business i i believe that's how it started so i did a call with him one of the one of the guys which one um richard and so yeah i think he might be in hampton too so he um he had said something slightly different he didn't talk about facebook pages he talked about youtube so he was like i was like what's your story he's like well i was like you know he's like wanted to be an actor goes to hollywood it's like whatever it's not really working out exactly great he's been in a couple things but he teaches himself to code he starts making iphone apps really early on in the iphone app store does pretty good with that ends up getting hired by verizon or something like that to do like something on the marketing side for them and um along the way he starts doing youtube fairly early on and so he's doing youtube videos and um for the brand but and also for himself like personally doing youtube videos and he starts building a pretty big youtube following and then him and his buddies start trying out different products and they're trying out you know this and that and oh should we do i don't know what the examples were but it's like you know um let's just pretend t-shirt brand and a shoe brand and let's do um you know this this thing that thing hats and then coffee was one of them and the coffee one took off and that's kind of like how they they rallied around black rifle coffee to this day i think they do like tens of millions in merch sales not the coffee but just like people love the brand so much they'll buy the t-shirts and so tens of millions of merch that there's t-shirt companies fashion companies that do tens of millions and that's their whole business this is like their their spin-off business that's like how strong the the brand is in fact when i'm on the zoom call with him his background i'll i'll put a picture up on the youtube channel but it's just like a great example of like this kind of like the subtle branding that exists today when you're on a zoom call it's like your background your clothes like says everything about you because that's how we meet now right so you can actually bring a full story in about your home and everything and he's got like you know on the wall he's got his his camo thing he's got his gun he's got his like he's got all the stuff that's kind of like that same vibe that you know like kind of uh you know the american tough guy military veteran uh you know like that sort of vibe so we're talking he's telling me this great story and um the reason why we're talking is because he's like dude i was listening to the pod and i heard you talk about the total man thing and he's like oh that's something just hit me he's like i just love that i love the total man thing i went on i saw that somebody had the domain and uh i bought it um and i was like oh cool like i didn't i was like i swear i looked at the domain wasn't available he goes oh no i bought it off somebody like i think he bought it probably like 10 or 20 grand and he's like yeah he's like i just want to gift it to you and like if you want to do something with it great like um that'd be awesome um that's a baller i hope i can write this off or something but uh you know i just wanted to do this i was like a baller move uh it's like when dharmesh i think has done that for you like on your birthday he bought you your he bought me a um like a twenty thousand dollar domain it could have been more right but it was copy that.com he bought it and so uh baller move and and i was like what resonated about the total man thing he's like i don't know man he's like i just felt like um the way you talked about like the way you and sam talked about just like look it's important to me that i like stand for something my own i live by a code um i care about fitness i care about these things um like i care about being a man and like that's important to me and like you're right that society has really like pushed this thing that is if you're trying to be a man you're it's like toxic masculinity and it's like doesn't have to be like you don't have to be a jerk or uh you know like um rude in any way but like why is it bad to like want to be manly and i think it just kind of like resonated with him and so we bought this and we got a lot of shipper that you see people some people were angry about that and that's what i think there was an understandable reason that they were angry which is we gave it and we when we were talking about it we were like you know i think you're seeing the craving for this type of content and this movement embodied in people who take an extreme version of that like andrew tate or uh stuff like that people like people just immediately they hate andrew tate so much they got blinded by rage and they're like you guys are saying entertains awesome and this total man thing is about andrew tate it's like no no i'm just saying like when you look at objectively that this guy is extremely popular he's the number one most googled man in america right now it's all under an umbrella and we're saying what is the appeal i think part of the appeal not the whole thing but part of the appeal is that this guy preaches that you need to live like a like a man and he's like you know be hard don't be soft like mentally be hard be tough uh physically be hard be fit um you know in your relations with people don't you know be a softy don't get pushed over don't keep apologizing and groveling like you know carry yourself like a man and i was like i and i was like you know what we had said was that i think the pendulum has swung too far in one direction where a lot of people are preaching like a um uh sort of like i don't know what you would call it almost like a softer sort of like a genderless like identity thing where it's you know it's not cool to be a man and i think that's building up a craving for people to want to be a man and so whatever something resonated with that he bought the domain and i was like uh yeah we should do something we should try to just make it an open source movement of and and when i mapped it out i i did a little five minute brainstorm the other day with ben and i was like yeah what is it what does the total man mean i was like this is a good this is a good little branding lesson i was like i was at first i i went down the path of like what matters to me like what matters to me is like i like to have i care about like freedom like financial freedom i care about fitness i'm trying to get more and more fit i want to be somebody who is free to move their body in certain ways and is a very fit individual um but i also care about family and whatever and i was like oh i think i just described something generic i said what's the real appeal of this total man thing it's not this well well-rounded appeals to actually nobody and i said sam said something once on the podcast that made me laugh but i kind of like i wanted to make fun of him and i also kind of liked it i was like jealous and i wanted to make fun of him at the same time what was it you you said this thing it's gonna sound so simple it's gonna sound dumb you you said it's important to you go it's important to me to be a man and i was like what what are you what are you even saying isn't that obvious you said that and you go yeah it's just important to me like to be a man and like to be like you know i don't even know how you explain it maybe you didn't even explain it that would maybe it was the beauty no i don't remember exactly but i say it to sarah all the time i go i take care of business i go we take care of our business you know like all and that doesn't mean money that means you know look i'm gonna provide emotionally uh financially spiritually i got you like we i take care of business whatever you need i got you i'll i'm here for you yeah and uh it's like i'm not gonna i'm gonna try my hardest not to get too emotional if you're emotional i'll be a rock i'll treat you with respect i'm gonna take care i'm gonna handle business that's what we do exactly and i was like i think it's more that it's basically i was like i don't think it's about this well-rounded blah blah blah because it dilutes the message well here and i also said and then you i'll let you go i said um when i like to exercise i want to be able to outrun or what did i say i said i want to either kill and eat everyone in the room or outrun them i i stole that from galloway from scott galloway don't you feel that way and i was like i don't know how to feel that way what are you talking about it's a ridiculous thought you took your most ridiculous thought and then said don't you feel that way sometimes no i've never once in my life looked around a room of men and been like i could eat and kill all these people or outrun them not once but when you said it it stuck in my head it was provocative i wanted to make fun of you but i was also like you know there is a no you know the truth in this madness and that is where a real brand is built and so that was my my little branding revelation to myself when i was doing this exercise around the what should we do with this total man domain i was like honestly it's real simple it's about being a man being it's about men who want to be be a man what does that mean we don't need to explain it it's somebody who handles their business you can come up with all the examples you want it's not a checklist that's not the total man attitude is uh having some some predefined criteria checklist no in all situations be a man about it and that's what i was like that's take care of take care of business that's the brand baby be a man about it no matter what the situation be a man about it and i was like that's the total man philosophy you could apply that to whatever situation you're going through in life but what are you going to do with it so is this going to be uh i know jesse isler who we're going to have on soon i've been emailing with him he's got this really cool thing where it's like you run up this mountain a bunch of times and that's like climbing everest that's kind of cool you i mean an event is the is the obvious one but but you can go a bunch of ways here's here's here's the idea fresh off the dome you just said what do you want to do with it you asked a great question my brain came up with an answer it's inspired by 75 hard which is also a very total exactly and it's great total men don't know it's great join movements sometimes we create them so we're going to create our own version of this and it's going to be the man month and what is the man month it's basically 30 days where you commit to to working towards being the total man in these like you know couple ways and it's like for 30 days we're doing cold shower we're doing 50 push-ups right when we wake up our 100 push-ups right when we wake up first thing it doesn't matter you're oh you're late all right you're 10 minutes more late go right oh you can't do 100 push-ups i'm waiting keep going it will stay here until you're done uh right so all right so push-ups and cold push-ups and cold i think is two we just need a third and it's going to be you do these three things you're just going to do them for 30 days straight and we're just going to harden you up it's going to harden you up a little bit and so what's the third what's the third in this thing well is this too soft you gotta you gotta you gotta tell you gotta tell the woman in your life how you feel or the man or the man in your life you gotta tell you gotta be kind you gotta tell someone how you feel it could be kind it could be oh you've been avoiding confrontation it's time to say or you gotta have a tough conversation you might have to have a conversation oh you really appreciate somebody you better show it right and so you're gonna send a message voice memo text message to your mom to your co-worker to whoever and we're gonna do that every day you gotta have a tough combo i do that every day for 30 days a tough conversation a tough shower a tough morning that's how we're doing it all right well you gotta call it total right a total conversation total one and so i think it's good i i my my feedback you need to add two more things my critique of my own thing here it's a little too easy i think it needs to be a little bit harder potentially it's got it has to be so hard that you're like oh i can't believe i'm doing like the 75 hard thing it's pretty hard and people have to look at you and be like are you nuts yeah the cold thing the cold thing you're onto something with the cold thing that is quite challenging but you got to have about you got to have a few more hard things 50 push-ups if you're fit i could do 50 push-ups in one sitting yeah uh yeah i think it's gonna be a lot more the original thing i was thinking about because i was like what would it mean because a lot of this also inspired when zuck did the murph thing and i was like whoa sucks kind of being a man right now like what's going on this is that's pretty cool could i do that i don't think i could do this i can't do a hundred pull-ups like this is something i can't do right all right so i started working towards it so the next morning i woke up and i did my little quarter murph i ran the oh he runs a mile all right i'm gonna run the quarter mile i'm gonna do a quarter of the push-ups quarter of the pull-ups quarter of the squad it's hard right run again and i'll do it again until that's easy when that's easy i'm gonna make it harder right i'm just gonna keep inching it forward until i could do the full thing and i was like yeah that's the way to go it's progress right like it's about progress and so i think you're right i think we kind of need to workshop the actual difficulty level because i think it to hit the brand right it's got to be something that other people think you're crazy for doing yeah i i think that's great it can't be reasonable you could also be a little self-serving and make it like a post on social media so you get that little hashtag going around by the way you know you got to share the results when i charge money this isn't a program you buy it's just a movement you're either in or you're out that's it that's it you're in and if you're in you got to do it if you're out day out when so i've known you for close to 10 years now did you ever think that 10 years ago you'd be about this life never never it feels good though right it feels good to be a man yes it feels good it feels good look i think it feels good i um i i agree i think it feels great i when i remember when i moved to san francisco uh san francisco uh people would make i felt really like nervous i was like people would call me a redneck because i moved from tennessee i remember when i when i first got uh like in san francisco when you moved there you'd have to interview for an apartment because they had so many applications i remember going to like one of these interviews and people being like this was in 2012 right i guess right after obama was there an election in 2012 people were like who'd you vote for they asked me who i voted for in order to like get this apartment and uh like so i was like i gotta hide like which i think we voted for obama but i had to like hide a bunch of about myself not anymore things have changed my friend this stuff is actually a lot more popular if you go to san francisco things are a lot different muscles are are not quite in but they're more in than before and fitness is more than before and hard conversations are more than before so i think it's good that you're kind of capitalizing on this we're not chasing trends here this is timeless people have been trying to be people have been trying to be hard for their whole like you know since the beginning of time uh you know in fact the only thing that turns me off is if this is a trend all right total man all right you're you're sounding harder already do you uh do you have to wrap up now i see you're looking at your phone by the way i'm gonna do my elizabeth holmes and start uh talking with a deeper voice on purpose dude people make fun of me uh on our youtube they say i've got a high voice yeah so now i'm like thinking in my head i got to talk lower too hey dude i think that's why mike tyson became mike tyson i think he had to overcompensate for his voice and just turn into an absolute savage oh so you're agreeing i have a high pitch voice it's not low oh my god that's ridiculous that is ridiculous that is ridiculous um all right that's the pod
