okay so we talked about cron art art and res carrot and lil lilia that's a stupid name you have a hundred thousand dollars to put in one which one you're gonna do all right let's take a look um it's not gonna be cron for me i'm also gonna say it's not gonna be lilia because even though i like the market for all those reasons we mentioned i don't know why this is the winning company i don't see them doing anything special and this is the what we have to tell people is once you meet the person behind it that could totally change your decision for sure right this is not based on the people at all because you could meet someone and you're like they're so formidable that's like you don't care what you sell them in right um i think if i was going to do this if i was gonna this is crazy to me that i'm even saying this but i think i would be putting it in ardent res uh i think i would put it in because i think if they can get the marketplace spun up it's going to be valuable and i think that uh this is an overlooked marketplace so so overlooked market so i like that it's a marketplace as a model not lead gen not not anything else and then on the other side i think if they can get um i have a feeling that the sort of fine art marketplace has not been affected by technology in the same way as all the other industries have and so i'm curious to see what they can do so i would bet the 100k on ardent res and i would write it off as a loss because i would assume it's going to be a loss all right i would do uh cron okay why cron um i just think it's it's super easy for them to be in default survival it's so easy um like i think that they can get to like a hundred thousand dollars in monthly revenue like really fast i think their churn might be high but i i think that it's just because of the market size and because it's an impulse buy and if this just saves you a little bit of time i i just think that they can get to 10 or 30 million dollars in recurring revenue inside three or four years with very little capital and so their default alive pretty easily and uh depending on how creative the entrepreneurs are they could expand beyond that um so i'm gonna go with cron okay i like that i don't know who would buy them though uh well like for example microsoft bought sunrise calendar i believe uh it was it was a calendar that people really liked it was a pro professional calendar and uh they got bought for i don't know how much but i know like inbox got bought for a hundred million for making a slicker inbox uh you know by google and then sort of thrown away um um sunrise got bought so so i think that there's potential for an acquisition there by one of the um you know big companies that cares about you know enterprise and productivity and whatnot so there's a there's a chance there i just want to be evil and just clone half of these things on this list yeah that's not evil that's uh that's not evil that's just capitalism but i i do like i some of these ideas i think are really stellar i don't know how it's i i can i tell you the one that i would invest in it's not even one we discussed uh i know we got to go i'll do it in 30 seconds company called duffel they're doing fast deliveries on college campuses and so that's a horrible idea but go ahead not horrible not horrible i'll tell you why what they do is they buy the popular stuff that that kids want like ben and jerry's and chips and whatnot beer they put it in an apartment and then they deliver it to you on scooter when you order it so average card is 16 they make five dollars per delivery and they're delivering in a very lightweight way uh on the same in a very tight geographic boundary so they don't have a bunch of logistical issues there's a company called puff or go puff have you heard of those guys no what's that it's this but um it's basically it's this and they're doing over 100 million dollars a year right now and they're just two kids out of i don't know penn state or something like that i don't know where they are but somewhere in middle america and so i've seen this model work i think that this is a business idea yeah puff or it's good i think the website's go puff dot com you're saying they do 100 million in sales yeah more than that i believe and so they're in you can see all the different campuses so then how profitable are they i mean i don't know all that right i don't have all their financials but i mean uh is 100 million like their net prop like they're after they pay the drive i mean or is it like where the driver gets most of money and most so they're they're at 163 million a year um is the is the thing and i don't think they even raise that much money like let me look at their fundraising for for go puff i don't think they raised too much oh no they have now raised a lot how much 866 million dollars oh you described it as two kids well it was soft bank invested in them and uh recently and is a huge round so soft bank backed up the truck in them but anyways i think this market works and i actually think it's great that soft bank backed up the truck and put the touch of death on this company if i'm duffel i uh i believe in what i'm doing there's a lot of college campuses out there to make this work
