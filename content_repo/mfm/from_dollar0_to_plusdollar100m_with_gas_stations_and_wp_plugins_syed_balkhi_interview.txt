yes in the early days i saved everything i mean i did i did not buy a bed until i got married dude just to put in perspective even when you were dating no there was no bed what up dude this is a long time in the making episode here i think we've been talking about you for like two years i think you told us you're like hey guys don't put me on blast like this uh we were like you got to come on the show you're like nah you're just gonna ask me how much money's in my pocket right now and i don't know if i want to do that but somehow some way we convinced you to come on saeed bulky you're here uh first why did you just change your mind how did you decide to come on you know i was talking with sam over twitter dm and that's how it happened well what i told you a lot of people think that sean and i are like really aggressive about questions but what they don't realize is like we'll ask an aggressive question but if you say i don't want to talk about that we just go all right cool we'll we'll move on like we don't we're not like digging that hard uh so hopefully that changed your opinion that did that did so side you're kind of an amazing guy so let me just set the table here for people let me just give you a little let me just tease everybody with the appetizer so i think you are one you've done something that i don't even know five other people on earth who have done what you've done which is that you've basically bootstrapped a unicorn you've bootstrapped a billion dollar company um you've done it you're only 32 years old so you did this by 32. you also didn't like invent the next big thing it's not like you did this because you're super genius you know you're not you didn't you're not like a you know vitalik you know creating ethereum on the blockchain or something crazy like that like you just did a very specific set of like prudent smart actions and it just added up in an amazing way we're going to talk about it um but also i didn't know about you sam's known you for a little while he brought you up on the pod a while back he goes i know this guy i met this guy he's really interesting he does this wordpress stuff have you seen him and i was like no we went to your personal website i don't know if you ever got this clip but like way back in the day we went to your personal website we were talking about you but we didn't know too much then we do camp mfm which was my basketball fantasy camp we invited like 25 other founders and we had an nba guy come basically treat us like we were you know pretend we're a pro for the weekend and uh when we were there there's so many people to get to know again i didn't really get to know everybody at the same time but then mr beast did something amazing so one night we were all in the kitchen basically we're all hungry after basketball and mr beast just sets a chair in the middle of the middle of the room and he goes i don't know who any of you guys are because he's like yeah we've just been playing basketball all day and now i'm curious like who the hell are you guys you tech nerds basically uh and he's like sit out of this chair you sit down and then he would just interrogate that person like all right what do you do who are you all right how does that work is that big what's your dream okay cool and he was like go to the next person and i think you were maybe the third or fourth person in the hot seat and i was like oh this is great i actually don't know too much of saeed's story and then you just blew us away you blew us away your story was so good mr beast was while he was interrogating you i thought um it was just like the perfect interview if we had just recorded that podcast i would have been happy so we're just going to try to recreate that moment right now well inside you you were the one of the quieter more humbler people there and probably the most impressive in terms of like traditional business accomplishments and it was very fascinating what you've done i basically heard about you through my friend neville medora and what i know about you is that you had this blog called wp beginner which wrote really uh a ton of articles some of it really simple like how do i set up a wordpress site and i think that ended up getting or it still does has a ton of traffic and then if i remember correctly and this is just from an outside perspective you'll have to tell me if i'm right or wrong you basically started buying different wordpress plugins that i imagine you saw were popular on your blog so it was like how do i set up um a form to capture emails on my wordpress blog and you probably got lots of traffic and you're like oh i should just go buy one of these or here are the best here are the five best plugins for this thing or here's the five best themes and if you put your cursor over the links on wp beginner you'll see which of the links are affiliate and i just i'm guessing that like of the top five let's say forms for wordpress based off the url you own like three of the top five and through that you've like built this into a business by the way you've never told me i'm just guessing that makes high tens of millions of dollars in revenue no no no sam not tens of not tens of millions nine figures of revenue over 100 million dollars of revenue oh i did not know that okay wow so just to paint the picture here you have uh wp engine and we'll talk about how sorry beginner so wp beginner and we'll talk about how you got to that but that's the content site that's just providing free help you know content to other people like you who are trying to make sites in the wordpress ecosystem that's the the mainstay and so i'll draw an analogy here because uh we've had andrew wilkinson on the pod i don't know a dozen times or something he's probably one of the most famous guests and most uh favorite guests of the audience uh of our community so um you have a business that's a lot like his he's got a portfolio of companies you've got a portfolio of companies he had meta lab which was kind of his like core business cash cow thing that allowed him to buy these others you had your uh your wordpress site that was the content site that was your core engine um in but i think you've actually done i think your model actually might be a little bit better that's no knock on andrew it's just to get people excited here so basically you i think have a more like one ecosystem you're like okay i'm gonna like dominate this wordpress ecosystem and the good thing is that wordpress i think powers like 30 or 40 percent of all websites so it's you know it's huge it's basically like you know a huge chunk of the internet um and then all your stuff fits together so you you know you have one customer they're trying to you know uh make a successful website and grow and and solve other problems you're like great i have the content that will help you then i have the tools that'll help you and you either buy them or you build them and you've created this portfolio that now does you know nine figures of revenue probably worth a billion dollars you own the whole thing yourself with no no outside investors you're only 32 years old uh you know you've built kind of an amazing thing so that's the just to sketch out like the blueprint here for what what you've done um sam does that you think would you add anything to that description well then there's all his side hobby stuff which like i read his annual report and he's like i bought a gas station or i bought like eight or ten gas stations so that's like a whole another conversation but yeah that that's that's let's do a quick thing on the on the origin story so that people people have it you told me once on the phone you said i think you were doing consulting or something you had like an agency you're like i was helping people make websites and i was building like crms or whatever for them and then wordpress came out i was like oh this is way better they should they should be using wordpress you started helping you just were a service agency right and then you started then wordpress became your your core service and then you're like okay i'm just going to help people make wordpress uh sites for their business is that right pretty much so remember uh the very first websites that i built were online proxies because i wanted to play games in school um and i was making ad revenue on proxies and some arcade turnkey sites and i was helping small other you know local businesses set up their websites i tried making my own cms uh with php by the way i can code i'm not the best at it i would say now i probably suck at it and what age what what what age was this 13 14 um so so i would i would build these websites super cheap call it like 250 300 i would make you a website uh back in the day and but what happened is that these clients would always rely on me to make changes to it changes to the websites and as i started doing consulting at a bigger scale um i didn't want to do these uh the small and small and things so and i discovered wordpress around this time this was 2006. uh and i said wordpress was only in inception for three years so wordpress started in 2003 so i discovered it in 2006.

to put in perspective i've been i'm 32 now i've been in wordpress half of my life you know this is the result is compounding in one thing for half of my life by the way you're 13 14 doing this are you like at the dinner table at night being like ah my clients are painting the ass right now mom like you know what are you saying at home and also how are these people finding you are they coming to your middle school and you're handing out flyers what's going on no no no so we moved from pakistan to us when i was 12. okay my dad had a mechanical engineering degree but it did not validate when he came to us so he was working 16 hours a day as a gas station clerk attendant you know just swiping things 16 hours a day kid you not every day monday to friday and on the weekend he had his third job so i didn't really see my dad uh my mom was busy because there's three of us and the fourth one on the way right so my youngest brother was born in us so there was not many dinner conversations happening um i wanted to figure out a way to have some chunk of change in my pocket so i can buy junk food like mountain dew and kitkat and sneakers and all all the that you buy when you're in high school dude your dad was at the gas station man you had the hookup you just uh you just needed to ask he was he was not cutting you any any breaks there he's like no way no way my dad would never do that by the way you went to high school at age 12 also right yeah i started so i moved here i had just finished seventh grade in pakistan and i came here in march so there's this two month gap the school system is like well we can put you in eighth grade worst case scenario you'll repeat eighth grade because that's where you're supposed to be in anyways but our education system in pakistan is far better than the one we have here in us so they're like you can go to high school so i'm like 12 in high school the youngest person in school i did not speak english that well um i would say probably very little english with i knew how to read english because we were thought alphabets and such but my communication skills were not there um so yeah that was that was a pretty challenging time for me and i spent most of the time in the library during lunch time i was in the library and i wanted to play games because i'm like i can't talk to humans so i would just play on the computer and those game sites were blocked i'm like how do you unblock this thing and that you know drove me down in terms of how i was getting clients it was through these forums online right so you had forums like dn forum digital point name pros bunch of these you know og communities online where you can get you know business and my cousin got me into one of those they don't know you're 13. you're just a guy in a forum no yeah well like so we had like a family friend who needed a website and you know they had a bit local business they knew how old i was and they're like oh you can do it and i'll pay you 300 to build my website i'm like okay sounds good and then you know that that's how that that funnel started so you're doing sites you're trying to make your own cms you discover wordpress you're like oh this is way better here's a cms out of the box uh what's what becomes the aha moment and uh when do you create the blog so had i had discovered wordpress moved these clients over i had affiliate sites i was doing affiliate promos at the time i was discovering this um i had directories that i was telling you about earlier that um so i wanted to get more traffic so i had these i created these myspace profiles they were fake profiles um and got hundreds of thousands of followers and i would send both you know dm's equivalent which were called bulletins on myspace right so i just wanted more traffic and i went down the rabbit hole of seo which brought me to wordpress and and then because wordpress was dynamic content so i added the blogs to the directories started using wordpress for the clients and i had these social media profiles on dig and stumble upon that were superpower users and such and essentially when i wanted to get rid of this business the consulting business i wanted to figure out how how do you do this i asked other agency owners and they're like well you know we just have these pdfs that we give to our clients and i'm like but wordpress updates all the time how do you keep those pdfs updated and they're like oh no we uh we update the pdfs i'm like that's dumb you should use wordpress to update those documentation so essentially wc beginner started that way it was the unofficial documentation for wordpress now wordpress had documentation but it was it was written for developers by developers nothing was for business owners and begin what year was this 2009 well one good point here is that that's now six years after wordpress started and you're making the beginner site and there really wasn't a great one most people i think uh there's a lesson i've seen many many times as we talk to different guests which is and sometimes you feel like you're late but you're rarely ever actually late to the wave and uh kevin van trump told us this one time he goes for all the best things you always get us that was a second turn to get on the train like uh you feel like you're late you feel like you missed it but often uh you're not you're not that late actually don't talk yourself out of it there's there's almost always another another another chance to hop on it look according to similar web right now you get like two or three million visits a month the early website shockingly doesn't look significantly different than how it looks now you kind of nailed it right out the gate it's like it was a simple website um where you just have articles about picking the right name how to install wordpress selecting the right theme picking the right web hosting but were you writing this stuff because i know you're in english as a second language person so were you are are you actually writing these articles because a lot of them are long like look 55 of the most wanted wordpress tips tricks and hacks yeah like these are like pretty like in-depth articles as well as you're playing the game of seo and like you clearly understand like english yeah no by by this time i was already in college right so i i started high school at 12 started college at 16.

by that time my english had gotten uh much much better so i was writing uh these articles on wp beginner i had a team um of two other people that were helping me uh with with with the website the website looks similar now and what it was in 2009 there was a period when but i changed it and that was a mistake people you know i changed the color scheme too much and the audience were like they didn't resonate with it so i changed it all back uh and haven't changed it since then because the big lesson was you know big companies don't really change their stuff because they know if it's working don't you know break it if it's not broke don't fix it don't interrupt compounding unnecessarily as charlie munger says so i made it go back to what it looks like and it's been that way since 2012. and what tools do you use to figure out because i i imagine most of these articles are you're writing them based off of what people are searching for is that right yes uh it's a combination of that and what they're asking us through our contact form what they're asking us in our facebook group i think our facebook group has probably over 90 000 members um and support requests are coming so yes we have our own keyword generator if you go on wp beginners kind of hidden on the free tools page is a keyword generator and you can put in anything in there like wordpress and it will tell you what people are searching for um and you have a lot of comments early on june on in 2010 a year or two after starting you already had 26 responses on just i just clicked on a random article so you're like getting traction yeah so a couple things happened that that worked out for me one do you guys remember dig.com yeah it was it was really popular so i had a power user profile there so what i like if one out of two articles that i would submit would hit the front page so of course i used that to my benefit and i used that network to my benefit how did you get a power user profile because uh there was there was legitimate ways and illegitimate ways to do that i'm curious how did you end up having that it's just a social circle right so there's these engagement pods that you go on and back back in the day was on msn messenger and well um aim so so we just had the engagement pods so if i submit something like you know it was a group chat and everybody would jump dump their items in there and you would upload it so so yeah it was the engagement pod and and what year did this did wp beginner cross a million in revenue in annual revenue how long did it how long did that take maybe a year and a half or so oh damn you crushed it right away yeah yeah so you know we had a good revenue stream so let's let me take a step back so there was this business and the listicle business so collectively passed a million in a year and a half so about 2011 2012. and so your early 20s uh basically at that stage you're a millionaire um that was my first million how does that feel you said you grew up your parent you know your dad worked you told me you were like yeah my dad worked at a gas station and i thought pakistan guy says gas station i know you own gases i was like oh so your family owned gases you go no no he sat in the gas station he swiped the cards in the gas station uh and you were like everybody in my family i knew you were either you worked at a gas station or you're like oh you're you're real smart like you get to be a bank teller and that's all you knew in your bubble so tell me two things how did you get because you got to kind of see the possibility of being a business person of being wealthy before you're going to even do it uh so how did that happen and how did it feel when like the name of the podcast my first film i'm curious how did it feel when that first happened what was do you remember your reaction yeah so i'll tell you how it how i knew it was possible so i used to play cricket which if you have a lot of listeners in pakistan and india you know they love cricket we love i love cricket so i was playing cricket and there are many leagues in us in south florida there was one and there's many now too i met this pakistani gentleman and he was the sponsor for our team he's a crazy cricket fanatic and he became my mentor and now he's a family friend um but back then i just see this pakistani guy you know driving a s class and you know just super humble super nice and i'm like what do you do are you like born into money or what's it what's your spiel i was pretty blunt as a kid um so so he's like no i have real estate i came to the us with like 500 in my pocket or 100 in my pocket you know those typical immigrant story um and then he you know after we would win the games he would take us out to eat sometimes he'll invite us all to his house which is like you know big mega mansion right you know 15 18 000 square foot house um and his kids were my age so we'll just kind of go over to his house hang out sometimes we would go over to his house to watch cricket games because they're happening on the other side of the world so time zones are different and in between breaks i was the one who took interest in his business you know and his kids were all roaming around i was i'm like tell me how this works tell me how this works right so he would tell me stories like oh this is how i took over a burger king for free or this is how i did this and this is how i started so i i absorbed a lot of the earlier lessons on business finance just hustle from him right and he was always super encouraging he'll ask me how's how is this going how you know and i felt like i could talk to him about it so that's that was the early stage of me knowing oh this is possible because nobody in my family um had any any wealth uh they were just working at gas stations all my uncles everybody and if you're really smart you're working at the teller at the bank um so so that was the motivation part in terms of how it felt when i hit my first million you know you would think it'd be like the joyous moment of oh my god look at this i was more scared than than uh than anything because i was is this gonna is this gonna last that's the question that you have you know in your 20s you're like you come from nothing and you have this thing you're like is this going to last forever like what what is the what am i supposed to be doing i have no guidance so there was like this inherent fear so i always lived below my means like way way way below my means so when i was in college i uh i did not buy any furniture i just slept on a on a floor on a blanket because i mean that's how i grew up in pakistan so i'm just like i'm not gonna buy any furniture why why waste time and money with this so in my in my apartment i had a blanket and i got a desk from goodwill so that's what i worked on and and i mean what's amazing is you said i would have thought the first million came sooner than 2012 but because in 10 years you've grown that from one to 100 plus or whatever it is when were the inflection points where you were like all right blogging is cool and it's working yes uh let's get beyond yeah so i launched opt-in monster in uh 2013 list 25 and 2011 um these things started really cranking i had some really sweetheart affiliate deals with certain companies um that worked out really really well for me and so that was good in that time you know we were coming out of the economy the recession so there's still like some real estate deals to be had so i bought my gas station the first one primarily because i wanted to offset uh offset expenses with an appreciating asset which was a lesson i learned from my mentor right yeah let's let's let's talk about that one real quick so just do a quick quick little monologue on why did you buy a gas station when you found out you were having a kid so one of the things i learned from my mentor early on i was like how do you how do you like justify buying a mercedes because that's a depreciating asset and he's like yeah but you know when i drive in this people think of me better like you know there's the impression game etc and how i justify it is i buy something that's an appreciating asset like real estate and i just use the income from that to off pay my lease payment so my principal never disappears and i was like that's a good idea your principal continues to appreciate and you're using something uh you know the income from it to offset and it also helps you stay disciplined because you're not gonna go you know overspend your money because normally when you get a raise or something like this everybody just thinks in monthly payments so this takes you away from that monthly payments mindset into thinking a little bit bigger so when i was about to have my son uh i was 26 by this time guys like i was i was doing all right you know i i had all these vc firms reaching out to me you know i i could i could have had a a solid eight figure exit like you know to a high eight figure exit i had offers for that at the time and i'm just like high eight figures as in as a 90 as in 70 at the time 70.

for the for wp beginner no no no i had opt-in monster at the time and i had uh uh the gallery solution at the time and i had uh i had wb forms i had analytics so were you close to taking it and how did you decide not to yeah i i i definitely thought about it but then i was like what would i do afterwards like my son is gonna you know grow up seeing me not work because i'm like i'll be set with that money right like i would not i would not go do anything if you i mean if you have 10 million dollars 20 million dollars you put it in the bank and you're like hey this this is it i want it you're gonna have a lot more yeah i was gonna have a lot more than that that's that's what i'm saying even after paying taxes i i would have a lot more than i would be set so the the the factor that my wife and i talked about was what instilled my work ethic was watching my dad work and i wanted my son to at least see that right what was the what was the multiple on that for to get to 70 million is it as high as 10x multiple at that time um no it it was lower than that so so you turned that down and i turned that down you turned it down was it really you've turned it down because you were like i want my son to see me work yeah and also i didn't i wasn't ready to give up my baby okay and uh okay so fair enough so you you um basically so here's the thing so so at this time my son is about to be born and i'm like okay how much does a baby cost right like what what are the causes of the baby and you're like okay well you know you're gonna have diapers you're gonna have you know schooling and this and that and i'm like well now what if i buy something that gives me at least five or six grand a month and that and that um and then the baby costs are covered first so like you know it's gonna give me 60 to 70 000 a year um and now i don't have to think about it and my family is taken care of no matter what happens to me so yeah that's that's that's what i i got for a baby shower most people take the money they make and then they're like all right that's what i have to spend and they spend it what you do from your mentor is you take the money you make that has to now go to buy an appreciating asset that will spit off cash flow you and then you could spend whatever that one makes so it's kind of like a a savings program basically um so you you spend what the you go by the gas station the gas station's gonna pay you and you're like that will pay uh for this child you know like i'm gonna provide my i'm not gonna provide my for my family this gas station is gonna provide for my family i'm gonna put food on the table dude it allows me to one sleep better at night and to be more bullish in the deals that i'm doing how many gas stations you own now 10. and you own a bank too i bought a bank yes it was fargo well as far because i you have a cool blog post where you're like uh i used to go to this bank all the time and i decided to buy it this year yeah i used to ride my bicycle around it i couldn't go to the bank i didn't have a bank account at the time i used to ride my bicycle around the bank because there was a sports authority there an office depot there i just like ride my bike into that and then i bought that building what amazes me is is how like i don't know if your similar web estimates are right but can do you say what your monthly traffic is on wp beginner no but you know it's in the millions okay so let's just let's just assume that similar web is roughly correct two to five million we'll give a huge range a month that's a lot that's not that much like what's crazy to me is that i mean that's high intent traffic it's likely people who are coming for to buy something like they want to in the email software so they're coming for a review it's just amazing to me that that much traffic has created so much value i think when you start um your online business most people think about maybe a cpm model of monetization or a cpc model of monetization there is far there are other and better models of monetization right um you can have cpls you can have cpa you can have a combination of cpl cpa you can have recurring you know uh commission you're talking about uh cpm meaning just uh third ten dollars per 1000 visitors for a display ad versus cost per lead or cost per acquisition which is someone buys something they give you a hundred dollars per month if it's a mailchimp and it's someone's paying 500 a month they'll say all right you get a hundred dollars per month while they're a customer correct and there are verticals that are not available on wc beginner because remember i was telling you i did a lot of affiliate marketing as well um there are verticals that will pay you on a lead basis and hundreds of dollars just for a lead not for not for a commission like as an affiliate not like you made a sale just a lead will get you hundreds of dollars and and so so i did a lot of those um and i still do so that that's that's a good cash cow um so those verticals are available where you can go and promote something and get over 100 in a lead has the wp beginner revenue grown like the rest of the business or is that just like you're like i'm i'm perfectly fine with it just being a steady 10 or 15 million dollar a year thing and i use i bet you it's super profitable i'm looking at your team page i would bet you make 50 profit or something crazy and you're like i'm just going to take that profit and buy more stuff and i'm okay with that being steady pretty much you know on a content business you cannot compound it as much you know eventually what what happens is you will hit the traffic mass that you hit um and you can unlock as many levers as you can but the compounding will stop because it's a reoccurring revenue you know like the person that i referred this year to something is not going to compound next year i'm not going to get that plus new customers which is what happens in a software business which is recurring revenue so yes your assumption is right that while wp beginner has grown it hasn't grown at the same pace as the software companies and that's like a very big you know mental shift in between recurring revenue and reoccurring revenue for all the creators that are listening um because once you understand that you'll start thinking about your business a little differently so i i took all of our profits and invested in um you know software in tools i i still have niche tools that are not even related to wordpress um that i bought off of flipper and sometimes just private outreach because i knew those verticals were going to be lucrative because i had a better offer than they were promoting and i paid like one guy i think like 15 000 up front and in the very first month it made me 18 grand and now every month it makes me over 10 grand like and it's pure profit nobody touches that tool right so i think about that just as good as a gas station because like my hosting cost for that tool is maybe like eight dollars a month right maybe 10 um and and that's it so so you can have these cash flow income streams that come through and that's how i was able to buy the businesses that i did without any outside financing without any outside debt i was also in a market that wasn't fully mature so so like there was that advantage that you know those shrewd pees and vcs are not in in the market they didn't understand the market um and i could see what the potential of a business so i might buy something and you're you're saying well this has no revenue it just has user base and i can come in and say yeah but if i do this and this it can it can be a seven figure business so i might buy something for like you know six figures and then in two years that thing will make seven figures in profit you told me something once that sounded almost like a real estate um philosophy so like in real estate they always say uh some people say you make money on the buy not on the sell meaning like you should buy something knowing that it has both a margin of safety and that you have the plan for what it's gonna how it's gonna be different than what the current owner values it at and i think you had a similar thing i forgot what the example was but it was sort of like uh like let's say for example you're like great i buy this company and they're paying three and a half percent on their payment things but i have a contract with that same payment provider because i have more scale that's at two percent so now i know i have 1.5 off just off the gross from day one because i i have this contract uh and you kind of have these this principle of like almost like you make the money on the buy because you already know well i have i know i can throw this much traffic at it maybe from wpp beginner i know i can renegotiate these payment terms because i already have the contract with the paper writer or the affiliate contracts with the companies on the other side is that uh is that accurate 100 100 so this was one of the lessons i learned from from my mentor right if and who had the real estate background so the philosophy is very much derivative of real estate you make money on the buy you have to be otherwise if you're paying a high multiple thinking based on future i mean yeah that might work out but it has a bigger risk so from my perspective you know i want to have heads i win tails i don't lose much and i got that you know formula from reading monish bobry's book was huge fan of his now we're friends um but but yeah so that's very much finding margin of safety explain that more heads i win tails i don't lose much um what what does that mean and what's an example so a good example would be that if if a business in your perspective intrinsic value of it is a million dollars and you end up paying 700 000 today heads you know you're gonna win if this business continues growing tails you know you you still have so much of upside that you know because you you pay 300 grand less 30 less than market value um that in case something don't doesn't go right it has to be like 40 doesn't go right and you still only lose 100 grand in that situation so you need to be able to look at the deal and say what are my downsides you have to invert the situation um think about like how are you going to die in this and then don't go there sort of thing our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better you sort of have this like pay attention to the sense and the dollars will follow type of vibe where like you're really not you're not i guess i'm surprised at how maybe i don't know if it's still the same way i'm surprised at how small some of the things that you do and yet because you own 30 or 40 of them they're really accumulating exactly so dude when you come from nothing you have you have to have a good sense of where the money is going to go right and you have to be very conservative to not lose it all because i came from nothing i don't want to go back to that so i i'm very very cautious the funny thing about compounding is that if you compounded a healthy rate and i i have a very very good compounding track record what what is it i've been compounding it in double digits in for for past seven eight years what's that mean 20 like what would what would be considered good like you know like for for you you're like all right 30 or 40 that's like i mean that's amazing you can't get that in any normal investment right exactly so market compounded about eight percent yeah um private equity might get might get you in teens right you know i i'm way way i'm double private equity more than double so so that's and that only happens when you can identify a mismanaged gem okay um when some somebody has a has a business and they might only be thinking about monetizing monetizing from one angle they're not thinking about it from a full perspective so i can look at it and say well yes this is the current revenue today and i'm getting a bargain on today's revenue but here are my contracts that i have with so many different partners and vendors and such that i'll be able to unlock extra revenue here here here here here so i turned this business that has one revenue stream to having like multiple revenue streams um and and that's how you take something that was doing like no revenue to or or very little revenue to having you know five eight ten million dollars in revenue um and you do it enough times and you just let it compound like these businesses are not rocket growth right so this is not a um business that's gonna hit one business gonna hit billion dollar in revenue that's not what's gonna happen but these businesses are gonna consistently compound because more people are gonna need websites um the web presence just keeps growing you had a tailwind which was wordpress was just gonna keep getting more and more and more popular right that's a huge tailwind that's like a generational tailwind that's huge this is already it's gonna grow faster than like an average growth rate because of that then you can do things smart operationally but i gotta ask you a question so our buddy moiz has this phrase he goes the two sexiest words in the english language are distressed asset have you just said mismanaged gems as a as a catchphrase of something you look for i like that idea but also i'm kind of a lazy motherfucker and when i hear distressed asset or mismanaged gem i think work oh i gotta go clean up i gotta manage this better um isn't that gonna take a bunch of work and a bunch of mind share to turn things around versus it's kind of like the buffett cigarette butt companies versus like just buying a beautiful business that's already working and letting it letting it grow for a long period of time um am i wrong i must be wrong about the the amount of effort that goes into fixing a mismanaged gem or a distressed asset what do you think about that so i think distressed asset from a real estate perspective i would say slightly different than what a mismanaged gem is my real estate buys sean that i did uh in in early days were distressed assets okay um but it was just the banks needed to get get this off their books right and i was a cash buyer um you know i'm not looking to finance anything i'm a cash buyer i had the right contacts so i was able to buy some of those gas station properties they were already leased out to uh tipperland leased out to like kustard the canadian multi-billion dollar company that owns circle k all i had to do was just give cash the bank and take take the you know deed over so those are distressed assets and i got lucky i mean i bought a gas station um but it was all said and done i paid 90 grand for it and you're like holy crap how'd you do that uh that was a distressed asset because you had to do environmental cleanup on that thing okay that was work so so those are distressed assets when you're thinking about a mismanaged gem um this is a property where somebody maybe due to the lack of effort or lack of experience you know what you're thinking about what you're thinking about what you're thinking about what you're thinking about what are the commonalities of not realizing potential or common mistakes so you know you might you might be a creator and you have a lot of user base and you just haven't think about monetization from you know all the different potential monetizations that that that can be had in that one business we have a friend that was doing this they were just looking at businesses on flippa or like you know websites uh you know products to buy companies to buy and they were like yeah i just want an owner who just cared a lot about product and cared to thought 95 of their brain just had the word product stamped all over it and then you're like cool so what were you doing for marketing and they're like well it's word of mouth and they were so proud of the word of mouth he's like great as long as their answer isn't facebook ads then i'm just going to start doing facebook ads or even if their answer was facebook guys like what's the budget like oh you know like eight grand a month it's like why eight grand that's like uh you know i don't want to spend too much and he's like i want to spend 80 grand on facebook you know like and basically that was his entire like you think oh this person made 20 million dollars wow they must be a genius and it's like no i just found a business which was so common somebody makes a product and all they think about is product and they really care about product they don't spend much on marketing it maybe none because they don't know it or a small amount because they're just kind of like they don't think what like they don't ask themselves the question why don't i spend 10 times more on facebook ads what would that take and that's literally the only change that they did that's a good barometer the other thing that that worked in our favor was the ecosystem effect so if i buy an analytics software i can cross sell opt and monster and vice versa you know if i if i buy member press then i know that all the people who are creating a course will need to buy opt and monster to have lead generation or it will need analytics to track all the things so the synergy effect uh compounds and and that that was a big uh big up for us and i read somewhere that you said something like i don't buy whole stakes anymore i don't buy 100 of the company anymore i try to buy 49 because i can't i have too many things i can't run all of them and then in the pre-call that you did with sean you have this really cool line it's in quotes it says how i manage a billion dollar portfolio without stressing out and uh that's my quote by the way he didn't say that was sean who wrote that oh really well when i met him he was like he said something like you were like i travel i was like what are the you know what do you do with your time like how are you spending your time and you were like oh i love to travel my family we go travel and i was like i thought you meant like you know like i don't know la or you know like we go to see the graham canyon and you were like we're going to egypt and then we're going to like the serengeti and we're going like i was like oh okay this guy's like doing like exotic travel every month that's cool he you said something like i don't know if this is exactly right but my brain heard you basically stack a bunch of calls with your kind of operators in the last week of the month and like that's your only time to like stress out or think about like those calls and then the rest of the month you're not thinking about those things you're reading you're playing basketball you're doing other things and um so a is that accurate and b like i interpreted that as wow this guy's managing a billion dollar portfolio and he's not stressed out that's awesome yes that is that is fairly accurate now now it didn't start that way i want to i want to emphasize that it didn't start that way um i didn't figure this out up until maybe two years ago okay so just just to put in perspective uh in in terms of like me being as chill what was like what were you doing before that you know i would have to go in sometimes clean the business and you know like oh this this is not doing right i would get get involved too much were you a hard ass yeah depending on who you ask yeah sure according to me no according to everyone i ever worked with hell yeah like you you seem like you have a ruthless side to you even though you're polite and kind you seem like you could be ruthless i i would say i could be very disciplined uh ruthless might not be the right word did that sound so ruthless the way you said that that was awesome yeah that's a ruthless thing to say that's a ruthless thing to say i loved it so so the trick is you know like people say hire good people get out of the way but that sounds easier than it is so we use eos in our companies and some of your audience might be familiar with it others might not be it's entrepreneurial operating system um and adds transparency and accountability and then you know that now they're like they're really checked out so now they're like ah this this thing sucks now i'm back into business and it's a mess and they will come and exit to us that's a mismanaged gem by the way because all what you got to do is put back those accountability things and maybe put a right team member and this will this will start uh kickstarting again so you have to delegate but not abdicate so the eos scorecards and good pnls uh monitoring will help you with the accountability piece so the pnls for all of our companies um are managed by my finance team at the hq level that's cool so you um i want to talk a little bit about ideas so uh you built this amazing thing uh and you've been basically kind of like building cool stuff making money since 12 to 32. so you've had this run um i'm curious you know one of the questions we always get is all right well you know now it's easy for you it's easy for you to just keep doing what you're doing but like i'm not you so that's you know it's inspiring but it's not entirely helpful uh what would be more helpful is like what ideas or opportunities do you see that like somebody else could do you're too busy to do them or they're too too small for you now um what ideas or opportunities do you see that other people could do i think about cash flow so if i had nothing you know of course it's a lot easier for me now i can say hey andrew i want to spend i want to invest in tiny i want to go do this and i can do a lot of those with the means that i have now but if i was starting all over the first thing would be to go build cash flow again and the easiest way to build cash flow is services um you know agency business right now uh content agency since i know content well using ai i would crush it you know because i already know that brands like shopify etc are using ai agencies to create top of the funnel content of course there's some human editing involved but this changes the game because if an article used to take maybe four hours to write now you can do it in 45 minutes right because you if if you know the game right so a hustler younger version of me that's what i'd be doing content agencies copywriting agencies all ai powered plus human review i would i would use like tools like clay.com i'm not sure if you if you've seen clay.com but it it helps you automate your sales outreach you dump a profile and it finds all the data on on on that person you can write you can use gpt to write emails to them and then just hit them up right just cold outreach cold outreach cold outreach because something like not everybody but a small portion will you know take take you up on it deliver a great service go above and beyond with them watch the word of mouth take you places you raise prices um and i think that's uh that would be the way to go for me if i if i wanted to start all over again step one build cash flow then figure out how i can take this cash flow to build some recurring revenue stream because in agency you're you still only have reoccurring revenue stream and so uh then you would uh would you buy versus build from there and talk about that distinction because you started off as a builder you've now bought like i don't know 30 companies or something like that along the way and i think you studied not just charlie munger and warren buffett but also um mark leonard at constellation and you had told me something like you read all his annual letters and there was one thing in there that really stood out to you about building versus buying what was that yeah it was one of his earlier letters maybe maybe like a third one or fourth one or something something like that um where mark talked about that there was three types of growth that constellation was experiencing one was growth through organic which is just your business growing organically in their case maybe seven eight percent whatever um the second part of revenue growth was coming from acquisitions um where they would just go buy revenue and the third one was initiatives and initiatives would be things like new bills i have this product now i'm going to build a second product and he was like these turned out to be very expensive because it required more resources in time that you plan for it takes away time of your senior people um and you're not even counting those things so they're distracted and he's like you know i'm a capital allocator and from a pure capital allocation perspective the return on invested capital isn't always great because bills have higher risk so if it doesn't work out it's crap um for the first year or so when you're building there's zero percent return on your investment in that time so the compounding return is lower um and this this was my take was you know you can have ad spend of three years cac at that point might not just go buy a company that has guaranteed revenue and then you can cross promote so so that sort of took me away from the initiatives idea so most of our focus and all of our focus is on um is on buying one thing that i i imagine sean is a little bit like this but i'm definitely like this where creating products and uh new businesses is part self-expression where like it's just exciting it's fun to do that and i'm not like the most disciplined person when like the reason i don't like real estate is i'm like dude i i i'm not very great at just looking at this excel sheet and unlocking value like that's not that's not what i'm skilled at and i don't know if i even particularly like that where did you learn how to like unlock like find value that you could unlock and what are some of the like common themes that you see uh with that i don't know sean are you like that too yeah i am uh but then i'm also a short a natural short cutter i like to find the simplest path to the solution and that so like while creating like you you had this thing you said on the pod that was hilarious you're like i'm an artist bro i'm just an artist i gotta create and i definitely feel that i have a creative itch to me but i also have a uh path of least resistance itch to me where i'm like oh there's some beauty in just finding a simpler a simpler way to win um you know like i agree with that i also think it's fearful it's it's fear to outlay to pay like with the internet you could start with nothing and spend time and you can get something but i think that's or you could he's like you could build something new high chance is just not going to work it's a zero it's also going to take a long time if you're buying something that's already working yes you outlay cash but are you actually taking more risk there's a difference between putting out cash and putting out risk and i think what he's saying is that but that's what i'm asking is the difference i'm asking the difference between putting out cap like how do you make that gap small so i'll say this so when i started sam i was very much an artist like you i enjoyed my creation i enjoyed putting my you know fingerprint footprint whatever you want to call it on those so when if you were looking at the early days of optin monster or those products you would have my footprint on them and you had like a twenty thousand dollar bill to the serengeti with your family of five no they're like i i was not doing serengeti when i was building the business you know i'm not doing serengeti when i was building the business i was very very much involved but a big mindset shift that happened in my career which has led to i would say tremendous growth for awesome motive is the mindset of going from a creator and operator to a capital allocator right and this happened when i was studying uh buffett munger uh monish etc buffett says i'm a better investor because i'm a businessman and i'm a better businessman because i'm an investor now you you read that and you're like okay it sounds good cute right but when you think about that from a first principles point of view what's the commonality between the two is that both investors and the businessmen are resource allocators or capital allocators so when you can when you tie that together that was the aha moment for me when i think about okay if i start this new thing yes i'll make x but if i buy something if i if i shortcut it and let's say i buy something that's doing two million dollars in revenue i you know 20 or 30 of two million is always going to be better than you know 10 or 30 of 100 000 or 100 of 100 000 for that matter you see what i'm saying what's the biggest what's the biggest deal that you've bought you don't just say which one but like uh what checks out what check made you sweat what check made me sweat none of them because i'm not buying like i'm not putting 80 of my net worth or my cash in any any one of those deals but have you bought things for tens of millions no no i have not bought anything in the tens of million dollar range but these are so single digit millions and then do you do millions single that is insane that you've built that much value with like these little small like what's that whatever sean said the cigarette butts like you've made the cigar with it but um and are you doing all cash up front or i there's no way you do that you're you're you're way too sophisticated mostly mostly all cash up front you do do that there there might be some pieces of like seller financing but one one of the advantages that that we have uh compared to somebody offering like a higher valuation is that we can make the process really seamless for for the seller um that also allows us to have get get a better and a more attractive valuation um but you know you if you try to ever sell to like a private equity or a vc mostly private equity you you'll be on on the hook for like six months they'll be dragging you asking you for all sorts of nonsensical stuff and by the time the entrepreneurs just burned out and it's just a shitty feeling um with us you know you send you send me a message over the website my assistant source through it i'll look at it and say okay yeah this is good um we will like look at it and ask you for the pnls within like a week or week or so time we'll give you an loi and then we can close in 30 40 days after that holy are you the only decision maker yes that's insane i i like to think that i'm the chief risk officer of the company you told me a story about risk you because i was like okay you buy all this stuff um like how much debt do you have you're like no debt and you're buying you know with a margin of safety and you're like even with his mortgages he says no mortgages no mortgages and and look like there's gonna be a lot of financially savvy listeners here and i have many many financially savvy friends who are billionaires uh and they disagree with me on this you know but but the way i was raised in and in pakistani culture debt is considered bad it's considered taboo and short leverage can help you grow faster especially when you use in a smart way but it also takes away the margin of safety which in troubled times can really destroy your autonomy if you're not being careful so you know i'm okay with getting rich slowly um and i think i've done all right for where i am i see myself as a turtle in a rabbit race bro you're a 32 year old like pretty much billionaire dude yeah you didn't go that slow you know in 60 years i think i'll be okay um it helps me sleep better at night be more bullish i don't know sean sam do you know about uh charlie and more and start business partner no no tell the story see nobody knows about the third business partner um so they did have a third business partner uh his name was uh rick right rick warren or something like this and he was just as smart as them but was in a hurry to get rich and monish asked warren about what happened to rick at one of the lunches that he he had and this is public i'm not sharing with you anything warren's like rick's a no no no warren said warren said something along the line with like charlie and i always knew that we would become like you know incredibly wealthy but we were just not in a hurry to get wealthy we knew it would just happen rick was just as smart as us but he was in a hurry so like in the 70s like 73 74 downturn what ended up happening was that rick had margin loans he was highly levered and the stock market went down 70 so all those margin calls happened and he had to sell his berkshire shares to warren and warren bought him for like 40 bucks a piece right so now the same share is like half a half a million plus i'm gonna get a framed picture of this guy rick on my wall and it's just gonna be a reminder every day don't be in a hurry to get rich it'll happen don't don't be in a hurry i that's going on my wall uh sean i cut you off what were you gonna ask him um i wanted him to tell that story but also i wanted to go back to ideas so you had given us the first move uh if i needed a cash flow right away i would do service agency maybe something around creating content for brands using and use ai for leverage or generating leads for brands and create a lead agency using ai for leverage um okay that's the get started plan but you don't want to be in the service business forever and you want to you want to get that's just the get you know the escape from broke jail prep plan okay now you've done that what are what's kind of like level two type of ideas or opportunities you see i i would look into the quick cash cow of tools right now they are these ai wrappers right so you think like upload your pdf and we'll turn this into a chat gpd there's several of those out there right now but you can make it vertical focused that's what i would do i'd like chat gpd for lawyers add all of your internal sops and now your team can just talk to it um real estate internal processes you can do this my team built this internally in about a week so it's not very hard to build you can pay some money somebody on upwork to do it and then work with the different uh ai influencers on tick tock ig etc and this can easily get you to 10k plus a month i know as a matter of fact like several kids that are making 10k over 10k a month and some even over 100k a month uh doing justice just the ai wrappers so i think that's uh that's that's pretty easy um i would i would look at how i can um leverage the freedom of information act to my advantage um trying to go into the student businesses are you familiar with foia no what is that okay so basically in the united states this works only if you're in the united states we have such thing called a freedom of information act that allows you to request any kind of data from any government run you know authority so usually journalists use it so we use it at the hustle all the time so like when big stories break oftentimes it's because the journalists did that and they like uncovered some you know controversial fact so now now you can you can get creative with it right so you can you can go and say um to a government agency maybe a university or whatever uh hey i want to see the contracts of your last three or five construction projects that you undertook um and that that will give you an advantage um in terms of how to approach terms and pricing that was approved before so when you're submitting your bid it's it's better so but you can get really creative uh like that i remember i was talking this this was a while ago um i was talking to a guy uh he was in atlanta area and he would request student informations from universities so public universities um and he was targeting like nursing school graduates and so on if you were coming out of nursing school you know he he wanted your information then schools have to give it to you and you might pay them like a processing fee of like hundred dollars or something like that but you get the whole graduating classes name email address that you know their physical address that the university have in file they give they give that to you um and then he would send those students an affiliate offer for student loan forgiveness program that was passed under the obama administration right and so the affiliate offer was for a company that would fill out those forms for you right and they would charge charge you like i don't know 500 600 bucks and they would pay this guy and he was like i just send one email i make six figures number one so i would find arbitrage opportunities like these to build up more cash flow um and then i would go invest so but you know sam when you when you're talking about in the earlier days you're very focused on the wc beginner but there was a lot of creative things that were happening like this that was helping my cash flow um grow uh and that allowed me to invest in software or some fun creative cash flow things you were doing at the time i'm not going to talk about this there's got to be one prolific one that that is i've heard a bunch through friends of friends i'm not going to mention any of them but i've heard i've heard some of your thing i mean like the space that you're in everyone starts sometimes black hat gray hat and then as you like start making real money you're like all right i gotta go legit uh but i've heard some crazy stories about what you used to do that's good yeah justin marys had a good phrase he goes uh do whatever you got to do to make your nut and then go on your noble mission and um and i was like i don't know if i agree with that but i like the way you said it um let me put it that way and i know several people who have done that where it's like okay what were you doing before this oh i was running um you know this dating dating site affiliate you know affiliate ad network it's like okay cool plenty of fish like you know this is not really where you want to hang out for too long or like these poker uh you know poker arbitrages poker affiliates uh there's one guy selling ringtones with subscriptions there's a guy who emailed me that was like i think he said you could say this on the pod he's like yeah like uh i go on sportsbook every sportsbook has a welcome offer so he's like i go on sportsbook a and they have a welcome offer of like they'll match up to 20 of your deposit up to whatever a thousand dollars and b has the same welcome offer and i go max out both welcome offers and i bet on the same game for team a team b i lose the small rake but i take the whole welcome offer and i just do that again and again and again i was like this is so simple and so funny that you do this what are you have you ever had liquidity from selling a business or is the majority of your liquid wealth come through annual cash flows and are you pulling out a significant chunk from the from the business yes um i'm pulling out massive chunks from the business um in terms of liquidity event yes i sold uh two two businesses relatively small you know seven figure exits on both of those one was the youtube channel business and another was a was a software photography software business um in terms of the cash flow you know we operate with a very healthy cash flow so i moved that out to the to the whole co level um and then use that cash to invest um you know in private businesses as well as in real estate and public markets if you had a pie a good question sean always asks is what do you do with your money if you had a pie of your uh net worth what's that allocation looking like pie chart not just a pie pie chart or a pie yeah or five it's so heavily skewed towards my business the online business portfolio extremely extremely heavily skewed um i would say then a good chunk is in the in the public stock market um and then i have cash do you actively manage your portfolio or are you uh are you just doing boring chip big chunk of it is boring you know dollar cost average index um i have begun to play with you know a little bit of money to uh to see what i can do with it and i've i've done all right like stocks or other stuff no no stocks this is only i'm only talking about public investments because real estate is separate you um you talked about like kind of coming from nothing literally sleeping on the floor uh because you're like why would i buy furniture i should not buy furniture even when you had money um yeah but i believe two things a money is a tool it's not the like end goal it's a tool to enable you to do something with it and b um there's no point to money except for to you know uh you know enhance your lifestyle other people's lifestyle you know improve lives in some way right it would be a shame to just uh have the money and never use it have you and and spending money and spending money is as much of a skill as making money you just you know you just start it later in life um have you learned how to spend money and uh what have you learned what can you teach us yeah uh yes in the early days i saved everything i mean i did i did not buy a bed until i got married dude just to put in perspective when we were dating you know there's no bed ladies find you a man find you a man with no bed so so you know i i met my wife in high school um so so she's known me since i was broke and you know her her parents weren't that well off either so um so yeah in terms of learning how to spend the money yes now i have right for me and the the culture and how i was raised we take care of family first um and my first thing was to ensure my parents are retired because my dad worked really really hard when i you know when we moved to us so my my parents are retired i mean they go to pakistan maybe like four times a year they're in pakistan you know like right now for example so um so yeah so that that that was first thing first in terms of making that impact um in terms of traveling i i realized that i get a lot of creativity and joy out of just going and seeing new places um and i spend the money on those those things are you giving equity to your uh people like is the structure where is there like a whole code that you fully own and then the whole co owns 80 of this company 70 of this company yes in the early days that's what i did now i don't do that now you don't give equity to the operators do you regret giving equity no i i enjoy working with those co-founders and i i don't think i would be able to do what i did without them what now you're only 32 like what are you gonna like how do you get up in the morning and feel motivated you know what do you what's what's driving you now i want to build a generational company sounds like you're there though no i think it's generational one like you know when my kids kids are older and grandkids are around i i'm i'm probably going to be doing this till till i'm dead um i enjoy the game i enjoy the fun of it um i know sam doesn't get excited about uh about buying a business and fixing it up and growing it i i get i get a thrill out of it you know because for me that's the opportunity that's the hustle like finding finding the edge um getting that deal uh you you can say in in some sense um just just getting an unfair advantage um but but knowing those tricks knowing those tactics giving me a head like you know like if you play basketball i mean we all play basketball and i sucked at it right but there were some people like alex was amazing right because alex had been doing this for a long time and he had tactics he could just cross you over or whatnot um i like having those tactics in in the business okay what's crazy is you might be like probably in the top 50 richest maybe maybe top 100 top 200 richest under 40 year olds in america i've kept a very very low profile and the only way this would be validated is if i was ever to raise around or if i was to exit right um so right now what i can see and looking at our our numbers and what similar companies trade at and and you know exit at my assumptions are based on that um but it actually doesn't matter to me one way or another i'm pretty uncomfortable this model of buy don't build and um of becoming a hold co and having a portfolio like there's a whole bunch of people who i know that are trying to do this right now i'm sure you get a bunch of questions i think i've called you asking you a bunch of questions about this um what do you think uh they get wrong what's the common mistake or trap you think smart people can fall into trying to do this path or what's a misconception that smart people have when they come into this one thing that i've i've noticed uh noticed several things but this is the primary thing is that the excitement takes them away so they they will overpay on a deal uh and then regret it later on when they find out because oftentimes they have taken investors money um they are on a timeline you know most of them are trying to raise a fund you know your typical 10 year plus two years whatever so they have they're not disciplined enough uh to wait and i have no rush like you know if i don't buy a company this year no it doesn't make a difference um but you know so it allows me to be more measured and disciplined in the deals that we do um and that's that's probably the biggest thing yeah and and or underestimating the problems that exist in a business the first interview that i saw with you was it looks like it was on mixergy our friend andrew warner it looks like it might have been 2014 but i think it was even before that and andrew was like how much revenue do you do you do and he go you go andrew i told you i'm not going to tell you this and uh it was pretty funny and then i asked you to come on here and you're like i'm not telling you these numbers you've told us a lot of shit like it seems like you're you're you're in a different uh sphere than you were before where you don't mind talking about some cool stuff and i think that that's neat because you're like maturing from like this hacker probably gray hat hacker from you know 20 years ago 15 years ago to like kind of a tycoon i think you know when when i was younger i was afraid um you know just from a taboo things but also i didn't i want to fly under the radar i still do but i wasn't very vulnerable um i struggled with vulnerability and that that change as my network changed as as i continued leveling up um you know with with i mean now my forum is amazing and with ypo but it's not a ypo forum but everybody's in the ypo um and those kind of you know groups really really help you mature and find your blind spots and things like that so so i'm you know definitely appreciative of the friends that i have who call me out on those things and they have helped me become better i'm gonna have to use that little clip for my new company as an ad thanks we use ai to replace which the company you said with hampton exactly uh no man i think by the way if your goal is to have a low profile i have a feeling that's going to change when the headline of this of this podcast comes out because uh i don't think honestly that he's trying to keep a low profile i just feel like you care about being humble and and uh you came across a lot of humility uh you know and not false humility you know false humility is basically like uh i'm gonna downplay everything and not tell you anything and um that's actually like a different form of sort of uh you know i don't know arrogance or narcissism the the non-flex flex yeah the not flex flex right or the it's sort of this close the door uh behind me on the on the way in so you know i'm in but you can't get in because i'm not going to really do anything like you know i think the best people are the ones who sort of become the person they needed when they were younger and i think that like you know the younger version of you if you heard something like this all right this guy came from nothing moved here for pakistan didn't speak english was like sitting in the library because he didn't know how to make friends in the school was like all right i want to play video games the library had a firewall so his first business was creating a proxy to get around the firewall and he started giving that to other kids as a both a way to like make friends and make a little bit of money and then he took money and like he was like okay how do we get more customers it's not like he's some business savant he just kept asking how do we get more customers oh what if a directory posted about me how do i get them to do that what's in it for them and like you know you just one foot after another so i think you uh yeah i think you did a good job of basically like without um putting yourself in a position where you said something you're uncomfortable with you know you you did share stuff that i think you know for me at least pretty uh pretty inspiring you're somebody that uh you know i gave ben a list of like five people i was like you know who are the five people that we've met because we met a lot of people last two years i said in the last two years who are the people that we've met that were kind of the most inspiring they seem to have a blueprint for life not just business that was working for them yeah their business part of their life was working but they were also like content and they weren't you know like in the first five minutes of meeting them like weirdly bragging about stuff or like saying something that revealed some like weird insecurity that's driving them still and they haven't gotten over it's like i don't know those people are their characters they're fun to be around but like i'm not trying to be them um you know like somebody who's you know has a family life that they actually care about so we put you on that list um and i'm glad you came on because for sure i don't think most people even know your story and that's a shame you know like uh i think more people are going to know your story now after this where should people like follow you or where do you want to send them to uh well go from really quick sean before we wrap up i want to tell you something so he has this website so google syed uh so it uh i want the listener to google this so s y e d and then his last name b a l k h i and then google that and then the word net worth he's got this hilarious blog post oh this is yours sam told me about this yeah yes where it says what is what's sayed's net worth the first line you're probably thinking and so his his his website comes up first and it's a blog post you're probably thinking that i'm some sort of narcissist writing about my own net worth in third person it's quite the contrary i was looking through search traffic for my blog and i noticed that i have a lot of type in traffic for users simply searching my name uh and then the term net worth and then he goes on to explain that it's like it's always changing but it's not but knowing someone's net worth is not going to help you succeed but he's got those hilarious posts that he and he and it was really funny and uh that you also i want to give a shout out we talked a lot about money and you've got uh amazing posts where you do an annual wrap-up i've been reading that for years i think you started in 2017.
