Hi good evening I think that's gonna be a little bit boring after all that talk of sex I thought I thought I was kind of the badass one but clearly I'm just the English prude in all of this I'm Sarah Wilkinson thank you so much for coming out this evening to share and listen to these stories and it's been a really special night so far and I've certainly learned a lot in in row two and I've been specializing in trend brand and creative direction for over 20 years focusing mainly on Millennials and Gen Z and Gen Y customers I've been privileged enough to work for forever 21 currently but before that and CK jeans miss Elfridge asos.com and nasty gal so I've been around a few years I've been around the block I have emigrated three times in my career and this time obviously I'm here in LA but previously in my career I emigrated the first time to New York it was 1996 so quite a while back and I moved to start a six-month internship in and I was living in Hell's Kitchen and it was a pretty grim and bleak looking Manhattan in those days and I was paid a hundred and seventy five dollars a week cash which obviously didn't go very far especially when my favorite things were clubbing clothes cocktails and I mainly survived on deli egg rolls with sweet and sour sauce and drank copious amounts of Starbucks coffee and we used to work really long hours in those days we we didn't have computers believe it or not and so we would have to design everything by hand sketched out and faxed to China page by page by page and if the if the fax machine blew out a long which it did invariably and quite often you would have to start again and feed every single piece of paper through to factories in China where with some handwritten instruction they would have to tape the artworks together and use those to recreate the designs let's just say that we worked hard but we partied even harder and we were surviving on probably around about four hours sleep a night and I definitely would have considered myself as a technophobe I think I'd only had a mobile phone for around about a year there was no scanners no computer no internet no Google at that time can you imagine and it was certainly very challenging to build fashion trends at that time mainly just through editorial magazines and pulling bought samples if you were to fast forward 10 years and 2000 to 2006 I was working in London holding design manager at Miss Selfridge and I still probably would have considered myself a technophobe I mainly would put boards together by hand and taking them together on large pieces of foam core and keeping things really quite simple and very manual I had a very interesting chance meeting with a guy called Robert Brady who was products and trading director at ASOS.com at a time I was out in a wine bar on a Friday night and it happened to be his birthday and he was very tipsy and he was extremely animated and determined about persuading me to come and join what was then known as as seen on screen back then not no one had an online fashion store Topshop H&M and Zara those guys probably open their online stores maybe two years after that and so there wasn't a blueprint at all for an online fashion store I thought he was crazy I thought it was impossible I didn't understand how we were going to get people to buy clothes from a computer screen I mean was it even cool I mean it kind of just like a catalog but on a screen I mean how are we going to make that into a brand how are we going to make it into something that people would really get excited about I kind of laughed him off the bar stall but I did enjoy the rounds of drinks that he was buying me while he was coaxing me to try to come and work for him anyway four months passed and eventually he managed to persuade me to leave Miss Selfridge and come and join him to head up a researching putting trends together and it was it was kind of it was kind of crazy times but we started to make headway and what broke it was really in 2008 we landed the front cover of Vogue we got Georgia Jagger in a sequined zebra dress and at last we felt like we'd made it a lot of work during that time we launched asos white asos black asos salon asos Africa asos marketplace and we collaborated with some incredible talents Patricia Fields Marcus look for Josh Goote Michelle Rafferty Steph Stevens hundreds of people who came to our came to our calling we certainly spent a lot of time in the pub Nick Robertson CEO of a sauce said that if the alcohol ever dried up a sauce then all the ideas would try it with it but anyway we did have some good ideas in the pub and it proved to be so because we grew head office staff within six years from 60 people head office to 2,500 people and our sales jumped from 750 K a week to 35 million pounds a week it was this media attention and success that rouse Sophia Amorisu aka girl boss to contact me directly on LinkedIn she wanted me to come to LA and set up a fashion label for her that was sit alongside her her vintage gatherings nasty gal collection was born I moved to LA we started to collaborate with Courtney love iconic original badass and created some incredible collections and I was there for four years until recently I left and joined forever 21 I have just managed to achieve my hat trick I am on my third startup in 10 years I have just managed to do the brand and creative direction for a company called Riley rose which you may not have heard of just yet and but we launched our first store in Glendale Galleria last month and it is a lifestyle and beauty brand and really is the next generation of brands so highly integrated between the online and offline experience and it's really created for millennial girls just like you and so please check it out and the website will be launching on the 4th of November what can I tell you about the last 20 years and it's been a whirlwind of events and and definitely been there's been some real personal challenges in there as well as professional challenges but I want to leave you with a couple of things and that I think have helped me through the last 20 years and I want to say to all be brave dream the impossible dream the impossible is possible and be a badass and have a good night and cheers I'll see you at the bar thank you
