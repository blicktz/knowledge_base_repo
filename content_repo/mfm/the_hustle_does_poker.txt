You know what, I think you have to be your own greatest advocate. Definitely not me. Either Sam or Ethan.

I'm gonna win. I think that Tony's gonna get drunk. The first mistake is going to just laugh and not pay attention.

Lindsey's not gonna pay attention. Scott's gonna take it too seriously. And he's gonna wear sunglasses so I can't see his eyes.

Is that even a question? See this fit right here? Second place, first loser, could be anyone.

Doesn't matter. I'm gonna try to get the best. Most worried about Sam.

His style is very reckless. And you can never really tell what he's gonna do. I think Scott's gonna win tonight because he's wearing glasses and has headphones in.

So he's obviously taking it pretty serious. Sam or Tony. Kendall will think that he's gonna win and he's gonna talk a really big game and it won't work.

Because one time at a soccer camp in high school I won and that was the last time I've played competitive poker so I feel like I'm just gonna ride that winning streak. I feel like I'm just gonna ride that winning streak. Oh my god!

Oh my god! Oh my god!
