and you would end up raising you know potentially half a million dollars up front to fund your project first dibs okay what's first dibs okay so uh this is when we're looking at auction houses we were breaking down uh i think heritage auctions which did 850 million dollars last year in auctions which just shocked me right people selling collectible coins movie posters comic books i had no idea collectibles and auctions are as popular as they were i knew they were a thing but i didn't realize how much money was really flowing through that system and so anytime i observe something that surprises me i want to know more and i see that as an opportunity i used to see something odd and be like that's weird move in the other direction and now when i see something that i'm like that's weird tell me everything there is to know about this and i'll give you an example i remember when i was in college this guy who lived on our hall tofiq uh probably the strangest guy i've ever met i walked into his room uh his dorm room and he was looking at his computer and he was uh looking like he's playing a video game and i was like oh what are you playing and he turned and he looked at me and the game kept going like he his character kept moving and i was like whoa you're not even touching the mouse how's this happening he's like oh i'm not playing i'm watching i was like you're watching a video game this you know back in 2000 and uh what 2006 uh 2007 something like that and he's like yeah um yeah this is a replay of a starcraft you know tournament that happened yesterday i was like what i was like you watch other people play video games and he's like yeah uh it's great i'm like and it wasn't even live it was a recording uh of a korean match that some guy had commentated over recorded and posted on the internet and he was catching up the first thing in the morning he woke up and he was watching this and i was like this is so weird you're so weird dude i moved on with my life now fast forward you know 10 15 years later i sell my company to twitch which is the largest live game streaming you know a place to go watch other people in video games you know who knew but he knew and he knew it was awesome and if at that time i had been like whoa this is interesting why do you do this i could have learned a lot more i could have started twitch had i really sniffed out that opportunity and instead you know now i work at twitch and you know they've they've created a multi-billion dollar company out of it so this is kind of a learning for me anyways back to first dibs so as i was looking at these auction uh auction houses you know of course you have ebay which is the auction site for everything uh but then i saw all these niche ones there's goat for sneakers uh you know for sneaker heads uh bring a trailer is an auction site for vintage cars and it seems like you know on the surface that there's every every niche is covered there's an auction site for everything um so what do you do when there's no inventory left there's nothing else that there's no there's no niche left you got to make a new niche you got to make something make new inventory that doesn't even exist yet so the idea for first dibs is it's an auction house for things that don't exist yet now what does that mean you would partner with musicians artists movie studios athletes and you would auction off their first whatever you know these are the first hundred of this new line of lebron sneakers that are coming out uh so it's the same sneaker that's going to go for sale but auctioning off the first hundred to be made the first hundred tesla model threes the first hundred t-shirts the first hundred of copies of this album from your favorite musician i think people would pay a premium uh maybe even a super premium for getting first dibs from the creators that they love musicians athletes artists movie studios etc and it's like a cool kids version of kickstarter right if you're a famous musician you're not going to do a kickstarter it's sort of beneath you but this is like a cool version of doing the same thing you're going to say hey we're going to make an album if you want to have one of the first hundred copies or you want to be the first thousand people to listen to the single you can pay me right now you know uh five hundred dollars piece to to get that and you would end up raising you know potentially half a million dollars uh up front to fund your project just through selling first dibs to your super fans all right that's that idea
