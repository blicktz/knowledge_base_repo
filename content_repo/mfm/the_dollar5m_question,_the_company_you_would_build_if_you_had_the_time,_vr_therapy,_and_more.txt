100 i've been saying this for a long time which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay-at-home mom workforce is going to make billions of dollars dude this morning my friend had a 40th birthday party and he rented out an entire water park this morning from like 7 30 a.m to like 10 a.m and i went to it yeah it was like me and ramon and neville and then like you know david perel he was there and a bunch of other guys are there and i it was so fun we had this whole park to ourselves and then i came home and like threw up and went to sleep like i did you caught something because you threw about a nostalgia why are you puking i didn't re like when i was a kid i used to love that stuff and then i did all these like slides and like went too hard and like going through them like i like you go like these slides are it's kind of hard to explain but you're like in that you know those tubes that like go in twisties whatever like it just made me sick to my stomach i i was like on the ride home i was like no i think i might throw up i can you uh unlock the window it i can't believe how like old i got you savage you threw up out the window you didn't know i didn't do it out the window but i came home and i got sick and i just had to lay down i cannot believe how life has changed like you didn't even drink just just the straight just the action just the just like the like well did you go to rides on dis at disney uh like that my daughter's two so i did only like the dumbo ride like the most simple rides i don't like i think it's a little crazy i think i would have done like the big stuff i think i would throw up at this point i couldn't handle it it was horrible um but man this is why austin is awesome so like okay so david perel i don't know him that well but uh just two blocks up there's this restaurant and i would me and sarah went out to breakfast and he was there and so i he we knew who each other's were and we just said what's good we're now we're gonna go hang out last night i had this guy over named chris williamson do you know who that is no he's like a popular youtuber and he just dm'd me he said i'm in austin do you want to hang out i go yeah just come over for dinner uh like we're just like constantly just seeing people it's pretty wild it's a small weird it's like a a lot of like cool people here but it's a small town yeah that used to be the case in san francisco you know because you would just bump into people everywhere that were like doing the same thing like-minded people who are also in the same game but um i don't know i moved out of the city now so like you know i'm in the burb my neighbor is 80 years old uh you know if i bump into him you know he's telling me about like crochet or something like that so it's not the same well it's it's awesome here i've thoroughly enjoyed it um you want to get into some stuff yeah you have a bunch of really interesting things to talk about i've got less interesting things to talk about yeah let's do it let's pick one um well actually let me tell let me let me lead with mine because i have less stuff this is pretty much the only thing but you talk to this person all right this woman named rebecca zamalo you talked to her right yeah i think you butchered her last name zamarolo zamarolo sorry all right so i did a call with her as well i i dm'd her and we started talking this woman is amazing so basically it's her and her husband her husband's name is matt they're partners on this she has a youtube channel it's anyone listening to this you only probably know about it if you have kids so it's meant for children it's like it's like acting like fictional stuff age uh like six to eight uh six to ten ish maybe where it's like it's not the like absolute beginner kitty coco melon type of stuff it's like somewhere between and yeah they basically like it's a little show it's a t it's almost like a tv show uh you know whether it's blues clues or whatever else they're they create like you know these videos these are like 10 minute videos that are entertaining and on her personal channel she's got like 10 or 12 million subscribers she has seven other or seven channels total so six other channels one for her dog one for her husband one for like this for gaming just like all types of stuff she's releasing eight videos a week they have a team of like eight or six people maybe and she kind of told me a little bit about some of like the business numbers my mind was blown it was astounding unbelievable it was unbelievable did you talk to her about her business we can't like i didn't ask her if i could say anything and she didn't like that but put that on blast but yeah i like you know the dog has 10 times maybe 20 times more subscribers than we do on youtube like it's like oh this is my dog's gaming channel and it'll have like 400 000 subscribers or something crazy so she gets youtube has i mean 10 million subscribers is no joke and the amount of production the content output like just that thing you said sounded like oh six like seven eight videos a week like okay so they do a video they release video pretty much every day but they're like 40 minute long sometimes yeah they're like long videos with like storylines about like and she'd be like you know um yeah we moved into this new house and there was like this weird door in my bedroom so we created this storyline about this like secret secret passage that takes you down and then there's a villain inside and the villain is my husband and like that's the like then they create a whole play basically a little screenplay and they shoot it and while we were talking she's like yeah downstairs there's like eight people for our crew like our kind of film audio uh you know editors whatever that are all here and she's like yeah my life is crazy it's it's it was wild and she was telling me about different stuff and so there's this guy named dar mon so his first name is dar dh i know him well yeah okay so you're friends with them i'm not friends with them uh my wife either knew him like in college or something like that or whatever but then we've uh done some deals with that him and his wife around like influencer content so he's got 13.8 million subscribers and it's it's kind of lame what he does like lame and that it's not gonna fit what we we do but basically it's like hallmark channel videos like one was like bully someone bullies an autistic kid and the reaction is crazy or and it's like a fictional hallmark video i think they like children watch it i guess to understand like values and he's got something like a hundred employees and he's brand new to this like within a three-year thing yeah like two three years a hundred employees and they pump these videos out to the point of like right now he's got 6.3 billion views and it is crazy and across all their platforms their videos have been viewed 27 billion times uh it's the some of these youtubers it is i'm just blown away at how big their businesses are and when i'm thinking about it and i talked to rebecca i'm like this actually isn't that hard i could do this and if you dedicate like 40 or 50 hours a week if you start from scratch you can get big really fast and but you have to treat it like a job not a hobby just like anything else yeah like a business not even a job uh because yeah managing a bunch of people and you got to have a product for customers and things like that so so yeah i totally agree um like i'm on his uh twitter so it says like new videos monday through thursday family friendly kid approved right this is a that is a product you're offering we you know we release on these days we are kid friendly rated g uh you know like here's what you're gonna get out of this and that's that's you know my studio company or whatever um and i think but by the way before this this guy i think he was doing like a cannabis company and e-commerce thing yeah they have an e-commerce and cannabis business like unrelated doing all kinds of stuff it's it's amazing it's incredible um these youtubers like i'm blown away because there's so many that you have no idea who they are but they have these empires that could be potentially making tens of millions of dollars a year yeah i i also think um you know it's really hard to do what they're doing um like you know the it's not for everybody uh and i i guess that's kind of obvious but uh i guess what i'm trying to say is even if you could do it not everybody could do it but even if you could do it doesn't mean you should do it like this is such a hard thing to do to get on that treadmill and say i'm gonna produce awesome content five days a week non-stop and if i ever stop the algorithm punishes me and my subscribers leave my channel and my patreon people stop giving me money and my i don't have ad content for my sponsors and if i ever you know just don't feel like being in front of the camera like it doesn't work there's no substitute teacher to um to you know step in here and and step into this business so i think it is a really valuable i think it's a powerful business when you have it because anytime you have the trust of millions of people who like your entertainment that's great but man um i don't think it's worth it you know just i i'm not even just saying that theoretically like i've thought about doing it and i'm like there's no way this is worth it for me yeah i and that's what i said to her and so this guy dar i think he's not like the face i believe in most of his videos i don't think i think he's in close to none of his videos or something like that with her she was like yeah but we've got all these seven other channels now so we diversify beyond just me and i agree with you i think that that's a hard treadmill but i would say to the the other side is like everything is that right if you start anything like you of course you just kind of work at it for a long time um i think i could share this but when i did the episode when i recorded with hansen minaj uh who's like you know comedian uh he's on tv shows stuff like that he um he had asked me at one point during the thing i think the episode's coming out soon um the he had asked me like you know uh like what would you do next step if you were me and he he asked you that yeah like kind of like okay from a business point of view what would you do next and um on the pod itself i don't think i got him gave him a great answer like i think in the pod we were talking more about like how would you invest your money and um i was like you know here's kind of the thought process i would go down it was kind of a boring lame answer i would to be honest but afterwards when we were hanging out i i told him what i think is actually the real answer for this i said you know everybody should do what fits them like something that looks exhausting to me might look might feel amazing to somebody else so you know don't don't take my word for it but let's just pretend i'm just going to give you my two cents and you could throw it away if you don't like it um i said if i was you this touring business model seems awesome because i was at your show it was so you know like 4 000 seats sold out every you know average tickets like 150 bucks and you just did that eight times in this city and then you're going to go to 50 cities on this tour like you could just add it up and be like wow you can make a lot of money touring and um and then there's no limit to that like yeah this was a 4 000 person auditorium but you could do your same set in front of 30 000 people in a state in a bigger stadium if like you know chris rock or dame cook or whoever these other people would do that that size tours so i said you got a business model that works and but the problem is you're like i was like you're a new dad like me like i can't imagine being on the road going to 50 cities like we've been invited of many things i've been like yeah and then i'm like uh traveling is so hard with little kids i gotta leave my wife i don't really want to leave the house for an extended period of time right now like i like being home so i was like you don't for me i would want to get rid of the travel component i said okay how do you do that you can't have a substitute teacher come in and say your jokes on stage that doesn't work and so what i had told him afterwards i go if i was you i would stash cash and i would create a two-year runway where i could just work on one thing and that is creating the next hamilton and he's like what and i was like i would use your storytelling your comedic abilities i would create hamilton for brown people because that's like his audience's his demographic is like heavily skewed asian and i said um i'll create hamilton for brown people i don't even know what that means i would just take that and say i'm doing that and then he's like you know he reacted to it or whatever and i was like the reason i would do that is because then you get the business model of touring but it's not you on the stage yeah you can sit back you all you only have to create it once and like mama mia has been running for 16 years and has done over 600 million dollars in ticket sales and um you know like hamilton's done over a billion dollars in ticket sales and it's the same story it's the same songs it's the same jokes every night done by a different cast of kind of like you know fungible or interchangeable pieces so you're not super dependent on any one talent like you can switch it off switch switch out people if you need so i was like that to me seems like an amazing business model i would do that so that that's kind of my example of this youtube thing is like you can also do the youtube thing but in a different way like i think it's cool that dar isn't the face of his videos so then it's more like a production company it's like a tv show he's created not so much a vlog dude there's this guy uh people are gonna laugh at me because i don't know or if you know who this is uh is it andrew lloyd weber i forget who i forget the guy's name is that the fan of the opera guy yeah and did he do joseph uh something jesus radical what's that that broadway show where it's like radical jesus or like jesus is uh it's like about jesus and they're like this christ super yes yes school of rock phantom of the opera and evita which are all big hits that i've heard of and then i've never heard of jesus christ superstar but yeah that's apparently like done in the 70s yeah he uh he's a billionaire it yeah so so i looked up so when i thought of that play model i was like is the play is the play business a good business it could be and i think it can be so the the top the top ip definitely accrues like a ton of value like i said if you can go look at like lion king is grossed like two point something billion dollars uh that's the number one stage play what's number two and three hamilton is like getting up there it's like it's like number two or three now but it's like very new so it'll it'll surpass lion king if it just keeps going um there's like fan of the opera there's mama mia there's like if you take the top 10 and they're all doing like hundreds of millions in gross sales okay now you don't get to keep the gross sales but i think you could do this in a way that works so like the guy who created hamilton lynn manual whatever his name is yeah but did the uh did the author get paid too on that one uh so he gets so this guy lynn who's the creator of it he uh has like a seven percent royalty or something like that wow so he's made like tens of millions of dollars off of the the profits they actually crowdfunded the thing uh so what they did i don't have the full story in front of me because i'm trying to say this off the top of my head from memory but i think what they did was to raise the money to create the thing they had like a bunch of patrons basically chip in money and they all get to keep a profit share after a certain amount of money had been recouped and so that investment has been paid over like 10 times so if again if i was hustle mong i'd be like hmm there's web 3 going on interesting a lot of people flush with cash buying into okay cool digital tickets nfts okay what can i do with this and i would basically raise 10 million dollars through an nft pre-sale of the show and uh in different tiers like you know some of the tickets have backstage passes attached to them some of them don't whatever that's interesting and and i would i would just let people buy buy this i'd raise 10 million dollars i'd use the 10 million dollars to go into a bunker to create whatever the health hamilton for black people is and then i would hamilton brown people for indians oh yeah sorry not black people brown people so then i would take that show on the road and i would just try to i would be like yeah i know it's hard but like being a successful stand-up comedian was also like a 0.1 success rate or whatever um you know to get to where he's at so like yeah you you want to get to the 0.1 success rate but this time with a superior business model that um doesn't require your face on the stage saying the jokes yeah i think that's sick i think that's a that's a great idea i think that actually that's wonderful i think and that could be incredibly creative creatively fulfilling i wish i had said it on the spot it's like one of those when you're in an argument and then like later you're in the show oh fuck i should have said that that's what happened to me but luckily we're still hanging out at that moment so i was able to tell them you know then ah this is a cool idea i think in the next couple episodes what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to bring in uh i'm going to do some research on the broadway business or like i don't know theater i guess what do you call it theater yeah um it's actually an interesting idea i was always curious because american idiot basically they did this so billy joe armstrong wrote green day wrote american idiot the album the song they turned it into a uh a rock musical right you didn't have to be there they didn't have to be there you know exactly and they got paid a lot from it book of mormon let me see how much book of mormon has made uh 500 million dollars has been the gross ticket sales of book of mormon and then if you did something like a hamilton or like a lion king or whatever you could take that same ip those characters you have merch you have like other that ip is you okay is you got to own the ip and um you know so so i think you know when that when book of mormon launched it says it was bringing bringing in 19 million per month so like i don't know what south park generated lifetime but like i bet it's kind of like on par with that uh or you know i guess south park's probably a bigger success um yeah oh wow south park okay just in 20 i didn't know this happened actually looks like a couple months ago the south park creators signed a 900 million dollar deal for more episodes for for uh six years uh with viacom cbs that's insane i didn't know that that's actually amazing that's amazing right now is the best time ever to be a uh like a production company or an ip holder and we said this a long time ago remember i said someone needs to there's all these platforms now you got at the time it was netflix amazon prime and then i said disney plus was going to come out it hadn't come out yet um and then there was like you know there's hulu there's all these different platforms apple tv plus came out um they all want original content they're all hungry for content and they are betting billions of dollars uh budgeting every single year to buy content i think netflix or amazon or something like they're paying like six billion dollars per year for content uh for new content production and so it is the best time ever to be a seller of content and at the time we had said somebody should create yc for content basically the way that y combinator helped produce software startups and it just said hey two engineers okay you're 21 years old you graduated from stanford all right come here this is essentially like a business school but you're going to create a little business and you know maybe you can sell to facebook or google or you'll end up becoming the next airbnb you'll go public i think the same thing with the content where you would come in as two kind of like creatives you have a pitch for an idea of a show you want to create um you have three months to basically create the sizzle reel or the pilot or whatever and then there's a demo day with a bunch of buyers from all the big streaming platforms and they just buy options on your shit and um i just think that's a beautiful i still think that's a great business idea and it's only been proven when south park signs a 900 million dollar deal with with cbs uh shonda rhymes i think signed signed a couple hundred million dollar deal with netflix to produce six shows um reese witherspoon sold her production company which didn't even have that like for like a billion for like a billion dollars um like this is you know this is tech startup money that's being sold for for tv content which is amazing so you know that's a way more fun than building software way more way cooler um way cooler than that and i think today hasam manaj also announced his production he created a production company today he announced it like 100 i think it's called 186k productions or something like that which is smart again like once you see reese witherspoon and other people's production companies selling and we had rob dyrdek on i think he said he sold his production company for 200 something million he said that he i think he said he's walking away with 100 him personally yeah so like i think you know at least let's say at least 100 million probably closer to 200 million he sold his production company which basically just produced shows for mtv that's a great business to be in and i think it's only going to get better for like this kind of five-year period and then these platforms are going to go away like paramount plus and you know like quibi died you know paramount plus what the is that that that's good i love paramount plus why do you love paramount what's the one show you love on there there's got to be one they have uh like a lot of documentaries and shit paramount it's like old older it's like old school a little bit or like peacock are you a subscriber to peacock hell yeah oh my god dude peacock i literally was just when i was laying in bed when i wasn't feeling good i watched the office on peacock peacock is the only place that you can get the office mbc's one right yeah yeah you could you the office and parks and rec that's the only place you can get it and then so i i use it for parks and rec the office and ap bio or have you seen ap bio no i don't know what that is it's like with the class i took in high school it's like the main guy from it's always sunny you know uh d's brother dennis yeah yeah it's sick uh but peacock's good man peacock it's just it all costs so much money it all i mean i was looking to shit on one of them i thought peacock was safe but uh i guess no peacock's cool dude you're sponsored by peacock i guess i don't know what's going on i pay i pay for all this man a free subscription um you want to do something let's dude you have so much stuff here let's just bang through it yeah let's do one uh okay so let's do um do this tweet thing okay let's do this tweet so this guy sue hale who created mix panel and now is creating mighty which is a cool company have we talked about mighty by the way yeah it's pretty awesome i think we talked about it so yeah we'll skip that for now anyways good entrepreneur cool guy whatever he tweeted this thing out and uh my tweets not loading right now but i think it was something along the lines up it said the truth what's a company you'd start if you had more energy time or a lot more money right which is basically like if you took away your ass reasons what's the thing you really should be working on right now and i find that to be a very interesting question i have another question that's similar to that so maybe we'll do both these questions today so i went through the replies and i want to read you five of my favorite replies and i want you to just give me a gut reaction hell yeah hell no or i don't get it um okay so the first one came from gary tan who's a you know big shot investor guy um first investor in coinbase made like a billion dollars on that so he he said a reference check network do you know what that means just when i say just that yeah yeah so uh well the problem being solved is how to get uh like if he's gonna want to invest in someone hey does anyone know is this person uh honest right or you're hiring somebody and you want to know okay yeah you worked at this place how do i get a reference check so normally today you ask the employee they give you three names of course those are the three people that are only going to say good things which is kind of annoying in the first place so you can't really get the right people then you kind of have to bug them there's no real incentive for them except for to maybe help out their their ex-employee and then you have to think of whatever questions you're going to ask most people ask pretty poor questions but there are better ways of doing it and in the end you're just trying to get this fuzzy picture of like you know is this person any good or not so that can be done better and i think he had some solution in mind which is like something on the blockchain which was just like um you are able to like i'm able to have people who are linked to me somebody can go and request a reference from them maybe there's a little payment made i'm not sure and then they share information but it's not publicly shared it's just shared privately with me given the context of you know who who's who's the employee and what what this that's cool is so i thought that was all right um i thought it was really specific one i thought was cool because there was a lot of like i'd solve clean energy and like i don't really know what to do with that idea like it's not that that's a bad mission it's just like what the am i supposed to say about that okay somebody else said create the largest employer of high school students in the us what do you think of that sick sick yeah i mean that's like that that sounds awesome yes i mean what is that now mcdonald's yeah like i mean i mean probably honestly i guess it might be like mcdonald's i don't know what that would be i talked to these guys who were building a company i forget what it was called you probably know what it was but it's basically like an indeed.com but it's meant for teens and it looks like tick tock and like panda express and uh mcdonald's and like pack sun were all advertising on it and you could like scroll through and look at job opportunities yeah i want to say it was called like peach something or like lemon something or something like that i don't remember i don't remember but uh panda express was like spending a ton of money on it um and so uh anyway yeah i think that's cool i think it's a great idea uh it's not even an idea i think it's a great prize to go for i actually would say that this is like an interesting framework which is who do you want to employ 100 i've been saying this for a long time which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay-at-home mom workforce is going to make billions of dollars so if you just work backwards from there's a bunch of moms who are at home they want to earn a little extra income doesn't have to be a ton they want to maintain flexibility of being able to stay at home and work not like necessarily a fixed number of full-time hours or the same hours every day who can solve that problem and um there's only one example that i know of that's solving that problem i don't know if you know any um for moms yeah uh maybe user voice.com i think they do it uh user testing user testing dot com that that's the one i was thinking of oh is it really my mom my mom worked for them yeah so oh my god that's so funny i knew about it what a random thing that we both knew that um so i would say so user testing.com is an amazing company by the way so you just pay someone to like go through your website public by the way um and how cool is they just went public and my mom stock and my mom was like well say what it is so user testing basically it's a service where i have an app or a website i want to know where it's confusing for users like design makes sense to me but like sure enough when somebody else is using it they're confused they can't find the thing they want and they just record your mom like scrolling through the site so they have an army of testers which is just all the requirement is be a normal person you have we do not even want you to be highly skilled like you're supposed to represent the average customer so they have a bunch of people they send them a little camera that um that records their finger on their phone basically it records them like and they just talk out loud so that you give a task you say like you know find a christmas gift for your dad and put it into your cart and they're like okay i'm looking for the gifts for dad section i don't see it uh scrolling scrolling scrolling they don't see the button that says menu oh there's the menu uh dad oh it's men's men's okay i'll click men's um yeah i don't get how this is sorted oh this is by new release and you just talk through what's confusing to you and that 15 minute video goes to the company and the company gets to watch it and they get to share it internally their their researcher basically shares with the designer or the engineer they pay like 300 for it right no no each test is like 25 or 30 dollars and then um and then now it's all switched to subscription but originally it was like 25 30 a test the tester gets 10 bucks for doing the test and the company kept you know 15 20 bucks and so the tester's like cool i can do like four of these in an hour and so a like a bid would come online oh chipotle wants you to test their new mobile menu and you would just have to go quickly say yes and then you qualify they're looking for women you know age 40 to 55 in the us and you're like yeah great i qualify i can take this test and that's a billion dollar company now it's market cap is over a billion dollars did your mom get paid did they give her shares yeah it's awesome so basically my mom was she first started off as a tester then she got hired by the company to review the other testers because you have to do quality control so she became like she would watch the test and give feedback to the testers like hey your audio sucks or like you're mumbling or like you didn't follow the instructions of the test um one more strike and you're out of the testing pool and so that was her job and she was the oldest person in the company i think so she was like my mom's like 63 now so she just retired this this year so she was there at 62 years old uh my mom like had slack and like knew how to use all like jira she knew what a jira ticket was like it was crazy my mom like who knew and she got some shares and she had always told me like should i i was like yeah you want the shares for sure um and then she would tell me like hey the ceo did in all hands he said this this this is that good i'm like yeah it sounds good like this company's doing well i should have bought secondary stock in the company during that time because i had like basically inside info like this company's pretty good it's a good quality company and i was a user of the service as well so it goes public the other day like two weeks ago and i'm like mom how many shares do you have and she goes looks in carta she's telling you to share i'm like mom you made 150 000 dollars no way and she's like yeah because her strike price was super low uh she was there for like four or five years and uh so i was like that's amazing that's like uh like that's that my mom was so happy yeah like good for her that's bad money and so like this is why i think this model of who do you want to pull is actually interesting because it's actually there is two for two reasons it's motivating so like the fact that like they are employing uh most like i have no idea i'm just make this up if it's like mostly women who stayed at home for a long time and now they want to get back to it that's like incredibly motivating it's like look we're serving our employees yeah it's very noble it's cool let's say you want to hire uh uh ex-cons or something it's like look this is interesting or we're gonna hire a bunch of 16 year olds and it's gonna be the first job we're gonna train them how to be uh men and women and prepare them for the rest of their lives it's actually incredibly cool it's fascinating there's one um i want to look up the name give them a shout out here so it's hire you hire uh military wives as eas that's awesome it's called and it also helps with expectations so you know what you're you what's it called squared away squared away that's basically a woman i think i think her story is that she i'm assuming she was in this position i don't really know um but basically it's military spouses um and i was like this is a great this is a great idea um because you know this is us uh these are us employees they want this work they um yeah you know they it's great to provide for their family while you know the husband's away i just think it's awesome and um and it it it helps significantly with expectations because then user testing knows all right we're mostly going to be hiring 60 year old or 50 year old uh women who don't have a probably a ton of experience with slack and jira so now we know what we're getting into right processes we know how to hire the culture is good they all get along yeah it's like like mindedness or if we're hiring a ton of 17 year old high school kids like we know like here's the deficiencies and here's where they kick ass or if we're hiring guys out of jail we know like here's where they're going to struggle here's where not so that's cool um what are what are some other great ones on here that's a good one it's kind of vague but pretty cool i'll do two more um okay we'll we'll do one vr therapy so um vr is not there for like mainstream use cases the average person's not coming home and spending a couple hours of vr there's a few you know there are some people who do it they like to play games but vr is really awesome for like for like training like i know doctor like medical schools buy it so that the doctor can be like in the operating room they can make a highly lifelike simulation um and i think therapy is a good one too so um being able to put a headset on and really like change your environment change the state of mind be able to go role play through scenarios or talk to somebody and feel like you're there with them i think that's kind of amazing and so i look forward to seeing like vr with these like really specific high value use cases um until like the mainstream thing is ready dude i'm down with that i also think i could conquer a bunch of phobias like with that right so i'm down i think that's cool like i know that like athletes are doing this so like you know um there's this great we both love uh like you know ufc and mma and nfl is this way also but there's this phrase that conor mcgregor's coach always says which is you want to upgrade the software without damaging the hardware so it's like how do you train and improve without the without putting strain on the body hurting your body because training is so physically grueling so one way that they're doing it in the nfl is vr headsets the quarterback instead of just watching film their first person reading the defense without having to go stretch get their ankles taped up go out on the field potentially you know sprain a knee or get hit it's like they get to they get to read practice reading the defense and all the different coverages just in vr and then when they get out there on the field like it's that same first person point of view being able to turn your head and you're only seeing parts of the field like it's like pretty much like a one-to-one recreation i think that's kind of awesome i want to know which company is doing that um i'm sure there's a company doing that my favorite videos on youtube to watch right now are they take folks who play uh simula racing sims so racing simulations with vr sets and they have these like amazing setups at home that are like 10 20 50 000 and then they go and put them in a race car and uh they do really no they do really well you know it takes them like in all the videos i've seen it takes them 5 10 20 minutes to like get used to the noise and get used to um like the smell and just the the slightly different sensation but they pick it up super fast and so it's like those guys who have actually never raced before and they get them out there and they give them the fast cars and they pick that up it's pretty amazing yeah like i think even stuff as boring as sales i think you can practice sales in a much more lifelike way uh i know that teachers are doing this for like uh how to talk to your student about if they're feeling depressed or if they're being bullied it's like you sit there a student walks in you can see their face they're saying something and then you have to react and then you have to like you're kind of like choosing what to say live it's it makes it you get to practice before you go do the real thing that's cool any other good ones uh there was a couple other ambitious ones so there's a terra formation one we've talked about this before which is taking just deserts on the on earth and turning them into like rainforests basically turn them into forest like put it creating a green oasis of trees there and like that cleans up that sucks up a bunch of carbon dioxide from the environment so it cleans up uh you know the the air as well as like turns it into livable land and so like if we can learn how to terraform which is basically like turn you know unlivable land into livable land um that's going to help earth but it'll also help when we finally do make it to mars and we need to turn that into a hospitable place we're going to need to know how to do terra formation so i thought that was kind of interesting and there's another one like that like drone based wildfire fighting so like sending in drones to put out wildfires i think that's pretty cool too i think that's great those are really neat what um what's what's another one what's this legal question for five million dollars this i thought was cool all right so there's so as you know i'm a tick tock binger nowadays and tick tock is the only social media that like i when i leave it i feel better than when i came in everything else like facebook feel awful at the end instagram i feel like oh man my brain is rotting twitter i'm like i was a waste of time just dealing with a bunch of people's bad thoughts and uh tick tock is really i i cannot believe how much i enjoy it like is it just entertainment addictive it's entertainment but there's a lot of education like i learned a lot of off tick tock now it's all little life stuff it's like um you know like i don't know stupid examples but like hey if you ever take a photo and you see that like you know where you're like when you take a photo your eye can have like a red like you know you look kind of evil like the camera has that flash or whatever like a red dot if that's ever white you should go to the doctor um because there's actually like a very uh like there's a chance that that's a very bad thing and then this guy was replying saying actually i had heard that i saw a photo like the line of that i went to the doctor it turns out i had eye cancer he's like i actually have my eye removed but like it saved my life that we found it early and um i don't know this is random that to like you know just quickly seeing like how an avocado gets to your door it's like oh cool this farmer farmer tick tock is dope like parenting tick tock is great it's like oh when your kid is just not listening how many times have you done this i'm like yeah that's me and they're like here's a better way to say it i'm like thanks you know parent i never had to teach me how to do this really important thing in my life um like you just learn little so um anyways i was on it and there's this account called legal baddie uh legal baddie is just like some hot lawyer and she's like here's my question for you she goes if i told you that you were going to make five million dollars a year as your salary regardless of what you do so you're just you're going to work 30 40 hours a week you're going to make a fixed rate of five million dollars a year what would you choose to do as your work like you still have to work to get it uh what would you choose as your job and obviously this is like you know a hidden question of kind of like what do you actually really enjoy to do if money wasn't an issue um and so and but you still have to work right so there's one of like oh if i had 100 million dollars well then i probably maybe i wouldn't work at all like maybe i would just do blah blah blah this is like you have to work to earn this but no matter what job you do you're going to earn the same amount so which job by the way i'm looking at her profile i love legal baddie i love this woman why it's just her look what do you like she's just like she's a baddie she's she's this one was a lawyer is that her her shtick yeah she's i think she's a lawyer otherwise i just think it's she's crushing it it will mean something else i don't know what's going on if this woman she's 19 and that's her first-gen lawyer from ucla law i think it's amazing she's probably making more money off tick tock and like she's like i like i like i particularly like it with women but i like it with men too where they uh talk about like cool shit like passing the bar exam or whatever but then like uh like she's got all a bunch of nail shit i i always think it's cool we're like you can break that barrier of like smut and cool stuff and also like legitimate uh life helping content i always thought that was cool yeah exactly yeah i'm with you she has 500 000 followers on uh on here and like you know her top videos yeah she's like doing like like purposely hot girl stuff and then also like telling you how to get into law school i always i always think that's cool law school and then downer dog then back to quick bar exam tip and then back to my favorite name and like here's like a bit here's like a pretty racy bikini video of her right so yeah she knows what she's doing right like let's credit where credit is due uh she is giving the market what it wants i love this differentiated thing all right she's not just one of the like kind of like tick tock hot girl in a bikini or whatever like she layered it with another like that what this the skill stack as you call it right how rare is that there's there's not a lot of lawyers on tick tock there's not a lot of hot girls both she might be the only one right so she's competing in a pool of one and there's this video of her talking in front of like c-span like some type of press con i love this anyway i love her uh so what's the question five million dollars what would your job be yeah what would you do for your job if you were for sure going to get paid five million dollars what would you just choose to do for that 30 40 hours a week what's your answer now i want to hear yours first i don't know what comes to mind five million dollars a year and you have to have like a 40 hour a week job right yeah um definitely something involving like charity so like uh something involving not making money so if i can get five million dollars and all i have to do is like spend time like running a dog shelter or uh uh that's awesome i would do that in a heartbeat if i could pay five that's not what i thought you were gonna say if i could do five million dollars to like run like a dog rescue i would do that in a heartbeat or to help inmates ex-inmates find jobs i think that would be exciting so or even like people like everything we just discussed about helping uh stay-at-home moms get on get employment anything that involves helping people and not making money i would do that yeah that's good uh yeah mine's kind of similar mine's kind of boring i would i would probably teach like i just love teaching so um i would teach now the question is what would i teach i think i would teach kind of like business slash life stuff to people who uh want to actually like they're really motivated to have a great life and have a great great like kind of business career and so those are the people i like hanging out with the most and that's the thing i like doing the most is basically learning and then just you know packaging it up and then teaching it to others and answering questions you know talking things through basically with people figuring stuff out um so i think that's probably what i would do but i feel like uh you know your dog shelter thing made me think oh maybe there's an even more lightweight um just pure enjoyment like maybe actually i know what it would probably be i would be like a um i'd be a basketball coach or i would be like a uh like whatever the f minus basketball league is like i'd be a basketball player like that'd be sick to travel absolute most fun doing is playing basketball and like second best would be coaching a basketball team this woman legal baddie has another question would you rather have 10 million dollars today or 100 million in five years that's the easiest question ever which one would you take 105 yeah exactly 105 is is great um it gets if it's 50 i think it's a lot closer it gets a lot closer at 50 because 50 could turn into 105 years in a bull market 10 10 10 will turn into 20 but also you got to have 10 now and you didn't have to wait five years of your life which is you know pretty significant uh but yeah i think my answer is i'd be on some gordon bombay and i'd go do my mighty ducks thing with some like you know high school team i think that's a good answer um you want to do a few more let's do something else let's do it let's do a couple ideas so business idea all right problem i just ran into um sending a gift to your production partner your factory partner uh overseas okay sending gifts in general is hard sending gifts overseas even harder um because like just like the act of mailing things and like oh i want to send them like you know bottle of wine for christmas or what it's like i can't mail that how do i do this i gotta look up ups like alcohol shipment you know rules and make sure it doesn't crack and all this so i felt i was searching like i'd like to send my factory a gift in china is there just like a version of doordash in china i could just like go look at what they have push a button and they'll just deliver it to them and like boom it's done and i actually found this like really janky website um i'm gonna find uh i'm gonna find the name of it but basically i found this like old school looking craigslist looking website and it was we send gifts to your business partners in east asia and it's like that's all we do um browse here's like 50 gift baskets ranging from like balling out to like ah we just met and um you know you want to spend 40 you want to spend for 400 you could you could pick and they just say great what and then their address field is like formatted for chinese address it's like you know like it's like it's just it's optimized where you have confidence that they will actually deliver the goods and i'm not gonna have to worry about logistics i'm just gonna be able to put in some money and i'm gonna have a thoughtful gift to my factory partner so i like this idea because okay there's probably some amount of people like me that are searching for this like okay it's christmas i want to get gift for my business partner but um do they not have can you not order an amazon thing and send it to china no i don't think so oh i don't i don't know maybe maybe i could have just done something as simple as that i don't think i don't think so but maybe there's like maybe i needed to go on taobao and like figure that out yeah but that's a pain in the ass because i don't even know what is exactly this was like pay with paypal you're done and i was like great um this is what i wanted and it was also like organized as a gift so it wasn't just like an item where they're just going to get it in a shitty amazon box it's like it looks like a gift it's in a gift care package um which is nice that's like the goal of what i was trying to do it's like edible arrangements to china is what i was trying to do essentially so i sent it and um and i was just thinking you could just do this and then do like cold outreach to like the one million shopify stores and be like hey you know what's a good idea you should send your your factory you know your your manufacturing basket a gift basket and like you know it costs six bucks it goes a long way you know these people you know they're the key to your business and study show blah blah and gifting is a big thing in china it shows respect don't be rude um and like you could do that three times a year like oh it's that's your chinese new year it's whatever else and i think just through outbound you could create like a like probably like a one million dollar a year uh revenue business maybe three million dollars a year in like two weeks i think you could create that so our uh listen to this crap so so the other day we got a mattress delivered to our front door a zinus mattress it's huge and it had sarah's name on it i go sarah why'd you order a mattress she goes i didn't order a mattress and i'm like we got to find out who sent this mattress because we can't open this up because if you open it up it's a pain in the butt we're just gonna keep in the box maybe send it back or we'll sell it for like 200 or give it to a friend yeah so here's like a heavy ass huge box huge that you can't open and you don't know where it came from yes and it says zinus so i know it's a cloud mattress i don't even know what size of mattress it is okay i open it up and she posts on twitter and nick huber sweaty startup says that was from me uh and and i go oh very funny and he goes no that was seriously from me i uh we wanted you to know i invested into his storage business and he said we wanted you to be able to sleep well at night knowing that your money is uh uh like being taken care of and i was like well i appreciate the sincerity that's lovely yes who the hell has a like i don't have like a spare an unmattressed bed yeah like i don't have an unmatter's bed like what were you thinking like maybe a blender would have been cool or like just chocolate like like like a pillow a pillow would have been yeah like a fancy pillow i could use another one of those he gave me an extra mattress and so we've been texting our friends like does anyone need a mattress he created a pain in the ass for you yes i'm like dude just send me chocolate covered nuts you know what i mean like give me like like some flavored like some weird fruit or something i don't want a fucking mattress he sent me a mattress i've got this huge mattress in the front door problem and i've got guests coming on friday and i'm like looking like a redneck with this mattress on my front bed we have a bed they're staying in the bed that's already in the guest room and i'm like look like an idiot i look like a country bumpkin with just a mattress on my front door and i'm like oh just ignore that we'll get rid of it so uh i'm on board with better gifting nick huber i this will make it to you i i really appreciate the the gesture though it was very nice um but like maybe like peanut butter cups and like chocolate covered nuts and like some chocolate turtles would be more sufficient i love it um all right so that's one quick idea the factory gift idea with the outbound outreach to every fba and amazon seller and i say a shopify seller and i think you could i think you could side hustle your way into a million dollars a year doing that okay here's another uh random thing have you uh have you ever seen uh emf protected pants is that for your computer on your balls is that your phone yeah uh no emf it might be em something else electromagnetic whatever radiation i'm on board with this though i hate like i i don't know it's emf the studies i i don't know exactly what it is but like basically having your laptop on your lap and that heat is not i don't know if it's radiation or what it is it like it's proven to kill your sperm another thing like wearing whitey tighties you know like tight underwear where your balls are against your body that actually uh kills your sperm because it it heats your body up too much let them baby swing you know yeah it can't be you can't be you can't the birds gotta fly yes you can't keep them in the net so um so i've i've noticed that there's a few people in my life who i they're like the canary in the coal mine like they they kind of get really into stuff and i'm when they first say i'm like why are you even thinking about this why do you even care about this um you're you're one of these people by the way where it's like dude sam just got really into mobility and like you know stretching he's like like got really serious about like ripped dudes who want to stretch and be like super mobile or it'll be like you know um he's on this kick about like really wanting like uh toughness challenges like life is too good he's too soft so he's craving this like core primal challenge in his life oh is that just sam being sam and actually what it ends up being is like sam being ahead of the curve by like three years and it's going to become it's going to be proven to be like quite popular um there's a few people in my life that are like that my brother-in-law is like this you're like this my trainer i've learned is one of these people where he'll say something and he's like you know super into this thing i'm like i've never like he'll be like oh yeah dude i take kratom like oh kratom like what the fuck's kratom like do you know what kratom is no it's like basically so so he's big into like these like kind of supplements nootropics which like you know if the promise of them is amazing but you like can't tell if they work or not like people who believe in them like oh this feels great but it's it's that thing we talked about before it's like the best product in the world is cbd for dogs because yeah it's the best you think you're giving them you know pain relief but you'll never know if it does anything and like cbd for humans is like that too but the dogs can't talk and um and so there's a whole bunch of these like kind of nootropics or supplements that's like oh yeah i take lion's mane and i take like you know milk of magnesia i don't know whatever just a bunch of random ass names and then later like he said he was telling me about like tangali and then dr hooberman came on he's like yeah i don't do testosterone anymore i do like i get it from these others uh like more natural herbs like tangali and whatever i was like dude there's only two people in my life that i've ever said this name tangali and like it's these two people and so i've just noticed he's ahead of the curve on a lot of these whether it's like fashion fitness supplements nootropics uh you know like books that he's into and so on the supplement side he's like really this thing called kratom uh which is kind of like a advil um like you don't take it instead of you take it instead of advil so it's like kind of like helps with your aches and pains without the side effects of like that like thin your blood or hurt your kidneys yeah like you're bad for your liver and shit like that yeah and um so anyways that's where i'm going with this okay so he's like oh yeah dude uh he's got his fashion line coming out where he's like making clothes basically just like i'm his only customer right now because it's like not released but i just get to have a bunch of his and i'm like oh this is amazing um he's like yeah the shorts on these the pockets have like emf protection and i was like what and he's like oh yeah like i'm big into like you know just why not why not have emf protection and i was like from like he's like yeah your phone's in your pocket all day is right next to your balls like you just don't want that you know i want to have kids i i don't want to be having all this stuff there i'm like i guess you're right i guess it's pretty sick i was like it's so normal everybody puts in their pockets so like is there something to be worried about and i call this fud where fud which stands for fear uncertainty and doubt so i did you make that up yeah there's a general trend i'm creating here called fudware and i think that fudware is going to be anything that's like oh yeah you know like blue blocker glass like uh light glasses um emf radiation proof pants um you know it's like uh you know like and that's not to say that they're all like it's not to say that any of this is false like it might be totally true but it's basically preying on people that are when you tell them oh did you know that parabens you should never have aluminum in your deodorant and they're like what aluminum am i gonna die all right i'm never using old spice i'll use native deodorant instead it's like paraben free it's like what the fuck's a paraben but i i guess i've heard parabens are bad for you you know um like that guy who came on the show and he was like oh yeah i don't drink out of plastic because you know phthalates i don't drink out of plastic either and it's like yeah it's still super common but the smart people i know are like starting to say this word phthalate i never heard this word before but i'm starting to hear this and it tells me there's a bunch of people that as they become aware they're going to start to steer away or teflon pans right exactly like the non-stick or whatever yeah so i think there's just a whole class of products that are just fudware and you can just find the next fud of like what are people afraid of it's like oh like they want to do like um uv cleaning of their phone and their toys because uv kills uh you know know covet and you know uv red lights a great one fudware that's fantastic so a few more like the water filters so there's those charcoal silver water filters that are everywhere i think just justin mayor said he tried to get a built like a huge one so all of his home water goes through this thing yeah he has like a intense i asked him i go what do you what do you do for water he goes i go way over and i have like a 12 foot tall system that's filtering is it like a is it called like bur it's called like bur burkeley or berkeley i don't know what it's called but when rob dyrdick was on he said that too he's like i'm making a showerhead filter company because like oh yeah what if i found out that i'm showering and toxic chemicals well then i'm gonna buy this attachment that purifies it like if you just put a little seed of doubt into my brain i'm gonna be like yeah why not i'm just getting on the side of safety and on in the same realm with that and i actually i would want to look into this but i think laptops on men laps is like a massive issue right if i i like it could potentially be quite big you could just make a whole company just protecting men's balls from from like you know the modern day you know harm it's like yeah here's a laptop tray that's like fucking made out of kryptonite and it's like you can't pass through this here's your shorts put your pie and put it in this pocket it won't won't fry your balls uh you know wear this underwear uh because you know your underwear has you know cotton phosphors it's like what's a cotton foster i don't know sean just made it up but it's bad for your balls and so it's like did you just make that up that's good it sounded good right dude i'm telling you the heat it does freak me out like having that heat like i feel it and i'm like oh this is horrible for me so i i have like a pad like i put a pad on my lap there's a small uh you know pomade you need to apply to your balls every night uh before you sleep because you know that when you sleep the gravity pulls your balls and it's bad for you like how much make up an endless number of ball okay here's this one that i saw these guys launch and they advertised with us early on and i was like this is the stupidest thing i've ever heard of why are you guys even doing this and now it's a billion dollar company manscaped have you heard about manscaped i have i asked a buddy i said what's one of the best investments in your portfolio what are your best investments i thought he named some tech company some cyber security company he goes oh manscaped is great because they raised like only a tiny amount of money and they're worth like yeah like close to a billion dollars is it a billion dollar company you think i i don't know something like that it's where they sponsored the ufc and that's a really expensive sponsorship and they sponsor a ton of stuff if you told me that they do like 150 million in revenue i wouldn't be surprised i think it's definitely over 100 million in revenue for you think it's over 200 i mean i don't know and i've i've never used one i told i told sarah to buy one for me because i want one for my nose hair and i think they have like what did sarah have to buy for you why didn't you just buy it she wanted a christmas present for i told on my christmas i was like give me like the nose hair one um i think they have a nose hair one uh but uh like i don't want is it all in one i don't mind using they would give you that cover they give you that air cover to be like yeah i just want to trim my beard and my nose and uh oh what do you know it comes in all the attachments maybe your boy will start manscaping yeah i'm cool with share like using that on my face and i'm no the the the nose one's different uh but but the the manscape like buzzer it it's just a normal i think it's just a normal buzzer i i don't know how it's actually different than like a normal hair much different and they crushed it this cat i never would a million years would have thought that this was gonna work it sounded like a joke when it came out i remember just being like oh that's a funny that's a funny joke of a company cool cool joke of the day for a startup yes and they kill it they sponsor all the major like boxing and ufc stuff these guys are killing it uh and it doesn't look so i'm on board with with with uh protect your balls that's a good business and fud is a phenomenal uh name what's it stand for fudware uh fud is fear uncertainty and doubt so they say this in the market a lot like if people are like oh i heard china's gonna ban bitcoin or like isn't it true that like uh you know satoshi was a you know part of the nsa it's like oh this is just fud you're spreading to get people to be uncertain and doubt and sell their positions dude that's great like compression socks i i buy compression socks so that's fudware i have no idea if it works but it's what it was supposed to do compression socks when you run i have calf pain and achilles pain all the time compression socks are socks that you pull really high up to your knees and they have a lot of compression on it and it keeps your calves calves tight so if you're aware like compression shorts like that tight underwear for your thighs it's like that for your calves and ankles gotcha okay i like it i dig it um can we wrap up with one thing uh so recently this bitcoin thing um craig wright i don't know much about it other than like one article i read i guess he's an australian guy and he was being sued by this person who wanted a share of the money for what's the story uh i don't know about his lawsuit but i know about craig wright and that he basically for a long time has been claiming to be uh satoshi nakamoto so well so he claims to be the creator of bitcoin and then people who are smart in the community are like there's no way so people but the this lawsuit basically he's being sued by the spouse of someone this this craig wright had a partner the partner died and the spouse of the partner sued craig wright and craig wright won the lawsuit and in winning for what uh she said that you owe me money because of this reason and that reason we created this you and my husband created this thing together you owe us some money and in winning i forget exactly how it worked but in winning the case the jurors said well no you're satoshi and you worked on this alone and so uh like in order for him to win in a weird i don't know the exact details but in order for him to win they were basically saying yes we believe you're satoshi and satoshi worked alone so okay here's the here's the story so uh kleinman versus wright uh the jury ruled that david kleinman's relationship to craig wright did not constitute a business partnership meaning the estate was not entitled to a share of the satoshi nakamoto fortune which wright claims to have control over as the self-reported creator of bitcoin the jury ruled against wright on the conversion account awarding awarding 100 million dollars to kleinman what a rule against right yeah so he said they got 100 million out of it i don't know because i thought he was celebrating it was a little confusing but the point was is that this like this legal team okay they wanted billions they didn't get that but they got 100 million against him for the unauthorized use of funds from climate and rights shared venture wnk info defense research llc okay i don't know this is from something else so did is this guy the guy who started it that's what i want to know so basically um so he claims to have invented bitcoin then um there's a great clip by the way of vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum uh co-creator of ethereum uh on stage and he goes uh there's they were talking about it and usually people like you know like in a in a conference panel people are usually pretty like you know they don't take shots at people like live there and he just he just pipes because you want to know what i think and they're like yes we'd love to know what you think he goes he goes um he gives this like quick like two minute rant that just destroys craig right where he's like i think if you're the creator of bitcoin you have a and everybody was saying you're not and you keep trying to tell people you are all you have to do is one simple thing you just have to sign something with with satoshi's wallet and that will just show that you're him and the fact that you're not doing that like the you know he he calls some like something like you know oxen razor oxen's razor or whatever like some term like that he's like the simplest explanation here is that you're not satoshi because if you have a simple way to prove your claim and you do not prove your claim using the simple way you cannot prove your claim and um so you kind of just like on him right there so who who crowd went wild so who is this you think that is he he's died or he's still quiet um the best theory is that it's uh that it's this guy hal i forgot what his name is hal uh hal finney um this was so hal finney was like a cryptographer he received the first bitcoin transaction he was the like the second wallet and normally like what does a developer do when they test something that's like oh i sent it from like sean a to sean b like my test account basically like that's how i do the first transaction and um he was like very active in the forums and then he died right around the time he got als and died around the time that the last known time that stoshi ever posted anything um so you know it seems like why wouldn't he tell do you think he why wouldn't he like tell his wife or his family or you know like because it looks like he has a wife on these pictures yeah well a maybe he did and b um like you know some people are so mission driven in their thing and their thinking and like you know there was a there's a real genius of the idea of being like i'm gonna have this as a pseudonymous name satoshi nakamoto i'm not gonna use my real name which means i'll never get the credit for being a genius if this works but also it like it's kind of like the parent dies so the child can survive it's like the only way a currency like this could have really worked is if you couldn't point to the creator because then they would just attack the creator they would say the creator has too much they'd say this guy has a ulterior motives he has control he is he's too powerful to you know he's just the new the new bad guy you know okay you're bad at the federal reserve and the governments uh yeah now you're bad at this guy for for a private citizen being in control of this so you think this is him i personally think it's him um like i've looked into a couple times about like what who are the most likely candidates um you know is it a group of people uh was it the government themselves was it one person and it does seem like it was uh like you know i guess like i shouldn't say it does seem like it there's really no evidence of the existing evidence that's there this kind of like speculative data points you have how finney's fits the story in my world view the best so i think it's him god that's i love these mysteries i i which would mean that it's it's sort of gone like his coins are locked up um unless he gave him to his wife unless he gave her the keys uh and like you know and she and told her don't touch it because it hasn't moved no not a single coin has moved uh ever and um you know i think if he did it let's say he did give her instructions how would i give instructions i would say um i would probably not actually let her have it i would say this file is going to be available to you on this date um 20 years from now and i would say you know follow the instructions inside so i wouldn't even give her the opportunity to make a bad decision because i would say if these move before bitcoin wins um then it'll be this will be very destructive for it like if the creator of bitcoin starts to sell bitcoin that will trigger like a huge sell-off in the market because it'll be like oh the creator's alive they don't believe they're selling their coins who is it it'll create this like whole drama it'll hurt the project but has any money ever left his account no not a single satoshi has ever left his account so then he would have had to have create a different account for her to live on or something yeah which could have easily happened right um you know at some point but you know people can also see the ledger so they know who all satoshi sent the they know which wallets satoshi sent coins to and um some of them are like known identities like the other people that were in this like crypto like the cypherpunk community that wanted to test out the project early on uh but like you know he very easily could have just had her set up mining a mining rig so it didn't even have to come from his account he could just say it because he didn't give himself the coins he mined the coins sure it's just that mining was so easy at that time so you know she could be miner number eight um you know that mine some coins and that's it that's she could live off that yeah god how well we should see like you know house finney's what how she living is she like in a in a 40 million dollar home in venice i don't even know if he i mean there's a woman with all these pictures with him like it looks like a wife i don't even know anything about her i just googled it doesn't say anything about the wikipedia about his wife um but oh yeah his wife raised yeah so he does have a wife yeah i'd be curious i'm looking at pictures of his house when he's dying like pictures of him dying and he's in his home it does not look fancy yeah yeah also als just looks so brutal man yeah it feels like the worst debilitated uh that's really tough yeah so anyway that's fascinating we should do like an entire episode on that that's this is so interesting to me yeah i agree we should we should just do the research of like okay what is all the research that's out there and like what's the conclusion i think people are i'm fascinated by like this story i think it's one of the coolest fucking out of straight out of a movie but it's actually real life things that has ever happened you know i like that and silk road but i think the silk road case is far more cut and dry than anyone thinks i think ross did it i think ross did everything right you know what's the what's the controversy people think what many people were running it dread scott pirate whatever the the what's the name dread pirates roberts or whatever yeah uh they're saying that that was multiple people and whenever i post about ross all right people are like free ross and i'm like well like he did kind of hire people to kill one another like other people like i don't know like what you have you seen the comments so you have a youtube video about your story yeah they hate and they're they're like they're like they're like there's like an army of people that love ross and hate they hate anybody that says anything bad you didn't even say anything bad i didn't say anything bad i said i think he did it but like but like my thing is like uh like i mean he sold like he sold drugs so there's some consequence to that not life but some consequence but if you did like murder for hire yeah life is is definitely fair if you do it three times totally fair right and when like i read that book american kingpin i looked at some of the evidence and i'm like yeah there were some bad cops working on the case and those guys got in trouble but it definitely seems like this guy did it i don't understand how there's any shadow of a doubt right by the way fran finney's twitter bio and i'll just leave it on this note she she says i graduated from caltech i spent 35 amazing years married to hal finney um who lived with als from 2009 2014. currently living in dubai i vow to spend the rest of my life making him proud i thought that was nice yeah man she seems like a sweetheart and she turns out my wife like hey it turns out she like it's to me drive like a ferrari and a bugatti and like only wears gucci i've had to spend the rest of my life in these fresh ass gucci's yeah gucci life you see this um did you ever see that meme you know that guy huzbollah the little like the little guy i love him so he tweeted out this thing he goes man people say i had this like people always talk about my disability did you see this meme yes and what did he say he goes yeah i got disability to make that bread picture of him holding a huge block of cash he's like disability to make this money i love that kid he's not a kid i think he's like 20. yeah i don't know what to say i'm gonna get canceled just trying to like just try to describe anything about him without being offensive so i'm just not gonna say anything all right let's roll i'm out of here
