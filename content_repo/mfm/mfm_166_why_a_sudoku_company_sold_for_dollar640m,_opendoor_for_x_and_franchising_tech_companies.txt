the very bottom it says this don't know this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous or unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007. right so i emailed this guy and i was like hey uh saw your website um like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to sell this and he's like refuses to monetize it refuses to sell it i think it's hilarious what what is this i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back let's talk about business ideas um first of all let me give you an update did you see someone in the facebook group um launched a pickleball newsletter because we told them to uh a few months ago because we told and it's now it's now their full-time job and they traveled the country uh getting their products into stores and things like that so it started as a pickleball newsletter right and then they partnered with the pro tour of pickleball which i didn't know that was a thing and then they started selling their own stuff out of a van their own pickleball equipment and now they're in retail stores thomas shields good job thomas thomas um looks like a young kid he looks like a younger better looking version of me uh let's see why i can't uh yeah he looks young he looks real young so congratulations thomas shield that's great i think the ceo or the founder of pickleball either listens to the pod or he messaged once being like yeah i'm down to come on so we we can have him on if you ever want to um we can do an episode about kind of like alternative sports basically and do some research and have them on as well great and speaking of alternative sports you want to talk about chess yeah so i have a follow-up there i don't know if you have one or or just what i put there um go ahead what were you going to say so we talked about the background is we talked about chess.com last episode i tweeted about it because i was even more people love that tweet dude that tweet had tons of engagement um it was good and the the summary of this is that i actually we underestimated it so chess.com gets around 200 million monthly uniques they have 60 million registered users they uh traffic has grown significantly if i had to guess they do at least 100 million in recurring revenue subscription revenue uh potentially is worth a billion dollars super fascinating company um go ahead what were you gonna say we were trying to hype it and we actually were under hyping even even though we were trying to hype it um and by the way the guy who started is like a ex-stanford guy or the guy who owns it uh it was two i think stanford guys uh which is cool like you know they didn't go the same track probably as 95 of their classmates and they're gonna outperform 99 of them just by by doing something really simple that the world wanted so i started thinking about this because we talked about it you brought it up cool topic cool bit really cool business it really fits the what we call the new zealand type of business that andrew wilkinson kind of coined that that phrase which is it's this independent thing it has like a cult following it's profitable it's simple it's not nobody competes with it it's like new zealand nobody's going to war with with chess.com uh you know the biggest competitor i think it's called lie chess or something like that it's basically like an open source free you know like kind of like alternative and it's also doing extremely well and those are like the two uh but it seems like people kind of prefer chess.com so i started thinking okay what's the next chess.com what are the others is there a whole slew of these guys because i think that's where we didn't talk about last time that we should have and so i wanted to double click in a little bit so i started and that was that's a really really hard question i've been thinking about it too i only came up with like dominoes i looked into solitaire websites they a lot of them crush uh but yeah that's a hard question to ask so i spent 10 15 minutes on it but that was enough to tell me something very interesting so the first one that came to mind was because here's the characteristics that you need you need a game played by tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people that is not owned by a brand chess works checkers also works but the problem with checkers is it's so simple that it's not as like uh there's not as much depth to it therefore not as much of a like kind of like uh money made and passion around the sport uh sudoku was the second one that came to mind so i went to sudoku.com and sudoku.com it's just like chess.com it's like you you go to sudoku.com and there's already a sudoku board waiting for you with the clock going and it's like oh play here it is you don't need to download you don't need to sign up you don't need to do anything just play sudoku i love that then they you scroll down a little bit and you see like this advertisement for like a mobile app a mobile sudoku app so i clicked that i'm like i bet this app i bet this is an amazing distribution for this app app crushes so this company called easybrain behind it so the sudoku app that they have has 50 million downloads the uh on just google play forget about iphone that's just google that's just android um it's probably 100 million total lifetime downloads the website itself gets you know 10 to 20 million visitors a month uh so they're getting free like basically free traffic to their mobile apps where they're able to monetize and easybrain basically makes they're like a mobile app developer that makes these apps they've had over 750 million downloads lifetime of these little simple number game apps starting with sudoku then like a remix of sudoku then like another number game if you like that one and they just cross promote them within each other i bet this company is crushing it they're based in europe it looks like i have information on them i just found some interesting stuff when i googled them and went to the website there was something amazing about them that immediately stuck out and and and just this quick google it i'm wrong but it is based in cyprus anytime a company is based in cyprus it's like it turns out these guys actually are uh from like the belarus they're actually from this area but they're based in cyprus so i'll i just googled it real quick so uh do you know that it was they were acquired um three months ago no i did not know this so that's okay that's the other piece i have their revenues i have their profit and i have the uh all their user numbers and i have okay can i guess and yeah yeah i'm gonna be totally wrong but i'm i like to guess by the way little tip always guess before you hear any number that's how you get good at knowing numbers because you guess and then when you're wrong your brain remembers that and you start to hone that gut instinct okay so here's here's my guess i'm okay well uh how much were they what's their revenue i'm gonna guess that their revenue was 400 million dollars a year okay what's their um profit 90 million dollars a year pretty good um all right how much were they acquired for i'm gonna guess that they're required for 852 million dollars okay and how many um how many daily active users do they have across their 15 games i'm gonna say they have 25 million dau okay so you didn't do you didn't do horrible okay so easybrain was acquired uh last this most recent february uh they were uh acquired for 640 million dollars in stock and up to 120 25 million dollars of additional consideration if they hit it so 640 yeah what is that that isn't that exactly 850 no what's six uh what 640 plus 100 is 740 plus 25 is 765. so great job you guessed 850.

great job you're almost there um they their revenue is uh in 2020 revenues were 210 million dollars okay so you were off there by half you guessed 400 million but their profit was 70 million you guessed 90. right pretty good um they've had 750 installs over the course of their the lifetime of all their all their things all their uh games they have uh 15 live games with 12 million daily active users you guessed 25 million okay not bad not bad um what a company so okay so that was the first one i thought of and by the way i think that there's other versions of that like you know i don't know go look at like you know sudoku online.com i don't know what's that like you know right all the things people are going to google search if you can get the top level domain for those that's really interesting um so then i started looking at some others poker.com so i went to poker.com and poker.com is like kind of like this crappy like just describe what you're looking at when you go to it let me look at this but you can't this is an actual poker right this you're not betting it's not even a as you can't play there it's just like reviews here's it's like an affiliate site so it's like oh here's a place to play poker here's where you can go because they get big kickbacks for basically sending a player to poker stars or wherever if they deposit and so this is horrible what is the website um crappy kind of like affiliate and reviews site dude you could do so much more with this website like if somebody was like dude i'm gonna i have a if you have a mobile poker app that's like good i would pay like ungodly amounts of money for poker.com i think that that's a and they also if you like do their traffic search see what they get it's nothing so they should be getting a lot more traffic having poker.com um okay so then there's some other ones crosswordpuzzle.com crossword.com go to those like they don't even like crossword.com or something doesn't even like render it's like a there's like five asterisks on the screen yeah like what's going on here because crossword is the other game that's like sudoku it's like chess that people play religiously and they love we talked about how how much the new york times makes off their mini crossword game the number was uh 90 million dollars in subscription revenue from crossword puzzles for the new york times so so i am surprised at crossword puzzle across the puzzles.com crossword.com i can't believe that these sites are not being like leveraged so i was very surprised to see this and uh yeah that was my follow-up from this so you go to crosswordpuzzle.com it says please email suggestions to dkw999 at yahoo.com right so i emailed the guy so so so you see this the website is basically like a white page with a bunch of text and it's basically just very bottom things the very bottom it says this don't no this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous or unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007. right so i emailed this guy and i was like hey uh saw your website um like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to sell this and uh what's your you know what do you want this to be why do you believe like why do you believe that it should be done this way i you know i'm just super curious like what's your thought process so we'll see if he replies there's another website that's like this and bray you see if you can find the name of this i don't remember call from head but sam you might know this there is a website that's like it's like a misspelling of google.com or gmail.com i think it might be gmail.com or something like that and it's the same thing it's an all white web page that's like yeah frank and susan you know we were married in 1977 and like blah blah uh no if we're not going to put ads on the site no we did not we owned this before gmail came out it's like they basically just have this webpage that gets like and they have a counter of how much traffic they get uh and they just show that they're getting like hundreds of thousands of hits a day and like he's like refuses to monetize it refuses to sell it i think it's hilarious what what is this what uh brady do you find it i'm gonna try to find it i'll find it after the pot otherwise i i have this in my like things to tweet about uh you know folder that's actually such a funny idea oh so like if if we just looked at the most visited website and find out what the typos are for each one and go and look at what those are so like right if you go to goggle.com so g-o-g-l-e google owns it so it redirects to google most of the time the company owns like their plurals and their misspells but sometimes they don't and then those are hilarious oh my gosh i just uh i was looking at bing i change it to bang don't go there something else yeah don't go there um what else is there that's like a what's a like a like a youtube spelled wrong like you can do like facebook uh but you could do like i don't know like you you lose the a or something like that i don't know see what see what that is god that's so interesting um that that's actually an interesting thing facebook owns facebook with one oh pretty interesting that's actually an interesting thing i'm gonna research that after this of uh i don't know if you know the guy who owns bitcoin.com so this is guy roger van der or whatever i don't know his name is but he's like kind of hated in the bitcoin community by like 80 of the people because he tried to create his own fork of bitcoin so they forked bitcoin i think it's bitcoin cash or bitcoin satoshi's vision bsv i forgot which one he's associated with i think it's bitcoin cash but basically he created you know they forked bitcoin and they have their own but this guy owns bitcoin.com and uh and so he's like a billionaire guy from bitcoin and like he refuses to give up bitcoin.com but it's like it's like points to the other version of the not popular version of bitcoin you know it's like the the fifth of jonas brother who's not in the band or whatever you know it's basically like oh it's kind of a waste and but nobody can sue him because it's there's no company behind bitcoin and nobody owns the trademark oh that's a pain in the ass i hate that yeah i'm looking at it now um let's talk about um which one you want to go through we have a bunch on the agenda here um okay does this interest you well first of all i want to tell you about a company i just invested in um and i want you to criticize it or tell me if it's awesome okay oh you actually read it okay so i'm doing we just did a podcast a second ago and sean talked about angel investing i've been doing a little bit of angel investing now and my whole thing is i'm doing this thing called a syndicate i almost did a rolling fund like you but i didn't really want like a full-time job so i was like i'll just do this so it's deal by deal or not a full-time job but whatever it is for you right um and my premise is this and you confirmed it a little bit by your reaction what i'm trying to do is find interesting deals that other angel investors who i think are smarter than me or other like firms who are smarter than me are also investing in but i try to find them where they're explaining the company really poorly and i'm spending time with the founder listening to them and then i'm rewriting a memo about the company and i'm sending it to people to invest in and it's kind of working so i sent you one deck and it was really bad it was confusing um and then i just rewrote it and you're like oh i want to invest in this company maybe um and it worked and i was kind of gushing i was like dude did they write this memo like who wrote this memo i was like this is the best investment memo i've ever read you were like dude shut up i just wrote this in 20 minutes i was like no no trust me i read a lot of these things and i was like it's all the memo was so good that i had to separate the writing which was really entertaining and persuasive and likable from the business because i was like dude i don't want to just like convince myself this is a good business i want it to be a good business i you know like i love pitches where the founder can just barely explain what the hell they're doing but then i'm like oh that makes total sense and i'm like yes that's like you you get it you're not like a salesman so i'm not like gonna invest in this like hand wavy it's like no it's real and it's working and you're explaining it in kind of this nonchalant way but it's actually super legit you just don't like get really excited and animated and you don't have great words to describe it yet uh and actually i can help you with that it sounds like you're thinking about the same thing um i'm actually just thinking i'm going to simplify my thing which is like just helping them with their landing page and their communication because almost every company invests in their landing page kind of sucks and landing pages are really hard to make good but um they need a lot of help and it's like something that not every other investor is offering to do for them and they actually are not that good at doing it and so uh anyways as i got off topic but your memo was really great i actually want to like publish it in some way without like i don't know what you can do but like i feel like that should be public uh i want to point to that and be like this is great writing here's why you can go to uh you can if you like go to angelus hampton vc and you can invest if you wanted to or you could even just say you're going to invest and then like look at it um and then once it's done i'll you can publish it or i'll publish it but they uh this company it's lobby.com l-o-b-b-i-e.com uh it's so funny because he actually did something really good basically and this kind of sounds like simple and negative but it's it's it's a cool company i've invested in it they it's basically software that helps doctors uh schedule appointments or patients schedule appointments with doctors in a in a just a good way and it's kind of like an archaic space but he was like we're making the lobby digital and like and i that's so much better than creating than say we are creating software that's just a crm for a doctor's office and i'm like they're like no we're making the lobby room the lobby digital we're going to save people so much time and so basically the software what it does is that you can you can schedule an appointment online and they'll alert you if the doctor is running late and when you get in the parking lot you can tell them so you just wait your car and they'll tell you when to come in yada yada yada um i mean it's like the interesting thing about it is the guy has already started and sold the company in the space and uh it's at worst going to be okay at best might be big right um anyway i just thought it was so interesting how it was digitizing the lobby or the waiting room of healthcare and i just wanted to bring that up because i think it's so cool how they repositioned that to make something that isn't that cool sound kind of neat right yeah you know that that's that's a skill that's like a superpower in and of itself uh i don't have a ton of thoughts on the business itself so i don't have too much to add there but i agree with you basically the most interesting part of talking about lobby was your memo was so damn good and i think we should uh show it to people so that they could see how do you explain how do you make a business seem really juicy to be a part of uh to invest in because i think you did a good job of that well that's what and that's what we're gonna do so what i'm doing it with joe and i'll you and i will probably do a bunch together i hope we're all investing yours and you mine and the whole thing is i'm not trying to sell people i'm not trying to convince people to do it um you either want to do it or you don't like i'm not going to try and convince you to do it because that's that's kind of unethical but i just want to paint the business in the most positive light or at least what i believe it to be accurate like an accurate it is cool and i want to make sure you know it's cool and i think that this whole copywriting thing for angel investing might end up being a a hit yeah i think it'll be it'll be easy for you to to get people into your round because people like you and the memos are good so i think i think those will be those will be good i have a company i wanted to tell you about that's a cool company um that i think you're gonna have a good opinion on so uh have you seen what keith reboy is doing as his new startup no so you know who he is yeah so he's the guy who uh uh he was like ex-paypal then he was the coo of square he's kind of a known investor at founders fund then he started he's a known asshole like people think that he's a total on twitter super hilarious to follow because he's a just absolute jerk to people um you know his like number one tweet is just like wrong the period and he won't tell you why he won't argue back he just calls you an idiot and then if you like try to argue he's like this is why i'm i was more successful at the age of 27 than you are at 40.

and he just like rips people like that and like who does that that's nobody does that so i think that's just like really crazy and entertaining to me um but anyways he's doing so he did opendoor and what opendoor is is now is like a publicly listed company because it did us back and open door is a multi-billion dollar company and basically it was like selling your house is a time consuming and stressful process what if like the day you want to sell you could just sell your house right away give you a price you say yes or no and uh that's what opendoor did so they basically would just buy your house and then they had a lot of data to know how much to buy your house for and then they were the brokers they could keep the broker fee for themselves buying and selling and then they would sell it within like 90 days hopefully and they do this in a whole bunch of markets like arizona and stuff like that and so they've done very well you know kind of like on paper and like zillow now like does the same thing to try to compete with them they kind of changed the way that the business model of these big real estate companies worked where now like the money to be made is in basically like auto buying your auto buying your house and then reselling it for you and using a bunch of technology to do that anyways his new company he's starting uh with with jack jack abraham is uh called open store and so you have open door and now you have open store i know they haven't released a bunch of details but i think i know what it is which is it is open door for buying businesses so it's the same idea for buying i think it's going to be specialized in online businesses but maybe not um where basically you just say here's my business and then they say here's your offer we'll buy it off you and um and so i don't know if this is going to be specialized like e-commerce roll-ups like a thrasio um i don't know if it's going to be online and offline like uh where did you learn about this and what what can i go is there a website yet uh they announced it so i heard about it a few weeks ago like six weeks ago maybe and i was like oh that's super interesting how did you hear about this so somebody told me about it because their friend interviewed at the company and so that's like the only way you could know about it because like when you interview they like kind of tell you the premise of the company and that guy was like oh dude you know he's always doing a new thing it's basically open door for buying businesses and i was like oh that's sick uh that's a great idea because buying selling your business is also just like but it's even more than buying a home in terms of time consuming stressful uncertain on what price you're going to get uncertain what price it even should be and um and the marketplace is to do that online like buy biz buy biz sell or whatever that website is like.com buy biz sell they're so like old school you know like on how they do that and so um so i think there's like room for improvement there so i found that to be really interesting let me bring this up real quick which is it's so crazy how often internet marketers who often are accused of being sleazy and many of them are i mean they're they're accused of being that because they are but they're often ahead of the game so for example email marketing email newsletters are all the rage right now uh scammy guys like i don't think this guy's actually scammy but david d'angelo used to sell dating books in the 1990s by having these long emails i just stole and copied from him um the other thing is paid memberships paid memberships have been a thing for decades now guys like greg your friend our friend greg is doing a paid community thing and greg's like a cool guy um and so it's like it's like cool to do it um and there's so many more and this is another one buying and selling businesses online has been a thing that internet marketers so for example flippa where you buy affiliate websites that's been a thing for years empire flippers is another one empire builders yeah empire builders and if you go as empire flippers or empire builders i think those are actually two different things but they but if you go to those websites you're gonna a lot of people are gonna be immediately turned off you're gonna think what the is this and startup guys like us we just come in i guess that's what we are we just come in and we take this stuff that these guys have been doing for years and we just say put some lipstick on it yeah one 2.0 make it a flat beautiful color uh it's so funny because like cool this sounds neat but this isn't unique right uh yeah i i think you know there's no unique ideas really there's you know remixes of ideas there's old ideas that you make new there's new platforms but but i think it's cool and i think it could be big uh it's one i'm going to keep my eye on then i saw another business like this so i started to put together a little bit of a pattern here and i said oh what is open door for x so what other parts of life and and uh and the world could use instant liquidity because that's what this is it's basically taking something that was kind of illiquid like your house and it takes a lot of time to get liquid where you actually sell the thing and takes a lot of you know you got to like you got to move out you got to stage it you got to repaint it you got to get a broker you got to list it you got to do tours no instant liquidity we buy your house today don't do any of that um same thing with your buying your business what else needs that and then i saw another one and this business is called um i grabbed the name but it's basically doing this for used electronics it's called backflip just got funded and backflip is basically saying we'll instantly buy any of your used electronics and uh because that's not a new thing either and and i think it's awesome and so it's not that it's new it's basically that there is a big swing being taken by people who are going to try to do this at scale using like the modern kind of internet marketing and models to do it and so like you know like we buy gold or whatever what else is billboards cards you know like gift cards yeah exactly like um and there's like a gift card there's actually a gift card startup that crushes uh that that basically took the old model and just doesn't knew what's it called raise i think raised yeah i'm on their website right now i'm looking at raise.com holy i can look at the traffic and just tell you these guys are printing money yeah raise is going to be like a billion dollar plus win uh and nobody even like hears about this company nobody talks about this company but you know super simple business of like you know gift card the gift card business resale of gift cards essentially and so uh so anyways i'm interested in this open door for x which is basically instant liquidity for things that were pretty that's interesting all right let's play off that so houses okay there's equity zen which i think is badass uh so equity zen also equity zen kind of looks more like flippa than it does like open door meaning like it's kind of hard to get in it's kind of obtuse you got to like sign up to see shit not everything is there it's like a 10-step process to do an investment it's like equity zen is not like it's not robin hood on my phone where i could just like do my thing and so like secondary shares yeah it's like a shitty name like i don't know like it's just bad all around and forge global or was the other one it's like also bad i don't know i feel like somebody's gonna do this better carta is trying to card x is trying to do this better um right now which is like secondary shares of private companies yeah i'm not a fan of carta but um i could see them doing well but i'm not i'm not a fan of carta so i don't know if i want them to be the best at this um angel is also trying to do it there's a bunch of people trying to do this second trying to do open door trying to do what they're trying to do is a little bit different they're just still trying to do the marketplace what open door did was different it wasn't like open door wasn't just another housing marketplace it was i will buy the thing off you right now because i know what i can sell it for um and i'll i'm comfortable with this five percent spread that i will i will keep so you give up five percent of your upside but you get the certainty of it being done now and um i'm comfortable in that five percent spread so somebody would need to do this for secondary shares where they just go you want to sell your your company stock done and then i will figure out how to flip this thing on the other side with my own spread so there's a few people that have done this with furniture and furniture is really hard because furniture doesn't ship well yeah um but there is if you i don't know if you know i mean i buy i like buying used furniture because you can get like ten thousand dollar couches for like three grand um and oftentimes they're really nice used furniture is not really a thing on the internet uh or at least it's not hugely popular but you could i think there is still an interesting way you can do this with used furniture right um so i think trading cards is one so i know a lot of people that have sports cards they collected as a kid it's in their attic somewhere it's in a box they kind of heard oh cards are worth something but they don't like they don't know what they have they don't know what it's worth they don't have them graded they didn't send them into psa and pay the money to get them graded so i think if somebody basically did the shoebox model where you basically say put it all in a shoebox and mail it to us and we will pay you for it uh we'll do all the work of figuring out what it's worth and then we'll pay you you know 70 cents on the dollar for for what it's worth and like today you're getting nothing for it and like that that's the and if you don't like our offer we'll send it back and i think that if somebody did that they could just hoover up all the long tail of like trading cards that are out there um that people are not doing anything with that they want to monetize that's interesting okay so uh we've we've we've furniture is not that good trading cards pretty interesting because it's a lot easier cars everyone a lot of people do cars carvana does cars and i think that that is so sick they're a multi-billion dollar is that the same model they use where they'll instantly buy your car off you yeah like they'll buy it in a matter of minutes which if you told me this like years ago i'd be like no way that can't be done but they made uh 5.6 billion dollars last year in sales so it works okay so it's working open door for cars it's working yeah yeah totally works um what else is interesting what's a huge thing like what's what are some of the bigger assets that you possibly have in your life that you want to wow carvana's market cap is 45 billion dollars holy yeah it's working um what else is there i don't know there's gonna be some obscure like oh like life insurance policy payouts or something like you know like something like that that i'm like i don't even know that space but that makes sense it takes you know it's something that you get or like social security like i know like my parents are getting to the age where they can collect social security like would they take a lump sum of all their social security now and you know at at 70 cents or 72 cents on the dollar and then you know this company just collects the payments over time like probably i don't know like there's a lot of people who would make that trade dude did you know this so there's this uh a company i have to go and look at what it is but you guys could probably google it actually but i think some banks do it like goldman will do it but if you have a winning lottery ticket they'll buy it off you right and they'll give you the money up front and it's structured in such a way where they're they're still able to make their profit but they'll buy lottery tickets from you like we're talking like 10 million dollar lottery tickets or seven figure uh i uh it's kind of interesting people buy winning lottery tickets off of people that's actually kind of an interesting one um i would actually need to do some research how many people do how much money do you think is one in the lottery per year oh dude i have no idea i mean i feel like the weekly lottery the powerball every week is like you know between 50 and like 200 million dollars it's like it's like that's that's like on a weekly basis that it's now it doesn't get one every week that's how it accrues and that's how it gets bigger but like you know i don't know you do you have the number in front of you i feel like it's gonna look at it i don't know no i i uh no i i can't find it there's 1600 lotteries created each year so there's at least 1600 unique winners um no i don't i don't have the numbers but lottery tickets is might actually be kind of interesting because you said the life insurance i'm like what do you wait to get paid for that you would take a discounted upfront payment lotteries is kind of is actually kind of interesting um and i do know that some banks actually do that right you know who else does that is whitey bulger you remember whitey bulger i've never even heard that those words in my life do you do you know the movie the departed yes you know jack nicholas's character okay yes it's modeled after whitey bulger he was a gangster in uh boston he was an italian or irish mafia guy he uh a mobster guy he ended up going to jail recently they found him and they um um he got beat to death in jail so it was like a a crazy ending to the story of him he was america's most wanted man for like 20 years and um anyway he as part of his story he won the lottery three times and the way that he did it is people who had won the lottery that in the neighborhood they would have to go to him and he would buy it from you and he would go and catch the ticket and uh so this is like a famous like the numbers game they call it that's like a famous mafia thing wow okay i had no idea um yes i don't know maybe maybe if people have good ideas on what what part of life could use instant liquidity uh i'm curious to see to see what that that would be um okay so a couple other things i wanted to bring up one is a pain point or kind of a business opportunity maybe this exists if it exists tell me because i want to use this service so in e-commerce most e-commerce brands are just local in their own geography so most are let's say most us e-commerce brands basically just sell in the us and then it takes time and then you start selling in canada and then you start selling in europe and then you you know but it takes a long time and the reason it takes a long time is because of the like international logistics so for example you want to ship something to canada they have to pay like pretty heavy duty like a import duty on the product so you sell like a 50 product they're gonna have to pay like 20 of import taxes in addition to the shipping so it just becomes like irresponsible to buy uh and still some customers do because they can only get the product from the us-based company but it really sucks and then the company has to like fill out this form that says these goods are worth 14 and then you submit that at the thing and then it's just annoying right and so i think there should be a company so there's these brands trying to do these e-commerce roll-ups i think you should do it differently i think some enterprising entrepreneur can basically say look i will boot up your canadian operation today i'll boot up your uk operation your france operation yeah i'll do europe i'll do uk i'll do um australia whatever right so basically say i'll import your brand today you do no work so all you have to do is you need to ship me this product to this warehouse so here's the address ship me your products uh i need like you know whatever your normal inventory is ship 10 to me and let's see how i do and basically you get one giant warehouse where you're warehousing for all the brands that you're going to work with and you just say look in exchange for doing this you pay me no money i will start generating sales for you but i want a royalty i want a royalty of 10 cents or 15 cents for every dollar but what's your point what like how is this how is this interesting or new uh because i don't know of a brand that does this that exists so you know my wife has an e-commerce brand we sell in the us i would love to be making more money by selling in europe but the time the operational overhead to go to europe right now is just crazy so why aren't there more people that are reaching out to e-commerce store owners and basically saying i will run your international operation and make it a low risk to no risk proposition for them in order to do so and i think there's a lot of money to be made given the number of e-commerce brands in the us and how you could if you're in brazil or you're in australia or you're in canada or wherever i think you could become the leading trusted like kind of like we're we are your canada go to canada go to market plan for canada and we just do all the work for you this is actually quite common in media so there's business insider india there's business insider australia there's business insider germany i believe um and then uh uh i think i believe the wall street journal does the same thing for those same countries but it's it uh there is buzzfeed france uh huff po france huff po australia it's actually pretty common in media um and i runs those so so is it run out of the us or they hire a team there or it's a local team there that just licenses the brand basically when they report the revenue it's under licensing and so i don't exactly know what that means though because i was trying i was thinking about us and i was like man we have a lot of people who are uh english as a second language folks uh in germany so like uh i got germany i guess is one of the most populous i don't i don't know numbers i guess it's one of the most populous places in europe it's uh very business focused so you know the germans liked us um same with australia australians loved us and i was like yeah let's go do it but what the fuck do i do do i just fly over there and just start recruiting like it's it's crazy i would love to partner with someone and then another thing is in particular china and japan and there's actually a whole word for this there's a word i can't remember what the word is but there's a word that describes why it's difficult to break into japan um and the reason is is that once it's hard to break into an island in particular japan and i would love to have paid someone to be like hey can you be my japanese uh yeah consigliary like my my capo on the ground those are all mob terms because i'm i'm into the mafia now uh can you be my my guy on the street of japan and let me know is this good am i getting the right people i think that's incredibly interesting yeah exactly so i'm i'm not saying that this doesn't exist i'm saying there's still a lot of room there because i know a lot of people i have a lot of friends who are doing e-commerce right we we host club ltv there's you know 75 to 100 e-commerce brands each doing over a million dollars a year in there and every single one of them i think has the same problem which is that we're all us focused and why are we us focused because it would be too much of a lift too much of a lift to go figure out how to do australia it's too small of a pie to like do manpower on or spread brain power on but if somebody in australia was like hey look this is what we do this is our business model we help you get sales here and we just take our cut and uh and so i just think that like there needs there's more opportunity for this and that's cool that in media it sounds like there's also an opportunity to do it in media too or it's being done in some way by the big players it's being done in some way but like i remember when buzzfeed uh like we're going through some troubles they had a layoff like their whole french office and i was like buzzfeed has a french office what the fuck well that's the opposite right that's we have a french office and then you have to do things like that when it's like not working out i'm saying no investment no consulting fees you just take a royalty on sales and these are all incremental sales that i wasn't getting otherwise and you take care of the whole operational headache in this case for e-commerce about like i just ship your goods to your warehouse you ship it to local customers customers don't have to overpay customers don't have to do import duties uh for every order they make and so i just think that there's a opportunity in e-commerce to like be the the go-to brand for every d2c brand to partner with in each of these locales what country would you go to next um i think europe is probably the best because you want um what though you know the next wealthiest high populous place um but really it could work anywhere it's just like the biggest market is doing it you know throughout europe now europe is made up of so many countries maybe that's a pain in the ass if not like canada's the no-brainer australia next japan is a good one um those are be the ones india maybe like for example i know a bunch of people in india who did this so uh my dad introduced me to these guys and i was like oh wow why these guys is how their house is humongous how you know what do they do it's like oh yeah they um they partnered with jockey underwear and they just became the jockey like seller here you have exclusive rights to sell jockey in india next guy at the dinner table what do you do oh we're the dominoes guys in india what yeah we're their exclusive franchisee of dominoes for india um okay what does that mean well we have like india didn't really eat pizza before this so we're like teaching people to eat pizza they love it turns out and so we have like you know 9 000 dominoes throughout india now like oh my god what is going on here uh so like you know local franchisee but for what's this called what's the term it out what's the term for this i don't know you know maybe i should have gone to business school i think it's probably just like in brick and mortar i think it's just called franchising um franchising was the way to spread geographically you know when your brick and mortar can only scale so fast uh that's how you would do it you would franchise out and then the franchise would pay a royalty back to the back to the master franchise of the brand of their sales and they're the local operator but with e-commerce or with digital media it's a little bit different but it kind of has the same problem so i don't know if there's a new word for it man i think this is wildly fascinating this is that i didn't think it was that interesting at first but now i know what you're talking about where uh i've heard so many stories of the same thing but not maybe not of india but i am the official uh importer of x y and z yeah we're the distributor of x or like for you just think about for your business right like what could you have sold for more if you had like 250 000 you know or like 500 000 subscribers in japan and like dude i think there's a world where i would have been where i could have made more money in those markets than i did in america because even though america has more people um i don't think the french or i don't think that the germans um i don't think facebook kicks as much ass over there as it does here with instagram and everything and i so i think the ad markets because i i do think that europe sorry europeans if you're listening i do think that you guys are five or ten years behind when it comes to some technology stuff um and the ad markets suck because of facebook and google so like if you could still capture a little bit of that revenue i think you could well i don't know if any of that's true but i what i do know is that it's true trust me as you're building well i think like everybody uses facebook everywhere so that's the part i'm saying i don't know um well sorry but what i mean is like old media still does quite well abroad okay that's fair that's fair uh the thing i'm just saying is like if while you were building your us business and all your employees are focused on your us business if somebody said i love your product i'd love to license the brand from you or or i'd love to be your partner and in the uk or in japan or in australia and i will build i will use the same playbook it'll be under your company i just want my cut for building this for you because i'm taking your proof you would have done it in a heartbeat right and so the fact that you didn't means there was an opportunity for some entrepreneur that should have been reaching out to you saying this is a no-lose proposition you still own it you still make money off of it it's still your name brand i just get to go i get to basically take your brand take your head take your product and localize it or distribute it here where i'm from and i know the market yeah and my products way easier than yours it was right because it's pixels it's not anything real and i would have loved to have done that and i used to have people emailing me all the time and then we had a bunch of people in russia some people in mexico who would just verbatim copy our shit and i would say i would have to i'd find it and i'd be like you guys stop this you're not allowed to do this and then i'd have other people who'd email me and be like hey can i could you stop anyone from doing that i feel like you can't do if somebody takes your newsletter and they just word for word transcribe it in russia and they're like we're called whatever hustle are you no there's nothing you could do the only thing that i was able to do the only thing i was able to do we had someone do this in italian we had someone do it in russian and we had someone do it in mexico uh yeah mexico and i basically shamed them i said like i'm just gonna i'm just gonna call you out and so i would tweet at them or i would email them uh i i would just would make it well known and my network was large enough that someone of someone knew them and they were embarrassed knock off and they yeah and they stopped doing it but no i couldn't do shit yeah and i had people email me all the time saying hey can i do this for uh spain and i would say yeah but i don't really know anything about you i don't know if you've got good taste i don't like i don't i know nothing about you and i would just throw it off to the side and just kind of forget about it but i wish i would have done it i'm surprised this doesn't happen more i'm surprised there's not just like freemedia.com based in cyprus that basically takes all the content from behind the paywall of wall street journal and just says cool if if you ever hit a paywall come here look like input the input the url you're trying to go to here's the article for free i'm surprised somebody hasn't just tried to do that like it's totally bootleg it's piracy right but like it is so hard to enforce that stuff i can't believe that somebody internationally isn't doing that that seems like the way to do it do you know what outline.com is i know about it and i know i don't know what i could say publicly about it but uh yeah i know explain it i don't have any insider information so maybe you do i don't explain what someone so outline.com it's uh the tagline is read and annotate without distractions frankly i have no idea what that means but the way that i use it and the way that everyone else uses it is when you come across a paywall website you put the url into outline.com and you can see the whole article um it just it doesn't work for everything i don't think it works for new york times but uh you can get you can get you can get a bunch of sites they they kind of stopped working on but initially it worked on everything and uh the person behind this is somebody we know that's like a well-known kind of tech person that works at one of the big companies and was like they had to like distance themselves it was getting like millions of vits like people were using this thing and they had to distance themselves from it because they're like oh yeah like i was kind of told i had to knock it off he's like i didn't make it for that purpose it just it works that way but uh yeah is it a brazilian no site oh my god oh okay i uh yeah yeah i see yeah i know who you're talking about how interesting outline.com what the heck it's that big i just googled that uh or i just looked at similar about how big it was outline.com crazy fascinating yeah so so i think that one's cool um all right i'll bring you how did we do on the wait hold on yeah just quick question does outline.com make money i don't think so i don't know i have no idea wow this person is so interesting all right uh that's it that's the episode uh by the way for the people listening we actually just did like a q a before this it was sean i think it was too much talking we got to do the q a on the second half because oh yeah i'm exhausted right now but like i feel like the blood is drained from my body right now i'm tired from listening i'm like how the the fuck is going i'm so dead i can't if we're gonna do two hours again we have to do the heavy lifting in the front i tried to keep the energy high but like in my brain and my i also haven't eaten anything today so i'm just like dying on all fronts right now i'm hurting i'm hurting yeah una is going to be a separate episode dude so we are we're getting two episodes out of this yeah we gotta i can't do it next time yeah i thought we would be able to but yeah this is painful maybe this is hard for another one tomorrow yeah i can do another one tomorrow i can do i can do one a day easy uh i think i think i can yeah we'll have to try something else if we want to continue the q a's i like that i thought the q a was almost better than the actual episode maybe because you guys retired but the q a came out a lot better than i thought i think people are going to like both of those yeah no the whole thing is good so good job guys i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back
