world has changed where there's now this like robotic arm that's a general purpose robotic arm so think of it like an iphone right it's a piece of hardware that you could buy that you could program to do anything right so when when steve jobs came out with the iphone they were like this is an iphone it can access the internet it has a gps inside and it can make phone calls like that's what it could do and from there you guys figure out the rest right like initially they didn't have the app store but then when they did have the app store now all of a sudden you get the flashlight app and then the app that turns you know it's like a ruler uses the camera to like measure something then you get like strava it's like we'll use the gps to do this thing so it's basically like a programmable general purpose tool so that's what's happening with these robotic arms all right we're live bro what's up listen listen to this thing i'm going to tell you something i uh you know have been being really healthy this summer and didn't eat a lot of sugar didn't have no sugar other than like fruits and fruits and vegetables and like just no sugar added today i decided today was my planned cheat day after three months of like doing this and i ate some ice cream um i feel miserable yeah the cheat day is always underwhelming it's always like i'm looking forward to it i'm planning for it then i start doing it i don't even feel good while i'm eating it well it's like it's like um when you drink and then the next day you're hung over you're like why did i do that but then you immediately do it again like a few days later i kind of feel like that except instead of like three days it's like it's 10 minutes so like i eat something and 10 minutes later i'm feeling horrible i'm like oh it there's still some left though i should probably do it oh my god i feel so sick you have such an extreme personality you you always go to these extremes um you also i feel like this is also why people hate uh like fit people is because they like have these types of problems and normal people are just like what are you talking about uh like what is the big deal why are you doing this to yourself why are you waking up in the middle of the night thinking about ice cream it's like uh the way that you know the way that some people get annoyed about like crossfitters and you know like people who love to talk about intermittent fasting i think there's people who feel that way about us with business and money which is just like dude not everything's a business it's okay and i would say that if we succeed we need to succeed in creating people that are as annoying as crossfitters as our fans i think that's my new goal yeah you need freaks and here you've got you you're at a huge disadvantage you know why right it's because you are what i like to call emotionally stable you have too much emotional health uh good emotional health in order to uh you know be extreme like some people i'm reading this great book about uh leaders and how the guy the author looks at a lot of like uh interesting leaders who we like like so for example abe lincoln's one of the most written about i think the most written about american figure ever winston churchill uh a bunch of people like that and he basically his whole theory is that during okay times uh a mentally stable leader is could be adequate but during bad times mentally unstable leaders typically are the best at leading because they understand like the ups and downs they uh are kind of like crazy enough kind of like when an entrepreneur like invent something or start something versus the type of person who just runs it and runs it like even keel and they're like well you kind of need some extremes or extreme times and it like analyzes history on emotionally unstable people and looks at like oh they're actually the best during bad times well i think people underestimate this because in theory it sounds like you want somebody who is stable in theory you want let's say you join a startup or a small company you want it to be like oh how do we make decisions you know we we talk about it as a group we get a bunch of different perspectives and then we sort of all chime in with what we think and we go with you know maybe the majority it's like a democracy and actually that doesn't work in startups uh it is not the norm and that would be the outlier if it was to work the the norm is what they call the benevolent dictator so it's basically we agree for better or for worse that person's the the captain they're the captain and we're going on their ship and either we're going down or we're going to the promised land and that's how the best startups work is they pick a captain and they just go ride or die with that person and they say look for better for worse we need to make decisions fast so one person's going to always be faster than a committee we need to be extremely decisive so we can't be torn constantly by warring you know one group wants a the other group wants b we can't have that uh three we need it to be a little bit extreme because look we're trying to do an extreme thing here so maybe we need an extra bit of an extreme leader and so i think in companies you actually want a dictatorship and people don't like that they're uncomfortable with that because that's not what you want in your country maybe or that's not what you want in your you know your local city but it is what you want in a company and it is what you want on any creative project is kind of my view you want kind of a crazy genius who's going to be the creative force driving the thing and everybody else get on board or get off and uh that's that's how you ran the hustle that's how i run my companies it is definitely the way when it comes to to creating new stuff from scratch yeah and it actually makes sense and let me uh explain how i was and you tell me if you're the same way but if you look at like with the ceo like it doesn't really matter if there's a 30 percent uh not approval rating it's just like do the numbers like does it work you know for a publicly traded company it's like uh it didn't matter unfortunately or fortunately the way you look at it doesn't matter if you're an asshole did the numbers go up and did you achieve what you said you're going to achieve and so it doesn't matter if your employees i mean it matters if it becomes a retention problem but if it just if you have a 10 approval rating but your numbers are great it's great if you have a 10 approval rating and you're the president of america well you're you're jobless you know what i mean like you're not going to win the next election so it's just like all about appeasing to one and because of that we get used to this idea of like democracy and like you know i don't want to be led this is like you know don't lead me just like get me involved and so i remember when i started my company i was like yeah that's how i'm going to run it like look it's this is like a meritocracy we are all here working together and it is that but it is definitely more like hey i'm the boss i will take input in from everyone i'm making the decision and this is the way that we're going to go and it's my job to make sure that you feel inspired to be here and all this other stuff and i remember feeling really self-conscious about that and then there'd be times where i wasn't the leader like for example when i joined hubspot or maybe when you and i work on this podcast it's like well i'm not exactly the boss and i actually felt a lot of security and comfort when i said hey who's the boss of this project and you just say uh is this person the boss great hey boss uh what you know make your decision please and i felt actually good about like being a follower and then i realized that maybe i think my employees when i'm the boss like you have to have a boss i think and when you are the boss it's kind of cool but also very stressful but when you're not the boss it's like yeah i'm okay taking this role and i recognize we need a leader just tell me what to do right yeah what do they call it one neck to choke it's like there needs to be one neck to choke when it comes to any situation or any problem like if it's like if i don't know who's in charge if i don't know who's who actually makes the call then you lose one really powerful thing which is accountability and uh and so i think that's that's really important i think that uh you're absolutely right i don't mind whether i'm the person or i'm not the person in charge i just like that there is a person in charge i want a benevolent dictatorship because that's what i've had personally seen work best i remember when we were uh when i was at twitch and we did uh the first executive off-site so it's like i don't know the the sort of like 15 exact leaders in the company go to whatever some fancy place they have a spread of you know like whatever tea and crumpets and it's even busters in daily city yeah fridays you go to fridays during happy hour potato skins and the nuclear margarita yeah yeah you eat a loaded potato and you you start to decide the future of the company you got to feel like your customers you know you got to go to the applebee's and you got to get the nachos so the the ceo and the ceo they get up there and they say hey look we we read the results from the last the last offset we did last quarter and it seemed like the big thing you guys wanted was you felt like the decision making was too top down and you didn't have a say and you feel it felt like your ideas either weren't heard or you know the groups you know it was it was all just sort of mandated from above and you just had to execute you didn't feel empowered so this time we're doing it different and they like spent the whole day and it was like what are your ideas children and then everybody writes down their ideas on sticky notes like awesome let's do a color voting system everybody vote on your top three and you're like uh and then you go through this like you know uh so you want to do a commercial with the rolling stones sean you know that that that cost a million dollars but okay we'll we'll take that into account yeah who here who here keeps writing billboards are back back from where what is this idea about right so it's like you basically and then you go through this whole day process where everybody's talking about it and you could tell the exact in a way they're interested but they're also like biting their tongue a bit because they're like look all right we said we're not going to just like slam in with our opinion and just overrule everything and be like guys it's obvious we're doing one two and three what are we talking about here and so they didn't do that they let everybody do their things great come up and we leave the off site fast forward either the next quarter of the quarter after that so three or six months later we go for the next off site it's like oh we're in the feedback uh we feel like we just don't know how decisions are being made uh we kind of wish that the leadership would just step in and give us clear direction on what we're going to do like hey we're ready we just need some clarity from you guys it's called the long con man that this is the long time and so they basically were like here we'll let you you know try this and i was just like am i the only one in the room that just remembers what the last feedback was which is the exact opposite which is like it's too top down and now it's like are the leaders going to be leaders or not like we need clarity your job is to give us these decisions like uh we feel like you're just sitting back and then now it's mayhem and it's like and so that was like the affirmation of something i always believed the second part there's this uh there's a skit from the chapelle show where he wants to get oprah pregnant so he uh you know he wants to have oprah's baby and he gets her pregnant and goes gotcha and uh like that's how that's how i feel emmet is just like saying to himself after like three months he's like gotcha you guys said yeah the dave chapelle gotcha clip i'm pregnant are you sure it's mine listen it's yours gotcha bitch what the uh the second thing is wartime and peacetime i think this also matters a lot so you want this sort of like dictatorship when it is wartime and for for a startup there for a company there's usually two war times there's the beginning when you're nobody you have no customers no product no direction you have no market share no nothing and then if you start to succeed you will hopefully enter some version of peacetime where it's like the thing is working we don't need to every day wake up and worry about dying or killing our competitors or like all the stuff like maybe you're working on you know maintenance fixing bugs maybe you're working on um talking to customers and making sure you support you know things that you kind of push by the wayside now there's more time to go do those things properly you work on security we work on server robustness whatever it is the same thing but more and better a little bit every time yeah you don't need to go and conquer new lands you're basically taking your existing land and saying oh you know we need to fix up some things around here that we ignored during the wartime rush but then you enter wartime again inevitably and that's when you know the competitive landscape changes you know a new platform gets released competitors emerge um whatever and the economy changes and being able to shift between those two gears is pretty tough i think very few leaders can be the best wartime ceo and the best peacetime ceo usually you're one or the other you're an amazing peacetime or amazing wartime and then you sort of stay too long during when the when the when the season shifts and so i think that's the other thing to recognize because people will always say oh this person's good or bad and it's like well actually maybe they're just amazing at one season and the season has changed and now a different type of person would actually be best for what's going on now and so uh that's the other thing about like kind of this dictatorship stuff that you got to know is like what season are we in if we're in wartime i want a wartime ceo if we're in peacetime i need a peacetime ceo and i need to know when to shift i always hated saying this because there's so many people who died and it was so bad for so many people but i remember thinking like dude covid was awesome like i loved i loved being in the trenches you know like it was actually quite exciting it's exciting now because i know how the story ends and things end well at the time i was quite scared but looking back i was like oh i feel alive like this is this is yeah and honestly i kind of hate the war uh metaphor because you know first of all there's people who are actually in war so yeah that's true this is a it's a borrowed it's a borrowed term term and they didn't give us permission um the second thing is you know our war is fought literally at a keyboard with clicks firing left and right and so you know there's a part of me that just feels very lame it's like yeah i felt so alive when i was logging into google analytics every morning and checking out you know what was going it's like well do you acknowledge that you're kind of a soft right like it's like okay yeah as long as i acknowledge that then it's okay to continue this yeah this metaphor but let's acknowledge it is a metaphor it is not like real in any any way but i know what you mean which was that when these big shake-ups happen or there's a downturn where most people's reaction is oh i'm sure you know this is bad for me and they just go with the sheep of like it's bad for me versus a lot of other people recognize hey this is happening whether i like it or not and given that it's happening the questions i need to ask are what opportunities does this open up for me where does this where what am i now going to get strong and that i was otherwise weakened what have i been neglecting that now it's time to put my focus on right like just ask yourself better questions then you start to focus on cool i'm going to take market share in this area i'm gonna i'm gonna quickly pounce on this thing that i've otherwise been neglecting that i now matters a lot or hey oh now that everybody's comfortable with remote work and stuff like what that opens up this new opportunity for us and just ask better questions and you'll get better answers dude speaking of so i've got two topics here that are like kind of related to like mad men and crazy people the first have you ever heard of this guy named brad uh brett adcock no have you heard of this company called vetery do you remember vetery not really okay but no i don't i couldn't tell you what it is so this guy named brett adcock he i just met him recently and he joined our community and i began to know him listen to this guy's background so he's 36 years old he's from central illinois and in around 2012 2015 he started a company called vetery and it's nothing particularly sexy it was just basically like a job site and it was a little bit like hired.com and eventually hired.com tried to bully vetery hired.com was also a similar business a job board but like you know more in depth more technology and they raised north of 100 million fast forward five or six years later vetery ended up buying hired.com when hired.com went bankrupt and so vetery was basically a job website to help people recruit engineers raised 10 million dollars eventually was acquired for 120 ish about 100 150 i think so this guy brett he's 36 now so back then when it was acquired that was in like 2015 so he was in his 20s he made low digit tens of millions of dollars so he didn't tell me but i would imagine in the 20 million dollar range but here's what he did tell me listen to this he put 100 of his money minus a little bit of cash that he put down for a down payment for a house so when i say 100 he told me he goes i didn't own any outside equities i owned nothing i had my down payment my house and 100 of the earnings that i made which was low tens of the million tens of millions put into the business bank account and then he started a company called archer so basically they make like these car they some people call them flying cars they're basically like helicopters uh helicopters but they kind of look like a car body and i was like how did you learn about this and he said i learned it all on my own i read 50 engineering books and built three generations of electric aircraft in 2018 at the university of florida where i was doing engineering courses as an undergrad i had to build a lab there to have facilities big enough in 2018. 2018. and so he with owning zero public equities outside of archer the archer stock he makes zero outside investments and he said because he needs extreme focus and we put all this money in archer archer eventually does a spac i believe they did a spac but they but they went public so they sold like a billion dollars worth of these flying vehicles to united airlines or something like that takes it public for three or four billion dollars now the stock is you know like most stocks in the in the growth space is it doing so hot but i still think it's a billion dollar uh company and his net worth skyrockets to a billion i think now it's in the three or four hundred range and makes all this money from archer and now i can't talk about his new startup but i can soon he's told me he took basically 200 million dollars and he's put all of it into his new company and still to this day he goes the only stock that i own is archer and my house that's like the only outside investments and then now the new business and so i go you know is your wife and family okay with this he goes i've been doing i've been going all in and been doing this for 20 years they're used to it now by now and i said well what do you what do you think about people who say you know you're kind of nuts why don't you square away a little bit of money while you can and he goes i don't care what people think i just want to build the future and this guy he's not like one of these elon musk types where he's like hard to talk to and you like ask him a question he can't he's like you know so smart that he that he can't articulate it he's like fairly normal i guess normal in quotation marks but he's like easy ish to he's easy to talk to he's a personal personable charismatic guy and you're like oh you seem very reasonable and then he says he does this stuff and i'm like you are insane you're a madman and so really interesting guy totally under the radar from central illinois he's only 36 years old so i got along with him because i'm from missouri really fascinating dude and i'm on his twitter he's talking only about this thing called pole star is that his new thing or that's pole star is a pole star is like a subsidiary or their partner with volvo and they make really cool cars is that what the tweet is about i i don't know yeah he's just talking about pole star cars the whole time okay uh wow amazing so uh so that's incredible so they basically is it the are they actually planes are they what they call vtol like vertical uh takeoff and landing the second one so kind of like a helicopter-ish it looks like a helicopter it looks like four blades four helicopter blades attached to like you know a honda civic right and why do you need this what does this do differently than a helicopter i have no idea i feel like question here's sam's question does he ask you know it's usually name where you're from and then instead of like you know what do you do it's like what other equities do you own and like how much of your personal net worth are you reloading into your next company wow okay let's focus on that i don't even want to know why why you've created no idea what the actual helicopter does that's what a website's for i don't know to take cool pictures i don't know what are planes for it's just like a plane i don't know i mean i'm looking at the website oh it's also just cool pictures of the of the aircraft yeah i don't give a what the widget is he makes it's a widget it's there's just like this beautiful black woman getting into this helicopter in a dress and i'm like what's she doing what's the purpose here and then she and then the next photo is she's on like a sand dune in dubai it's like oh did she just fly fly to the desert yeah she had like an appointment amazing yeah she had to go somewhere i don't know i'm sure there's something uh i'm sure there's something sorry brett adcock we did not do it justice there on the on the actual thing but okay so hold on there's a little question or a plot hole about the story so it said that he had to he was an undergrad in 2018 but you said he sold his company like in 2016.

so did he go back to school or he was in school like he went back to school to learn how to do this stuff oh my god even more incredible this guy's interesting right became an undergrad yes and he told me he goes he goes whenever i do something i go all in he goes for example i'm i i'm going all in on my latest thing i went all in on archer he goes when i was starting vetery there was a time where i took a personal loan one month because i i didn't have any money in my personal account and we had to pay rent and he goes this is just what i do and so he said he wanted to learn about electric cars or whatever these this cool is and he went and learned about it at university of florida wow uh okay that's incredible speaking of people who go all in you know uh my buddy furcon and he's been on the podcast we haven't had him on a while we should bring him back on but basically he was my co-founder at my last startup before we we uh it was called bebo and we we sold it um to twitch and then since then he left and he was i was like what are you gonna do well you gotta say what he did before that oh before he's got a kind of a crazy story before that he was a co-founder of a company called app lovin that went public and it's like i don't know uh 15 20 billion dollar mobile ad network uh mobile gaming company so like one of the fastest growing companies ever yeah just an incredible story like they've only they only ever raised four million dollars and they took that four million of external capital so they took i think four million from the founders and four million from uh from like strategic investors and they turned that into basically like 20 billion of equity value which is and it makes insane capital efficiency three billion a year in revenue so it's like a big business and they like rotated they were a mobile ad network and then they went public and when they were going public it was like a mobile ad network their comps were not very good because most mobile ad networks were like not doing very well and even though they were like well our business is actually really good but we're just going to keep getting compared to these low multiple other mobile ad networks so they basically executed a pivot mid-flight and we're like well on our ad network the number one advertisers are games that's who makes the most money on our network that's who pays the most money on our ad network is mobile games so they're like why don't we just build mobile games and buy mobile gaming studios and so they built up this mobile gaming arm that i think does over a billion dollars a year in revenue i think they did two billion on just the it's like the amazon basic of games yeah exactly so they started buying up these little partnering buying up studios and building their own studio in-house and then they would just use their existing reach and their ad network to like grow their own games and uh insane and then they got valued much higher because they had like a different story than just we're a bubble ad network and that's it so anyways furcon's been doing crazy but he's been going all in since he was very very young so when he was 15 he worked at a dot-com uh during the uh like dot-com boom like his dad was like hey um i met this guy they raised like i don't remember dot-com is like this guy raised 50 million dollars on a powerpoint he needs somebody to build his website he doesn't know how you know how to build websites like why don't you go work over there so at 15 he's working at a dot-com then he starts his own e-com site that's like selling uh like cool like mods for your computer you know people like trick out their cars with like rims and stuff he was doing that for like your gaming computer or stuff like that you can have like a see-through case with like blue liquid going through it or stuff like that and he goes to san jose state so not like a fancy school freshman year he's like and is he an immigrant is it is he from well yeah his family's they're pakistani but they his they've lived he grew up in the bay area so he grew up that's that's part of the magic is like his dad worked i think at ibm and like when he was like five years old his dad would bring home like the early computer or the early printer would be like let's assemble this together so that's how he learned how to do so um so anyways he he's freshman freshman year at san jose state he's like dude i just keep leaving the classroom to take calls because like you know we're out of inventory or whatever and so he just quits san jose state he goes all in on the e-com thing he figures out one hack with the e-com thing which was like back then i think on google or yahoo or somewhere where people were searching for stuff you could just sort my cheapest so he just wrote a bot that would always price what like their their main like high selling skew one cent lower than whatever the cheapest price was and it was like his lost leader and it would always bring somebody to the to the site and that's what he that's when he decided to quit school was he was in a class and they were describing what a loss leader is he's like oh that's the i'm doing with my life i'm like i'm like selling this stuff at a loss to get traffic he's like i don't need to be here i'm learning this like in the real world so he just left and just like i dropped out and then he's like whatever goes on he spends a couple years playing poker as well like you know a bunch of different crazy stuff comes back starts doing startups and now and so after we saw and after applovin goes public the guy never needs to work again he's got all the money in the world and i'm like so what are you gonna do and he's like he's like i wanna uh like i'm gonna buy a big space it basically is like he's creating his heaven on earth which did he buy that space or did he rent it it looks beautiful he's renting that one but he was looking at buying before then when covet started happening he's like i'm just gonna lease these they're all like dirt cheap leases now and like i don't know yeah he got this sick place over on the presidio yeah so he's in fort mason he's got like i don't know maybe 10 000 20 000 25 000 square feet or something like that it's crazy and he basically created his heaven on earth which i've come to realize is like i that's actually what i respect the most it's like i don't respect because people will be like oh on one hand you guys go all in on elon or brett adcock these guys who go all in is that what you love but you also love this guy who's got this amazing lifestyle and works four hours a month but like the same thing they're the same thing they're creating their heaven on earth and i think that is that my best description of what i admire and what i want to do is create my own little heaven on earth which takes two i don't even like that description i say they're taking the world and they're just bending it over their leg to help the shape that they want it to be you know what i mean they're just they're spanking their world yeah they're a dominatrix and the and the earth is their uh is the recipient no they're just like making the world because that's what it feels like it feels like they're forcing things they're forcing an industry and they say and they spank it go get my belt and then they bend the industry over and they spank it yeah exactly billy go get my belt that's another one so so he's also an all-in kind of guy because he he basically immediately created like a lot of work for himself he rented out the space he puts 40 there's i went there to visit there's 40 people working in there i'm like who are all these this is like a bunch of young brown dudes like who are all these indian dudes everywhere what are they doing i invested in one of them because they're just part of his thing i was like furcon are these guys legit and he like told me this huge explanation i was like all right so just say yes or no and i and i say less yeah yeah i actually want to just invest in the index because actually individually all of the ideas are a little bit crazy they're all crazy one of these is going to work i just don't trust myself to pick the right one so i actually have talking to him about like how do i just index into all of your crazy like i would like a piece of every brown dude in this in this uh under this roof here like how do i do that and i think i'm gonna work it out but i don't tell you about one of the things that i saw there so dude the guy i invested in was a white guy oh yeah you're the nba ggm drafting kyle ford it's like dude you should take lebron i think um so so one of the guys that one of the guys i met in there they were doing something called orangewood robotics have you ever heard of this company no but obviously i'm in orangewood yeah so i go in and there's a reason it's called orangewood i'll explain in a second so they go in and i go i walk in and there's a bunch of people at their computers and then there's the big thing he he wanted to do was he was like you know a lot of engineers they want to work in a space with other smart engineers that's cool but one of the things that engineers struggle with he's like the first thing i bought when i got money is i bought like a 3d printer and you know then like this robotics thing and then i brought bought this drone thing he's like i just want to have a whole bunch of hardware available for free to engineers that are building stuff that requires the stuff that's very expensive so they can come and hack on these these tools and they don't need to like go buy this you know 15 000 machine that just does this thing and so that's what he did and so when i walk in i'm like what's going on in there there's basically a room with a bunch of robotic equipment in there i walk in and there's this company called orangewood and what these guys are doing is they basically are like i was like explain what this is they go oh we have this robot that can paint stuff and i was like okay why and they're like well you know like you know look around this room like you see that you see this you know there's this process called powder coating you ever powder coated something and i was like you obviously don't know who you're talking to yeah so i was like no um i was like is that for donuts what is that and he's like no basically it's this like process where you need to paint you know i still can't explain it to you by the way that was that was a good one thank you um you do that thing in text where you're like six out of ten eight out of ten on any on any joke that was a good one i like that one the powder coating for donuts so so basically they're like you know it takes you know a specialist you have to you know you have to hire hire labor labor is really hard nowadays and it's also like a chemically intensive process it's not really that powder coating like i do it with motorcycles so like your motorcycle frame is just metal and they powder coat it which is it kind of looks like paint i don't actually know exactly how it works but you do it in like a room that's sealed and you do it with gloves on and it's like you're putting it looks like a powder on it and it's like a sealant slash protected thing slash paint right so they basically trained this robot to do it and what they do the trick is that the world has changed where there's now this like robotic arm that's a general purpose robotic arm so think of it like an iphone right it's a piece of hardware that you could buy that you could program to do anything right so when steve jobs came out with the iphone they were like this is an iphone it can access the internet it has a gps inside and it can make phone calls like that's what it could do and from there you guys figure out the rest right like initially they didn't have the app store but then when they did have the app store now all of a sudden you get the flashlight app and then the app that turns you know it's like a ruler uses the camera to like measure something then you get like strava it's like we'll use the gps to do this thing so it's basically like a programmable general purpose tool so that's what's happening with these robotic arms these guys wrote software to teach that robotic arm they bought how to powder coat things and then they taught it how to paint floors and then they taught it how to weld things so this thing can literally just weld together uh they taught it how to um you know pick and pack things so it could take it could sort of take things out of one place and put it into another place based on what it looks like and and the way you do it is like you just write a program that that does each of these functions and you need to specialize it and then there's there's more sophisticated ways they'll put a camera on top and they'll teach it to like recognize stuff so like my cousin was doing this where he was teaching this robotic arm literally i went to his office and it was straight up a robotic arm and a uh like a hole and his whole thing was can i get the arm to go in the hole and i was like what's going on here guys like this is a little like you know sexual robot someone is and he's like no this is we're basically in the future electric cars are going to get need to get charged but when they're self-driving there's no driver to get out of the car and plug it in he's like so you need the the charging station to be able to automatically attach to the car otherwise we're never going to have self-driving cars that work that are electric because who will fill them up you'll need a a person there always to be able to go do this and they'll need basically gas attendance at every gas station to do this which in my mind i was like that doesn't sound so bad but like you know there's a reason he pivoted but the point is they were training this arm to be able to use the camera to find the hole and exactly get in without scratching the car and so there's like this whole industry of people that are doing this they're just figuring out how to program these general purpose robotic arms and they're making very interesting businesses off them so these guys are doing it with painting i thought that was pretty cool because it's like a high value thing like you rent it for 500 bucks for the day and it'll paint all your and it's like that's cheaper than than hiring a person to do it and more reliable maybe because they'll do it it'll do it like perfectly even every single time you don't have like human error and so the other one that that's interesting like this is cafe x which you've probably seen yeah yeah in the malls which is basically a job of starbucks yeah and like you see it and you're like oh what was this stupid and then you start thinking about it and you're like oh my god the implications here are quite big yeah no i saw that and i was immediately like this is the one of the smartest ideas i've ever seen so if you haven't seen cafe x because you're not like in san francisco imagine starbucks but now shrink starbucks down to the size of like a jumbo vending machine and it's see-through and inside is just a robotic arm and you go you place your order you're like i need my you know cappuccino i want it you know whatever double shot and i don't drink coffee so i don't make that but like you know oat milk and two sugars and basically the arm then starts to like move around inside and it makes your coffee then it hands it to you and then it waves and it does a dance and at least and you get to walk away and basically you pay you know two dollars fifty cents and you're getting a robotic coffee so the the why this is dope is it takes up like one tenth of the real estate of starbucks it has no like labor costs or very very low labor costs it's just the person who comes and cleans the robot at the end of the day and refills the ingredients so there's like you know very low labor cost and the robot like never gets tired never calls in sick it just like runs all day and just makes the exact same coffee all the time and it could do that with like you know 100 drinks or something like that and so cafe x hasn't quite taken off i think there's they did some stupid things and i remember hearing that like at one point like in the seed round the founder only owned four percent of the company or something they like effed up their cap table or something like that i heard of that too um and so you know that that particular startup i don't think it's going to work but i'll be damned if this is not going to be a thing like this is going to be a thing it just makes too much it has such an economic advantage and it only has technology risks and i think people really underestimate that because most businesses have extreme market risk we don't even know if the customers want it and we don't know if they're going to adopt it then it has but this has like well if the customer wants it is not not really a question the customer wants a fast delicious coffee yes that's not like that's not that hard to do um and instead of making starbucks as a place where you go sit it's optimizing for people who want to get in and get out like subway stations and stuff like that like people who are quickly on the go and has such a big financial advantage if they can do it because the real estate and the labor costs now the only question is can you make the robot arm work well enough and actually that's a problem that engineers are good at solving over like a 10-year period so i'm trying to just do this math to make sure i'm right um wow okay so check this out so i i know a few a few of these guys doing these startups that involve so a lot of them use the word humanoid have you heard that word yeah i don't like it yeah i don't like humanoid but basically it's robots that do jobs of humans like gas station attendant so i was just curious and this cafe x is interesting there's another one that's doing it for pizza i think it's called zoom is it called zoom uh that was one of the popular ones soft bank put like i don't know 500 million dollars into it or something ridiculous which sounds silly but i and this is i only did this research while we were talking i could be way off but i'm looking at a government website it seems legit do you know what percentage of working americans work in fast food oh man it's gotta be high uh but i'm gonna give you the homie move and i'll say seven percent no that was way too much i asked that poorly so about a about three and a half million americans work uh in fast food jobs which is like a point that that's that's significant dude that's significant uh 10 of those work at mcdonald's so mcdonald's employs like 250 300 000 people um it's kind of astonishing i'm i'm a fairly libertarian person but when i think of these things i'm like what are these people going to do for work i mean there's just that's only we're only talking about fast fast food you talk about all these other things i mean potentially five or ten percent of americans of workers it's like you know maybe you don't have a lot of that many skills like when these things happen i'm like i don't know what's going to happen with these people it's not a good situation it almost is more scary than it is interesting you know what i'm saying yeah people always say that um i don't know i just feel like it's there's really two questions which is like a is this new no for forever technology has been like making things easier and getting rid of jobs like okay you know maybe we were you know doing stuff by hand on the fields and then we got the tractor and that like maybe reduced the number of people you needed by 10x in order to run a farm and you know with all the automations by the way the farming industry has massive stuff subsidies i mean they like there's some farmers that are so efficient and so good and there's more nuance to this so someone's going to correct me but basically some farms my parents work in the agriculture industry it's kind of how i know this some farms are so big and so good the government will pay you money not to grow a crop because they say you're going to screw up the whole market if you overflow us with corn really yes it's called the farm act i believe uh or is that the farm act there's a there's a couple acts a couple bills uh in in america well they will pay you money not to do anything because they say you're going to disrupt you're gonna you're gonna make too much you we don't want you screwing this up yeah and so the farming thing is a good example and what has happened is the government is heavily involved that sounds that sounds so stupid i i i really oversimplified that but it is basically the case where you get paid not to do something because you will disrupt the market too much that's insane to me i mean aren't there people that need food and aren't there are prices high higher than ever like that's crazy to me that we're not for like corn i mean corn i mean like america does like two a few things really well one we produce really good entertainment so like our biggest export you could say is like uh culture you know movies and music and fashion and the second best thing is corn like our ability to create corn is like phenomenal we create corn so well uh i mean corn's here is in everything ethanol fuel is made out of corn everything's made out of corn we are really good at making corn so i don't know i think with corn i think we're we're kind of we kind of nailed that one we kind of that's a home run yeah okay i don't know enough about this to really speak on it but i guess what my point is over time technology has just gotten more and more pervasive and it's like what's what happened to all the horse carriage drivers what happened to all the people that worked in factories what happened to all the people that did this and that and the reality is like they shift they shift around so you know some people will become robot attendants and they'll become good at like managing and cleaning the robots and many and fixing them when they when they bug out some people will shift into a new type of labor and like whether that's they become entertainers on social media they become you know there's new jobs that will get created from every single thing that it gets done and like you know what's the other question is like what's the alternative do you pump the brakes on making things better faster cheaper like that doesn't seem like you it's possible or real or like yeah like i'm not gonna let i'm not gonna let like my feelings get away of like progress and technology i'm just saying like it it that doesn't mean that it's not frightening yeah i i just think you know there's a little bit of carnage whenever any change happens whether it's you know change for the good or it's change for the bad right like i think in any there's there's a little bit of collateral damage along the way and the question is like you know that also creates opportunities because if you created a business that re-skills people not only are there going to be a lot of people that need re-skilling but maybe the government will pay you to help re-skill workers in the economy so the free market can come up with a solution to how to absorb this labor how to re-skill this labor and do things like that so i don't really worry about stuff like that but i do think that it's very interesting to me that these robotic like these general purpose robot robot like pieces can now be programmed to do just a variety of things that are otherwise you know today human labor i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better have you seen this tv show called the bear i've seen a few episodes i haven't finished it all right so the background in the show is it necessarily the important topic here but it's a topic i want to ask you about but the background is basically a restaurant in chicago the owner kills himself and the br the brother inherits this restaurant and it's a mess and the brother is a trained chef from french laundry which is like the best restaurant in the world and he comes to this kind of like shithole restaurant and he's got to turn it around so that's the whole premise and i'm watching this show and i used to work at a restaurant like most kids if you know 15 16 17 18 i worked at a restaurant and this show remind this show reminded me how miserable they are and like this goes on the list like right below like music festivals of things and businesses that you should never start and run from no matter almost no matter how good they are and are like why music festivals what's wrong with music festivals dude any business that you could that you spend 18 months working on and if it rains that day you're completely screwed like that's a one out of you know 365 chance i mean more than that it's more than one time a year but like the odds that like rain come and ruin your whole years of work that's the worst that's like i don't want to join that business i mean like music festivals they they're just horrible and they're horrible because the bigger and more people who that go and the more money that you make the worse the experience gets that's why i always dislike the conferences because like damn the better i make this for me the worse it is for the attendee and thus harder for them get them to come back over and over again and with a restaurant you see inside this kitchen at the bear at the it's called like chicago beef i think uh you see the behind the scenes of the restaurant it is impossible this is playing business on the hardest mode possible people are angry people are vulgar all the time i remember when i used to work at a restaurant like there was a huge uh contingency of drug addicts you know you get off work at 2 a.m what are you gonna do you're gonna go immediately go to the bar and get screwed up and then come back to work the next day at 11. lots of drug addicts lots of people calling into sick for work lots of people angry lots of vulgar hostility this looks like a horrible business to be in your sushi restaurant was probably a little bit different than this but was it at all similar to what i'm seeing in the bear well ours wasn't just because a we only ran it for three months and you know we were only open and live for three months and b we were the we were the labor for most of that we only had a couple other people the but what the way i experienced this was we we went and worked in other restaurants to shadow to learn how do you actually run a restaurant right so like we worked in other sushi restaurants my buddy dan worked inside of a noodles and company to see like how does a fast casual like process thing work or whatever and how does that work with a lot of salt he was just like dude like because we used to eat at these places he's like don't order the tomato bisque i was like the bisque it's a soup the soup is the good and he's like don't order the tomato bisque i was like what what's wrong he's just like bro you've never seen salt like you see in the bisque i was like he's it's like somebody who was just like traumatized by what they saw and it's just like dude those people in the back don't give a they're gonna put whatever they want in this it does and the things that they're supposed to put are so bad for you and uh this stuff just sits around and like he's like don't don't eat this stuff i was like okay yeah sometimes the less you know like i remember when we were working in the kitchen we worked out of a commissary kitchen so there's other people there the food truck people would come prep there the caterers and the worst was the guy who would sell hot dogs he had like a hot dog stand not no offense but like he would just come in with 350 hot dogs he would pour them all into the sink and we're like that's the sink where we do everybody does their dishes in there it's like pouring your hot dogs in a hot tub and he was like just started turned up the water was just washing them and then he was just like chucking them to the side after they've been like rinse for a second yuck i was like first of all why are you washing the hot dog why did this need washing it was like if it came out of a package you washed it you washed it in the grossest sink possible and you just threw it on the side i was like somebody's gonna eat that like six hours i was like i will never eat a hot dog again i think forget about what even went into the hot dog which i think in itself is gross like when you watch these documentaries about like you know farming and stuff like that and i was like just watching this dude watch the hot dogs before taking them to the ball game i was like this is absolutely sick dude by the way you saying no offense is not gonna be my new neg so i'm gonna be like i'm just gonna be talking about anything like yeah dude i was running this guy and he smelled so bad no offense and i'm just gonna start saying no offense just like all the time and like i was out walking around the streets and they were disgusting no offense and this person was so annoying no offense i mean nothing wrong with annoying people so no offense i'm gonna throw no offense there there all the time that's amazing uh that's disgusting but anyway this show what's interesting about it though and this is a lot of similarities i see in what you and i do and what a lot of our friends do and a lot of listeners do is they are so passionate about this thing and at first i was like why are they so passionate about this and i started i was like oh wait no this is just their this is just their shtick you know my outlet's a little bit different but it's like the same type of obsessed um they love it they love it so anyway cool show and and i wanted to bring it up because i i wasn't sure if it was similar to your restaurant experience i i think it was like we used to do the thing you'd get off at 1 a.m and then are you you know you the thing closes at midnight you got to clean up prep for the next day it's one before you get out of there and now you're hungry and tired you didn't want to eat your own food so you go to another restaurant they're getting off they'll just cook for you for free but then like you know two people are doing cocaine in the bathroom and you're like this isn't like you know the most productive lifestyle the restaurant industry i would say the bonding is very like the camaraderie was amazing and i would say there's something very soulful about like feeding people uh that's like really great but then the hours are brutal it is business on hard mode and there's a lot of like degeneracy same thing with like poker i used to play poker i love the game of poker i hated sitting in a casino playing poker because i just felt like i was surrounded by so many degenerates and i was like this is not a high quality of living like just sitting here in this kind of artificial air with this guy who's like fell asleep next to me because he's been here for 42 hours straight like this is not who i want to surround myself with i need to get out of this situation um let me tell you about something that is the opposite of that kind of a an inspiring work environment so i saw this tick tock and it just uh that's not two tick tocks i don't remind i want to tell you about i'm not going to play them here because it'll take a little too long maybe in the youtube video we can we can play them but i want to know if you've seen these one went viral so it was did you see this viral clip of the pitcher on the mets coming out to the uh coming out to pitch he's like the closer so he was coming out to do his thing and it's normally on tv they just cut to commercial um in between like the chain like the the lineup change because it's like whatever it's gonna be two minutes the guy's got to warm up he's got to run out from the bullpen that takes a little while baseball's slow already he's got to warm up then whatever they usually come back but this time they stuck with it so they showed did you see this clip or am i just should i describe it keep going keep going so the show from behind the guy like walking out from the thing emerging basically into the stadium so they have a dope camera shot oh and they're using that ufc lens have you noticed all these guys are using yeah the ufc's got this beautiful lens where it like blurs out the back makes it look special yeah and then they and the guy normally comes out to this um song i don't even know what it's called it's like whatever i don't know the guy timmy timmy trumpets is like the singer you know he's featured on it so this guy with his trumpet but the mets had brought the guy there live and so he was kind of hiding and he comes out he's got his little trumpet he's got a microphone on the end of the trumpet and he starts playing the song and he's playing the song live the guy's running out into like the roaring crowd and it's just so dope one two three inning and now timmy trumpet takes center stage as edwin diaz gets ready to come in a game all right business is cool but like god sports and music just have this special thing this special moment these special feelings that you you can't there's nobody is that passionate about our podcast nobody is that passionate about this piece of software but when this moment hits the guy runs out he's the hero the trumpet guy's there he's playing the crowd's going nuts and it was just like this special moment and it was a lot of showmanship and so i i watched that and i get this feeling i'm like that was dope i'm glad that they went that extra mile for that showmanship does that create i will never watch baseball but like i'm a fan of like this guy that song you don't watch baseball at all right now way too slow for you right too slow too boring uh used to love it but you know when i was a kid so now i swipe up on tiktok the next video is this teacher and it says uh revealing the muse the year musical part one and i'm like i don't know i just hung around for an extra second to watch he goes he goes all right and this year the musical is gonna be and he like reveals the whiteboard and there's nothing there and then there's like a small envelope and everyone's like what what and then he's like he opens up the envelope that he's like it's gonna be hold on this just says turn on the computer and then the students are like what's going on here and clearly the teacher had kind of set up a bit to like just make it more fun and like you know everybody loves this because it's like here's this teacher of like a middle school or high school or something like that they didn't have to do this like you know most teachers are just sort of like they want to just roll out the tv on the black you know like trolley and just be like all right guys just watch this fucking movie for an hour and like just leave right like being a teacher is exhausting and like it's easy it would be it would be very easy to phone it in most don't and some like this guy go the extra mile so now he clicks his computer and it's a video and it's him and he's like hey it's me from the future and he's just like it's a silly bit but he's talking back to it he's like what are you doing here he's like i don't know i read the envelope it said to turn the computer he's like you just going to do whatever the envelope says and it's like it goes back and forth so he's like doing this skit with himself good and he's like he's like uh and it freezes and then it freezes and it says wait everybody look under your desk and like one kid has this special thing and then it was like this elaborate almost like an escape room leading up to this reveal and i saw that and so what was the plan videos viral the play was like i don't even remember it was like it was like not something like that cool it was like you know les miserables whatever it was like some like play i was like who cares like but like by the end the students are going nuts because they're so invested at this point they sort of midway through they realized okay this is cheesy but i'm into it he's doing this for us and like all right i want to know he built up tension and the reason i bring up these examples is because there is a word that my trainer uses all the time and nobody else in my life i know talks about this my trainer all the time goes yeah you gotta have a little showmanship and showmanship is a word that i think like for most of us doesn't even enter our brain on a day-to-day basis and my trainer will always tell me he's like you know he'll be at starbucks before you know he'll go get a coffee before our session and he'll always tell me these stories he's like you know i decided to add a little showmanship so i told him my name was blah blah blah and they wrote it on the cup and then by the time the person was done you know i told them like you know whatever uh you know he'll like he'll he'll say you know bond james bond and then they'll just laugh they'll have a little chuckle and then they'll write bond he's like add the comma james bond and then they'll do it they'll laugh a little more and now he just like made their day a little more entertaining than it was than it had to be if he just said my name is john and okay cool you're just another john and so he always talks about adding showmanship and it's just like walking through life and just identify little moments or you could do something slightly different than like than the norm and i have a like i have kids now so i do this with my daughter all the time um like we used to have such a hard time getting her to eat and my mother-in-law came over and like you know as a classic sort of like mother-in-law thing she's like always being like do this do that you guys are doing this wrong like you know it's true she's got like i don't know 30 years of parenting experience we got two but like it's also really annoying to be told what to do and how to parent better and how to like do this do that so we're normally my default was kind of annoyed but one day she was like uh she was like um like the milk bottle was like way less i was like how did you get her to drink the milk and she's like oh she loves to drink out of this like little measuring cup instead of like the normal cup and she goes change of presentation and i go and i was like and so now me and my wife will always joke because we're always like oh god so annoying she was telling us what to do but then like like sometimes she does pull this like rabbit out of her hat and like you know we'll do something my daughter doesn't want to do it and then we just change the like change the presentation of how we're getting her to do it and all of a sudden she's super locked in like i do this now when i feed her i couldn't get her to eat vegetables so i decided to create like my own version of the show uh chopped so i'm like okay close your eyes i'm going to put one thing in front of you and in front of your brother and like take the bite and then you need to tell me is it one thumbs up two thumbs up or thumbs down and then i do a huge reaction based on the score they give me and she's like i want to play the closed eyes game i want to play the closed eyes game because she and i can get her to eat a whole meal if i'm willing to basically create a television show out of it it's really like exhausting for me but honestly it's like also kind of fun and it gets her to eat anything whereas otherwise that's actually even more exhausting to try to feed her something she doesn't want and so this idea of showmanship keeps weaving its way into my life and i wanted to bring this up because for somebody out there they're going to basically use this as like your word of the day find a way to like weave in a little more showmanship into what you're doing a little change of presentation as we say have you do you think about this at all i do and so i was i wanted i had to go find it but have you heard of this guy named trend griffin he's like this like 60s maybe 60 something years old white dude and his twitter bio just says like i used to work with bill gates at microsoft so you're like oh you're automatically like wise and interesting so he has a blog called 25 iq and i was reading it the other day and he had this article called a dozen beliefs about business money and life that kanye west shares with other great entrepreneurs and investors it's like oh that's an interesting title and the very first line has always stuck with me and it's about con it's from kanye and it says for me first of all dopeness is what i like the most dopeness people who want to make things as dope as possible and and by default make money from it and i always think about that quote because i also get caught up and like well this does this and this does this and this does this and that's how it makes money and i'm like oh yeah but this is super lame and not that cool and like this sucks my soul what am i doing like this isn't awesome you know and and it's like well what is awesome i don't know exactly how to explain it but i do think about that all the time where i'll try to like nickel and dime things about what i'm going to buy or like the other day i bought some uh uh like air force ones and i was like trying to like get like this cheap ones and i'm like bruh i can get the 250 dollar air force ones and i don't have to justify it like if they're cool they're cool they're dope i'm doing it no matter what and i always have to justify like certain decisions to myself as like this is just cool do it because it's cool i only have one life so yeah i think about this all the time yeah do it because it's cool i think is a great like you know uh uh for for most people who listen to this podcast they're probably like high achiever types and they're probably rational and like analytical about a lot of decisions and so i think for that audience actually you need to add more of this other ingredient which is the yeah for sure do it because it's cool eff it don't measure it and also honestly the same thing can either be done boring or dope it's like it's not the thing that's dope yeah it's how you do the thing that's dope or not dope and so you know the broccoli itself wasn't dope when i turned it into this game i made it more dope for her and therefore she has a different experience and i have a different experience in doing it and if i consistently do that well there's just more experiences throughout my day that are dope and what's a dope life it's a bunch of dope days what's a bunch of dope days it's a bunch of dope experiences throughout the day right you just break it down into moment like you can break it down into its atomic unit and realize that like the boringness or like routine of your life is uh like you know in your own hands and if you just add a little showmanship to yourself and to the people around you you kind of change how the experience feels and i'm guilty of this in many ways but like you know i'm seeing how this helps me and i wanted to share this little framework do you remember boosted skateboards yeah these are all over the place in san francisco people would like skateboard up the hill because it was like you know san francisco is so hilly and it's like look like magic how are they going up this and now like electric scooters are the norms like the bird scooters and all these good so that's like considered normal now but about eight years ago boosted skateboards came out with this longboard skateboard that would go 25 miles an hour i remember i bought one and it was crazy it was so cool and i met the founder and i was like tell me about your background he's like oh i worked at nasa and i was doing this other thing and then i thought about like working in the government and like sending people to mars i thought that had been like interesting but i decided to launch this the skateboard company i was like well you know are you interested in skateboards he's like no i was like were you interested in this other thing he's like no not really i was like well you know why'd you go to skateboards he goes because it's fucking awesome and i remember i remember him saying that and i was like well yeah you got a point yeah yeah it is it is awesome and i when he told me that i just i remember a shift happened in my life it's like oh yeah yeah that's a that's a good addition i gotta add that to my like box of checks check box you know of things to do like you know it makes money it makes my mom proud uh it's effing awesome uh and i remember him saying that and i was like oh yeah you're you're right right yeah tony robbins has this thing he says which is like you will uh you will only meet the you'll meet your standards not your not your desires and basically like a standard is like more of a must a standard is like you know i'm not going to eat at a restaurant if i saw flies flying around everywhere that's below my standard and so an important thing to figure out is like what are my standards for the things that i do in my life it sounds like for this guy one of his standards for like what do i work on is is this awesome or not whereas for a lot of people that shit is completely optional nice to have for sure it's like i need to pay the bills it's not part of the standard and then you meet certain people and this is the best thing you could do like why do people have that phrase of like you are the average of the five people you spend your most the most time with is because it's because fundamentally you will adopt the standards of the people you're around it's not because they'll teach you things it's not because they'll give you good advice it's because fundamentally you will adopt the standards like i remember we have a couple friends who are like you like you're one of my friends who's very fit i have other friends that are that are very fit or they care about being very fit and whenever there's a question like all right you know let's go grab some food what do you guys want to eat it's like i know that i can't suggest you know i can't cheesecake factory is not on the list you know like i can't i can't take these guys there that's not their their standard is that that's not what they eat and so like you know i automatically i will start to only suggest and therefore only go to places that i know meets their standard of what they they consider just for the record i fucks with cheesecake factory hardcore get that chicken piccata all day yeah i'm not above it yeah we have a couple friends that like is like oh cool like what uh you ordered the gordita what's good here i've never been to this place dude can i talk about something that that i can't decide if actually and we could wrap up with it i can't decide if it's awesome and dope or not so basically i want to give like people perspective on you and i's like behind the scene so you and i sean and i get dm'd or cold email all the time and a very common thing is hey can i like give you content to share and i'll do it for free or something like that and the bad thing about freeze you kind of get what you pay for so when it's free shit you're like oh this is too much work i don't want to share your stuff on twitter i don't want to share your stuff on whatever it's just it's not good i don't want to work on it for some reason i gave one of these kids a chance and i i say no to everyone i gave this kid a chance he dm'd me and i was like you know i'll give you i'm going to give you my password to my tick tock and i want you to impress me i go send me a picture of your social security card send me a picture of your boss and send me a picture of your driver's license and he did and i go all right if you fuck i was like if you because i was like if you screw me over here i'm gonna get you back so like i have your information um here's my password to my tick tock i gave him the password by the way yeah that's great showmanship a threat is also that's what i did i go look like if you do something bad to me i'm gonna get you and so i um i gave him my password to my tick tock give me your mother's address because i will be mailing her your index finger in an envelope if you fuck this up because there's like no information that i could get to like get back at this person you know what i mean like i'm like i need you to have something yeah we're imbalanced you could really screw me by posting on my account what am i gonna i need to equally be able to screw you okay i can't continue yeah and i gave him the password to my tick tock it's been one week so in one week this kid has taken you and i's videos and posted them to a day on tick tock and in six days maybe i think one week's tomorrow he's gotten 1.5 million views and i went from basically zero to like not having to count to like eight or nine thousand followers as of now a handful of videos have gotten one got five hundred thousand one got seven hundred thousand a bunch got fifty thousand plus uh 150 or 200 000 likes tens of thousands of comments and i'm like that's kind of interesting but i don't exactly believe that this is true like i don't know if this is true and so i was like post a video where there's a call to action and so we did a video about my favorite book and it shot up the charts and i'm like all right people are actually like these people are somewhat engaged they're like buying a book the charts like on amazon you mean yeah so uh and this is the second this is the second time that i did this so one time i recommended a book and right before i recommended it i took a picture of its rating on amazon and then i recommended it and the next day it was number one in the entrepreneurship category and number one in the business category and i took screenshots of it to like prove it and uh it was it was the book called how to get rich that that tweet reached two million people this other video that i did i talked about the same book and it shot up i think now it's number one in entrepreneurship again and it's uh that video has been viewed 500 000 times let's write our own book if you got this kind of oprah influence i mean what why are you referencing this guy's dead he doesn't need your help come on let's write our own book let's see okay yeah look uh how to get rich is now number 30 in all of audible and originals it's number one in the small business category yeah look up how to get rich go look at right now look at the categories like it like skyrocketed after this video and i can't decide if this whole tick tock game is actually just do it where it's like you should do it simpler which is just like if you're a real person i don't know if these tick tock views are real or not if you're real just put like a one in the just type the number one i am going to see who's going to do that you know because because i feel the same way about these tick tock views it's like our favorite words a little little fugazi a little fugazi there's a fugazi fugazi element to these tick tock views it's like how you know is this really 1.5 million people what does this mean did they actually watch it what's going on here if so that's amazing but i'm you know some things can be too good to be true uh but that's good yeah you've been showing up on my feed for what it's worth but i think it's because i have like two tick tock fans and you're one of them hey this one this book video got 414 000 views a couple of them got 70 000 50 000 one got 700 000 lots of 20 000 i can't decide if this is real and if it is real i don't want to sound like gary v but i'm like oh everyone should do this like this is easy this is this kid in miami is just doing this and he just spun this up and it's working wonderfully and like you i don't i mean i think you're actually better than me but i'm not like that charismatic i'm not that good why is this game so easy and is this game is it real and also honestly is it worth it i'm not convinced that it's worth it well if you can spike a book to number one in the charts that shows that there's some value there there's some influence there like and it's not just a number but okay yeah it's kind of lame like the most of the most there's a lot of amazing stuff on tick tock basically these 18 year old kids are like the most creative people i've ever seen but then there's guys like you and me these like money people and influencers and everyone's doing the same circle jerk alex or mosey stuff and it's really lame and so i don't know how to make it interesting and right now what i'm doing i think is not interesting but the results are incredible yeah but is it effing awesome to go back to your standard tbd tbd you know what's effing awesome is when you create content and then like someone like legitimately famous and cool like hassan like hollers at you and then you're like yeah this is the awesome part about it so like like that you know what i mean like that's worth all the lame tweets that you and i have done is getting to hang out with like a couple of really cool people you know what's cool about selling your soul sometimes someone pays the price for it you know what's cool about being a whore the money we're out so you
