The other thing that's interesting is you were on Shark Tank. I was. So as a fan of reality TV, me and Sam both watched The Challenge, probably the trashiest reality show that there is.

Well, tonight's the season finale of the Netflix one. Of which one? Of The Circle?

No, the one where they get married after living in a room. Love is Blind? Yeah.

Wait, didn't it all come out already? Didn't they just release it? Today.

I'm at episode three of that one. Good show. It's pretty awesome.

Pretty good show. Have you seen it? I haven't seen it yet.

Do you know the premise? I do know the premise. They put people in rooms and they don't see each other.

It's actually pretty cool as a experiment. Oh, and they have to get married. Yeah, they have to get married.

Or you get cut off the show. Literally, you don't even get eliminated survivor style. They just edit you out.

You're just not shown ever again if you didn't propose. And so what ends up happening is it's 10 days behind a wall. You talk to this person and you're speed dating basically behind a wall.

So you're kind of deciding who you like. And then someone proposes through the wall. So they're like, can you come close to the wall, please?

I'm on a knee now. And I want to ask you to marry me. And then, but the thing is that I thought that's where the show would end.

But then they like put them in the real world together. And they're like, all right, you're going to get married in 30 days. And see what happens.

And it's pretty interesting stuff. Okay. So good job, Netflix.

Shout out to you. What were you asking her about? I was asking her about Shark Tank.

Because tell me about how it came about. You applied many times, one time. How did you get on?

Yeah. Yeah. So Shark Tank was an, honestly, I am a huge fan of the show.

I also am a huge fan of my own experience. And that's not, I think, what everyone has to say. But I always tell people I think it can be a really game-changing thing for entrepreneurs if you do it the right way.

It is a lot of freaking work. A ton of work. Really?

So I. Once you're on or before you're on? Before you're on.

Okay. So I would say like, so we aired in November of 2017. Go to the beginning.

How did you even audition? It was like a nine-month process of, I would say the year of 2017, 80% of my year was Shark Tank. So we applied, and by WeMe, it's like a 50-page written application.

Online or? No. It is printed and written out.

I tried to like use a PDF editor. I mean, it was like, yeah. Like, you know, it was like a decade ago.

So you write this whole thing up? I write this whole thing out. I will be honest.

I was a finalist at TechCrunch Battlefield in 2016. The producer scout from. Gotcha.

So they reached out maybe. So they reached out. That's cool.

So it's kind of like if you're thinking about American Idol maybe, which I would never be, but you either can get contacted and sort of put in the front and do audition, or you kind of. You wait in line. So it's not that I had necessarily a better chance, but I did get shortcut into the application process.

So filled that out. The application probably takes 40 hours. Wow.

And then you have to sign all their contracts and basically sign your identity and image away to ABC in perpetuity. And then from there, you do a voice interview with producers. You do a video interview as well with the application.

Then another video interview of your pitch. And then from there, the producers work with you for about four months. To get it right.

And then like what is your story? What is your brand? What is your script?

Crazy. And it's ultimately your, what I think people don't realize. It's a human interest story.

It's a human interest story. You are there to make good reality TV, but it is your decision. The producers will help you and advise you, but this is your gig.

And it's up to you to decide how you want to display yourself and who you want to be on TV. But. So do you still remember your.

Whether or not to air you. Do you still remember your opening? Because you probably drilled it like a thousand times.

I did. I did. And I will tell you, I thought I was like really good and comfortable at public speaking.

And then I did this and I was like, okay, I was really bad. Now I feel comfortable. Now I'm good.

Did you pay the money for them? I did. So I signed or I shook on the largest deal ever for a female entrepreneur in terms of valuation.

So yeah, with Lori Greiner, she is on board. She's been tremendous. Because of QVC or what?

For me, it was really at the time we had no brick and mortar retail presence. And I knew that that was a priority for us to create a product that was like actually accessible and ubiquitous. And that's actually in hindsight been a really good move for us.

But I felt that she would be invaluable in helping us to get into some of those stores. Yeah. She really helped with packaging and branding and making something that's accessible.

When you're trying to like sell a testing kit where either people think it's a DNA kit. Right. Where they have no idea what it is.

Right. Being able to differentiate that when you have like 10 seconds to grab something. How much of a check did she write?

So the deal we shook on was. Why do you keep saying shook? Because there's the shake on it and then there's the actual deal.

What's the actual deal? I can't disclose that. Oh, come on.

However. Well, hold on one second. It was different.

Yes. Better or worse? Better.

For the company. And probably better for Lori. And better because.

Honestly. Why does the deal change? So normally there's like they do diligence and they might change it probably for their favor.

You're saying it went better for you guys. It went better for us. How does it improve?

So there was a. And it's very case by case. So what happens after the show is.

Can I pause you one second? I want to make sure you project because your audio. What you're saying is great.

I want to make sure we're getting it all. So my audio paranoia. Just make sure you're.

Talk louder than you're comfortable talking. So after you shake on the deal on the show. A fair number of those deals.

I think it's something like over half never come to fruition at all. And then another quarter or so actually change. And then another quarter get done at the terms that.

I've had a bunch of friends that they screw. Yeah. I think each shark.

Each shark has a different approach. So like I. They're totally.

You then go into their management company. Right. So you're going into Mark Cuban companies or Laurie Grenier's companies.

And so it's not a. I don't know what each shark's process is. I can say Laurie's was super fair.

They go through very detailed diligence on everything. But you know what? The show actually does diligence on you.

They have a venture analyst on board. So they run diligence on you before you ever pitch. What was your valuation that you guys freed on?

I pitched. My valuation was 20 million post money. And how much did she invest?

So that was a. How much did they free on? It was a line of credit deal at an 8% interest rate for 5% of the company.

And was it like. You know. Hey.

Deal offer on the spot. Or do you have this like long pause where you're like. Can I think and write this down?

Well in my case. Every shark was out. And I actually knew I wanted either Laurie or Mark.

Sorry. Laurie or Mark Cuban. And so I was really excited about it.

And so I really did want to work with her. And it was a good deal. So I actually sat on the show.

Because you're supposed to negotiate. I said. Because it makes good TV.

Yes. And so I said. I know I'm supposed to negotiate.

But I want to take this deal. Right. So I didn't.

You do have. It is really what you see. Like you can exit.

You can talk about it with your partner. You can call a lifeline or a friend. They may edit that out or whatever else.

But you can take a minute to think about it. What's something people don't see or don't realize that is different from having actually gone through it versus watching it? What's one difference?

I think people know it's edited. I don't think people realize how long the actual time filming can be. From when you walk in and walk out.

To like what they edit down to five minutes. So it varies. But mine was probably an hour.

And they edit it to seven minutes. Some people have gone on up to two to three hours. Some are 15 minutes.

Right. And so I think you know it's edited to a degree. But I don't think you realize how much discussion actually happens.

Was Lori investing her own money? She is investing her own money. Always.

So that. Does she have a fund or is it literally just hers? It is in a fund structure.

But it's her capital. It's her money. How much do you think she's worth?

You know. I don't know. I will say she is a prolific salesperson in the sense that like the top three or four companies from Shark Tank.

And I mean companies that have done like a quarter of a billion in sales. Each. Squatty Potty.

Yeah. Those. She has a relationship with each of those companies and is invested in each of those companies.

So I suspect quite a bit. Not to mention her own patent portfolio and the success she's had with products. She has a great team.

But do those pay cash? I mean. Who cares if you.

I mean it's important. But if you own equity in that business. And there's not an exit.

Yeah. So. I don't know.

Where is her cash coming from? I don't know. I don't know.

I'd be very good. Sam's going to get to the bottom of this. I don't know.

Because I also. I agree. Well and I also don't know.

She takes that Saudi money. No I'm sorry. Each deal is different.

Right. So like she does it just like any VC deal is different. Right.

She's negotiating a deal with me. Right. That's different.

I don't know what terms are. You know with the rest of her companies. I do know she has put all of these companies on the map from Scrub Daddy to Squatty Potty.

These companies that have incredible consumer products. She delivers. Now she delivers.

Yeah. I've got a funny company. So.

You do? I'm telling you. I think it seems to be actually.

I don't have one. But it does seem. I mean it does seem very popular.

Yes. Apparently. So.

Okay. So Everly Bell question for you. When you actually get the test.

How do you actually administer it? Hold on. Hold on.

Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

How much traffic did your site get? Oh yeah. So we got.

This is back three years ago? It was November. Which would be even better than now.

Because there's more. Oh yeah. People watch TV more than.

Right. And it aired the night before Cyber Monday. It was Thanksgiving weekend.

It couldn't have been a better day. Although my poor team. They were wonderful.

They canceled all their Thanksgivings. It was a lot of work. But we got about 30 times our normal traffic.

But we had an interesting experience. We didn't have this tremendous like huge spike the night of in terms of purchases. But we ended up doing about a million dollars in sales.

Which at the time was a tremendously large number for us. In like the four day period after. Right.

The show. So there's been a little bit of this interesting thing for us that I haven't heard many other companies have. Which is we doubled.

Like we doubled in that week on a run rate standpoint. And then we continued doubling the next month. And we never had that decline.

Right. But we didn't have this spike in like the three hour period that we aired. Yeah.

We had a lot of traffic. We didn't have much traffic. I think like a million sessions.

A million uniques. Yeah. Uniques.

Yeah. So. And we did.

I mean we had to. I mean at the time we were not set up for that scale. Now we don't even have to think about it.

We know. We've always been on. On.

WooCommerce. Stripe. Not WooCommerce.

Not Shopify. Big Commerce. We've built on it now.

And like totally customized it. Something else. It's not.

I know. But it's one of the big ones that actually. I think we should have gone to Shopify.

But we didn't. Gotcha. So.

I shouldn't. Now I shouldn't name them. Because it's going to sound bad.

Right. But. Shout out to Toby from Shopify.

Yes. Exactly. I like to think he's listening.

Yeah. So. Might be.

We're trying to get him on. I was going to say that valuation. Right.

Yeah. That valuation. So.

He also streams on Twitch. Great guy. Oh.

So. So. So.

Yeah. So. We saw a really good traffic increase.

But it was a very different pattern. And Lori warned us about that. She said some companies.

It's like they sell out immediately. And some companies. It's just a slow.

Right. A slow burn. So.

That was what it was with us. But we did not crash. Which was essential.

Thank you.
