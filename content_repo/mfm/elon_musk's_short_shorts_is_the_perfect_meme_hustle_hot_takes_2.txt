Yo what up episode 2 of Hustle Hot Takes we're bringing back the Ralph Lauren flower hoodie popular demand. Okay so episode 2 we're gonna be talking about Elon Musk if you're gonna do hot takes you gotta talk Musk and today's episode is gonna be talking about the short shorts tweet which is just it might be as great as tweet ever and I want to walk you through why but first of all let's talk about what is going on with Tesla and there's a lot so this time last year Exxon Mobile the oil and gas giant was worth 320 billion dollars Tesla was worth 40 billion dollars today Tesla is worth 250 billion dollars Exxon is worth 180 billion dollars think about this look at this blue line that's Tesla that is mind-boggling Tesla was an eighth of the size of Exxon Mobile last year and now it's about 50% bigger my mind is blown unfortunately I don't own any Tesla okay anyways let's not talk about how un-rich I am let's talk about Elon Musk's tweet from last week he tweeted out that he's selling limited edition short shorts now this is something that's been in the works for a while and we were gonna go through exactly what has led to these short shorts these satin short shorts when you go to the website it's actually hysterical so you can read here is uh you can run like the winner entertain like Liberace with our satin and gold trim design so actually on the back of these shorts it spells out s-e-x-y sexy and Elon Musk has always joked that he named his car the model s the model 3 model x and the model y because he wants to spell sexy sure enough that's what he's done let me explain to you why I think this is the greatest of Elon's many memes so at the end of June Elon tweeted that who controls the memes controls the universe and I mean this is just factually true if you control memes you control mind share and mind share as Leo said in inception that's everything once you're in the brain there's no going back you're in there once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate so Elon loves memes his entire life is kind of a meme and I'm going to walk you through why these short shorts might be the greatest meme ever so specifically what I'm going to touch on are the shorts themselves the word short and the price tag that he put on the shorts 69 420 and I think I can convince you that this is like a mega meme based on a lot of his old history so let's talk about the shorts themselves for the uninitiated in investing in the stock market when you want to bet against the stock you short it so you short sell it I'm not going to talk about the mechanics of what that means but just know that shorting the stock is betting against it and now Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks in the market and even though he doesn't deliver the profits you might expect from a typical car company he still has stock prices keeps going up and up and up as I showed with the Exxon example earlier the most famous short seller of Tesla has been David Einhorn a former billionaire keep that in mind he runs a fun green light capital and in 2018 he compared Tesla to Lehman Brothers which was the investment bank that went bankrupt and ultimately precipitated the great financial crisis so what's so funny about the Einhorn situation was Einhorn was a very vocal short seller of Tesla and Musk was very well aware of this but Musk had a good time with Einhorn so it turned out that Einhorn actually leased Musk's car and he gave up the lease and Bloomberg reported it of course uh when Bloomberg reports this Elon the mean master is going to jump on it to have a good time look at the first response here it's Elon Musk and he says tragic I will send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time and this is where it gets really good that wasn't an empty promise Elon actually reached out to Chubbies the apparel company and they tweet on Elon's tweet on it fam and they prepared a box of short shorts and if you're thinking to yourself oh there's no chance that David Einhorn actually received this package uh you would be mistaken so here's David Einhorn tweeting that he received the shorts and he actually made a pretty funny joke here he says that the shorts came with the manufacturing defect kind of like what he was saying about Tesla but he has also since then fallen out of the billy rank and I'm gonna have to give this round to Elon so that kind of wraps up the short part of the short short meme and now I want to talk about the 69 420 the price that Elon put on it and how he has previously hinted at those memes in the past which are incredible first let's talk 420. in internet meme 420 refers to april 20th which is national weed smoking day but two years ago when Elon Musk tweeted about the number 420 it was in reference to taking Tesla private at 420 a share he said that funding was secured and that this share price was at a significant premium to the existing public stock market price so this obviously moved the stock uh quite significantly but it turns out you can't actually make these statements if they're not true and Elon ended up paying 20 million dollars to the security and exchange commission uh Tesla also had to pay 20 million dollars as you see had said that Elon misled the markets now if you're thinking to yourself you know this is honest mistake maybe Elon was just a little bit excited and he had fundamentals around the number 420.

uh that is just not true it turns out that Elon picked the number 420 uh in reference to the 420 meme and he did it to impress his singing or you know a musical artist girlfriend Grimes I want you to think about that for a second Elon Musk ended up paying 40 million along with Tesla for what was essentially an inside joke on an internet meme and he said that's the 420 part of the $69 420 price tag you're probably wondering okay the $420 part I get that that makes a lot of sense that tweet was pretty famous what does $69 have to do with Elon Musk here's a little bit of detective work to identify why $69 matters to Elon Musk other than the fact that $69 is just a hilarious internet meme thing so Elon Musk was born on June 28th and $420 the number we just refer to national weed smoking date is obviously April 20th so if you actually calculate how many days there are between those two dates you're gonna come to a pretty funny number sure enough the number is 69 there are 69 days between 420 and Elon Musk's birthday June 28th and if you think this is just a coincidence that I found that Elon Musk is not aware of uh let me point you to this tweet do I even have to read this I'm not reading it this is so good okay so what does this all mean it means if you control the memes you control the universe and Elon clearly does you can see from this chart I've put up every time he's done a merch drop Tesla is up the next day and just for my end as a student of Elon this video is 489 seconds which is 420 plus 69 and I'm just doing that out of respect for Elon thank you I am a student you are the meme god and short shorts for everyone if you enjoyed this video please leave some comments below subscribe and now watch Elon Musk as John stopping Mr. Short Shorts
