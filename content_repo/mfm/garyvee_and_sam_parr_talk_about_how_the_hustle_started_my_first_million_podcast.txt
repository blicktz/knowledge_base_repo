so how about as a kid like were you entrepreneurial yeah so I grew up in Missouri and then I went to college in Tennessee and when I was in Tennessee I owned a chain of hot dog stands called southern Sam's wieners as big as a baby's arm and and like how old were you I started when I was like 20 but before that I was selling stuff on eBay but like that was my first legal business I got business license and pay taxes and things like that have you said TV show called American Pickers yes so Mike the main guy the skinny guy I met him on the street because I was a big fan and I asked him to work at his company or at his store he was open up a store where they sell like all the old shit and I worked there and it was great but there was always a line of like a thousand people and I was like I'm gonna go open up a hot dog stand so hot dogs these people and that's what happened because the show was so famous that yeah when I worked there in 2011 or no sorry 2008 or 9 or something like that we were number two on cable behind Pawn Stars and all these people from around the world would come and get in this line where was that it was in Nashville and it but it's he like he's into old stuff right so he got this old building that was away from everything and there's no restaurants and I was like huh he's I'm from the south so I can say this but they're kind of rednecks who would come and wait in line and I was like these fuckers want some hot dogs and water that's all they want and I opened up this hot dog stand and that was like my first hustle yeah first business made money and I'd pay taxes and got licenses and how did that go how long did you do it for a few years I mean you would make a grand a day on a good day yeah it was awesome and then I started a website that made a little bit of money but I was like oh the internet's the way to go and so I left school and moved out to Silicon Valley San Francisco and originally had job offers at Airbnb but at the time it was called air bed and breakfast but I was like you know screw this let's try to start something so I started a roommate matching app that had a small exit and then kind of parlayed that into the hustle and what I'm doing now and what was that company called and who did sell to it was called bunk originally bunk SF it was so what we would do is it was kind of funny we would cold email all these landlords and apartments who had two three four five bedroom apartments and then we would host parties so people who had similar wants and needs for living situation could all meet one another and we would help them move into these buildings and we would take a small cut of like a placement fee and so it was a small exit like hundreds of thousands of dollars to apartment lists so apartment list calm and did you have to work in that company or no yeah and I quit on the first day day six or whatever it was yeah like that last day how was that how you know as somebody who now it sounds like your whole career has been for yourself how was that year working so it was good like I still don't know shit like I had to read books on like how to run a meeting so I felt like I moved to San Francisco from Tennessee I and I'm gripping Missouri I always felt really uncomfortable and out of place there but I love it now I didn't do anything like I would say things that were inappropriate I would wear stuff I wasn't supposed to wear I just felt horrible so it was good to see like what an actual business is run like but I was also young I was 22 and I was partying and I didn't take it as seriously as I should have and I I regret that big time but it was great to see what was the biggest take what would you argue the one or two or three biggest takeaways were from that year even though you were just leveling up like okay so you guys have a great setup here okay um you started in like a small room I imagine yes a shitty office that's right and so just seeing like wait I could take all these little silly things like a hot dog stand or whatever and like properly build it out with nice offices after you get revenue and like like I need you in order to get huge as big as my ambitions were you really need to properly approach things and be able to like have a go up proper levels as opposed to have you started the challenge proper so like for example what was funny running through my mind in when you just said you know I read books on how to run a meeting properly I was like laughing in my head because I was like fuck man I probably hate that book right because like to me like meetings and like how the world those proper things you're referring to see meetings and how I personally see meetings there's a huge Delta and I'm cure how old are you now I just I'm 30 I'm curious you know someone who also came from out of bounds and never understood proper I always wonder I'm always challenging myself of like what was I naturally gifted in in an entrepreneurial and human way what has evolved over these 22 years of operating and what have I taken on that is horseshit because it's osmosis yeah I feel you but to my here in my mind it's like this okay when you play an instrument when you learn the guitar you don't it's most people don't play songs of their own songs right away they kind of copy other people and feel the texture and they go oh I see some kind of like the the stuff that I like I see recurring patterns yeah this is interesting I can I can disregard this other stuff so what I do is I I'll usually read books I'll read like I'll read your guys's glass doors I'll get it other companies glass doors I'm like all right what do people say what yeah like what's the baseline for like what is interesting and I can you can hit cherry-pick but like if you don't know like anything you have it's easier to have like a model and then you can know what to disregard yeah but I would argue that your analogy for the way you went about it unless I'm missing something is actually not flawed but not exactly the same analogy because it sounds like based on your hot dog business what you're telling me is you didn't play other people's music you picked it up started playing something and within that micro area it worked yeah I would also I would also argue that you know it's really interesting where the source of information comes from right so there's a lot of business books being written by people who've never run a business why I usually read biographies fair enough glass door is just anonymous reviews yes very dirty data one foreign or one other end that's what I mean I mean you're at this young age where you've had these levels of successes you know I have such empathy for where you're coming from because I'm sure I had a lot of those same feelings of like I'm from out of bounds I don't go to business school and things of that nature and I remember ironically it's interesting for you to bring that up I also remember kind of hitting the Silicon Valley scene and like every single person went to Stanford and Harvard and I was like thank God for me very different for you that I already had such a real significant win that I was able to kind of use that but I have so much empathy for what must have been going through your mind in that scenario on the flip side you're catching me at a very funny time where I would what are we February 24 these eight weeks are probably my favorite eight weeks of being an operator in a long time because I decided going into this year that I was gonna go more me because I've really let the company do its thing I'm running the company but I've let the osmosis of like classic executives have a lot of say over the last half decade and I would argue the last eight weeks have been some of those productive weeks at VaynerMedia's history and definitely my favorite time in the last four years because I'm going back a little bit to hot dog with the baby arm shit yeah I I don't disagree we agree I think that but it's still important it was important for me to understand because you need that context yeah I get it I get it like I was like my hot dog thing I'd be like alright I'm just gonna pick take this thousand dollars in cash I'm gonna put that shit right in my pocket right like I'm gonna incriminate myself but you don't have to be you're gonna spend it on some dumb shit well I didn't spend on that man no no no oh you got it keep going you know I just did do things right didn't do proper accounting I get it now that we have an eight-figure you know we make seven figures a month it's a good I think it could be a very large company just learning how to do shit properly now not not not everything needs to be proper no like to the outside world but like there are some things like all right I gotta make sure I do things the right way 100% you know when things go from just and have you brought in people like is that how Adam is our president which who I knew from high school he kind of he's the president runs a lot of the day-to-day stuff he's a straight man yeah yeah and so I'm able to like I'm able to kind of be my wild self and then well we don't always meet in the middle sometimes I I will will still go the wild route but like there I have some proper procedures dude for a while I was doing the accounting and not good and I was like I thought cash flow and revenue were the same thing I've got guys we got to get these people to put the money in our bank that's not revenue I'm not paying your quota on that and I get it and then you learn all that right stuff you know how the right way to do it that's I'm referring to I totally understand you know how it is like not coming from this area it's really uncomfortable at first but it's actually a advantage in the end I think a hundred thousand percent I used to have this book club called the anti MBA because when I moved to San Francisco I was so jealous of all these Stanford people so I would create this book club and we'd meet once a week and then we'd get experts to come in and lead the discussion and I was like we just did the same thing as Stanford of course but yeah it's really uncomfortable I think you know how it is
