You were at Harvard when he launched Facebook at Harvard? So Mark Zuckerberg, I went to college undergrad with me. I was his same classmate.

And so Facebook definitely existed before I was starting Learn Best. But I, you know, 2007, 2008, when I was starting the idea, Facebook, I think, was founded in like 2004. So it existed, but it was very much, you know, you weren't building your business on Facebook.

Hold on. You were at Harvard when he launched Facebook at Harvard? Yeah.

What was that like? Do you remember when you heard about Facebook? Do we remember?

Are you kidding? You, like, could never have forgotten. You know, I remember actually at the end of your username would be the number of Facebook user you were.

And I was, like, in the hundreds. So I was, like, roughly around 150. And you knew it because it was just the most helpful thing on the planet.

It'd be like, oh, what's that person's name again? I can look them up. And I always joke with my husband.

When my husband asked me out, I, like, couldn't look up who he was yet. He'd asked me out before Facebook existed. And I remember being like, oh, I can't remember who he is.

Like, is it this guy or that guy? And it just, like, my kids will never know a world where you, like, can't look somebody up. I mean, it's just really powerful.

Did you think at that time, is it going to be a big deal? Or were you like, this is useful for Harvard and that's, you know? I mean, like, could you foresee that it was going to be, like, a $75 billion company?

You know, I can't take credit for having, like, something that was that kind of crystal ballish. But you knew it was a big deal. Really quickly, you could just tell.

It was, like, the amount of time you were spending on it, how quickly it was spreading. When it went to other colleges and you could look up your opinions at those schools, when you could poke people. I mean, it was, you know, to the credit of Mark, it was an incredibly infectious platform.

And did you know him personally or no? So I didn't know him when we were an undergrad. I met him a handful of times.

And I know his family and his siblings pretty well. But, no, when he was starting at undergrad, I did not know him. Did you think about joining when it was, it's like, hey, this thing is kind of taken off.

I'm a student at Harvard. You were thinking about drop, you know, you dropped out of business school anyways to start a business. I actually was thinking at that time of dropping out of Harvard to start LearnVest, basically.

So my mom convinced me to graduate. I said to her, I want to go start a company. I know I need to.

And my mom was like, can you just graduate pretty, please? I'd gotten into Harvard Business School. My mom was like, can you at least graduate from college?

And to my mom's credit, I did. I'm glad I did. But that itch to go start something was, like, pretty alive.

And I, you know, to the credit of, like, a Mark Zuckerberg, when you are so close to seeing businesses get built, you know, I think they called it the Facebook effect, which is when you can see how powerful the Internet can be. And if you're a hardworking person who has skills, you're like, huh, maybe I should go do something. But I, so yes, and I will definitely say I think Facebook spawns an entire, you know, set of entrepreneurs.

And I said, you know, you're like, you know, set of apps and get of course. And I said, you know, I're bad. I said, you know, I'll be fine with what happens.

I'm not going to call yourself, absolutely. I'll be fine. That's a good morning.

Like, scary. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

I'll be fine. Bye. Bye.

Bye.
