and they said well you shouldn't confuse revenue for success so i said well you guys shouldn't confuse the lack of revenue versus i see either and then they got like kind of upset dude this meeting it goes in like the silicon valley autistic hall of fame what's up we got our friend siki here founder of runway back in the day built a company sold it to zynga built another company sold it to postmates has gone viral many times and there's a lot of people in silicon valley who you almost it's like a film director it's like oh they're working on a new project you really want to know what they're doing that's you uh because you do things with taste so excited to have you here do you uh do you have any good stories from early days of zynga because you sold a company to zynga back when zynga was the did you work with mark pinkus what's he like give me a good zynga story uh okay i have a great story actually uh how i came to report to mark pink is actually itself a great story i have like so many good marketing stories so yeah zynga bought my first second come my first company and i joined as director project under studio wait can you give the background of mark so he marks like a silicon valley og i did he help uh fund facebook to get off the ground was that his first big he did so um he and reid hoffman co-owned bought the uh six degrees of separation patent from a company of six degrees and he angel invested in facebook and but also licensed a patent i believe for more stock into facebook that patent was basically the kind of the social networking patent right like how how we're we're connected six degrees of kevin bacon away from each other and i think reid the store some there's some story where reid and him realized that if this patent got in the hands of microsoft or some big company that they would be able to squish innovation by a startup by like holding this patent over their head so they bought the patent i believe and just decided we're not going to use it to stop anybody and then they i think parlayed it into to getting extra shares in facebook which is amazing i think that's what happened yeah um so when i joined i was director of products and my girlfriend my wife who i recently met moved to china for some job work thing and i was like three months into zynga and i was like i'm not really feeling it's not that fun so i told them i was going to resign and move to china and they said hey why don't we just give you this new job um you know you can report to eric schreinmeyer one of the co-founders and basically be head of product for the company i said that sounds fun that sounds great so so i did that so i reported eric schreinmeyer he was a co-founder zynga and what happened is a month into the job eric schreinmeyer stopped showing up to work like wouldn't run emails wouldn't go to work and i was like what and basically that's when i reported to mark and i was the head of products uh and later the the the punchline the story is what i the reason why he stopped showing up to work is i later found out that he decided to become a ninja pretty good reason it's not what i thought was going he literally he was like he wanted to start a ninja dojo and he wanted to undergo ninja training and so when i what in the napoleon dynamite is this story how's his ninja career now uh i think he started another um uh social games company all right so i have this notebook here and the reason i have here is i take notes whenever we have a guest not because it's my job and i'm a podcast host but because a lot of times what the guests are talking about it's just so interesting to me as a human i just want to go and like implement it in my business or my life and the person i took the most notes for was jesse itzler if you haven't heard that podcast it's the best like it legitimately changed my life and so i thought let's share our notes and so with the help of the team at hubspot we went and took all of the notes from that episode and we turned it into a 10 page document you can download it for free it changed my life that episode i think it might change yours so check it out the link is below in the description again notes with jesse itzler down below so at the time what was zynga like was it like on top was it king of the world at the time or was it on the down swing yeah i mean what's interesting on zynga is they hired a bunch of people who are used to be investment makers to be product managers there because it was just all about the numbers going up it's highly analytical so i went in and just the amount of like knowledge i had about growth one of the things that really blew my mind i think about a lot is when i first had a commerce v mark pinkus uh early on i think maybe during the acquisition i asked him hey what do you think about this like industry it just seems really low moat it's hard to have a competitive moat here because it's just so easy to enter you build a new game and for it to expand and how defensible is it when i think about his answer quite a bit because his i was like no this is great i want there to be more new intrants into the space because it's free r d for me and i just like okay that is that blows my mind that is next level because he would just so confident ability to execute that like anyone who's kind of come in with some new idea they can just like fast follow it and do a much better job of growing it which is like what they did right farmable was in the first farm game poker was the first poker game um and that they work really really well at least during the facebook era wait did he have like genghis khan energy where he was like is he a conqueror yeah he did he did i mean you know we were working like 80 90 100 hours a week of zynga and uh that was kind of the norm it sort of seems like a waste of talent though to have that conquer energy and do it in the lamest way possible you know yeah like farm bill like that's what he's like trying to do this on like a few billion dollars a few billion dollars there's a um there's a quote by max levchin at the time max left and who created paypal is by all accounts like a genius computer engineer single handedly was like fighting fraud at paypal and and like with as a one-man army like withstood you know the attacks of all of these sort of financial scammers around the world the guy's brilliant and then his next startup i think was slide and it was making like widgets for myspace and facebook where you'd be like slideshows or super poke where you throw like chickens at your friends when you wake up uh you know by pushing a button and it just slaps your friend with a chicken or something like that and they go what was your takeaway from slide slide ultimately didn't fully work out sold to google i think for a little bit but he goes be really careful what you choose to work on because everything can be optimized endlessly so he's like once we got in that we could just sit there and optimize and just get the number of chicken slap per day up um so you know choose wisely what should i be optimizing this chicken slapping or should i be doing something else and i've always thought about that because i found myself falling into the same trap no matter what i'm doing if i'm selling little widgets my life becomes about selling widgets and i can optimize that to infinity and people do if you go look at how any company works that's what they've done they've optimized it to infinity dude when my wife worked at facebook years and years ago i remember like i was talking to all of her co-workers at a party and i was like oh you guys are amazing you guys are so smart what are you working on and they explained it to me but it boiled down to they're trying to convince brazilians to put more stickers on their photos like the there was like one dog that had a long tongue do you guys remember that dog yeah yeah yeah like they're trying to convince that dog sticker to put brazilians it was like the face it was like the face filter thing when snapchat came out and then you opened up your mouth a giant tongue would come out dude i felt like when they explained that to like i kind of both i was like wait so you're just trying to get like brazilians to use more stickers because they share more photos i felt like a cartoon it was like what like you know what i mean i was like what are you guys doing i also have a max levichin and slide story uh this goes back 17 years so i don't think they'll mind anymore but um when i this is when i first moved to the city and i had this app on facebook was blowing up and so some guy who worked with keith for boy keith for boy was i think the ceo of slide at the time he said hey we like your app you want to meet you know the team i said oh my god this is amazing i'm a year out of college it could be max lepchin um so i go in and we had a meeting at noon and i will go to the slide office and no one was there everyone's out for lunch and i talked to receptionists i said hey i'm here to meet max and keith and they're like i'll draw lunch uh they'll be back in half an hour i said okay so we sit there for half an hour and then they walk in and they act like they kind of forgot there was a meeting um but we go in the meeting room and we just start talking about what i wanted to do with this app by build whether i wanted to build it independently or maybe like join slide and they asked me how much i wanted for it i said well i have a co-founder so two million dollars i would probably do it a million dollars each i kind of laughed at the number like what like i looked at uh the evaluation on app data and like the amount of money we're generating it's not a huge ass but it's fine it's too much um my friend that heel built super poke which i recently bought and they said verbatim you know we bought super poke and he's easily the 18th or 19 most important person company now out of a company of like 60 people uh i said okay that's a compelling offer and then i said uh and i said yeah this is probably not gonna happen and i said you know we're profitable we were making a bunch of money from ads so it's cool if you don't want to buy it and they said uh well you shouldn't confuse revenue for success and at this point i was just like really upset so i said well you guys shouldn't confuse the lack revenue versus i was either and then they got like kind of upset so then so then it got really weird um oh i forgot to mention like at the start of the meeting they said something like hey you know there's a recession coming up to each other and they're like yeah there's a recession coming up and then he said i can't wait to buy all these shitty companies for cheap like we're in the room and we're like what what the hell dude this meeting it goes in like the silicon valley autistic hall of fame and then at the end keith was like hey keith hey max what was your body fat percentage in the in the in the paypal days and max was like eight percent and i was like yeah and i'm like look i'm not the fittest person but i'm not selling you my company because he's like you're fitter than me like what what's happening so that was like meeting with them but the thing that made it all make sense made sense is the next week i was talking to my uh one of my friends john who also was an uh had a company building apps and he comes up to me at some party he goes see he man like you won't believe this so i just had a meeting with slide last week i'm like really he's like yeah it was so weird because they started meeting talking about how there's a recession coming up and thinking all these countries are cheap i was like oh my god is the script uh it was in episode one of this podcast i think uh my buddy suey told almost the same story he goes he gets invited to slide he says oh my god and what they said was they were like you should uh we want to hire you and he's like i don't really want a job like i have my apps good i thought you wanted to like maybe buy it or something and then he opened the door and he goes you see all those guys out there they they're gonna build your app in like six days if you don't take this offer and he was like okay i'm not interested in this even more now i'm like this is horrible my app is stupid what he said he goes his app at the time was called like superlatives it was like you would name your friend most likely to you know go to jail or something he's like you're threatening me that you're going to take my app i think my app is stupid the fact that you think my app is cool makes me think you're stupid that's what he thought in his head uh siki who did you meet i i love talking to people uh to people who have been uh around a bunch of these folks before they kind of quote made it who is a tycoon or a big shot now that you're shocked by because of when you knew them when you guys were both younger you uh you're like oh i can't believe they they actually developed into such an amazing uh business person i i don't don't know that i met a lot of people who weren't great other than anything great that were huge later um who's someone you met that wasn't huge then but you knew and why did you know oh yeah i mean drew houston you know when did you meet him dropbox was like 10 people it was 2000 late 2007 early 2008 and we were just talking about growth it's like they had this like college referral plan um so drew houston i mean anish who's general permanent andreessen like he was a just a founder building apps on mobile phones right and he would come to my office and we talk about it oh probably the best one is chris wansroth who's that he's co-founder of github and he was a contractor at powerset which was like this job i took when i first moved to the city but he was actually a contractor for my first company serious business he i had him build this translation layer between facebook markup language and my space markup language uh just to look after and he was really good at it um and i distinctly remember that we were at 21st amendment um yeah or or actually uh the bear a brewery doesn't matter but um i gave him a full-time employee planning offer uh in early 2008 and he was considering it and the same night he when we're talking about he said you know dhh just put rails on github and so i think i might work on github full-time and i was thinking in my head and i was like the smart thing for me to do is actually shut down my facebook days business and go work for you but i didn't say that but i was thinking have did you have you had any massive um uh angel investment wins because you're around the hoop for so long and so and yeah i mean the best i mean the best one by far is amplitude um and that one was i was introduced through um actually yeah someone at zynga uh matt akko who runs data collective now and he introduced my very first angel of s pen after i sold to zynga uh and now like 10x in like 12 months and so i was playing with play money up after that and he introduced to his team that we ended up being the fourth customer of uh for analytics platform it's now amplitude and we used it we thought this is great it's the best thing we thought we've seen since the zynga internal tools and i managed to get into the seed round and that ipo that you know we ended up being a 400x uh return on that which is pretty great let's jump in with ideas opportunities you're an idea guy what do you think are some cool ideas or opportunities that that you would want to be working on right now um so i built a zapier and it's basically categorizes my emails with gpd4 into different labels so i have this very long prompt and automation um and i also use a protocol same box which also does something similar filters my emails but there's been no good version of email management software that i'm able to customize the prompt and train it so i want to say hey here's the things related to my kids and there's no keywords necessarily you can you have to kind of read it it's like some email to my babysitter or or an email from the school and if it's related to my kids i want you to put in this folder and the idea is i want an inbox for like these different contexts um and so people are doing different kinds of email categorization what's missing is there's no way to train it so i think building some way for you to for a product to understand all the content about your life and organize your stuff starting with inbox will be really handy for me um and i've seen at least 12 companies do this and no one has done a really great job of it i just tested this product have you guys heard of this um i can't think of the name right now um but it was this thing where i it sounds insane where it recorded my screen for weeks at a time and it would see how i'm typing what i'm saying to people and it would give me feedback on the productivity of my day and how i can improve it have you guys seen this it started with an r i think is it called uh elect or something or isn't it uh yeah rescue time no no no sean you're right it's sort of guy the guy who started it's like a like a he's like a guy he's like been around uh he was doing like a pendant or something right at one point and then now it's a oh rewind then rewind yeah yeah yeah rewind.ai is that it yeah they stopped working on it now it's called limit listeners working on the pendant now yes i was tinkering with rewind and the promise it it's not there yet but the promise of this is is was amazing i like i was like so into this um and it's kind of describing what you're what you're just explaining because we're having to use zapier and openai or chadgbt to like kind of duct tape this all together their premise was amazing and that is exactly what i'm looking for i got a third one which is like a lot spicier but you know like this is not a venture blockable thing but you know just character ai and chai and all of these like chat bots that really people are using for um sexy chats i think like someone could and these things print money by the way like they immediately generate millions of dollars a month uh i thought if if i were just in it just to like print money the thing i would make is something that is kind of like tender but basically everything is ai generated so it's not like oh you're creating a robot but it's a fake dating app where everyone is attractive and is super into you and then you can like that then you can go off of your tinder app and go on instagram and there have an instagram account on actual instagram is that it's owned by the the the person that you met on your fake tender app siki do you know who tai lopez is he's like the guy who had the infomercial that was like here in my garage i do know who he is yeah so tai uh one accuses he came on mfm years ago and an accusation that i learned about him based off of the comments on youtube is that years and years before he was whatever he was famous for he owned dating apps and the accusation accusation was that all of the users were completely fake and that it was guys in the philippines like running it and uh doing exactly what you're describing that's true of the majority of dating apps what do you mean that's just like standard offer day procedure like plenty of fish you know like uh a seeking arrangement like that is their business model um they're like and in fact outsource men acting as women yeah there's also like the webcam industry like like they up until open ai the companies with the most advanced ai technology is going to be one of these companies because they are better at creating chat bots than anyone they have the most advanced technology i'm not not kidding like i know people who work there or run it uh they've just developed better chat bot technology than anyone and gbt that'd be so funny if that's where agi starts actually it's not open ai it's none of these labs it's like whatever some of these like web webcam sites developers in slovenia that's not a crazy idea i mean isn't that how it typically has been where a lot of like the vice industries are the ones pushing the pushing the envelope yeah yeah yeah it's a transformative for only fans right like i don't know if you've read but like there's you know you're a big influence for only fans and you have an army of 100 people who are like typers or chatters right and the funny thing about them is they're not just chatters that are flirting they're also basically salesmen so what they're doing is they're chatting to try to upsell you until that get buy this video buy this photo i don't know exactly buy the subscription whatever the the thing is but they're they're not just customer support they're actually sales but they need to come across like they're the original person um which is just hilarious what do you think that office environment is like uh so i actually i know someone who works in um that and it's just normal it is like the most boring cubicle normal office environment that you've ever seen that's almost better it's a job it was weird the uh the other thing with the dating apps i think that they did was i remember seeing the study about match.com because if you're a guy on match.com you would basically send out you know 30 messages and you'd get you know one back or whatever and what they would do is they realize that a lot of guys accounts would go inactive because they're not getting replies and so what they would do is they would basically send they would show an active person 30 inactive profiles knowing that that inactive person is not there to reply but that that will be the notification for that person to come back and reactivate their subscription they have to pay to go read their inbox and to be able to reply and so the it's almost intentionally a horrible experience for the person who's there trying to find somebody in order to reactivate all the churned members and they would do they would basically in a the first hundred matches they would show you you know something like 50 60 70 of those matches were all just inactive people they wanted you to send a notification to to make them come back that sounds like a zynga train pm dude i went to the zynga office once back in the like heyday it was the craziest office i've ever seen sam did you ever go to this thing yes uh it was right it was like it shared a building or was next door to airbnb and it had a huge bulldog in the front right and i think at one point i think they i think they owned the building and i think the building was worth at one point more than the company like you know hundreds of millions of dollars why what what did you think of the office sean well you would go in there's a giant tunnel like an led tunnel you would walk through just to enter and then when you're there first of all there was dogs everywhere and it was like everybody it was bring your dog to work there was just like herds of dogs running around it was insane and we met the chef and the chef like the food operation was more sophisticated just the cafeteria was more sophisticated than any company that i'd ever i'd ever been a part of like just the food part was better than my actual company so like they had a staff of 60 people on the culinary team they had a roof on the top where they were growing all the vegetables he had like a giant fridge that was like the size of like a swimming pool you'd walk in and there was cows hanging upside down because they had their own butcher process they they didn't serve soda they only brewed their own sodas like everything was soup to nuts custom and like like just so insanely sophisticated for a cafeteria program i was like man if the food is like this i don't even want to know what the actual you know like teams that do the work are and i walked into one pm thing and it was like a stock market dude his screen had so many metrics fine-tuned in real time where they were running so many tests at a time and it was like you said siki like it looked to me from the outside like you know the most data-driven operation i had ever really seen you know i knew about what we did but what we did look like you know cavemen compared to what what they were doing in terms of sophistication of data the the food thing reminds me like i was the person who did a petition for us to serve real bacon and after a few months we finally started to serve real bacon because we never had real bacon it was only turkey bacon because you know mark pincus didn't like to kill pigs but yeah like one of the things that people did at uh zynga in the product org is we have pm on call and i never seen this on any other organization the pm on call for every game would daily send an analysis of what changed day over day and so if there's a drop then you would segment it and so oh my god there's like an anonymous like 50 drop uh in mexico uh for farmville and we're not sure why because usually on wednesdays at two it shouldn't be like this and it lasted three hours long and they would have to explain oh it's because the world cup is happening what comes what comes first we are with mr beast a few weeks ago and i had the same question but he wasn't able to articulate or answer it what comes first when you're that data or analytic oriented does it are you that way and scale comes because of that or uh are you can you only behave that way because you have scale so it depends on the environment for if if it's a data friendly environment like facebook is then like facebook platform is where virality lets you grow from zero to a billion then data is all that matters but you can see in the his in the experience of zynga that that didn't translate to the mobile industry mobile was less about virality it was just difficult to do distribution a lot more of that creativity and that's why supercell had such a great advantage because they actually built very fun new games um so i think it's the completely dependent environment if it's hard to get early distribution then scale makes it makes data more important but if it's quite difficult to get early distribution then you want to be creative and innovative and brand and creativity matters a lot more do you remember any uh like random game change like color red to blue or flashing lights or whatever that just generated like 10 million dollars overnight i i always remember thinking that like the best way to generate 30 million dollars overnight is just to like say hey you it's going to take you 10 just to unlock the game today like we could just like make a not payable and people pay one of the more interesting ideas is this idea of crew so we had this idea of collecting materials and you ask people materials uh one of the mechanics that we invented at zynga is this idea of crew where you for whatever thing you want to unlock you have to get at least like 20 people to help you unique people uh because what that did is what we saw in the data is that when you do materials you ask same two people over and over again but if we have a unique spread then that increases the distribution and that ended up being like a pretty large boost in the aus um another thing that we saw is like just the power segmentation and so there was this one day where our our numbers went down anonymously and i had to figure out what is it like this channel or that channel turns out there was a one particular typo bug in the drop rate of this particular treasure that was creating a lot of opportunities for people to share and so you just spend all day doing things like that uh and so and it's rarely something like huge but it's all all the details added together that makes a difference isn't it what were the other uh business ideas or opportunities that you think are exciting right now yeah i mean i was i actually uh asked sam altman to make this but uh i don't know how long they're going to take but um i'm doing a lot of medical research what what did you say i'm open to make this product he's like oh i thought i thought you were like oh you had sam all they make a list for you to talk about i was like no oh no no we're not that tight but no um i was doing a bunch of medical research and uh i noticed that you can't access um paywall articles and so i really wish someone will make a version of deep research that lets you enter my your paywall credentials so you can get full text access uh and this goes further i think there's just so much data behind uh auth walls paywalls that you can't get to and you can only search on the open web and the more private data you can get access to the more useful these ages become so that's like probably number one thing i've been thinking about what's the name of the company uh that starts with an r it's based in england sean we've talked to him about them a bunch it's like an acronym anyway it's a uh an academic publishing company in england and it's like really controversial because i think it has like the second highest profit margin of all publicly traded companies in the world behind public storage and the shtick behind it and why everyone hates it is because researchers at universities don't get paid anything for this in fact oftentimes they have to pay tuition in order to even go to these places but they take your research and they put it behind like a thirty thousand dollar a year paywall uh and so it's a very frustrating industry yeah it's uh that's the whole industry right el sevier i think is the biggest one and there's a bunch of controversy around that and yeah all of these are extremely hard immersion businesses they charge an arm and a leg for access the researchers get paid nothing the peer reviewers get paid nothing all they're doing is just like taking the tats and copy and paste it and putting somewhere and maybe like printing it into a journal um so how would this work you're talking about like you told sam altman to say hey can i just give chat gpt my credentials and then it can go log in for me and use that information when i ask it questions so that's that's exactly right he would have to do it how could a founder well how would a founder get around that or how would they do this yeah i mean you wouldn't need access to o3 the full model first because that's what open research is based on but i mean it's not terribly difficult to create something like a deep research um there was a company called there is a company called gen spark so i'm friends with the founder gen spark he used to be a vp of search at baidu which is the google of china and they made a version of deep research just using a different model and so that's relatively easy to build i think the storage of the credentials and logging in is a little bit more tricky right it also just seems like somebody could just create like science pal or something like that it's like specifically for researchers and it's a chat gpt like interface but it's specifically trained on or going to access all of the journals all of the all of the academic research out there for you um and just do like a vertical thing isn't there like a google for doctors that's like this like lumos or something like that is so there's uh so i'm deep in the space there's a company called illicit there's a company called uh cy space and what they allow you to do is they let you search abstracts where available and also you can upload individual pdfs too which also chadzp allows you to do but there's nothing i've seen that is lets you that's indexed as the full text of all these journals uh with your credentials and why are you so interested in why what's all this research for is it for uh i i is it your daughter and if it is what's the story behind that yeah so my daughter was diagnosed with the rare brain tumor last september um and we've been doing everything we can to find new treatments for this because it's so rare and you really get a deep insight into the sentence and the structure of the of the medical uh community and one of the big learnings is that what is available as standard of care meaning that's what's available if you go to a hospital or you talk to a doctor and what is available at the frontier there's a huge gap already um and then further when you have a rare disease just amount of research and data and treatments available is also just thin because you need to have like enough critical mass for for the research to be worth it so they can recoup the uh research costs and the other interesting thing that we learned is that the ip issues are really weird so for example there's this uh drug that is fda approved non-prescription has been out since the 70s to treat pidworms and over the past 20 years there's a huge amount of compelling data this might be a pretty good treatment for different kinds of cancer and there's been no clinical trials for it because there is no money for it because you can't patent a pidworm drug um and so all the money hundreds of millions billions of dollars are going to new molecules are patentable even if things are already available and so once you get into it is you're like wow this is super super broken um and so yeah i'm doing a lot of primary research in order to find repurposal drugs that might already exist that could treat a distrately rare brain tumor it's it you know uh there's um obviously this is super serious and i'm sorry you're going through everything uh but also there's like an interesting like um there's like an like like an interesting like logistical thing of like wait so you are able just to just research potential cures or or or ways to help your daughter on your own and come up with a solution i mean is that like what you hope the outcome like yeah i mean so there's i'm not the first founder type who's been in the situation right so the co-founder of clubhouse rohan his daughter has a range of disease her name is lydia and she he runs the lydia foundation and he's going so far as manufacture his own drugs right for very rare diseases you can do a lot um there is other people have met have done similar things like end of one cures exist and so you can go this is what i mean like if you're sufficiently motivated and there's no one more motivated than a dad with a sick kid uh you could do you can go so much further than what is available standard as standard of care and so even the last time we met with our uh primary care team they were proposing like two particular paths one involving like pretty aggressive surgery and radiation another involving this like drug i proposed a third path and they were discussing it and this is like neurosurgeons and clinicians they came back a week later it's like actually your path things were sets and the reason i was able to do that is like because this disease is so rare i am like more knowledgeable about disease than anyone in the room because they have to like study 50 different cancers yeah right wow that's that's pretty incredible also my experience has been that the doctors once you get off of the kind of standard of care and this is maybe i'm i'm projecting just from like you know i just had a knee injury and i was asking the doctor i was like hey like would prp or stem cells like is there anything should i take what's a peptide can i put a peptide in there and he's like oh you know there's not a lot of evidence you know that's not part of the protocol right you don't have great evidence and he was sort of like my hands are tied he's an orthopedic surgeon he's just like you know my hands are i can only recommend what i can recommend you could do those things uh i don't know and so then i felt like you know i'm on my own here have you once you do this path are you just outside of the medical system basically are you outside of your standard chain of command with your doctors and you have to get your own system set up that's a great question and i've had an almost similar conversation in the last meeting i was just describing and so i saw it play out in real time so the neurosurgeon said hey when we this is operation we did it for this reason do we for some other reason it's not part of the standard of care but our primary clinician she is like she runs he's a principal investigator one of the clinical trials uh the only one of two that treats this disease and she was like yeah you're right we don't have a lot of evidence because there hasn't been a lot of research into the tumor and so sometimes you have to argue for first principles and if it's a fairly rare disease they're more open to being more creative and in our case our clinician was able to convince a neurosurgeon this was the right path or at least it's worth trying and she told us she was excited to have a partner who seems well informed is willing to think outside of the box and i straight up said i do not care what the standard of care is i think the standard of care is crap and she basically said yeah i think so too i just can't say that right dude and that's pretty cool that you're in san francisco too where hopefully you think that like uh the open-mindedness or the early adopter mindset like even uh trickles out to like the doctors and things like that uh that's pretty cool that you're around a doctor who's like willing to try some crazy stuff or what's crazy to a lot of people so to answer sean's question like if you do find your own drug you do have to like show enough research and be well informed enough that someone is willing to prescribe it off label on a compassionate use basis and so you just need to convince a dot one doctor and so if you can't find one you can find others who's willing to do that and then you're in you're in the clear and it's a lot easier if it's like a fairly serious rare disease can you tell the story about you tweeted out about your daughter's condition and then this crazy crypto turn of events happened where someone created a coin and then millions maybe tens of millions i don't even know how much money was raised and then people got mad at you people were speculating on this thing i don't even understand it can you explain what was going on and also just explain is this just was there just degenerate gambling or did you maybe stumble upon a novel way that people might fund research in the future i don't know which one of the two it is yeah i think i have a better idea which one it is after some reflection on it so okay so explain what happened basically yeah uh christmas uh i was going to japan uh to ski with some friends and the family and i was on a flight and i had a plan to start a gofumi for this lab the hankison lab in the university of colorado so we were donating money to them once this happened because they're the only lab in north america that researches this particular tumor called the craniopharyngioma and the treatment that we're on they found so i thought okay for christmas i thought it'd be great to do a gofundme use my network and raise some money for this lab so i tweeted this thread with this gofundme link and that we ended up raising about a quarter million dollars for lab which is like i think the biggest donation up to that point but what happened is some people started asking about hey can i donate crypto and so i said okay uh i posted my ens right my um ethereum name system address and people started donating a little bit of eef and then some other people said hey do you have a sole address because we're on solana and i didn't have a sole address i was aware what solana is but i never touched it and so the next day once i landed i created my first solana wallet i created this address and i tweeted out and basically by the way are you big in the crypto world why were all the crypto guys doing this for you just because what's the motivation other than it's good so i i i didn't occur to me i thought it was um people i had like 77 000 followers at a time uh and i'm not big in the crypto world i've like been on and off accident crypto so it's 2017 but never in a major way um i i'm not a crypto account that people follow uh but i found out why people did this uh later um and this answers the question of sean like is this gambling or is this something else uh but anyway i posted a soft soul address and basically an hour later i looked at my wallet and the wall is at four hundred thousand dollars and it was zero an hour before uh so i'm looking at like what is going on and it turns out so someone created a coin called pump on pump.fun which is a platform where you can create a coin in literally like 30 seconds and i was on eth right and i have an active in crypto this wasn't a thing pretty a new token on ethereum was like a whole process now they short in 30 seconds pump dot fun is that not fun yeah have you seen this business by the way no that's like guys made like 500 million dollars of profit last year like more than that i think more than that yeah and and and so you click a button and you make your own coin and obviously the name there's no hiding that the point of this is that it's a pump scheme pump and dump scheme right they made 500 million dollars at least at least that's just that's a lot of money specifically that's just like the majority of the traffic on solana and so people are basically uh creating these new coins and trading them trying to write it and it's basically uh musical shares right have you guys gone to this website it's crazy it looks like a geo city website like there's like flashing banners this is insane it's all real time like yesterday during the super bowl uh somebody created and set for for dave point and i this sort of barstool jail stool jail and then jail stool ran up to like 100 million dollars or something like that but like he said it's it's musical chairs so you're buying trying to catch one of these thousand x waves but it's gonna dump and you just gotta know when you're gonna get off the train and then if you wait too long or you're the one who comes in late you lose so it is a it's like being at a roulette table or whatever where you're you're just throwing chips at the table trying to trying to hit oh my god yeah it's like the trump coin except you can create it in like 10 seconds 30 seconds but anyway that's why people uh created this coin is because you're looking for these new narratives to gamble on right and the more interesting the more viral seeming a narrative is the more valuable becomes if you're in art early it could really pump so anyway it was four hundred thousand dollars and i tweeted a screenshot there's a whole tweet sort of thread where i was like what is going on and i kept on adding this to the tweet thread with screenshots on my wallet and so it's 400 000 i was like what is happening and people trying to explain someone created this coin called mira and there's a billion tokens and they sent me someone bought half the supply and just sent it to my wallet so i had 500 million tokens and once i tweeted then and i checked again and it's now four million dollars and i'm like what uh and an hour later it's eight a couple hours later it became 15 and at one point it was 20 million dollars just like the same day and the market cap and the market cap of the whole thing that means was 80 million uh correct okay no no i think peak market cap was around 60 million dollars okay and you had 40 million of it yeah because i i sold 10 percent immediately just to like capture something and i sold a bit more in the liquidity pool so you know i got around a million dollars out uh but i still owned 30 of it and immediately i was i said okay i don't know what i'm gonna do with it but every dollar in my wallet is going to charity this is a non-profit it's not for me not just charity going to the research lab going to research research researching the potential course to your daughter's thing okay correct so um i i said hey i'm not going to move anything without 24 hours notice um i'm gonna try to like be very transparent about this and i thought about it and i said i'm gonna start selling a thousand dollars every 10 minutes until like we're done because i just don't have time to run a crypto project and you know like i want everyone to know where this is going so that happened and the price started going down but once we get to it got to a million uh what happened in between is because it's such a big story um a bunch of rare disease organizations started reaching out to me and they're like wow this happened to you can we how do we not get in on this because i throw the phone they're like did you say pump dot fun okay uh-huh the average budget annual budget for one of these organizations like a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand dollars just like not a whole lot of money this is like more money than the community's ever seen it's a lot of excitement there so i thought well i was talking to some crypto friends and i thought okay how do we make this like a thing and maybe we can make this more sustainable long-lasting and this idea turning mira into a launch pad for other rare disease tokens where there is a liquidity pair token uh uh was talked about and so i thought well okay that seems interesting uh before i do that i should probably figure out how a coin works and how you launch one of these so i went on pump.fun and i thought okay let's find out how one of these works so i created a coin called zero and i entered a description for the coin because you could do that i said hey don't buy this coin it literally says don't buy this coin it'll never be worth anything i'm never going to do anything with it it'll be worth zero dollars so i pressed the button and what i didn't realize is because i was on ethereum for a long time but i never had a watch wallet what happened is i was in the background the most watch walleted crypto so within about 100 200 seconds the market cap of this coin that i told people to not buy a watch wallet does a watch wallet mean that you are someone that should be monitored because you're a potential whale yeah like people people start tracking like oh what is vitalik doing with his wallet what is what is people are calling so good with their wall yeah people want to copy what you're and they think that you're and they think you're the man because your wallet is old or you have a lot in it because i was for the main character of like crypto twitter for like a few days right okay understood so there were copy there were bots like just monitoring what i was doing and doing buying whatever i was buying and so they saw this new token and so within 100 200 seconds the market cap of this token was three and a half million dollars so i was just sitting there like panicking and i said okay i don't this is bad i don't want to have anything to do with this so i had half of the entire supply and i sold it and that was my main mistake i should have burned it which everyone would have been happy about right but because i sold i crashed the price of this token and people got very upset because it was considered a rug so now like oh my god everyone's and and when i sold i made like eighty thousand dollars because even those three and a half million dollars in market cap there's only about one hundred thousand dollars or so in liquidity um and yeah i i started a thread explaining oh my god i didn't expect this to happen i got on spaces over video just like i'm really sorry i i'm like still trying to figure out how this works and you know people don't didn't care um and what i realized is just a different community than it was when i was really active on twitter 2017 like people on ethereum they're like very deep tech people right they're like nerdy and with a solana in 2024 i didn't realize like it's so much more mainstream a lot of people maybe have like 50 100 and they're just trying to turn into a thousand dollars and so the amount of emotion there is like very very different crypto transition from neckbeards to like everybody who looks like jack harlow in like four years the community the solana community all has like the line etched into the into like the side of their haircut or like multiple it's very different than like the people that got me into ethereum in the first place today i learned or this month i learned so anyway the market out three and a half million before i sold it dumped at 300 000 and as i started talking about my mistake the market cap came back and at one point it was like five and a half six million dollars just because i was like talking about it and people were just the more upset people were the more the coin pumped and more people money people made from the coin so they were trying to make it like even more dramatic um which i didn't really understand the time i just thought i messed up and people were really upset at me so anyway so then that was like the main villain turn on twitter and everyone was super upset at me because they saw me as a scammer so i thought about what am i going to do with this so first of all like the eighty thousand dollars within a minute i i realized this is a mistake so i bought back in into the coin and i burned it all right so i already was like neutral and i explained that no one cared because of the anonymity of crypto they thought i had like a hundred other wallets that was like though that i pumped and dumped on any profit there and i can't prove otherwise so i decided like this is really shitty and i don't want any part of it so what i decided to do is um i got some help uh from you know a friend he used to or coinbase and other people who didn't want to be named um to do on-chain analysis so what i set on spaces is i'm actually just going to pay everyone back who lost money on this out of my own pocket um and i'm not even touched the charity wallet so what we ended up doing is everyone who held in the first 200 seconds who owned any coins then up until the point 43 minutes later where the market cap fully recovered back to the same value if you sold and you realize loss i'm just going to airdrop you soul and it ended up being like 140 50 000 dollars out of my own pocket uh and i just paid everyone back which has never happened on any pump fun coin before uh and maybe like 10 of the people have heard about this i i tweeted about it i had to like keep on responding because every time i tweet for the next like month someone say oh you're a scammer what are you still doing here and i had to say no i paid everyone back and they would just like not say anything right this is like uh a crypto larry david like thing like it's like this is like you're walking through times square and one of those fake monks put like a bracelet on your wrist and then like now expects you to give them like 20 it says even though he called it a free gift like this is just this is insane so how much did you end up giving to the charity yeah so between go fund me so it was a million dollars from crypto um and just like i locked a bunch of the mirror coin into a liquidity pool so so we're still perpetually generating so you bought a million dollars of charity for 150 000 basically that's correct yeah and then we it's total was like a 1.4 million um we donated more uh to match like the mistake and we added a go fund me to it so ended up being one and then the lab actually like triple leveraged it up into the coin there they they got hooked on pump pumped off fun would you sean put get back to 150 like he did i wouldn't that um i would not have for that situation personally i get why you did it's almost just like dude this is crazy all of this was unintentional uh people are really mad okay what's the sort of like how can i just like clear up any possible confusion but i don't think you needed to in this situation right you created a coin called zero that you said is don't buy this this is going to zero it's a test coin and if somebody went and randomly speculated on it using their like their sniper bots that are trying to track your wallet you know like i wouldn't have given a shit personally but then again these this community is so like crazy that they'll just like make your life hell on twitter for like the next five years it might be might be worth it you know just to clear your own conscious go to sleep at night you know exactly i couldn't it was for me so i could sleep all night because a lot of these people are fairly low income and the money is fairly meaningful it was one reason but another reason is like people just don't read like i explained this i mean the coin says don't buy it i explained this like a couple different times and what i realized is like you just don't read on the internet and as far as anyone else knows because it makes little joys like i the if you don't don't read what it sounds like is i created a scam coin using my own daughter's name to scam people out of right right right it's crazy did you um in the end of this is there anything here that's interesting for fundraising for research or this is just straight like i accidentally got into a gambling pool and kind of got some money for research but this is not a sustainable thing for anybody i'm still trying to figure it out so what i'm hoping to make nira into is so the way this works is you're this is like sort of game theory around okay you own a bunch of this coin because this coin's narrative is attached to you right in the case of you know dave port and portnoy is doing something similar with jailstool and in order to turn it into real world impact you have to sell there's no way around that and so when you sell then you're just like playing a zero sum game against the community and they're all going to be upset for you for sure no matter what um and so that's a very difficult dynamic and i think my idea here is like the only sustainable way to do this is to lock a bunch of the token into a liquidity pool and so that when people buy in or out of it you get to exchange you get the fees and that's not really like selling into your community i think imagine a version of dogecoin where every time someone you know it's like dogecoin is like a couple of tens of billions market cap but every time someone sells or buys it it creates like up to could be hundreds of thousands of dollars a day in fees and which you can then use to donate i think that might be relatively sustainable this is insane i don't even know what to say sounds like a great weekend uh no it was a month it was the last it was christmas up until like maybe you know now and it ruined my vacation and it's been by far the most stressful time i've ever had in my life can we do a quick uh a quick detour we were at a dinner once and you talked about some i think it was a stanford class you took called touchy feely or that's the code name for it i don't know and it's something about communication and relationships and i remember you said this really great thing at the dinner but this was now many years ago and i don't remember it exactly but can you say that bit again i want to hear it again and i think a lot of people might benefit from it so by the way sicky how old are you i'm 41 i think you look like you could be 22 or 41 i have no idea yeah asian no raisin let's go um um yeah so i i took um actually now twice i took i took class again since we taught um this class uh that was based on the stanford business will class called interpersonal dynamics which is the highly rated and most popular class in stanford business school is taught by a professor called carol robbins and it's generally known as touchy feely and it's famous for every participant at some point will like cry in the class but uh carol robbins is now a co-founder of a uh a group called leaders in tech which provides the same class for tech leaders so one of the things that you get taught in this class is so the purpose of the class is to teach you how to relate to people and build connections with other people because people work with other people and one of the most useful frameworks i got from that class is how to think about your connection with other people and how to develop that connection and so the two frameworks to connect is one is the two tracks of of interpersonal communication and the five levels of it so when you're talking with anyone else um there is two tracks there's a content track and there's a relationship track so the content track is filled with facts and a relationship track is filled with emotion and a relationship track is what uh is filled and what has to be filled for a relationship to get become closer and for trust to increase and the way you fill each of these tracks is through the five levels of communication and the idea is when you are talking to someone there's five levels at which you communicate um of increasing vulnerability and death so level one is what's called ritual and that is hey how's it going hey right which it doesn't really say anything we're just it's just ritualized greeting um level two is extended ritual so that is how's the weather how's the game right you're you're you're it's it's a longer version of hey how's it going level three is content so these are facts how's the project is it late what are we going to do uh with this particular idea level four is emotional self disclosure so that is when you say something uh that discloses how you are feeling emotionally at the time i feel sad i feel angry and there's a lot of thought about level four because people think they're doing level four but they're not and that's a very common thing that's unique to the english language which we talk about that was a fairly interesting insight so level five is the deepest one and level five is mutual emotional self-disclosure and it is when you are expressing the emotion that you have about the other person i feel angry at you i feel proud of you i feel disappointed by you that's the deepest level of communication you can have within the person and the content track is only filled by things from level one to three and the relationship track is only filled by level four and five and we are um taught and uh we are taught to really not use level four and five in professional settings but if you want to build a relationship level four or five is kind of the only way you can do it and so a lot of the training is about breaking past the barrier the uncomfortableness of engaging level four and level five communication uh and you basically sit in a circle with 12 people for four days straight um until you like so you can observe the impact of doing level four or five and not doing level four or five and how you are able to be closer to someone or further away from someone in emotional distance has this made your running a company better i mean i would say this is the most impactful thing i've ever done in my entire life like out of any class um i always like as a founder somewhat see the company in some kind of machine and i didn't find it i'm like you know mildly asked for degree so i found it difficult to relate to people uh but it's completely transformed my all my relationships including my relationship with my wife and so one of the ways this was even just last week we had an on-site and i was able to do a mini version of this with our customer success team we just sat or you know i did a very condensed version of this lecture and then we sat and we just talked for about four hours and the amount of closeness people got inside people got was transformative and you wouldn't normally you know sit around for a couple hours in an art setting talking about your feelings and it's very uncomfortable to do so um and it's intentionally so like it's very comfortable for the first couple of uh in the in the case of a real life workshop it's half a day um in the case of us we had it like sort of speed running and it was uncomfortable about an hour but then people uh were really into it and it's weird but everyone at some point was crying about uh some disclosure that they heard or or they've experienced and as a result the team got so much closer and their trust increased that's wild do you so how do you do this in practice right because when you talk about like um you know i feel angry at you about x or i'm disappointed about why i could see myself not having the skills or finesse to be able to do that and let the end result be a positive one versus we start talking you're upset by this well the other person gets defensive or they push back and say well you did you know blah blah blah and so can you give me an example of a conversation that you had that like maybe here's what i would love a conversation that typically would have gone like this or maybe been avoided altogether and instead here's how the actual conversation went that was useful for you as a as a you know ceo leader friend whatever husband whatever whichever example you want to choose yeah so the the first one is easy actually so in most people just don't have the conversation right so the conversation wouldn't say i'm angry you would just be angry and you wouldn't say anything and people can tell is the thing like when when you feel a certain way about someone it it it gets it leaks right like there's a level of even you're not attending a passive aggressive you're just kind of ignoring the person or it comes off like you're it's like oh my god it's late again right right or you didn't do this and so that's the default and that's when you have this negative feedback cycle of well okay you already felt a certain way then you express that unknowingly and now the other person thinks you're angry at them and now they dislike you more and then they do things that you dislike more because they dislike you more and it just gets worse that's how relationships get worse and that's like the default and so if you know that it leaks anyway then it becomes easier to say i'm going to express that and you're going to express it no matter what your choice is do you express it with words or to express it with not words but just like passive aggressive behavior and so and then you combine that with everyone is entitled to know the things that they know but they're not entitled to make things up about what other people are thinking so you are entitled to seeing the same facts as everyone else seeing the same behavior you're not entitled to read the minds of some other person and how they're thinking how they're feeling but you're 100% entitled to share what you're feeling because those are facts to you that's reality and so the mental model isn't and this is kind of like typical because people aren't used to expressing this the mental model is like oh if i am expressing this emotion that means i'm attacking someone and that is true if you don't express an emotion and you're just acting it out but if i were to say you know when i see you do this the story i tell myself is that you don't respect me and i don't know if it's true but this is like what i'm thinking in my head and because of that i feel angry and i just want you to know that because i don't i don't know if you know that you i know that you probably don't because you can't read my mind but i'm guessing you probably aren't intending to make me feel that way and i thought it'd be helpful for you to share for me to share that to you so that you are aware of it um and i just learned that technique in therapy last week amazing i seriously did non-violent non-violent communication framework right it is yeah it's very connected to that i literally just learned that yeah you're you're you're you're you're sharing information right so it's not an attack like you if you are genuinely doing it because you understand that you can't read their mind but other cursors can't read your mind either and so by sharing it is you're offering them a gift of information one question see you said something about the english language making it harder what did you mean by that so what you start seeing when you're in this class with these 12 people and you start realizing that oh like i really only feel closer and i get to know someone better when they say i feel emotion i feel sad i feel angry when this happened and i feel distance when they're expressing that emotion but not saying it you can tell on their faces that they're pissed off and it becomes scarier so then you start learning that oh i need to say i feel the thing about the english language is that we say i feel often without expressing any emotion at all and that's some sort of a quirk that's kind of unique to english so when you say i feel that or i feel like there it is actually grammatically impossible for the next word to be an emotion i feel that you're an is not an emotion i feel like this is fucked is not an emotion i feel sad is an emotion i feel happy is an emotion and we're not used to saying that because the word feel is used uh is is has been you know disused misused for other purposes and so we just often is unconsciously you once you see it you cannot see it people we i ask people it's showed emotion and they say i feel like i feel that and it's never an emotion and it's very very hard to change the habit do you guys do this where like sean in particular i'm curious if you do this but do you guys do this where you like uh you get into this type of whatever you want to call it the touchy feely stuff and you're like this is the way and then like i get into it and then half the time i execute that poorly and all and then like the business sucks and i'm like i gotta have more patience with this person or i gotta like let them get away with shit more or whatever and then i just go right back to the total opposite end where it's like um what do they what do they call this doge where i'm like everyone has 15 minutes to fight for their job like you know like like it's like i get influenced by either side and i don't but there is no middle ground and that's like i like you that the first sign of resistance i crumble sometimes so the but the version of it that happens for me is let's say i i hear this and i'm like ah siki just taught me something this is great two content tracks five levels i'm in i got this i'm going level five baby i don't even need one through four and then i'll go have the next conversation my wife tonight and i'll give her like i feel that no no i feel upset and i know you didn't mean that i tried to do the whole thing and she's like what and then she doesn't she doesn't know all of this she didn't because she didn't go to the seminar and she didn't have the skills and the she's like be a mad sean shut up it's on the front of her mind and so she doesn't play back like the role play that i had heard was and then i'm like well i don't really know the next move okay revert revert back to my old self yeah i mean that's not a bad response honestly because i i think i think you have to do whatever works and the reality is to get good at this you know it took me i i did this four day program twice and every day was like 12 hours a day and you're just sitting in the circle practice did your wife go with you uh the first time she actually did okay so she kind of had a assume i kind of no i kind of smuggled her into her into the hotel room so she didn't go to the class but i will say like the second night when i went home she was like who are you because i was like oh my god i feel so bad i've been such an dude this sounds like have you guys heard of the hoffman institute have you heard of this but i haven't been yeah like i have i've contemplated going to it but i think they it's like uh they have a variety of locations they have one in connecticut near me and then they have a boston one but you go for it's like not expensive it's like two thousand dollars and you go for four days and you can't bring your cell phone you can't you're you're going to be completely disconnected or maybe it's even five days it's kind of a lot but they like everyone who i go who goes to it they won't tell me what happens there but they all say that it's life-changing and they can now develop relationships and connections with other people it's one of these really strange things that i'm so tempted to do but the amount of time to be disconnected is very like nerve-wracking or you know just like scary this sounds very similar it does it's not the time to be disconnected that's the scary part there well yeah it is dude could it might even be seven days could you go seven days without a phone away from your family away from family is a little harder yeah that's hard like in a hotel like it's like crazy to be disconnected but yeah i don't want to like also i don't want to like cry with a lot of strangers that's why i don't want to go to tony robbins i don't want to see anyone i don't want anyone to see me dancing and singing like you know what i mean yeah what's great about leaders in tech is like is they're all like you know well-known-ish founders it's like not cheap to go so even worse around awesome people god i want to be my my most vulnerable self around cool people no actually it's really helpful because you realize that all the people that some people that you look up to like we're kind of all the same like there's very similar insecurities whenever i hear about whenever i hear about this stuff i think of the tony soprano quote where he's like whatever happened to the strong silent type like gary cooper that's that's like i get i go all down this track and i'm like can i just say like hey chief like hi bub i just know that person only at that amount and just say yes or no yeah but then he goes and kills about a dozen people um siki you have this uh interview question that i like you said my favorite interview question after 20 years of doing interviews with people is what is your greatest strength that you are most worried about not coming across in an interview setting why that question i think uh i enjoy breaking the fourth wall and interviews tends to be so standardized or formalized that what my greatest anxiety when i'm interviewing is like i'm actually really good at a thing and you're asking me to you know you know reverse a a leak list or something and it's just not coming across what i find is that it breaks down this deformality and lets people gets people excited to talk about something that they're really really good at telling great stories and you get it you get to know the person just a little bit better and i think the particular thing is like if you just ask what's your greatest strengths it sounds really formal but what is the insecurity that you're bringing in that you're hoping to that you're worried about not coming across interview setting it changes the tone quite a bit it's a great question i'm stealing that yeah that's a good one you know what's interesting is so you you're you're you founded runway which is like uh a very serious business like you're gonna have to hire enterprise people i would imagine um enterprise sales people uh like it's like a i'm basing like the future of my company off of some of the output that i'm going to learn from your software but you have the vibe of like an artist to me where like you you have a variety of like really intriguing projects you're like this thinker almost like a philosopher is this new to be doing like is this like a new challenge for you to be doing something so serious and regimented like and or can you still be like goofy and an artist in this b2b world so yeah funny enough he's a serious business that was the name of my first company and we built fun games i feel like if you call it serious citizen you know yeah because we're a games company serious business fun games um but uh yeah i mean i think it's actually a pretty huge advantage particularly for the things we consider serious so i mean people have the stereotype of business and finances being super serious and super rigid but finance at its best is really about creating value it's about looking forward and thinking about new ideas about how we can push the business forward and grow faster and all these things and in order for us to be creative you have to be in flow and things that are fun keeps you in flow and what we actually hear from our customers that the thing that we hear quite often we love hearing is this software feels fun and that's not a luxury that is a fund that creates flow that creates a creativity that creates value uh and when you use something that isn't fun if something that feels slow or confusing that you're not creative uh and you're making worse decisions so i don't think they're intentional with each other i think they're quite complementary and that is like very deeply part of our philosophy have you ever seen this yes that's that's that's what made me think of that question what's the what's the story of this ikey this happened last week our marketing uh team uh is run by cal freeze who was a yc founder of a company called tyka he's the ceo there and we also have this woman named julie uh fritas uh who was at shopify and uh i was in the office and i just saw them come out in a meeting kind of giggling and they got out this piece of cardboard and started like writing this i'm like what is this like oh you know how like you know you you didn't want to do a billboard we decided just like create a bill for ourselves and just hold on a freeway and i'm like that is such a cracked idea of course that's going to go viral and uh i said i'll do it it's like you will i'm like yeah i'll i'll do it so they're like okay so we walked outside we found a freeway entrance uh and i was just holding the sign um what does it say by the way it says it says if you hate your finance platform get runway.com are you um are you the only founder uh i have a i had a co-founder uh aria awesome on far and he left the company about a year and a half ago almost two years ago because that's like pretty rare i mean you're i don't know when you launch but i feel like you're very very very very early in the period because i remember seeing you guys go on twitter like get get popular on twitter uh that's gonna be pretty uh different to be a kind of a the only founder running a company that'd be kind of exciting right you get to do whatever the hell you want or is it you're gonna be lonely i think the reason why we parted ways is things were just slower to make decisions and neither of us were having as much fun as we wanted to so um and actually i didn't want him to leave like he is i mean i he's still on the board i love him um he's just the most wise and high-interpreter person i've ever met uh he was one of paragh's peers at twitter and he i hired him out of school my first company and now he works for brett taylor uh at sierra but he'll we if things were like going slower doing and wanted and he identified that it was him or our relationship slowing us down he decided to fire himself uh and i didn't think he was right about that but he was he usually is right about just about everything and it totally transformed the company he also must have attended interpersonal dynamics he did not you talked about character ai and chai like some of these ai companies that are crushing it just printing money right now are there any other companies that just have blown your mind in terms of how well they're doing or how fast they're growing right now like uh maybe ai maybe not ai uh 11 labs um i'm just following that company but it's it's they do like basically all of the audio translation generation sometimes defects um and when i met them there were like less than 10 people they were just they were ex-google they're working on the foundation of all technology and they are now i don't know what they last announced but they're in the hundreds of millions they are in like a year or two a year and a half or so um and what what blew my mind is i never seen a group of very good technologists that were also so good at commercializing the technology so rapidly they're at hundreds of millions and hundreds hundreds i feel like this just came out and there's yeah no no no it's just a year and a half right they uh they dubbed our podcast remember that clip where they were like you're speaking hindi now and it was amazing and i dm them and we were like hey this is really cool like so stupid of us not to have pursued that more yeah there's a graph right for wise and the fastest growing sas companies and i think cursor is up there i am fairly convinced that level labs is actually like faster than all of them um but yeah i think they announced some revenue milestone but well when we were tinkering with them it was borderline this is cool this is cute to i need i can use this right now it was like it was like just there so i guess they crossed it and people are actually using it like to actually who are they selling to is it so so apple has audiobooks oh it's not podcast or apple audiobooks right like so previously they didn't have audiobooks and you know you would know that a lot of this um um ai generated power by web labs oh so they and they also they also do ai agents for customer service and support agents and things like that so they're the back end of maybe potentially other software tools as well yeah yeah so they have all kinds of product lines they sell the book publishers the power agents they do why are they better than like what open ai you know like the risk with all these ai companies is that the the general the base models open ai and and anthropic etc can just offer those capabilities you know as part of the main suite do they do something different are they fine-tuning it in some way what's no it's their own found foundational models um and the quality and expressiveness is just better and uh the form factor is better so you can use it for all these rubber use cases and the the voice api of open ai is actually like not as good or is easily usable dude you're super fun to talk to i just like hearing all these like uh i feel like you're like a like a treasure box so i just like pick like i just grab something out of the toy chest like tell me the story behind this you know what i mean i think that's awesome yeah thanks for coming on dude and give people a shout out for your company and where to follow you for more yeah we're runway.com you can follow me at blader blade with an r or runway co um and if you are a cfo you should use our software how much did you have to pay for that domain a quarter million dollars uh it's funny ravicon named the company and suggested that we use it on the.com i think that was smart quarter million is not a lot i feel like for that wait wait what do you mean they've all named the company like you went to him being like hey what should we name this or he just suggested when clubhouse only had one room in april 2020 um it was in the naval app right i think you were on it quite a bit too and so uh when i was thinking about what i want to do for next company i said i want to do a finance company and i got a great name for it naval cfo.ai he's like no don't call it ai it's going to be dated in like two years everything's called ai you should just call it runway as you get the dot com and he wrote the first track into runway and that's why we got the dot com it's so funny that you said it was the naval app at the time it totally was yeah and it was amazing it was the open to talking all rob got it was amazing by the way i was using uh air chat like pretty religiously uh like for like two months yeah um even though i knew air chat's not going to work i was like oh it doesn't matter this is naval's app he's going to be on it 24 7. cool this is like i i like to hang out with the fall i'm not going to email him like a million other people and say hey can we get a coffee just a thousand dollars a month and you can talk to the volume whenever you want right exactly i was like i'm going to be on this i'm going to be on this for two months i'm going to be a power user for exactly two months and i'm going to hang out with the vol and that's exactly what happened i was very proud of myself for that it was great the most fun way to use that app yep dude thank you for doing this you're the man and uh uh we're thinking of you and your daughter and hopefully thank you appreciate you too all right see you thank you that's it that's the pod um you
