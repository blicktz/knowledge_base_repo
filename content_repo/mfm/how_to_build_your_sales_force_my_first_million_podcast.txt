so David Sachs who was founder of Yammer put out a beautiful post or maybe it's a YouTube video that says how to how to build your sales team he's like look I didn't know this when I got into it we started Yammer we thought we're gonna get this bottoms-up adoption then we need to make money they did actually get bottoms-up adoption but they didn't make bottoms-up revenue yeah that's a good distinction they cut the product in and then they go to the CIO and they're like hey every you know 20% of your employees are using this don't you want control over this and so then he just walks through he's like look this thing you don't need to be a genius like just follow the playbook don't try to deviate and invent your own sales system like playbook and so he was so he walks through it I don't remember all the top of my head but he walks through it on YouTube he's like look here's how you calculate your comp for your sales people here's how you calculate your quotas there's these two options you're either gonna go with this path or this path depends on the price your product and here's how you need to think about it here's when you hire you know sort of a sales manager and here's what you have here's how you compensate them he literally just lays it out and it's like oh this is if you're somebody who's in that who's you know building your sales organization and you kind of don't know what you're doing just google David Sachs YouTube how to build your sales team or whatever and you'll find this YouTube video with like a hundred views but it's I mean Sachs is the best he's super smart on this and he's obviously done it a bunch of times what I think is interesting is you know Sam what you said earlier like when we come into companies one of the first things we help them do is just triple prices and that does that's the same thing if it's a 5k ARR just there a 5k ACV same thing if it's a doesn't matter what it is like you almost always can price things significantly higher than you think you can and generally like the companies we work with you want to see them at a minimum like 25k ACV that's like that if you're having if you have 25k accounts like that's 25 thousand dollar accounts rather that's where you're yeah a year that's where you start to see some real leverage from putting on a sales team if you feel a little under that it can be a little bit tough
