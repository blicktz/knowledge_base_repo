all right you ready to do this yeah hold on I'm just uh I'm just executing a stock trade right now I'm I am the wolf of wall street right now Sam I we're live on this podcast but I'm not here I'm not here talking to you I'm in wall street right now I'm on the stock market floor shaking my money saying take my money because I'm buying a stock I don't think the wolf of wall street used Robin Hood but that's okay if you want here's here's what we're gonna do if you want to find out how to lose money like I do you should stick around all right so what is it you've been on a stock kick you're really on a stock kick which is just bad news for me I anytime I get on a stock kick bad things happen um I just don't realize it till three years later so let me just show you these two charts so take a look at this chart the first it's about this stock called Palo Alto Networks I don't think you're following too much of Palo Alto Networks am I right in assuming that I'm not following right now but I know like it's one of the Silicon Valley OGs it's been around for a long time and yeah yeah okay good that's pretty good all right so look at this first I know a bullshitter when I hear one and you don't know a shit about the stock I know I know whatever you can learn reading the Wikipedia I've read it the Wikipedia tell me this what do they sell what's the product no no no why are you looking at your screen look at me look me in the eyes and tell me what they sell networking and data solutions I believe so some type something like they used to be like one of the OGs that had servers didn't they dude here's the reality I don't know what they sell either it doesn't matter what they sell look at this chart for a second so this chart shows last five days damn down 14 15 basically that's pretty bad and actually it would be worse than that except for there's this little uptick so look at the second chart this is today up 10 you might ask yourself did they just have like an earnings call did they announce a new product did they announce a big AI breakthrough what is causing the stock in the first two hours of trading today to be up 10 percent the answer is our girl friend of the pod Nancy Pelosi just made a trade she just bought a million dollars of Palo Alto Networks of stock and immediately people start following her action and start buying this thing blind because they don't know what she knows but they know that she knows something and isn't that so funny that that's what's happening nowadays like I follow this account I don't know if you follow the Pelosi tracker and they were like it says breaking the Queen is back at it again she just bought a 1.25 million dollars of Palo Alto Network calls and then it says and then like there's a sub-endline Palo Alto Networks is one of the leading cybersecurity companies in the nation like in case you need to know but here's the reality you don't need to know you just need to know that Nancy Pelosi who has one of the greatest stock trading track records of our time just bought this and she are you actually buying this no I'm not buying the Palo Alto I was gonna say we just did this amazing whole thing on Buffett a couple episodes ago two months ago when uh Munger died we did a whole episode on that and I was gonna say you did a great job of remembering what he said which is like invest blindly in things you don't understand right yeah invest blindly off random Twitter anonymous accounts uh you know claims about you know 90 year old women's trades so so that's what I'm doing uh no I didn't buy this one but I did find it I was kind of curious I was like I saw this tweet and I was like I've seen her track record or like the data analysis of her track record it's like really really impressive I don't have it offhand here but it's like better than most hedge funds it's better than most like famous investors that you know of and so I was wondering are people just fast following her trades that's why I looked at what's happened today and this the you know the share price is up 27 bucks this morning because the the sort of the she had to disclose what she bought and so uh people were tracking that so I just find that I was curious does the stock actually move when Pelosi uh uh makes a trade and our girl moves wait all right she makes she makes waves in the market all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made it so I've got this company called Hampton you could check it out joinhampton.com it's a community for founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at joinhampton.com slash wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their landing page builder and it's super simple I'm not technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM I'm an idiot and I don't know anything about politics but but what I would say is if I'm like in charge what I would say to all these folks who are uh you know high up in the government is I would pay them a huge sum like two or three million dollars a year right because there's only like 500 how many how many people are I don't even know this is how uh how ignorant I am how many people are in the senate and congress I would pay them a ton of money and say there now you can't speak you can't consult and also all of your money has to be in this political ETF or whatever it's called so we know every trade you're doing and you can't actually buy individual stocks it's kind of ridiculous that she's able to do this right it's actually her husband her husband's able to do it it's their money but it is kind of crazy I think well she can't she's allowed to do it too it's not it's not only her husband's a PE guy I mean he's like this is his job I would imagine all right so let me just tell you this the last big trade that I saw from her was in I believe 2022 so July 2022 Nancy Pelosi um and her husband Paul who's a VC decided to buy 25 000 shares of Nvidia hmm they said what's the best stock in the world right now since 2020 what is almost the most valuable company in the world right now Nvidia oh that's right so they bought it at 165 bucks it's currently trading at 800 oh that's pretty good uh a little 4.8x for our girl Nancy that's that's pretty impressive good try when I first yeah great trade when I first moved to San Francisco I I told you the story how I lived in this warehouse it was like a dirt cheap warehouse it was horrible it was an awful place to live I lived with four other guys one of the guys worked there at Nvidia when I lived in this warehouse he worked at Nvidia I believe from 2009 to 2014. and I was doing the math if he had 150 000 of equity given to him over four years which seems reasonable uh that's 30 000 40 000 a year if he didn't sell his net worth would be something like 35 million dollars is that insane or what and he wasn't he wasn't an early employee he would have been employee I don't know how big they were at the time but it was thousands of people back then and that insane that someone could do that Nvidia has been insane uh so what was the S&P 500 gain last year last year last year the S&P 500 was up 24 in 2023 okay Nancy Pelosi was up 65 she just dripled the stock the S&P 500 performance with her trades you know as her side hustle well she's the whatever the speaker of the house whatever the hell she is um pretty crazy you know what else has grown a mere you know 25 in the last year what our YouTube subscriber base we are putting Pelosi to shame out here but we need your help we need your help we need you to go to YouTube we need you to type in my first million and we need you to subscribe because we put in so much work every week and people think it's free it's a common misconception they think it's free Sam tell tell them what it is look this podcast isn't free everything on YouTube is free except for this channel all we need in payment is just you to click subscribe it takes you literally 10 seconds but it means the world to us we pour our hearts in this it's all we're asking in exchange it's called the gentleman's agreement we're not there to actually see it you do it but we hope you do that's why it's the gentleman's agreement um what do you got what's the trade that you just did that you actually are excited about because you said when we started you said we've got you got a trade that you're doing as we speak what is it disclaimer not financial advice disclaimer I'm very bad at stock trading but I persist because I'm the little engine that could I'll never give up and so I noticed um I don't know if you noticed but over the weekend there was like a lot of negative sentiment around Google which is why because their AI product is uh like woke super woke yeah so basically they released Gemini which is their uh answer to chat GPT formerly known as bard which by the way there's a hilarious tweet that goes around every time Google releases a new product or rename something and people are like cool should I um I would love to check this out on um on meat formerly known as Google meat formerly known as Google Hangouts formerly known as Google Hangouts plus formerly known as Google Duo and they're like they'd show how many times Google renames its product so it renamed bard which was an awful name to Gemini better name um and it came out basically it was bard bard was their bard was their their you know the next great act of their company they like the thing about Google is it sound the word Google sounds like a noise which is fine I'm okay with that it sounds more like a noise than a name and they just took that a bit too far the bard yeah they're like what are we gonna call it and somebody burped on the call and they're like oh yeah we can go with that and the guy didn't know what to do so he just didn't say anything so um yeah basically if you went to bard and you were like hey um can you it started off when people were like hey you know can you um generate an image of spaghetti and it generated a great image of spaghetti they're like cool can you generate an image of a Viking and then it generated an image of a black Viking and people were like huh that's weird why is the Viking black hey can you generate an image of a white Viking and it was like gave you like a Mexican Viking you're like hold on can you give me an image of a white person and it was like nah I can't do that really it was basically either saying no or it was showing a picture of a black person it's like what ethnicity was George Washington they're like well it's highly debated you might be might be black and it was like you know they would just do or it'd be like uh who did more damage to society Elon Musk or Hitler and it's like it's hard to say who did more damage to society Elon Musk or Hitler Elon Musk tweeted these things about the stock price and Hitler committed genocide it is really a tough call and it's like it's so people were taking the stuff and running with it it's like the perfect it's the the way I think about it is there's two tribes and if you can if you can get one tribe riled up you're going to get that that storyline is going to get some legs but if you can get two tribes riled up then you got like a real story and so this was basically the anti-big company um anti-big tech tribe it's like yo babe wake up big big tech made a mistake and then there was the anti um anti-woke and the anti-anti-ai tribes all three tribes got together and basically had a fiesta around this and so people were sharing this like crazy and then people were like the CEO of Google needs to be fired um they were like you know Google is too bloated it's too bureaucratic it's too woke it's like it's got the woke virus it'll never recover blah blah blah uh you know Suhail the you know the guy who created Mixpanel awesome guy he's like Google has lost its way then I read my next tweet Elon Musk says the bureaucratic you know a Google exec called me and promised to change it but I told him I don't think the bureaucratic the bureaucratic blob inside Google will even let him make these changes it's hopeless basically is what what these guys are saying you go on the all-in podcast and they're like I can't believe this you know basically like our rights freedom of speech is at risk here it needs to tell the truth look at this crazy woke bias and everybody's anti-Google so I woke up today and I was like pretty sure Google still owns Gmail YouTube Google search Chrome Android Waymo okay I think I'll just go ahead and buy Google stock today because Google's on this dip right now on the negative PR and I think it's just that old quote of like the short term you know the stock market's a popularity contest and the long term it's a weighing machine and I just think that they have tremendous assets right like uh you know YouTube does YouTube alone which is not even Google's like a main product um does 32 billion a year in revenue which is more than Snapchat Pinterest Twitter Tik Tok all combined and that's just YouTube right and you take like Google Cloud which is like does you know 36 billion in revenue that's just like their cloud service not not Google search right not Android not the Play Store not not any of this stuff and so I just think they have too many assets and so I have no I don't really do much analysis aside from I was like I don't know it seems like everybody's overreacting to this because it's a really good social media storyline to be like Google's lost its way uh it's woke it it's gonna lose an AI blah blah blah maybe it's true I don't know to me seemed like a bit of an overreaction I don't think you're wrong um I think that you're right in this particular instance but I subscribe to the subreddit called money r slash money and it's basically people it's a big subreddit and it's people complaining mostly there's a lot of it not complaining but a lot of it is like I see all these posts of people in college who are like I'm now 20 grand in the hole because I was buying options on Robinhood and doing all this stuff on on these apps where they trade and in general I am so against individual trading even though I think you're right with Google it ain't going anywhere I we I buy ads on Google it freaking works so good uh but it's just I just will I refuse to go down this path it's such a slippery slope that I don't want to get addicted to it and I feel like I would and you've won a few times I know you've won a few times recently oh I'll tell you every time I win don't worry but but have you lost a bunch of course of course uh yeah you can't trade without having bad trades right like what what is the number one rule for having a few good trades is have many trades that's insane that you're doing this but you're not wrong with this I'm not doing it with a lot a lot of money and also um it's an excuse to learn for me too so I uh I don't know I think that I think a lot of learning just comes from trial and error and trying things when you build businesses is a really expensive slow way to it's like it's the it's the highest price way to learn right because it takes a long time takes a lot of effort takes a lot of focus but there are things where you're like all right well like you know very simple uh I wanted to learn about AI and so I pay this guy five hundred dollars an hour once a week to just teach me about AI yeah and I wanted to I wanted to be I wanted to be up to speed with what's going on what are the new tools what are the limitations what are some of the bottlenecks and so you know I in general I have a very uh a I want to have some fun in my life b I want to learn and for me the only way to learn is like uh Andrew Wilkins has said this once he's like I like to walk around with a fork finding sockets to put put my fork in basically it's like um you know the only way he learns is by getting electrocuted and I kind of feel I'm the same way uh you know I hear things and I hear wisdom but it never actually sinks in until I go and do something and maybe the real learning here by the way maybe the real learning is just don't pick it don't trade individual stocks you might actually be at the correct final answer um and so you know I'm not saying that you're wrong about that uh philosophically I agree with what you're saying but I just carve out a small fun budget that I use to do this I uh my partner Joe he trades individual stocks and this week or last week he was like I'm screwed I'm going back to indexing because he like looked at all the money that he I like did a calculator go show me what you had 15 years ago show me what you have today now let's I'm going to put it in this calculator I'm going to show you what you would have had if you would have done this and let's see and compare and the index fund funding uh index investing was so much higher and he's like yeah I'm going to switch and so he like makes the switch this week by the way I did the same calculation and it was 100 true for me too that if I had just bought the index and or just added a consistent amount to the index over time that would have been perfect but the funny thing is it's not uh the the thing in my analysis I was like okay I went through every single trade uh again how do you learn you go back and reflect so I went through every single trade and I said what is what story does this tell me and I had thought the story would be my prediction going in was um you would have made a little more money if you had done the index but you know whatever actually I would have made a lot more money just doing the index I was learning one number two learning was interesting which was I thought I would find you're not as smart as you think buddy like you know you buy this thing because you have all these reasons but you're wrong and in actuality I think I only lost money buying in a very small number of of of stocks I think it was like less than five stocks that I what I bought it for versus what it currently is um is less or even less than it would have been if I had just been in the in the mark uh in the index like it's pretty comparable returns um the two situations where I got it wrong were um number one when I during COVID I um bought some momentums like I just like bought zoom or something at some moment I had bought zoom like early and it was working so well and I just bought more that was stupid I should have done that but the second one was uh you know random tips from our friends you know friend says oh man I'm doing this they yeah they're a smart friend and so I bought so those are the only times that I bought and lost all of my actual losses of where I where I made less than I would have in the market was just selling early because I sold a bunch of things and I sold a bunch of things some some I sold early when they had a lot more room to run some I sold when I was uh you know the market sentiment was down or I was feeling fearful and I just wanted to move to cash and I would just sell and so I actually lost the all of my losses were in the sell not the buy which was surprising to me I've been making fun of Joe because he's going on all in on indexing and I'm like great you you picked a really good month all time highs record highs this is the best month ever decide to do it and now he's like second guessing it uh let me show you a company that launched uh I think this week or last week and I want to know what your opinion of it is so it's called Harbor so Harbor.co and I want to tell you what this company is and why it's interesting to me but I'm not sure if it's going to work or not but I want to hear your opinion of it do you remember Deep Sentinel we had uh Selly uh on the pod so Deep Sentinel I thought was going to be huge TBD verdict still out and it was basically I like these businesses where people are monitoring things so let me give you an example so Deep Sentinel their tagline is or I don't know if it's a tagline but the guy said it on the pod he goes ring is a great way to watch your shit get stolen uh which is how it typically works at ring like something like I've had a bike get stolen before and I'm like oh let me look at the ring yep there's the guy who did it it is in fact stole it uh and so Deep Sentinel is different because it's these cameras similar to ring but there's someone on the other end watching the cameras and they'll call the police and I've had like a drunk Airbnb-er think that my house was their Airbnb and he's like knocking on the door at 2 a.m and they called the police on him and like you know took care of it whatever uh there's this other thing called Harbor so Harbor.co it's basically that but for baby monitors and I shared the deck with you let me know what you think but basically have you ever heard of like sleep training so basically when you when your kid gets to be like three or four months old when they start crying sometimes you gotta let them cry it out a little bit in order to like you know figure out what's real and what's not real and eventually they quit whining and they go back to sleep they did this but for baby monitors so there's someone monitoring the baby monitor and I think they'll call you or like ping your the monitor that they give you to let you know all right now you actually should get up the baby's been crying for like nine or ten minutes it's time to get up you know baby's crying I fucking know well that's the end of the commercial this product this product makes no sense how big is your house that's why I want to hear your opinion on this because we had Jack Smith on the pod do you remember when we had him on the pod and he did the same thing where he set up like a ring camera for his baby monitor and then he hired someone in India to watch the monitor I think he used shepherd actually he hired someone to watch the monitor and to call a dedicated cell phone just to let him know when the baby's been crying for 10 minutes or something like that and these guys turn that into a product uh what do you think about this well I have a couple thoughts first is I love how Sam the new dad is like you ever heard about sleep training talking to me father of two it's like if I went and worked out and I was like bro you ever heard of bicep curls and you're like uh dude what welcome to the gym uh so yes I understand I'm familiar with the idea that babies cry and you know sleep can get a little hard for parents all right second thing this whole class of products is like what I call like it's supposed to be anxiety reduction but actually it's somewhat anxiety inducing so you know the idea would be hey you could sleep well knowing that somebody's monitoring your baby at night and there's a whole bunch of products like this like I don't know if you ever bought like the Owlet which is like this like ankle monitor uh for your baby or like there's like sock version of this there's like a there's like another one that's like measuring their like oxygen light at all times or whatever hey I know all about ankle monitors been there done that no I can tell you all about ankle sorry I'm guilty again preaching to the choir there yeah I didn't know you could put them on children but yeah I know a thing or two about ankle monitors exactly so um so those all exist and actually have done well I think Owlet did Owlet did pretty well I know they got in some some trouble but they I think they ended up going public what is it outlet is that is that's what it is it's the it's the that's the ankle monitor for babies but with the key thing being like it's measuring I think their oxygen levels so you know if the baby you know like casino SIDS is obviously uh you know the biggest like you know nightmare for a parent um would be if your baby you know suddenly in their sleep you know stops breathing and so the idea was with Owlet you would get notified if the oxygen um levels go down which is to me makes way more sense than the let me know if my baby's crying because I know if my baby's crying typically um you know through a traditional baby monitor or like you know my house is not that big or the baby sleeps in the crib in the same room like you know that's I guess I think this I think the outlet stuff makes a lot more sense than harbor so yeah I'm not like super into this idea and that's kind of where I say no offense to the people behind the harbor I'm sure they're great smart people the guy who started it started mizin and maine that clothing company remember the the clothing company that uh it's like golf people wear it it's like yeah not it's not popular among in our lives but it is very popular it's pretty successful right yeah it's huge it's like a hundred million plus it's like a big thing but he came out with this thing and I didn't I I invested a very very small sum a thousand dollars he's a friend of mine and I was like all right I'll just do a thousand dollars just to play that that's my version of you buying google is just doing small small investments but I saw this and I was like I don't know this might actually work we'll see what happens but I'm into these things that monitor things uh another one and this is this is a little bit of a shell this is actually totally a shell but do you remember my body tutor I told you all about my body tutor I use my body tutor happy to plug them for free I'm not a we don't get paid for this just a happy customer I get a little bit paid for it I'm a small stakeholder in this company I get a little bit paid for it because because here's what they do they you I use my fitness pal but you could use their app but I use my fitness pal and I upload like the calories that I've eaten and all the food that I've eaten and they basically call me every morning to like criticize me and be like why the hell did you eat this is this part of your plan or what's your plan today or what are you going to do this week and what type of protein you're going to eat what today what type of carbs you eat today and they actually like hold you accountable for what you're eating I'm actually am getting paid for this I am a stakeholder in this company I'm not getting paid directly but I do have a small stake in this company and so we did this thing called mybodytutor.com slash sam it's a little bit of a discount for our listeners because I do love this stuff has it worked with you uh yeah it's going great I love the product genuinely uh even though I'm not a not a uh you know not promoting there's no slash sean um but yeah happy customer my coach haley's awesome and uh you know it's a it's a good reminder so so most things in life I I always get surprised when the answer to most things if you if you trace back you're like all right how do I make this thing happen and you're like well you got to take a bunch of action it's cool non-negotiable right you got to take a bunch of action whatever the thing you want in life is you got to take a bunch of action okay well how do you get yourself to take a bunch of action well you got to have the you know maybe a strategy or you maybe have a motivation those are some of the elements that go into action okay where do you get the strategy and the motivation if you just keep going back down the chain the number one thing is simply awareness like a lot of things in life that aren't happening aren't happening because you haven't actually put your focus on it right the laser beam that's in your brain is pointed elsewhere and you haven't actually brought your awareness to to the situation at hand and you're not bringing your awareness to it regularly enough as a startup sam i'm sure you used to do the same thing i used to put like every day when i would come into the office i draw a giant zero on the whiteboard it's like that's how many paying customers i have and you know i was like i don't need a dashboard i will write this number here every day of how many paying customers i have and i would write zero every day because i had to look at that i had to bring my awareness to the fact that i currently have zero paying customers because otherwise it was very easy to get distracted by a whole bunch of random tasks but if i started with well my main goal is to hit you know this many paying customers and i currently have zero if i start my day without awareness then i'm likely to take actions that are in line with changing that number to be what i want in the same way you get a phone call in the morning that's like hey what's your plan for eating today and you're like i don't have a plan i'm just gonna eat whatever comes up in front of me right like you know whatever i see i'll eat like well that's not right so then you bring your awareness to okay that's right i do have this goal i am committed to making this happen i'm gonna make a plan and i'm gonna just decide up front i'm gonna bring my awareness to that early and often or when you take pictures or you log your meals you're bringing your awareness to what am i eating is this in line with what i've said i want to be eating or not right so i think awareness is actually like massively underrated both in diet but really any goal you have in life i think everything is downstream of first bringing a bunch of awareness to the thing yeah dude it's changed my life and that's why i've invested in some of these companies where they like monitor stuff for you and so you're either forced to focus on it or someone else is focusing on it for you um let me tell you one more thing have you heard of penske media no what is that you've never heard of that okay so most people haven't that's why i wanted to bring this up i've been i found this guy a few years ago and i've been following him and i spoke to someone who worked at the company and i didn't realize how big this company is so let me tell you this story so there's this guy named jay penske his father is roger penske roger penske do you remember in san francisco remember those yellow trucks they were yellow moving trucks and they used to say like penske yeah yeah so roger penske he was a race car driver he was like a professional race car driver and then he started a whole bunch of things including a moving company he also owns a uh a chain of auto parts store and so he's the self-made billionaire he's probably close to 90 at this point but he's like a big deal well he has this son named jay and google jay penske when i googled jay penske i wanted to hate this guy so much tell me what you see when you google him let me guess he's too handsome and too rich for you he's too handsome he's too rich i think his wife is a beauty pageant uh one or the other he's he's yeah he's got both of them if this guy has any handyman skills he's out of here for us dude if he can build anything with his bare hands too much get out of here i immediately googled like jay penske shirtless in order to like be like does he have that too which he does i think uh but i looked this guy up and i wanted to hate him and i did research on him and i completely love him i think he has it all so check this out so you've never heard of penske media but let me tell you all the things that they own so they own uh south by southwest they own the golden globes rolling stone the hollywood reporter now they own a large chunk maybe most of vox they own variety south by southwest and rolling stone this guy yes yes he owns the hollywood reporter billboard women's wear daily new york magazine eater uh the verge uh art news art form art in america the rob report have you been in the rob report yeah it's like this article says he is the rupert murdoch of entertainment yes exactly he's really under the radar not a lot of people talk about this guy but penske media i think it's called a uh pmc penske media corporation they're pretty under the radar they own enough publications that something like one in two americans go to their websites every month it's massive they get hundreds of millions of of monthly uniques and they're one of the few media companies that's large that is consistently profitable they've been killing it for years and years and years he's originally how did they get started how did he build this empire yeah so he originally started uh his first like getting into the digital business was when he was in his 20s he bought mail.com and he was like i'm going to create a new email service it didn't work out and so he eventually sold the domain mail.com to someone else and he made a little bit of money doing that and then he was like all right but i still want to get into digital i still want to get into media and so he started i believe it's actually hard to find the the origins of the story but he started something like an ad network and he starts an ad network in the 2000s and uh it's going okay and then they eventually start buying publications to put ads on and then slowly slowly slowly it starts they start gaining momentum and over the last 20 years i think it's the company's like 20 years old at this point they buy more and more publications and this guy is like he's got a chip on his shoulder because he's the son of a billionaire and allegedly that's what he says he says i've taken no money from my parents i started this with a very small sum my own money and i've just slowly rolled this into another thing and another thing and another thing and now it's this massive business and i think two or three years ago they raised 200 million dollars in order to further fund acquisitions but people aren't talking about this guy at all and i asked this guy who sold this company uh to penske and i'm like what is he so special at and he says uh here's a few quotes that people have said about him they go i think he has a chip on his shoulder wants to prove himself he was hustling uh back then not to be known as penske to prove himself not to the world but to his family and another guy said uh that he when he hires people at this point they have something like a thousand plus people he interviews every single person who they hire and when he buys a company he wants to interview every single person who works there and they say he's a steward of the brand and he truly cares there's this one story about i think it was uh what was it it was um a real estate publication owned by this woman that was notoriously rude to everyone she was like hard to uh work with she was kind of a diva and she was just rude constantly she was one of these hollywood real estate reporters and she kind of thought she was on top of the world and jay jay pence he comes in and he's like this good-looking privileged guy so immediately she thinks she's gonna hate him and he totally toned her down and won her over with kindness and like being polite and like having her back constantly and that's been a trend i've noticed with this guy is all these people say that he's just really kind he's really nice he's a really really savvy operator and he's super low-key and under the radar but this guy jay he's one of the biggest names in media and very few people are talking about him i love how he's like i want to make a name for myself he's like penske media group he's the same name also hilarious uh this is fascinating so he didn't take money from his dad that's interesting he took money from the saudis and he took money from that guy daniel loeb who's like that like the legendary uh trader yeah but but i think that was like 15 years into the business i think that they actually bootstrapped it for a long time i think they raised 200 million dollars at a billion dollar valuation how would he bootstrap it like what was the first what was the cash cow well the first cash cow was their ad network that they made so if you i used web archive and i went and looked at what their website used to look like and it was basically it reminded me of an ad network now this was like 15 years old i believe uh and so like a lot of the terminology was even different and like the type of stuff that they were doing isn't really relevant anymore but it was from like owning mail.com that he bought for cheap and he sold that for a profit and then it was like an ad network is what it was but they've they've run profitable for a really really long time so i think this super cool find i'd never heard of this guy um and i did not know that you know the same family owns penske the truck thing they own the indy 500 they owned like the indy car raceway and all that and then he bought all these brands like south by southwest and whatnot that's super interesting would you want to do this because this sounds really hard to do uh in fact there's a quote here from someone who's like he's the hardest working guy i know he's always on planes he's always on calls he never had he never stops it's been that way for 15 years this seems like like rolling up kind of like old school media properties seems like both one of the more dangerous things you could do because media is like i mean we just saw vice shut down the other day media is like not the most stable um industry it's not the most profitable industry either and owning a portfolio 15 things in general and operating them is you know like just a hard way to go a hard way to live no i would not want to do this uh i think that this is the worst way to one of the worst ways thousand employees yeah and not only do they have two thousand employees but it's two thousand like la based uh you know so they own or they operate so like do you know uh dick clark studios have you ever seen like the golden globes or yeah yeah uh remember like when the ball drops on uh on like nbc i forget even what network it's on and it says like this is brought to you by dick clark studios or whatever they own that and so having to host all those things no i would never in a million years want to do that but someone is doing it and they're actually doing it successfully so if you look at vox or how about buzzfeed buzzfeed has a horrible market cap and they they just sold complex media for less than i think they paid for it or um i mean what what other media company did you just mention um vice vice.com they just shut down no i think this is an awful way to do it however it can be done and this is the only guy who's proving that it can be done at that size and so the way that he's doing it is they're just being a really good operator and so he balances letting people do their thing but also he he is like pretty strict about operations so he expects a certain amount of profit things like that and he still owns 60 of the company and so would i want to do this absolutely not but do i still think it's cool yes he and if you by the way if you google his name i was trying to figure out mike where's chinks in this guy's armor like where's he screwing up uh the only thing that i could find was he got arrested for pissing outside when he was drunk on like nantucket or martha's vineyard uh and so that like that that was like the only time that i've noticed that that people really have disliked him in general he's gotcha yeah yeah see you're not perfect by the way i said that his uh wife was a like a miss america winner she's actually a victoria's secret model so he's doing great in many different aspects of his life but i i thought that this guy better to just pause after just like so he's doing all right let it all be just let let the air answer the question there he's doing all right but but he you know have you ever heard of cy newhouse do you know who cy newhouse is no but i have an idea for you real quick um i've noticed and many of the listeners have noticed that you love a good looking man i know you should create the forbes 30th i think you should create the par 30 studs under 30 and it's just great looking businessmen just dreamy hunks dude so many times so many times people in the comments they think i'm gay or they'll comment on how i comment i wonder why dude you're like i googled this guy shirtless for the record i'm not gay but i can appreciate when someone's really handsome so sue me so sue me i love art long walks on the beach and a nice body yeah who's it on dude it's pretty uh yeah a lot of people do think i'm gay because i remember we were talking about this one track athlete and i was like look at his calves you see those calves i'm sorry yeah i i can admire you know i can admire well your hand was like making a cupping motion while you were saying it so that was that's all right i'm fine with people thinking i'm gay that's okay uh i'll whatever um anyway interesting guy who's under the radar that's doing stuff that you use but you probably never knew who was behind it that's what i wanted to bring it up okay i like it all right um sam you brought some fire today the penske thing was awesome uh pelosi we're keeping an eye on her my stock pick i got my stock picking we're gonna check on that one in five years and see how i did um good episode that's
