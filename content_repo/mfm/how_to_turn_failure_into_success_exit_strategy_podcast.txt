Were there any failures from a marketing perspective that you had in the last 15 years that you can talk about? Yeah, I mean, I would say a couple of things to that. First, again, I was in advertising before, so I sort of always had this theory that unless we could really get the frequency, that it wasn't worth it.

So, you know, we never really went out and bought one billboard because I just thought like one billboard, it's just wasting money if we're just doing one thing. And so I think that we've always believed like, you know, buy a chunk in an area and do it right or just don't do it at all. And that's sort of been our theory too, that, you know, just not only from a marketing brand standpoint, but also from a distribution standpoint, we've also just believed like if we can't actually do well in a store or in a market, like we shouldn't be there.

Right. And I think it's the same sort of philosophy for like, don't be afraid to take your time, which is sort of like, you know, not what everybody would say. Like, I mean, we've had so many, you know, brands that have said, no, you've got to get across the U.S.

You've got to get into Kroger. You've got to get into Publix, like Costco, fast, fast, fast. And so many of those companies aren't here anymore because they just spent too fast.

Right. So if you don't have the money to go into those markets and really do it right, I mean, my best advice would be, you know, just do the markets that you can be really good at. Well, period.
