All right. So I got curious about something. I saw this.

So there's this guy named Mark Manson. Mark Manson has this book called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. Then he created a couple spin-offs from it.

So I'll tell you a quick funny story. So this book was the best-selling book of 2020, I believe, or 19. Either 19 or 20.

I forget the exact year. Or maybe even prior, before that, actually. But it sold many, many millions of copies of books.

I actually had dinner at a conference with Tucker, who we were just talking about. And Mark Manson sat next to me. And I was talking to him.

And I was like, so what do your parents think about your job? And he goes, well, they make fun of me and ask them if I'm going to get a real job. They don't really know what I do.

They just think I play on the computer all day and I play video games all day. They don't truly understand what I'm doing. But they understood it this year when they released a report for New York Times saying I sold more books than Hillary Clinton.

So that's when they understood what I do. And so that's a funny story about Mark. But I looked up, I was curious about something about him and I Googled it.

And the first article came out that he had a condo in New York City that he recently sold for $14 million. And I got curious about that because I think that book... I was like, books can't make that much money, can they?

And Atomic Habits this year sold... Or so far has sold around 5 million books in total. And this year, Atomic Habits was the best-selling book on Amazon in 2020 or 2021.

And I was curious about how much bookmakers... authors make. So I have a friend, I can't talk about his name, but he sold 30,000 copies of a book that was published on a major publisher.

And I want to explain to you how much money he made. By the way, and that 30,000, that's a ton. That's like in the top one percentile, you know, I think of a book.

This book is in bookstores and it's probably in the airport and things like that. So they were given... They didn't have a book before.

They were given a $250,000 advance, which is basically just like, here's $250,000, go spend a year and go write the book. Off that 30,000 in books, they have not made a cent in royalty or licensing fees. And he told me that when he was looking at the contract, he doesn't even entirely understand when he's going to get paid past that amount.

And he only gets paid pennies on the dollar for every $14 book sold. Right. And he said...

He goes, basically, I get paid... They spent a certain amount of money to help me make this book and they get paid once it surpasses that amount. But I can't even understand in the paperwork how much they spent, including everyone's salaries on doing this and publishing and things like that.

But I have made, he said, an additional $400,000 this year on selling other stuff, like courses and coaching and consulting, which wouldn't have happened because... Which happened because of the book. But basically, on 30,000 copies sold, he has not made a cent other than the $250.

And he told me that his editor wasn't that good, that he had to spend a little bit of money getting his own editor, and that their marketing people weren't that great. And I found it to be very interesting. And so I looked up Dan Blazerian.

Dan Blazerian, you know who he is, the Instagram guy. He self-published his book. And so Dan Blazerian's book, it costs $35.

And he has a Shopify store that sells it. You can't buy it on Amazon. And it works for Dan Blazerian because he just posted a link on Instagram and he goes viral.

But David Goggins did it as well. And so anyway, this whole publishing kind of thing got me interested because these people do not... I guess Mark Manson, he must have crushed it somehow.

But for someone who sells 30,000 books, they don't make shit off their books. And I found it to be incredibly fascinating. I guess if you're like Ryan Holiday, I heard that he does good.

But a lot of people, they just don't get paid. Well, I think it's two things. It's if you take an advance, and it's your first book, the economics can be super skewed against you.

If you have multiple hits like a Ryan Holiday, then by the time you negotiate your third book deal, you're going to have much better economics in the thing. Tim Ferriss probably made more off his last book than he did off the first book, which is the bestseller. And then the last thing is self-publishing, changing the game in a way.

So let's say a book sells for $13.99 or whatever, $14. I think it's going to be like probably $7, $8 of just the cost of the book plus shipping to get it to a customer. And so you're left with four or five bucks at the end to play with.

Now, whether that goes all in your pocket or your publisher's pocket, I think that depends on how you negotiate. But even if you just take four bucks per copy, you know, 5 million copies sold for Atomic Habits, you know, I would believe that he's grossed, you know, 20 million, 30 million in sales, or sorry, like gross profit off that. Now, I don't know what his deal was.

If he's I don't know if he self published or what? Well, 5 million books times $14 is 70,000, 70 million. So the revenue on that I would bet is in the 50 to 100 million range.

Yeah, that huge ballpark. But I don't know what a guy like him would make, but I bet you he could get paid like many thousands an hour to come and talk. I mean, I bet you even cost him $50,000 to show up at a at a boardroom in New York to give a discussion to get like, I just got paid $8,000 to do a zoom call for one hour.

Really to give a talk. And so that means that somebody who's the author of Atomic Habits is definitely commanding, you know, 2550 K per per. That's crazy.

And now maybe digital. That's crazy. So anyway, I thought I thought this was interesting.

And it's it shocked me writing a book because you're going through this. I know you're I know you're or you're thinking about going through. I don't know how far how far you are.

Yeah, I basically paid to write the book. And now I got to write the book this year. So that'll happen.

And so, yeah, I don't I would predict that you don't make money directly off of it. But I imagine there will be money made in some ways. Yeah, I think a book is a pretty horrible way to make money.

So I'm just doing it for fun.
