all right we're live sean i've got a little bit a few actually stories but it starts with a person i hung out without the other day you know ryan holiday right the author ryan holiday of course he came on the pod he's awesome i was hanging out with him the other day and he said something actually to me in person but he previously said this on the podcast that we i think he's been on twice he said something about how he actually made a funny comment he's like most most authors say they make more money through speaking than they do actually selling their books those people they just didn't sell a lot of books however uh ryan has sold a ton of books we know that for sure but he also mentioned to me that his other things like the daily stoic which is his daily newsletter so ryan holiday wrote a book on stoicism he's written six or seven now at this point but he has this other property it's a daily newsletter called the daily stoic where they sell coins and merch and advertisements he has told me that that has made more money for him than selling books like which is crazy because that's what he's known as as an author and so what i wanted to talk to you about today was i went down this huge rabbit hole where i found ways that authors are making money other than just like writing a book well you got you got to tell the coin thing because the coin thing is the perfect simple example of this i don't know what he confirmed exactly but explain the coin thing because i think it's the perfect simple example of an author making money not off their book but a lot of money in some other way ryan holiday's whole shtick is stoicism it's a philosophy that is fairly useful and it's just like how to deal with hardship in your daily life and for some reason he decided to come up with a coin and it's a coin that in latin it says like you're gonna die or like today's one of your last days alive or something like that like something like inspirational thing but it's in latin so i'm not exactly sure what it says and a coin's a great product to sell because it costs 25 bucks to sell it costs like a dollar to make it ships for whatever a stamp two stamps so however much that is 80 cents there's no returns there's no sizes it's just like the easiest thing ever to sell and on the podcast i don't remember if he said the exact number but i believe he said tens of thousands of coins which is millions and millions of dollars is that what he said he did he did say that and he also said that he works with some mint some mint in the united states and i guess it's it's one of the old famous coin mints and he i think he was like their biggest customer also like he's like they're minting more of his momentum warrior coin than they are anything else so what i want to do and that was surprising to me i had an inkling and then he kind of revealed that that is true where he made more money not from selling books but i had uh i went down this rabbit hole and what i want to do is i want to show you three people who are making significantly more money than you would think and they are doing it in ways other than just writing one book making whatever 10 of the revenue that they of which they sell all right so we're going to start with the first one sean do you know who james patterson is i do not know who james patterson is who is james patterson i did not think you would know who he was sandwiches maybe a former baseball player who are we talking about you you are very smart you're a very high iq smart person oh god here it comes the fact that you don't know some of the most basic things like of pop culture like it's it's beyond pop culture at this point this is these are things that you see all over bookstores whatever it shocks me that you don't know this is he the vampire in twilight yeah i mean who is this no okay your second guess was a lot further away from the first guess so listen to this so have you ever heard of this strap meyer syndicate you probably haven't right of course if you haven't heard james patterson you also probably haven't heard of nancy drew or the hardy boys have you heard of those things i know who those that they write murder mystery they write mystery novels right for kids or something yeah yeah yeah so they are the main characters in murder mystery novels so the way it starts is in the 1930s there was this thing called the shrapmeyer syndicate it was this one guy he came up with this company in the 30s where he was like hey not a lot of people are writing children's books i'm gonna go ahead and start publishing children children's books and then he was like you know what i need to write more books but i don't feel like dealing with the hassle of working with these artists authors who like are just a pain in the butt to deal with all i care about is making like kind of cookie cutter novels that children like so what he did was he goes i'm gonna actually just come up with these characters so nancy drew the hardy boys and he had a variety of other series and i'm gonna have these authors write these books but i'm just gonna say it's written by the same author every single time i'm not gonna give a person like their little bit of fame i'm gonna pay them a fair rate but it's and and they're gonna follow my rules and maybe eventually they'll become a famous author but for now they're just gonna follow my rules and that's what he did and there was at one point where like every kid in america could name nancy drew the hardy boys things like that stratmeyer syndicate what a name uh so wait sorry the syndicate is i think i missed something here the syndicate is the set of novels the syndicate was the name of his company he called it a syndicate which sounds like a drug like a drug syndicate it sounds like something illegal because usually said that was just the name of his company and it was a legitimate company this wasn't like anything shady although he did a bad job of naming it'd be like naming like your kids children's book like warm candy and vans or something like that like he did a very bad job of like naming his publishing company called the syndicate kind of weird gotcha but basically he came up with these rules where he was like all books need to be part of a series uh every chapter needs to end with a preview of what the next chapter is going to be the beginning of each book needs to give a summary of only one page what happened in the previous books and he just had this like outline of how to like make hits well fast forward uh 70 years there's this guy named james patterson at this point now he's 75 years old he started uh in advertising in new york for the j thompson advertising firm just some huge firm but on the side in his late 20s and early 30s he starts writing novels and they do okay like they're not like that big of hits um but he keeps at it and he's a workaholic and he keeps going and eventually at the age of 47 he retires from advertising and goes all in on publishing these novels so he's been doing it now at this point for about 20 years and he's finally starting to see success and the whole point of his novels is they're thrillers some people might say they're kind of like trash formulaic thrillers but the thing is is people love them and at this point he sold something like 500 million copies of his books and at one point he uh accounted for 16 or sorry 6 of all hardcover novels sold in america so the guy's a hit maker he sold he sells a ton of them but here's the craziest part since he started writing uh about 48 years ago he's published on average seven books a year and at this point even though he's 75 or 74 he's doing something like 30 books a year now how on earth does a guy do that that's like ridiculous right at this point uh to be doing that it's ridiculous to be doing that at a young age it's more ridiculous to be doing in the 70s well more than a book every two weeks it's ridiculous well here's how he does it he has co-authors and a little secret with james patterson even you know he's well loved in america he actually has only written about 20 percent like solely written 20 of the books that his name is is credited with as writing the way that he does it he has a team of uh of co-authors and so what he does is he pays these guys out of his own pocket he kind of comes up with a framework they flesh it out he reviews it almost like a movie script and he's like writes notes in the in the in the margins and he gives it back to him and they kind of flush it out and at this point he's done it so much that you'll see that there's james patterson with dolly parton i think there's a james patterson and then the co-author is bill clinton and then the other co-author who's like the person doing the actual work is listed below it but this has been so success successful that at this point he's made something like 800 million dollars what yes that's how rich this guy is he owns like three or four homes each of them are worth 40 million bucks he's donated something like 50 million according to his website to small bookstores but this has been a smashing success i'm shocked you've not heard of james patterson i think i have seen the name what's like his most famous book i don't even know the name of his books but he's almost like uh do you know tom clancy yes okay he's like tom clancy does tom clancy do the same thing or does he write all his own books no tom clancy uh would write them but jim patterson does not write as much but you know like jim patterson at this point is sort of like tom clancy where you're like oh it's a tom clancy novel and i don't even know what tom clancy i can't even name his novels but i know it means like it's like a spy novel right okay so um let me ask you a question did this guy start out writing all his books and then over the years was like how do i scale and he's like what if i got another author or from the beginning was he like did he have this plan from the beginning or did this come about organically trying to scale up so over the last 20 years that he's been killing it i don't i don't think one of his books i'm not sure exactly but most of his books have not themselves been best sellers however he has been a best-selling author if you add up all of his titles for many decades and he learned early on he was like well like i don't know if any individually are going to be a hit but i'll just make a shit ton of them and so we discovered early on to on his career he goes we're going to be about quantity and at this point he says that for the last 40 years he's worked something like uh 70 hours a week and he writes all day and when we talk about writing it means working with a team and things like that but he discovered early on he's like we're just gonna do quantity we're gonna pump these babies out and so at this point jim patterson he's a face he's a guy he's a real person but it's almost like a brand and he's like gets these authors to kind of come under his brand and he makes jokes but he'll say things like they should pay these like these referring to his co-authors they should pay me to be a co-author because i'm teaching them so much and they're giving their name out there and he actually gives them press so they're able to like list but it's almost uh it's almost like the way the music industry works of like have nikki nikki minaj coming on your song you have to pay nikki minaj you know what i mean i like that that's the first one you went to nikki minaj um all right so this is interesting uh what what do you like about this guy you like that he basically to me what i think i like is i feel like he broke the like precious rules of like like writing and book like being an author is this like high prestige usually it's a high prestige low volume labor of love uh you know that may you know almost never makes money and if it happens to make money you kind of got lucky with this one smash hit and uh you know the honor is in slaving away at this novel for four years and he's sounds like he broke all those rules he's not precious about it he's like cool let's write books people want to read let's make it formulaic uh let's make it so that i can hire people that are going to write these books um let's scale this baby up no individual we're hitting singles and doubles maybe we're not going for home runs necessarily because these will all add up and it sounds like the cool thing is that this guy almost like productized this type of book and treated more like a business person than he did a artist well in reality what he is is he's an he was he was the ceo of the thompson agency group so that's like a that's part of a huge corporation and he's basically an advertising executive turned author and he brings some of that pizzazz to being an author and it has worked really well so he's both a business person and an advertising person all right everyone a quick break to tell you about hubspot and this one's easy because i'm going to show you an example of how i'm doing this at my company when i say i i mean not my team i mean i'm the one who actually made it so i've got this company called hampton you can check it out joinhampton.com it's a community for founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and i went and made a landing page so you can check it out at joinhampton.com slash wealth you can actually see the landing page that i made and the hard part with this is with hampton we are appealing to a sort of a higher-end customer sort of like like a louis vuitton or ferrari so i needed the landing page to look a very particular way hubspot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their landing page builder and it's super simple i'm not technical and i'm the one who actually made it and once it's made i then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and i can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that i did this is where the revenue came from so it came from twitter it came from linkedin whatever it came from i can actually go and look at it and i can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this i highly suggest it look i'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of youtube and get started all right now back to mfm let me give you two more that i think are even more interesting have you seen these books lately written by this guy named jack carr it's kind of all the rage right now i've heard the name but i haven't read anything now all right so jack carr is a former navy seal he served in the navy seals from 1996 i think to 2016. and he started writing these books called uh the first one was called the terminal list it came out in 2018 and if you go to the terminal list on amazon you'll see it's it's one of the highest reviewed books i've ever seen given the quantity of reviews it has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of reviews and it's like a 4.5 i read one of them two weeks ago i think i even suggested that you read it but it's really great it's basically like the equivalent of a romance novel for a woman it's like james bond for the man it's like basically the story of a guy who goes through all these hardships where he's a he's an ex navy seal his family gets hurt he's gotta save them he's got to get revenge whatever all that like epic man ship however i started reading his book and i noticed something really interesting he names products and brands like crazy in his books and i'll give you an example so this is a a few excerpts or one excerpt from from one of the books where he talks about he reached inside and removed the nine millimeter smith and weston m39 from his chest better known in the seal teens as the mk22 hush puppy and then he goes on and saying he grabbed a box of his nine millimeter super vel subsonic ammunition that was sitting next to his yeti cooler he i swear to god he'll talk about things like for example he'll talk about like he sipped his athletic greens before he names brands like crazy like there was one point where he was talking about like they're like he needed the best most durable equipment so we started using a hill person fanny pack or something like that and i'm like i'd like dude can we care to get like my he's like he did he put on his headphones and turned on my first million his go-to on tuesdays and thursdays for all types of entrepreneurial inspiration and then dude he did he named stuff like crazy and the main character his name is james reese he's like a james bond type of guy where he does a lot of bad stuff but like you really like him and you kind of want to be like him and he just names all the products that he uses and it's crazy and so i was interested i'm like why is this guy naming all these products so i go to his website i google jack car brands i just google that he's got this whole website i think it's just jack car.com but if you google uh jack car brands uh what you'll see is he has jack car.com and he creates do you know like that website um uncrate or gear patrol he basically has created his own version of that where he has all these gift guides or he'll be like here's all the gear that james reese used in this book and he has these beautiful guides on his website and lo and behold if you highlight over a lot of them they're all affiliate links and in fact and in fact oftentimes on jack car.com he sells his own stuff and so one of the main parts in this first book that i read is he's got this fancy tomahawk which is basically like an axe and he uses this tomahawk to kill people and it's like a really high quality tomahawk well jack car.com sells that exact same tomahawk and i thought that this was brilliant because when reading these stories he's talking about the cars that he's in like the type of car that he's in is like a main part i'm like i want all this stuff because this character james reese is so cool all i have to do is go to jack car.com and i could buy all this stuff and it's amazing i love this strategy yeah this is brilliant i've never i never would have thought that product placement in books would work like product placement in movies does but that makes perfect sense this is his uh this is his feastables this is his prime tomahawk dude it's awesome and by the way i was just giving him a little not all of them are affiliate links but a lot of them are and if you go to like his amazon page he even has this cool feature on his amazon page where it lists all of the products in the books and those are affiliate is just like um you know for example a lot of people ask us a bunch of questions about like oh what do you use for this whatever and it's like sometimes writing the down is actually just it's valuable to them it's useful to me it saves me time uh and i know that a bunch of podcasters do this but it's it's like small income it's side income it's not their main thing do you think this guy's like he's got to be making more off of his books than he is off of this uh this amazon affiliate thing right i think he's making more off his books but my third example is i'm going to show someone who's making way more off this thing and i think there's a world where jack carr will make way more off that side thing than the original thing meaning when you think of a navy seal you think of like many things including like the cool types of gear they have and you like see what they're wearing you're like that's neat i would love to have that thing or you know it's like cosplaying to be a tough guy there's a here's right i mean like he says in his cardigan yeah as he walked around his home wearing birkenstocks yeah yeah yeah yeah does jc penny like sell like really good boxers or something i could talk about um the third one steve ranella have you heard of steve ranella um three for three no who's steve ranella okay this one is i would i would not think you would know who this guy is so he originally starts as a magazine article guy for outdoor magazine so he basically he's from michigan went to school montana he loves the outdoors he also loves writing and so he starts as a freelance journalist he works for outdoor magazine he works for like men's health these things where he he's able to like talk about the outdoors and they pay him a small amount of money whatever his first book that he writes is about foraging so which is basically just he wanted to create the the books sound silly but they're actually awesome he wanted to write about how he went and hunted and foraged his own thanksgiving dinner but like in doing that you find like the meaning of life and you see like the history of food whatever and outdoors it's awesome the second book that he did is called american buffalo and it's this amazing book about him hunting buffalo and how the buffalo are really important to american history whatever if you're not into that you're not into it which i don't think you are but for the people who are what gave it away yeah this is like yeah you know my body language right now is the body language of a girl who's about to get grinded on by a guy at the club unwantly no no no thanks foraging for my food no thanks i'm out of here would you like a free copy of my book it's signed no yeah you're you're not into this guy but you're going to be into what i'm about to explain so he writes this book american buffalo it gets pretty popular so then he creates this website called meat eater.com have you ever heard of meat eater i have heard of meat eater yes so meat eater starts as a series of podcasts they have a show on this thing called the outdoor the sports channel something like that and it starts working out well eventually churnin i think you know churnin they invest into it and at this point in 2023 meat eater is a website where steve ranella uh blogs about outdoors he publishes books his books under the meat eater name he has recipe books he has uh more podcasts whatever newsletters however they went and bought a bunch of brands they bought a duck call business they went and bought um a clothing line now in 2023 they announced that they did a hundred million in revenue from selling all of the products on meat eater.com of which his kind of claim to fame or at least where he gets a lot of the traffic from is his books and then his podcasts and things like that and so this is an example of a guy who i think has made significantly more or will make significantly more in terms of enterprise value from selling the product that he talks about in the books or selling the lifestyle this guy's super fascinating dude going from american buffalo a book about buffaloes in america or whatever to having 100 million dollars in revenue on your business is like that's not the american dream but it's it's something it's someone's dream somewhere it's it's an american's dream that is i can't believe that that happened that's insane churning is so smart by the way they took this one thesis of content to commerce so they were like hey anybody who's world classic content is not valued properly in the market because media is such a business that they're valued as a media business but if you can flip their business model from content to commerce then this thing is gonna this thing is gonna take off and it's gonna take off in the same way that our youtube subs are gonna take off when you go to youtube and you say to yourself god damn i'm learning a lot from sam today about meat eaters and about authors and about all these people and they're gonna go to youtube you're gonna go to my first million and you're gonna click subscribe because you love us so much thank you very much that's the plug that was a good pretty seamless right good job i think um if i had to make a prediction i think that meat eater will be worth many many many hundreds of millions maybe even a billion dollars in the next 10 years i believe it these these lifestyle brands once you get like there is no no niche too small with these lifestyle brands meat eater is actually pretty big compared to some of these lifestyle brands like the hodinkee the watch brand luxury watches only right or there's things for like you know how people when they get into biking they become like you know lamer they start dressing like spongebob yeah spandex and like clip-ons and they walk into a coffee shop after like a 90 000 mile ride that morning like those people are super valuable as an audience and they need content that's like so lame like that that it's the thing that they care about and so there's like an endless niche of these like really really hyper specific lifestyle content brands that i think can be built uh you just have to come from that space it sounds like this guy steve ranella uh you know came from that space which is pretty pretty cool you want to know the uh here's a curveball to the situation he lives in brooklyn for real he lives in brooklyn he lives in brooklyn yeah well he lives in brooklyn i was doing research on him and he's like from montana and he's like i know montana better than anywhere on anywhere uh anyone else in the country i knew enough to get the hell out of there yeah and now he lives in brooklyn which is what i thought was kind of weird um but anyway those are my three examples of strange ways or shocking ways that a bunch of these authors are making money i know that you are thinking about becoming an author does this change but i think you've paused it i'm not sure if you've paused it or well i think becoming an author uh to make money is just uh that's like saying you know i was hungry so i went to church it's like yeah just because they have some food there doesn't mean that's why you go and so like i don't think making money is the reason to write a book if you're gonna want if you want to make money and you're smart about marketing and all that there's a hundred times easier ways to make money did you just make up that analogy that was a really good uh that was a really good analogy i did my morning routine today so you know the brain is on um the brain is awake the thing that i've looked into is how much these authors make so there's like tiers to this so uh if it was 10 tiers the first five tiers you know of tier 10 through five is just all of them made no money actually maybe tears you know like uh 10 all the way to number three all made no money but a couple of interesting data points uh that are in our world so i think the top tier is like the jk rowling's of the world uh jk rowling james patterson which is like you actually are mainstream canon right you are you're a part of the meta like you you became the equivalent you know you're gonna get a netflix show type of thing so dude have you ever thought about by the way have you thought about jk rowling and how she invented an entire universe and made up rules to like a game or a language that people refer to now like the word muggle i actually just thought of that word at least twice a week you know people do the roman empire thing i don't give a about the roman empire but dude i do think of like diagonally i think about hogwarts i think about all these places right like i think about that twice a week uh how cool that is someone just made it up yeah it's weird to me that when i think about that i'm just like that's that's so odd no what percent of you is like might be real is there any part of me that's like well i i mean i am just a muggle how would i know the way that i think about it is it she is so good at inventing this thing that she couldn't possibly have invented it and she's just telling a true story like you know what i mean like it's just impossible to think that one brain like our brains are each six pounds but that came out of hers i don't understand how that happened dude i've been at an airport where it's like you have the smart cart thing and i'm walking between you know nine and ten and i don't run at it but like you know i'll take my finger and sort of drag it against the wall just in case there's a little little give in that in that wall you know i'll play i'll see um so there's that that tier right that's like god tier then there's the james clear you know atomic habits david goggins mark manson i think these guys have cleared like 30 to 50 million dollars off of a single book that's a lot i would say more like 20. so james clear i think uh i don't know how many he's sold now it's his thing is escalating by the way which is really interesting he tweeted this out recently and it was it was something like i'll try to find it but it was basically like he first year was like you know maybe like a hundred thousand and then the next year was like 200 000.

the third year was a million and then the fourth year was like four million and the fifth year was like 15 million and he's just gone up and up and up i think now he sold uh basically i don't know 20 million copies or something like that worldwide and so you know way really that 20 million yeah yeah his book is like a it's like a runaway train basically um so i i think i'm pretty sure his book has grossed like 150 to 200 million dollars probably 150 probably 150 million dollars worldwide it's my guess you know i might be off by 30 million in either direction but but i'm not off by by half you know um and he's just a guy in ohio i think like he's just a guy like i i knew him before theory i talked to him before the book and he was just like a blogger in ohio like it didn't seem particularly fancy and he doesn't talk to us in years i knew him before he stopped talking to me yeah so so i think that's like the next year david goggins book i think has done like 35 40 million dollars in sales and he did it through scribe so he kind of like owns more of that um tim ferris surprisingly didn't sell that many copies of four-hour workweek i thought four-hour workweek was like a to me it was like that was a huge book it obviously did super super well but i think it sold 2 million copies you know so 2 million versus 20 million right 10x more for atomic habits which is pretty crazy a fun one is eric jorgensen so you know eric jorgensen um he he was like a startup growth guy he lived in some i don't know where he lives he lives in like kansas city or something like that and eric jorgensen wrote the navalmanac which is basically he's like yeah naval's tweets are the what if i printed them out basically like what if i printed it out and stapled it together right obviously he did more than that but the core idea was he didn't write the book he didn't do he didn't study the vol's life and write a biography he didn't create a bunch of original wisdom he just took naval's existing wisdom that was super fragmented packaged up into a really easy to use book and then and he actually gives away like the ebook for free i think online um i'm pretty sure eric he's never told me this is this is my my guesswork based on some so back of the envelope stuff pretty sure eric has made like three to five million dollars off of the devalmanac himself no way i don't believe that that is so much money really 82 confident that that's a real number dude if you're even half right i would be he's definitely made more than a million dollars i think it's like three to five million dollars off the development act okay well that's insane does naval get anything naval got distribution i don't think he gives them all any money from it i don't know i'm gonna make you famous baby you're gonna be a superstar that's what i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna create the shauna shauna mac dude you said that way too naturally that was not the first time you said that is that what you told trunk that's insane i uh that that basically the concept is ridiculous right i mean it's good the concept is genius is what it is he he took somebody else's genius that was fragmented it was like why would i write nobody wants to read the eric jorgensen book but a lot of people want to write the naval book and naval is kind of open source with it he has he's said this many times like the best thing you could do is let other people reshare your ideas they're you know stealing your ideas but really they're propagating your ideas it's one of the highest compliments one of the best strategies you can have to get more distribution and so yeah i think he was happy that eric you know and it took him like a year he put a lot of effort into it not nearly as much effort as the guy who actually came up with the content uh 500 million in his life so i think he's done fine too right that's that's the whole idea no and eric by the way i think eric's now the ceo of scribe david the company that did david goggins book so yes and the company that i think you might be using uh yeah not yet but um okay so another crazy story so i've never heard of this book and i doubt you have either because are you a sci-fi reader not exactly only like the most famous ones so have you ever heard of this book called wool no uh talking to me about science fiction is like talking to you about bison you know what i mean ain't going very far that conversation's got a lot of dead ends yeah that's a hard yes and well basically here's the here's the idea i was looking at the uh at the charts and i saw all of the game of thrones books so it's like you know a song of ice and fire and it's basically george r martin george r martin george r martin there's five of his books and there was one book on top of it called wool and i was like i've never heard of this book what is this book so i went and researched it so the author this guy hugh howey which sounds like a fake name might be i don't know um his origin story is he's living in north carolina he's broke uh he was doing some odd jobs he was like oh there's a roofing gig yeah i'll go help you out you know i'm a technician sure i'll help you out and basically at some point he's unemployed and he's like you know what i'm gonna write a book his wife was kind of supporting the household he's like i'm gonna write a book and she's like okay honey great uh sure you don't want to get out there with the old resume and she's like no i'm gonna write a sci-fi book like it was like the idea was like something's like what if aliens had this flying car or whatever i don't know what it was some crazy idea this conversation could go way different it'd be like hey by the way like i know that you love having these action figures in the plastic still but can we make a little bit room for the baby oh you're gonna write a book i'm gonna go find another husband so yeah so he puts the book out he sells less than a thousand dollars of the book okay so first first try and it failed most people would obviously quit strike one he's like oh i'm just getting warmed up he's like that was that was good but i can do better and he still has no job he needs to kind of start you know paying for the bills a little bit so i love this part about the story he gets a job but he's like he's trying to find not the highest paying job he's trying to find a job that will make a minimum amount of money that he needs to live with the maximum amount of free hours so he ends up finding this job that he could do for about 25 30 hours a week it pays only 10 bucks an hour but he's like i'll take it because there's a lot of downtime where i'm just sitting there not doing anything i could be writing during that time and it's only 30 hours a week so i can spend all of my free time doing this and i also don't even want a good job that'll make it hard to quit later because i want to be an author and i'm not going to trap myself in a job that's like hard to leave then he changes his schedule he's like i'm going to wake up 2 a.m every day i'm going to write before my job i'm going to write during my lunch break i'm right after dinner it became a compulsion for him and in three weeks he writes this book wool three weeks so again just like james patterson wasn't precious about the whole idea of writing books this guy was like three weeks not three years and so he bangs he bangs out this book he puts it on amazon for 99 cents and he sells like a thousand copies he's like boom thousand bucks all right love it and he's like uh and the but like you know his small reader base it's kind of like yc they say you want like a small number of people you'd rather have a thousand people that love you than a hundred thousand people that just kind of like you so he had a thousand people that really loved the book and they were like dude we got to write a sequel so very next month before they get cold he writes a sequel by the way wool wool's 530 pages he did that in three weeks yeah so then he uh he writes a sequel a month later he uh or like you know two months later whatever it is and he sells 3 000 copies of that one he's like all right i gotta keep going so he writes two more and he sells 10 000 copies and finally he puts out the collection all five of the books that he's written in a very short period of time and the first month he sells 23 000 copies of the set and now he's selling it for six dollars instead of 99 cents he makes basically 140 grand that um in in gross revenue that month and he's self-publishing this whole thing so he's keeping 70 percent of it whereas a normal author is going to keep 10 maybe 15 of it and all of a sudden um you know the months roll by he's now sold 500 000 books uh before uh you know before anybody knows it which is a ton of books to sell that's like you know you're in the top top you know percent of a percent uh that are of authors at that stage and he's getting approached by publishers and they're like he's like okay what's the deal and they're like we'll give you you know 250 000 like i'm already making 250 000 they're like okay we'll give you more money he's like well i'm what why would i give you why would i take some money today for like now i give up all my upside and they're like well we can help you get distribution he's like i've sold 500 000 copies myself and they're like how the hell did you do that and he's like and so his strategy is like guerrilla tactics to get his book out there where he's like all right i need to influence the influencers so he sent basically like copies of the book to bloggers and reviewers at goodreads so not like influencers but book influencers so people who review books and goodreads like high-ranking good goodreads people so then he's like all right that's good next step he goes on reddit and he's got um he does an ama on reddit for 12 hours and so he's just like i'm just gonna like soak up all the reddit love for this day on on reddit all right does that then he starts encouraging fan fiction and fan art whereas most authors are pretty again precious about like it's my ip they try to like you know take down anybody who writes like variations of their book he's like no no go crazy i built the universe but you guys can fill up all the stories and he would basically incentivize people to design other alternative book covers for it so now their little audience would you know there are that artist audience would see them designing a book cover for this book called wool that was pretty cool he picks 30 of the diehard readers and he's like okay how do i get my diehards to help me and become like you know super evangelist and so he made them beta readers again everybody's so precious they keep everything under lock and key he took his super fans it was like you're going to be readers of the of the early editions of new books before they come out so he did a bunch of community building essentially like stuff that doesn't really scale that each one individually wasn't a game changer but if you add up that and the 20 other things that he did you could see how he like that's not what made it successful but he did start turning the crank at the beginning the crank is pretty hard to turn but eventually you know you you if you power through that first part of the crank it'll start to move on its own and that's basically what happened for this guy and so then someone comes up to him they're like look i don't think you should sell your book rights but i do think you should sell your film rights you haven't actually you're not going to make a film yourself so he sold his film rights and um and he kept his his uh book rights you know as an independent person for a while i think maybe he sold it now i'm not sure but he uh he also met george r martin once he went to a book signing for uh for george r martin and he's like hey george like um it's me you know hugh howie and the guy's like never heard of you he's like i'm the number six guy on the sci-fi list like you know it's your five books and i'm number six said george r martin he posted this thing that george r martin signed his book and said to number six keep trying and then a couple months later a couple months later he actually hit number one and so uh just a pretty cool story of like a self-published author that that really made it happen like entrepreneurial hustle story that's a great story do you use goodreads do you know anything about goodreads i've used goodreads yeah i bet the founders of goodreads uh and i was like yeah otis chandler yeah they're they're really cool people really nice people it's a cool product but but but it's old now it's been around for a long time but it's got a great mo i i can tell you a little bit about goodreads but this guy hugh holly he has so i'm i use goodreads religiously i'm i'm i'm i'm that's kind of like my it's where my library i keep everything this guy has 750 000 ratings which is huge and if you're in the hundreds of thousands of ratings and you have over a four-star review you're like the best of the best he has a 4.15 review uh out of five for almost a million reviews it's amazing yeah and it all started with a standalone short story basically it wasn't even like a full book it was like a short story that he published at the beginning of that first three weeks but again that's kind of what you want it's a prototype right he treated it like an entrepreneur would not like a author would he's like the blue collar version of sci-fi this guy's like the larry bird of sci-fi you know what i mean like french league indiana yeah dude how insane is it that larry bird was so amazing and would just literally drink beers like on the bus to the game and like people used to smoke cigarettes at halftime of those games like isn't that absolutely insane now like now lebron james sleeps in like a hyperbaric chamber but like the guy who was basically the lebron james of his time was literally just like downing bud lights after games and he was like so skinny and so pale had the worst haircut the shortest shorts the best the best mustache but he like kind of looked like a like a human version of like big bird and he just killed it and he's considered one of the top five yeah that guy's amazing he gives uh he gives the weirdos hope uh this story is amazing hugh holly um that's a good story um you want to do one or two more thing yeah uh michelle use shepherd it's great you need to hire somebody go check it out it's how i hire a bunch of people if you want to hire people like i do use shepherd how's that all right there that's no thrill in that show but i kept it short do you have one more thing oh well i guess we didn't talk about this uh this is kind of cool james clear just launched an app yesterday which i think was the stimulus for this whole thing that we didn't we didn't talk about andrew wilkinson he put out this tweet where he said uh we partnered with james clear tiny owns 40 james owns 60 we made this app i actually didn't look at the app it's a productivity app or a habit tracking app yeah it's one of those just something completely different it's just a social media app just a network photo sharing app just something like stupid game it's like you like they recreated like snake from nokia yeah that's so funny by the way okay so let's talk about a couple things here great idea to release a habits app uh you want an app to be habit forming literally that's like only successful apps are ones that you use habitually so creating a habits app is a good idea there's lots of there's habits apps but they're not made by james clear so i think this is like no no brainer idea he just created anything that was a habit like just like some supplement or drug like i'm gonna get you addicted we're gonna make this habit watch this we're gonna call it crack so i think genius idea by him maybe doubly genius idea by andrew to pull this off i think it's amazing what he's doing he's done this now with huberman so he launched uh the yerba mate drink with huberman which i think is also a genius idea i think what andrew's doing now is the new playbook of what chernin did remember i was saying like chernin's playbook with the content to commerce they did it with barstool they did it with eater they did it with like a bunch of these media media publications that was a really good model and it's played out over the last 10 years i think what andrew's doing now is going to play out over the next 10 years which is he's partnering with these experts and authorities and he's like look i already have metalab that can do the design the engineering uh i have i i own a portfolio of businesses i've you know made a billion dollars doing this whole thing so let me find a ceo we'll build the whole thing you just have to promote it and it's a perfect fit with what you do i think it's just like such a good model it's also really fun for him right because he's going to get to hang out and rub shoulders with people who he likes and respects he's got like a cool cocktail story of being like oh yeah we built the james clear app we did the huberman drink we did the whatever right um they've done a bunch of these these apps now so i just think it's an awesome win all around like i'm i'm really happy for him we should have andrew on to talk about it but my prediction is that this won't make nearly as much money as some of his other boring things that no one would ever talk about but it's cooler than all of the other ones like it's significantly cooler it won't make as much money but it's way cooler like to be able to like i think this thing's gonna make a lot of money why do you think this is not gonna make money well i just think that it's his other stuff just does so much better if i had to guess i think the like can do like hundreds of millions on meditation i'm pretty sure that you can get like 30 40 million of arr on a habit app i think maybe you can but andrew also owns all these boring agencies that are like the thousandth most popular agency and they also make many many tens of millions a year in profit no no if you add them all up they do but each individually does not right if you add them all up they do his agency if you add up what he's gonna do with huberman with james clear and the next five that he's gonna do like this those are gonna add up to be much bigger the huberman drink is a brilliant idea that is a absolutely brilliant idea the james clear app like he's getting the right type of things like you don't want necessarily the a-list celebrity because the a-list celebrity for every you know george clooney or ryan reynolds that you get that have a hit there's tons of others that they don't really care about promoting it they're too busy but it's not a fit they don't have like a direct relationship with their audience because they're actually on in hollywood they're not like have a direct channel through social media and so the people that he's finding are like this is meaningful for them it's a perfect fit with them they have a direct relation to their audience and they haven't like um they have like love from their audience it's not just like people who are fans of them as people have deep trust in them and i think that that is a i think he's picking the right influencers to do these just i i would bet that he's going to make hundreds of millions off of these plays if you if you add up the you know three to five that he's going to do in this category i would bet that that's a three to three uh like a 300 million dollar prize i guess we'll have to have him on and uh ask him about it i'm he he's like a spider man he's or like an octopus he has his tentacles like all over the place i see this i'm like how the did you weasel your way into that thing like he just like he knows everything like he not knows everything he knows everyone i don't know how he gets his fingers on all these things i'll be like checker like hey uh where's our email we're influencers andrew where you at well where's our offer he also plays dumb with me all the time i go like you're i i'd probably be like hey have you heard of this guy named huberman i've been loving his podcast and wilkinson will be like yeah i think it's a nice podcast i also enjoy it and then like weeks later like yeah we partnered with him and launched this company we're on this deal for 18 months yeah i'm like okay like he does that he does like kind of on a regular basis with me where i'll be like if you heard of this thing it's kind of neat and i'll be like yeah i agree that is neat he he is a super networker he is a absolutely like incredible networker i am i i am i admire his networking skills like he's like cool i like bill ackman now i'm friends with bill ackman and he's an investor in my company oh charlie munger's my hero years later i'm having dinner with charlie munger and he's offering me you know xyz it's like he is really able to when he puts his mind to it with who he wants to meet he is able to make that happen and um and i think he does it in a way that's mutually beneficial it's not like uh you know most people when they're like oh i want to meet this person it's like just begging for it you know time or attention in a way that's not additive to the other person i think he does it in a good way that's additive to the other person yeah he's he's fascinating in the way that he's able to but he also he also turns a weird networking opportunity into like real businesses like usually a lot more often than not when i meet people i'm like that was nice to meet you i'll see you never again uh this is awesome right high five that's like where my brain stops yeah what a guy yeah yeah like i'm literally like you know dumb and dumber when he's walking out of the 7-eleven he's like big gulps huh yeah all right that's later that's me at every networking event same that's exactly how i am where it starts and ends right there and it's just like a passing memory and yes andrew somehow like makes it into money and turns it into dollars i don't know how he does it but he's very good at it he told one story on the pod where he was like i wanted to meet dan gilbert i met dan gilbert and then they had this challenge with this like or he had a product i have a design agency so we just made him a website for free that was really nice because i used that as his currency to like you know hey i think you're awesome and we did this thing this is awesome right oh it's because my agency's awesome because i'm awesome he just uses it to sort of like open the door he'll put in the work basically and he'd be like oh whenever you're free i'll fly there and let's you know i'll meet you you know i'll make the effort to come to make this happen the takeaway is to have an agency to either have like an agency or like a sick house it's like oh you're in town come stay in my home and then right you know what i mean you have to have like some like awesome excuse should i do that anytime someone's trapped i'm like oh do you want to stay in my house and i just rent an airbnb they're just absolutely indebted to me well it's kind of a good tactic chris sacca said that he had this house in truckie and uh you know he would like lure which sounds weird more weird than it actually is right he would lure these like a white van in the house yeah come to my bed yeah i got aws credits come over and he would like get these guys to come up and to become friends with them and it was like they're they're like well i would love to hang out in truckie and just so happens you have a house and that's how we become friends with them but maybe having a great line about it he goes uh when i lived in san francisco i was just constantly getting like meeting requests or event invitations and it was like a good problem to have but still a problem he's like i was playing defense i was just reacting to whatever was going on he's like when i moved to truckie then i played offense i would figure out who who it is that i want to actually spend time with and then i would proactively plan and like set it up so that travis kalanik came for the weekend and stayed with him he's like we're not going to just get coffee we're going to hang out for a weekend and like for every 50 coffee meetings i do like one weekend is just so much more powerful than 50 coffee meetings and so he's like we hang out we spend time together they meet my family we chill in the hot tub we brainstorm in the morning then later that evening we a new idea comes and i'm just very helpful for these people that's how he did his uber investment he did the same thing with the founder of instagram that's how he did his instagram investment too was he invited kevin system to come stay at his place in truckie and he stayed there for whatever a few days a week or whatever it was and by the end of that like they were kind of bonded and i think that was chris saka did a lot of cool things and that's definitely one of them i don't know if a three bedroom place and the burbs is going to do the trick i think both of us are going to have to step it up can i interest you in walnut creek yeah we'll go to safeway we'll come back it's like the only appeal you like marble countertops i got i got marble countertops like like um all right is that it is that the pod that's the pod you
