um you know one great quote i saw was is it are you seeing unrest and protesting and looting where you live i'm seeing it because i'm just glued to twitter and me too you know i'm just scrolling and i can't believe my eyes and uh it is it is so sad there's so many different things going on at the same time and the shitty part about that to me is that um everybody pulls a different meaning away from it so like if your bias going in is um you know you know if you're racist in one way you're going to look at this and say oh man they're rooting and they're looting and rioting and this is awful what do those small business owners do why are they why are they getting their store smashed and then if you're somebody else and you're looking at this you're like dude people are sick of it they've hit their breaking point because this has been going on for so long police brutality and i totally understand what's going on and then other people are looking at it and they're sort of like hey what's like why are these other malicious groups kind of hijacking the movement and just inciting violence and you know antifa or some people believe you know russia china whoever it is who's dropping these pallets of bricks off trying to bait people into violence and you know some people just trying to make the world burn and so there's all these things mixed together and i think whoever you are you're going to select the evidence that supports your feeling and you're just going to get stronger you're just going to see more evidence towards your view and it's going to make people more divided my friend shared something and uh it was like four circles and it was like uh i'm pissed off about the racism in our country and black lives matter black lives matters has a point i'm pissed off that businesses are getting ruined this is not the right way to do it i'm pissed off at the police because i think most of them are good but a few bad uh cops ruined shit for everyone and then i forget the fourth one and then it was like at the center all the circles had a little bit of everything and like you can be here i was like that's how i feel i'm angry it's sad and so what was the fourth one what's the fourth circle i don't know what the fourth one was let's see uh it was really great though uh did you happen to see this go around i didn't see that but no that explains like exactly how i feel you know and how many people feel and um you know i think it's really crazy you know there's a whole bunch of things that you hear or you learn from these experiences where you're like oh you know that is a sort of a nugget of wisdom or and a bit of empathy that i didn't have before and so you know when you see people that are um you know one great quote i saw was when you have a thousand good cops and ten bad cops but the good cops don't police the bad cops then you have a thousand and ten bad cops and uh you know i i believe that and then that sort of applies to my life too like in what anytime i sort of stand by and do nothing while injustice is happening that makes me sort of complicit in my own way right and um you know i think about little minor examples of that in my own life and then you know it was george floyd's george george floyd's death was murder and the police should be held responsible i think most cops are good but police departments are corrupt and there are some bad cops looting businesses and destroying properties immoral and it hurts the cause i empathize and i agree with black live matter protester and believe in them and their right to be heard and then right in the middle was like i am here and this is sad right yeah it's really crazy and i know people don't listen to this podcast to hear like you know um talks about socioeconomic issues and racism and whatnot but um you know this i think affects everybody this is very different than anything that's happened in my lifetime where you have riots breaking out across the nation um all simultaneously and things really do feel like they've hit a breaking point for many reasons i think also the fact that people were pent up at home for the last three months um i don't think that helps necessarily because that's a sort of um a bunch of a bunch of uh you know just water boiling over you know at a certain point as well i agree i so i i agree i i don't even love discussing this stuff because i don't think about it a lot and i also tend i try to like talk about the positive but let me bring something up that i don't think i have bring up brought up and i want to hear your opinion so um i don't this doesn't matter and it doesn't change i don't think it should like validate or does not about validate anything i say so like my wife's black my family's black i'll have black children and this was the first time or half or partially black children this was the first time that i was at my house with sarah my wife and like she broke down she was like i don't i don't know how she's like i don't know where i fit in on this because she's like a successful black woman she's like i haven't had a lot of racist stuff happen to me or if any like i and and it was and she's like but i yeah it was it was it was just a total mindfuck because i'm like fuck what am i supposed to how am i supposed to i don't i didn't know what to feel i didn't i was like i don't i don't know what to do and it was incredibly exhausting do you you you're indian do you consider yourself white or not white or what definitely don't consider myself white uh and nor does anyone who sees me thinks i'm white but i don't know like how but i get i get what you mean in the sense of like in some ways like do you feel that you're uh privileged or or prejudiced against i think that's a different way of looking at it and like you know my sister so we i was born in tulsa oklahoma which is like you know not the most open-minded and racially friendly place and so my sister when she was in kindergarten uh you know students would would draw a picture of a pig and then write her name on it and cover the pig in mud and brown mud and then they would give it to the teacher and the teacher lacked my sister always remembers this like she was i don't know six years old and she vividly remembers the teacher sort of looking at this and laughing and saying no no put it away but like being you know involved in it and i never i don't understand that what what's the pig have to do is that because just like brown brown dirty in the mud you know that sort of thing and um and you know i remember you know when she went to my mom it was like why can't we be white type of thing where it's like you know asking questions as a kid just trying to understand why am i different what does that mean why do other people think we're worse than them that sort of thing i personally never experienced that because i luckily moved out of oklahoma when i was really young and went to different places where it was it was less so uh or just got lucky in sort of my experiences around who i was around um but i i guess i would say like you know when 9 11 happened you know it's not fun to be a brown guy in america right are you are you any religion are you muslim no i'm not religious but i would be hindu yeah i would be hindu but um you know just that's typically what most indian people are um but yeah you know i'm not religious but you know i do grow a beard pretty quick and so like yeah you know like when you go to the airport i don't think you think about how do i look today whereas i think about that because i'm like look i'm not trying to get hassled for no reason here so let me shave before i get on this flight or like you know i had friends who like are muslim who had like key their house keys take it away from them in tsa because it was like this is uh you know potentially a dangerous thing and they're like this is my apartment keys what are you talking about how does that make you feel so the fact that you have to shave are you angry or are you where do you what's that make you feel like uh i'm not angry about it you know i i sort of have this opinion that um uh my my personal philosophy if you're going to boil it down to any one thing is the only thing you have control over is your attitude towards the present moment and so um so that's empowering and disempowering right it's disempowering because it's like shit i can't control anything that's going on i can't control how other people feel how they're going to act i can't control the results i'm going to get in my life but it's empowering it's like the one thing i control is my attitude towards the moment so that sort of is a superpower because then no matter what the situation is no matter what the moment is i can decide what my attitude about it is going to be so for example when something shitty happens to me someone says something shitty or you know i you know get that extra sort of hey come into this room while i go through tsa clearance you know the meaning i put on that is of my choosing and if i put the meaning of it that you know i'm less than i'm being wronged um that doesn't help me it makes me feel like shit and so i just decide not to feel that way but i know that like on the grand scheme of things i get off pretty light it's very different than never feeling safe you know going for a jog in your neighborhood or something like that i think you know there's levels to it and i haven't experienced those levels where it would be very very challenging to put a positive meaning on what's going on yeah it's uh it's just a confusing time because you feel so many different emotions and some of them are uh opposite and i had to like talk to the whole company today which we're small let's say 20 or 30 people and i was like i don't know what to say other than if you guys like ever feel out of place somewhere like our company we're gonna we're gonna make you feel safe um like we'll hire all types of people we like i and i wasn't sure if that felt like weak or like um like oh like like barely anything to be done but i was like i don't know what i was like i don't know how to handle this other than you're safe here but uh yeah you know i think that's the right approach because it's not about having the answer or the wisdom or the most heartfelt thing and the best speech but like i think it is important if you're the leader to show up as a decent human being in that moment and just say look i understand i'm also feeling this crazy mix of emotions i just want to do my best with this anything you know we're gonna we're gonna try to do our best with this i think it goes a long way to just be a decent person and try to be present and visible there versus kind of shying away from it which is um what a lot of people do yeah it's crazy and uh i have a feeling once i have children my opinion is going to change a lot like or not my opinion but my i think i'll learn a lot um yeah like having black kids or part black kids i think well i'll so maybe i'll see something that i didn't previously see and one more thing which uh you know we can cut all this out if people tell us later hey you shouldn't have talked about this on the pod but did you watch the trevor noah um thing that he posted on youtube or whatever i did not i'm typically not a fan of his i think that a lot of the times the he says is the wrong take so i i tend to avoid him but i would watch it if you suggest it i i avoid him because he i don't think he's that funny but uh i did watch this thing and um you know he he brings up like what's going on he's like yeah a lot of people are looking at what's going on and saying well this isn't right either right of course police should not murder citizens that's wrong but also rioting and looting and destroying things is also not right and what his point was which i think made me better understand what was going on his point was like you got to think about this what is society you know society is essentially a contract it is an agreement amongst a group of people of here's what's right and wrong of how we're going to act here's the behaviors that are tolerated here's the behaviors that are not tolerated he goes so what you're seeing is that one side of contract you know if we're if we go into a contract together and you're just breaching your side of the contract regularly and without recourse and i just see wow this guy just keeps breaching his side of the contract then i also have no um no desire or incentive to uphold my side of the contract he goes you'll see somebody that's homeless and you know they don't go and just murder necessarily um because because they're in a bad position they say look these are the rules of the game i'm losing in the current game or i have not been able to sort of get to an advantage position in this game but like i still respect that we're in a game together and there are rules of this game he goes what you're seeing now is that a group of people you know black people in america feel like the contract has just been breached over and over and over again uh where they're you know unnecessary and um unjust violence against us and so now we're going to breach the contract too and we're going to sort of make it very known what it feels like when the contract is being breached for apparently no reason and it doesn't seem like a positive thing and so that made me look at you know when somebody is either protesting whether it's peacefully or not peacefully when somebody's rioting and they're creating a sort of unsafe environment for all it's sort of i don't know it's sort of uh explain to me why somebody would behave that way it's because if you feel like the other party's just terminally breached the contract and then there's no recourse then it's like i'm going to terminally breach the contract and and and we'll see we'll see how it feels and now both sides feel what it's like when the societal contract gets totally breached and let's definitely feel attention i feel it it i feel it definitely feels like uh like almost like the end of the world a little bit it's like there's it's like a small it's like in the same way having a new puppy it's just like a small taste of having a baby it's like that's how i feel right now like i'm like if like the world if like everything that i believed in is going to come to an end it's gonna like a little a little like this right um you know for every sad story there's also an inspiring story where people are you know waking up the next day and going and cleaning up the city and people standing together and you know i think there's a lot of really positive things going on too and i think that's the you know that's the silver lining or that's the other side of the coin here where where um is progress being made and
