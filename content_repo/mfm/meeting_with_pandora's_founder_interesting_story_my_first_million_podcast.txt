so if you want to hear a cool story about that the founder of pandora his name's tim westergen i went and met with him when i went and met with him we were we went out to lunch and he's like oh i forgot to do something like you can you walk with me and i walk with him and then we go he goes i gotta get a haircut and so i just sit next to him and this guy's worth probably 600 million dollars we go to super cuts right and he gets a haircut for 12 and we're sitting there in the barber shop it's on a tuesday at one no one's there and he's telling me the story i go what did you used to do how'd you grow pandora he goes here's what i would do monday through thursday he goes i had a coo who ran the company i would go i would just he goes this was i think it was a little bit before social media was around he said i would email people and i would say i'm gonna be at this library in new york at this time any pandora users in the area come and talk to me and he said he did that for four years and he goes here's the first one i did and he showed me a picture of him at a coffee shop he goes two people showed up and he goes here's the last one i did and he showed me a picture and it was at the library and there was two or three thousand people there he goes i would do that monday to thursday i did meetups everywhere all i did was travel and i did it for years and uh it worked out he goes he goes i was like did it work he goes every time i did it so like he goes it would take a little while but after a couple years of doing it i would go to the south or i go to atlanta and we would see more advertisers come so it was just like he goes it worked out perfectly right and because i said the same thing i go wow that's a horrible waste of time he goes no it worked we made a lot of money off of it and i got to connect with users and i would relay the feedback back to the right my ceo and they would do it yeah you so that case he's not trying to grow pandora's active user base he's taking fans and turning them into diehards and he's he's generating advertising revenue which you can get that actually scales enough to where you can get advertisers and he's getting feedback firsthand which is like great for the product to get better uh that's a dope story i love i love i love that story you
