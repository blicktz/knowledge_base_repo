He's also really good looking, so it's easy to admire him. I have a wall of people who I get inspired by. Yeah, so let me tell you who I have.

I have Steve Prefontaine. You know who that is? Never heard of him.

Who's that? There's a movie about him that's really great. You don't have to be a runner to like it, but he was a runner at Oregon.

He was the first person to wear Nike. So Bill Bowerman was the coach of Oregon Track and Field. His pupil, his athlete was Phil Knight.

Together, they partnered and made shoes together. Steve Prefontaine was probably the first person that wore them or one of, and he was definitely the first sponsored athlete. He was kind of a badass runner where he was kind of like a full clip.

So he would say shit like, to give anything less than your best is a sacrifice for gifts. He said all this inspirational stuff, but he died when he was 26, and he was just kind of a rebel without a cause. Then I have NWA.

Wait, hold on. How did he die? Specifically, he was drinking and driving and flipped over and crashed his car and suffocated.

Crazy. Okay. So very tragic, but he lived fast, died young.

And it was real tragic because he got fourth at the Olympics when he was a favorite, even though he was only 23. Anyway, it was a big deal. He's also really good looking, so it's easy to admire him.

Props to you for admitting that that's part of the appeal. All right, great. Yeah, he's like romantic, that type of thing.

You kind of look good. Then I have Easy E and Dr. Dre.

Okay. They're interesting to me because when Easy E was only 23, 24, 25, something like that, he created Ruthless Records, which went on to become a huge business, like hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. And he was just like a kid from Compton who knew nothing, didn't deserve to be there.

Or, you know, like on paper, like, what are you doing here? Anyway, they achieved it. And Dr.

Dre fucking changed culture in a variety of ways. Then I have Felix Dennis and Ted Turner. Ted Turner started CNN.

I like him. Felix Dennis, he started a media company. And he was like Richard Branson, but more vulgar.

Google him. And then I have, I've got three more. I've got Mike Tyson.

I love Mike Tyson. He's screwed up so many times in his life, but he's done a good job of being ferocious and kind of coming back. And then I've got Tupac.

And then I think that's it. That's amazing. Great.

Oh, Nate Diaz. Nate Diaz. Oh, amazing.

All right. So you have like. I love Nate Diaz.

You have like the intimidators row, dude. Like I'd say the majority of your people fight for a living or like should fight for a living. Not intimidators row, but I'm incredibly fascinated with people who are bold.

People who on paper should have done nothing. And they did a, they were really good at having bold ideas, but then also were having fun along the way. Right.

So that's what I like. Like Ted Turner, I think he had a, he was a southerner. He stuck out, but he had a bold idea and he laughed along the way.

So I'm always fascinated by that. Mar 진행h�도 tour Rosalyn07 válin, but you're wondering how you as I okay to win, as you'droads that are easy to win, like she had a happy place. Right.
