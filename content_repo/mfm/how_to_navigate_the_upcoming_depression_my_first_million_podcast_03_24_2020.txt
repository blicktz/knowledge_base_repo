what up nothing it's been a crazy few days i got my car broken into last night oh no front uh was there something in it or you just just go break in i i have a garage i didn't park in my garage and the back window was broken into and someone stole my little 200 like battery that jump jump starts the car but it was like a thousand dollars or no it was four hundred dollars to fix it just sucks um i'm also pretty sure i have corona oh no you're feeling it yeah adam mike adam ryan my co-worker he confirmed has it uh he lives in austin though but i'm pretty sure i have it were you in contact with him or you just think you have it in general i just think i have it oh no i was going to the office up until thursday but i thought that that was okay because i was the only one in the office right and i didn't and i like i didn't like see yeah alan was only there one of the days and i didn't see or talk to anyone even like i would i drove in i parked on the street and i just walked right up but i feel like shit but not that bad not bad enough that i can't do stuff but i you know that's a bummer what's going on with you um well on the bright side for you you got to talk to your hero yeah so the other day um for the listeners me and sean are extra ufc nerds one of my favorite guys is he your favorite you like i like him but he's not my favorite guy i feel like you i feel connected to him yeah so basically his name is ben askram he's interesting because he's very polarizing i would say he has more people who hate him than loves him but the people who love him love him and the people who hate him hate him um so on last week i gave a lecture on cold emailing and literally the day before i just cold tweeted at him and then we became friends in the inbox and then we just did like a conference call and we've been chatting and that was awesome and what was your cold tweet at him he tweeted out a podcast that he liked and i tweeted oh hey i was actually on that same podcast like two months ago and uh and then i dm'd him the episode i go hey i was just on that um i see you're doing x y and z i do this this and this i just like you but like if you ever want to like shoot the shit let me know that's amazing and then you you had a call with him he's a cool guy uh you guys are gonna hang out and be best friends or what i i pray i i'm trying to convince ben okay so ben askrin is he's kind of like this he's kind of like i think that the people who like him are like the jordan peterson crowd like the people who never had good fathers and want to learn how to be men you know what i mean yeah like discipline even though he's kind of a loud mouth and i'm like dude bed you have to like you could like you can like copy all like you could like the same way dave asbury has built this huge thing you could do that too by selling workout stuff and i'm trying to convince him to do that yeah he has a very big brand um and he's a very he has a very unique personality so you i could see that working for him yeah and i'm trying to convince him to do that he's based in wisconsin so i don't know like if he has like a whole bunch of like internet nerds hanging out with him that he truly understands what he's capable of and i'm trying to be his nerdy friend that's good and fighters don't have a very long shelf life like he's retired now so um you know they have to figure out the second second act well he told me he has a wrestling academy and that they're not in session right now so he's like i got i got a lot of free time and so i asked him if you wanted to come on here and he said yeah so if you want him to come on in the next couple of days or weeks we totally can do it yeah we should do a brainstorm with ben on what ben can do like what would i do if i was ben i think it'd be cool to brainstorm those ideas i'm gonna write that down i'll email him right after this cool and we'll we'll research a bunch of things that other either athletes or celebrities have done to leverage their name their brand kind of like what we were talking about with lance armstrong yeah the same conversation we had with lance we should do a full app with ben on that i'll i'll set that up um you want to talk about some new stuff that's going around sure okay so first thing um teachable you see teachable sold i did see that okay so teachable is udemy i hate comparing things because i don't want to be disrespectful to teachable but teachable is like udemy it's like udemy with one core difference so udemy is like you go to udemy to find what you want to learn teachable is hey i can make you know you can make your website coldemailing.com and you can sell your course on your brand on your site and they make it easy you don't have to know how to code to basically spin up an online class on your own website yeah and you and i are friends i think you are too right i don't know the guy but i'm really familiar with the thing and people know my education nerd so i'm like i kind of was very fascinated about their business and uh they did a pretty phenomenal job they were at like 20 million or so in revenue i think they sold for closer to 200 250 million something i talked to encore that's the guy who founded it and he said that it was very lucrative and it was a it was a good it worked out quite well yeah so i'm i'm super i'm proud of that i know their last round was at 250 million so i don't know if it sold at the same price it was just recently so i don't know if it sold at that price or above that even that'd be kind of amazing i don't know all i know is that it sounds it was a good deal for him and uh he is he's an he's an immigrant from india came here at age 18 so love love the story and i believe they have several teachers who use teachable and make over like a million dollars a year or something like that i think they have some some real success stories maybe not so he told me it might not be a million i don't know exactly no for no there there there are seven figure annual earners yeah they're mostly like affiliate marketer types i think but but whatever uh let's not let's not worry it's like when you say teachers people think like an english teacher and it's actually like you know so well he told me he told me the big one of the top earners was a guy who has an excel class yeah i've seen that um and you can actually google i've done this many times you can google uh you know uh high most profiting or sort of most uh highest revenue teachable classes and you can find the list um i think they even have it on their website the most popular classes there's like a social media marketing there's an excel how to do excel class there's a coding one there's a bunch of those did you do a podcast by i don't listen to any of our podcasts by the way because you don't ever listen to your own stuff um did you don't even listen to my voicemail yeah that's hilarious let alone you talking for a long time did you launch your your individual episode so i have two episodes i did one on thursday i didn't launch it i thought it sucked and then the uh our editor i think has coronavirus as well so he's been like in and out of the hospital and uh he has like an underlying lung condition so he's like trying to make sure he he doesn't know that you know get get in a bad spot um so he didn't publish it and i was like i you know i got cold feet i got to either ship it right away or i'll overthink it that's how i think you should do it and so so he listened to me he's like what are you talking about this is good and so we're going to ship that i have two banked um and then i also at the end of the last one i i um i had this idea during the podcast to do a um like morning routine thing so like you're in your house right now right you're in your kitchen and we're all at home and everyone's getting a little crazy and trying to figure out like oh i'm gonna work out by like opening and closing the fridge 50 times like people are trying to find a way to feel good and not go insane and i've had this morning routine i've done for years now that's a nine minute morning routine and um so on the podcast i was like i should just make a podcast it's just that this just the nine minute morning routine you can listen to it it's just free just put it out there so i recorded that last night so i had two episodes in the bank plus the morning routine um like uh thing recorded and so hopefully all those will come out this week are you working out yeah i'm working out yeah so we have we've had a home gym or like a room that we turned into a gym and now i'm using the shit out of it i have a home gym in my garage like a nice one like i've got like it's like a 400 pounds for uh squat like a squat rack heavy bag i have all types of shit and i talked to a guy the other day who was a listener or something like that he messaged me on twitter and he said that their home fitness equipment is selling like crazy he's like we can't keep up hot cakes um i ordered a thousand pounds worth of weights on amazon last year with free shipping yeah the delivery on weights is insane i felt so guilty because the guy bringing it up to my house like up the 15 steps is like you know breaking his back for this thing i'm never going to use and so i bought those bowflex dumbbells which is like it's one dumbbell that's what i have power blocks you rotate it and it like can be any weight you want those are actually pretty handy yeah i know i have those those are my favorite um do you want to talk about airbnb so next week we could do the trend stuff we wanted to talk about trend stuff but i and i it was a good one but i think we have a lot here do you want to talk about airbnb now we have a lot so we're going to do two things we're going to talk a little bit about airbnb and then we're going to start this thing that we we teased last week which is y combinator had their demo day and it's like a gold mine of new ideas and it's sort of you know yc is harvard and so we're going to take a look at this batch of companies and we're going to break them down we're going to do like five or six of them today and if it's fun we might do the rest i mean the list is like a hundred plus so i don't know how long we can do this but let's do like five today and let's see what happens so we'll do both those things in this episode did you want to do let's talk airbnb first yeah do it so airbnb some interesting things are going on so airbnb you know very well um is a awesome company one of the sort of most successful startups of the last decade or so and was about to go public this year and was preparing for it and um now with coronavirus you know travel has stopped hospitality you know hotels casinos they're all taking a total beating and airbnb of course is going to get caught up in the the crossfire as well and so a couple interesting things here so airbnb financially you know their revenue must have dropped by 50 60 70 80 percent essentially overnight and with an indefinite time span we don't know how long this is going to last the second thing is airbnb um not only does it have a huge you know staff on payroll and now revenue drops but um all the hosts were essentially small small small entrepreneurs so some people did you know a traditional thing they just rented out an extra bedroom in their house but a lot of people once they got a taste of that money they started buying places renting out places and subleasing and basically putting it on airbnb and so all those people now there's this thing that was a money maker for a couple years has gone to zero and so i think there's something very interesting that's going to happen where what happens to all these hosts who got places just to airbnb them and now the airbnb income has sort of totally dried up are they going to default on their mortgages are they going to default on their rent payments if they're if they're subleasing or um are they going to turn into just normal rentals like i don't know what's going to happen but what do you think about all this so you already know what's going on in zillow you're the one who told me right well i did see some charts yeah so i saw some charts that basically showed on zillow um normal housing so just normal rentals not a short-term airbnb stay but uh just here's an apartment for lease for six months is exploding so like it looks like the coronavirus is like here's last month one little blue dot this month 15 blue dots on the map right it's like uh the number of listings is exploding for rentals which is also bad for airbnb because in places like san francisco where there's a housing shortage and for years airbnb has been saying oh we don't contribute to the housing shortage we are we're a different thing altogether well now it's actually kind of a whether it's whether it's truly the the proof or not i don't know but it certainly does look like if you're somebody who was anti-airbnb you have a lot of evidence a lot of ammunition now to say hey look when we turned airbnb off look at how much more housing supply came on the market look how that lowers rents for everybody here well you know what airbnb is doing now though is long-term rentals um they've been getting into that for a while where you could rent something for many months maybe many years right and that part is growing still or it's growing a lot right now right and so so i'm curious whether people in cities who are anti-airbnb are going to take this and run with it and yes the answer is yes very sensitive to legislation right they changed some rules here in san francisco where it's like you can only do 90 days out of the year and you have to live in the place you have to prove that blah blah and that you know it eliminated like 30 or 40 percent of the listings overnight when that legislation happened a year or two ago and now i wonder if it's going to get worse sonder you know sonder i'm googling them right now you know them no oh that's the like um it's the the hotel or explain sonder it's basically if you are traveling for work and you want to go stay somewhere you'll stay at a sonder often um let's see i'll go to sonder.com it's also if you want to stay somewhere for like three months like let's say you're going somewhere for three months and you want to and you have to make a lot of money in order to do this it's high-end shit like in san francisco it's like five or six grand a month right need a place to stay or work we know it's time uh here the best yeah the best parts of home and hotel so it's like a it's like a an apartment that you can rent for two months right so the corporate housing but done well yes but they just laid off 20 of their company it looks like oh wow yeah today yeah frankie muse um so i think this is going to be very interesting how these different companies get affected you know i'm rooting for airbnb i think it's a great product i think it's a great company i hope that they have you know a war chest of cash that lets them endure this time but um you know we'll we'll see it's uh i'm keeping an eye on this if you could invest a little bit of what you can you can go and buy secondary shares if you're going to invest money at airbnb's previous valuation i think they raised money on a 30 billion dollar valuation would you invest in that right now well i'd need to know more right i need to know about the how the company's financials look and let's say that revenue drops people let's say revenue dropped 70 percent for this i'm not so concerned about the 70 percent drop because that's that i think is is more temporary so i just need to know do they have enough cash in the bank to endure this or i think they have three billion dollars okay so three billion dollars you know they're probably burning several million a month but like okay three billion should still last you um through this time and then the other question is were the fundamentals good to begin with so a lot of times these companies don't have great unit economics or fundamentals to begin with and so when the downturn comes and people start looking for things that are more stable more sure bets these uh high growth but poor unit economic companies they struggle they were profitable in 2018 ah dude i love this this is like an analyst call and uh i think they're also profitable in 2019 um this is all public information right so yeah so if they're if they're profitable right now even with this explosive growth and yeah it's probably a pretty good bet um to pick up a little secondary there okay um i guess we'll see what happens do you want to talk about some y combinator stuff yeah so um so we're going to go through a couple of the companies in the batch um you know there these are uh well we won't say anything that's too um what i'll call too private information so we'll do what's mostly public information about these companies so we'll start with the first one wait sean before we get into that dude can you can i tell you something that was striking about this list how many lists were there 150 yeah uh shockingly uh africa african and indian based yes this has been a trend in the last year or two for y combinator uh they did two things they went and did a road show so michael siebel who was the ceo of yc for a while um actually he might still be so he went on a road show through africa through india and met a bunch of entrepreneurs they had a bunch of events and they sort of opened up the doors to those applicants and really got people excited about coming to yc and their bet was that hey look a lot of the growth opportunity and the best companies are um you know we can go fish in this pond where not everybody else is fishing and um you know certainly 500 startups did this many many years ago where they just they invest in companies all around the world this has not been the the the sort of way that most silicon valley investors have been operating they're not actively going and hunting for great companies in india or brazil or in africa but yeah it's pretty amazing about how like there's i see a lot of latin america a ton of india and a ton of africa and what's funny is a lot of them are just you know flexport for brazil it's like this other successful yc company or it's like same one says once tagline is smile direct club for latin america right yeah that's literally it um yeah flexport for india uh or sorry flexport for africa yeah it's pretty crazy and i think that's a great move yeah for sure because a lot of these companies that that work when they're not purely software based they're going to scale slowly they're not going to expand everywhere overnight so same thing happened to airbnb airbnb got cloned in europe and in all different parts of the world sometimes they they were able to catch up and beat them most of the time they weren't and they had to buy a piece of them or acquire them or they just lost and they said okay i guess we're not going to be the number one player in the uk we're going to be two or three or and it works yeah and so you want it you want it smart you want to start it off yeah so let's do cron so cron is an app uh the website just cron.app cron.app and what these guys are trying to do is essentially superhuman for your calendar so that assumes you know what superhuman is which is this really slick and very hyped uh email client i used it for a while i stopped i don't know about you do you have you used superhuman um i'm still using it verdict's still out if i love it but their tagline for people who don't know superhuman is the calendar for professionals right so their thesis is look the market for calendar users for just if you just take google calendar is 500 million people and what they're trying to do is take the top you know set of prosumers right so professionals people who really care about efficiency people who are heavy power users of the calendar app and they're trying to say can we get the top x percent they said top 20 but really it's going to end up being the top two percent of people to pay 19 a month to have you know their google calendar on steroids what's one percent of what's one percent of 500 million that 50 million wait no that's five million uh yeah that's five million okay so five million people paying 19 bucks a month not bad um so so they're trying to go after that they basically made a very slick looking calendar so it's got all you know aesthetically it looks better they have hot keys and little short commands and oh you want to set up a meeting and it's hard to sort of say oh i'm free tuesday from one to two and thursday from three to four it's like you just share your availability and make it make it really easy so they have a bunch of these features and they have a thousand users on the wait list who are um sort of ready to pay and they're they've onboarded the first 50 paying customers so far so they're they're doing that thing that yc companies do you'll see this a lot is um big idea and then good traction but over a very short amount of time so you can't really judge if this is successful or not yet and it says like 50 percent month over over month growth but it's like six weeks but it's been six weeks and and 100 of those companies were other 100 of the customers were other companies in the yc batch right so it's like you know it's hard to really get a sense of these things but um i thought that's pretty interesting idea what do you what do you think about this okay so if i was this guy i would bet my life that this could be a company that makes a shit ton of profit so there's the nearest competitor that i can think of is calendly calendly is a plug-in for gmail it's a 30 million a year company that's bootstrapped out of atlanta started by a guy who moved here from i think nigeria cool story um andrew wilkinson a guy i respect and like thinks that calendly is or i think he thinks it's total bullshit and that google could totally clone it i disagree with um i disagree with that assessment i think that crone can for sure be a very very profitable software company um i'm not convinced that it that they should raise venture capital um because i yeah i wouldn't raise venture capital if them i was them if they needed money and just to start i would say raise a million dollars and just make this make like stupid make it stupidly profitable right yeah i don't think that's the route they're going because they're nyc but yeah i hear that i think that's a valid path i don't think they're going to need a ton of capital there's not a big um they don't need a huge engineering force they don't have to buy a bunch of assets you know this is a software play that really a motivated team of six to ten people could could knock out the park if i was listening to this podcast i would say and i was technical i would be like oh that is a great idea their their website if you go there right now it kind of shows how the product works and i would just completely rip it off right and scale but be far more scrappy because i don't think these companies out here are scrappy and i think that someone could build it and be able to pay themselves five million dollars a year in net income yeah you know the so i think this is a good idea i also like this general genre of company so uh our friend sully tipped me off to this a while ago he goes i just think superhuman for x is a good investment thesis right now and so he loves superhuman he loves the business it's doing really well and um you know we were looking at this company called linear which is a um it's like a bug tracking software so every big software company tracks their bugs usually using jira or some like old school ticketing system nobody loves using jira it's just like uh you know you it's a must uh you have to be organized around your bugs and uh linear just made like a slick looking jira and um and so we you know we talked to them thought about investing in them did you and i didn't end up it was like a it was a bit of a competitive round and then i could have got in at the end but i sort of uh cooled on it because when i tried to bring it into our company there was a lot of um security concerns um not that they were doing something wrong but you just have to do a lot of work to be enterprise security compliant and pass those checks and they hadn't done that work yet now in reality they're going to do that work it's going to be fine and they're going to get there um it's just it got out of sight out of mind for me because i stopped using them and i forgot about the email thread and you're making investments right now uh no now i'm on startup investments i have uh cooled off uh for for the time being there's a freeze so okay so verdict on crone how do you say it cron cron verdict for me is great company to own i think it will work i don't know if it's good to raise money on yeah agreed thanks to good idea good product i think there's other products like this if you just take a superhuman for x and you take any work tool that's massively used and you just make a extremely slick ui ux um for for that this can work with to-do lists this can work with email this can work with calendar this can work well you know how i would do that is i would log into gmail i'm going to log into gmail right now i would log into gmail i would click that little uh the drop down arrow the drop down no the google apps thing on the top right right i would look at search gmail calendar docs drive sheets slides sites groups contacts hangout and i would just oh wow there's way more youtube maps news translate photos admin my business i would and you just put that on a uh bullseye or a dartboard just close your eyes and just there it is that's what you do air table did this for excel notion did this for docs um superhuman did it for email there's a new one that's doing it for presentations yeah so let's let's talk about that i don't know much about it it's called pitch.io right or pitch.co i think it's pitch.co if i remember correctly is it awesome or something i don't know like why are people talking about it so much no it's pitch.com dude they got the com that's like that's how you know it's legit that's like a hundred thousand dollar domain name what uh what why are people talking about that so much so i saw this the first time um so this is again you know just like air table did for excel these guys are trying to do for powerpoint so powerpoint also has hundreds of millions of users it's a critical business function and uh microsoft does not make the ui ux better over time uh they do not do smart things in the cloud and so you have on the low end you have google docs and google sheets google slides and on the high end you have right now microsoft uh you know powerpoint and um these guys are trying to to do a better job making making a sexy powerpoint and i'm down with sexy powerpoint i always love their website it looks great pitch.com and um it looks like it's ready to come out now i've seen this thing this has been like for over a year i believe maybe two years that i've seen this this uh website like this based off the people who are recommending it uh on their on their home page i feel like i know the people behind this yeah it's like you're friends with all the testimonials yeah uh great i'm very yeah i like that i don't know anything about it other than what i'm seeing on this website and yeah awesome and so this is one where i think um great market to go after uh your execution obviously has to be good but like you know but but that's okay it's better than going after a bad market because then even great execution doesn't do jack shit for you uh i have another one that's like this on the excel side that's called causal um so i've been talking to these guys i'm not quite enough i don't think i'm like an official advisor but i just give my give these guys a lot of opinions so causal is um it basically tries to give everyone the ability to do like data modeling like an excel wizard or like a data scientist oh that's awesome that's not hard but that's awesome and so they have some cool things you should just if you just google causal's uh rent versus buy calculator you can see what the end output looks like they make this like calculator of rent versus buy how do you spell that um c-a-u-s-a-l um that's causal it's causal app.com is their thing and then if you just google causal app rent versus buy um you can see it it's a cool tool i don't think they've quite got it to work i'm telling them they're trying to make it too they're they're basically too smart so they're trying to do like data modeling and data science like oh look how easy it is to make a linear regression or monte carlo it's like yeah but you don't do that frequently you should just make it where it's really pleasurable and easy to do simple formulas and spit out awesome charts like i love just do that because what air table did was air table took the part of excel that's just rows of information and they made that sexy but what they didn't do is calculation people use excel for calculation and charting and air table doesn't do that so if you did the calculation and charting and you made it beautiful and sexy you could win and uh these guys aren't doing that yeah but i'm looking at causal now it's awesome on and pitch.com i changed my opinion they're gonna fail okay why i went to their about page and they have nine employees and they're all founders oh yeah that's a that's a bit of a red flag um yeah literally dude they're about page they have nine people it says co-founder for all of every employee yeah that ain't gonna work these are also like amazing headshots that they took for themselves yeah so there's one guy that's a co-founder and a qa engineer it says co-founder next to all of them yeah uh they're pretty pretty legit investors okay so say andrea is an investor in them um yeah okay i'm excited to see what they got i want to see it it's been two years okay so let's go to the next company um the next one is art in res art in res so the idea here is you can buy fine art in installments and you know i personally didn't know too much about the fine art market i think my hunch is that you know a little bit more i think you like to look into these things so tell me what you think about this idea and what you know about the fine art market yeah so masterclass is one of our partners we work with masterclass i went and met with the founder his name's scott in new york a couple weeks ago a couple months ago and i learned a lot so uh fine art is one of the largest asset classes in the world um but masterclass is not about art right or what do you mean sorry uh masterworks so masterworks is a website where you can purchase pieces of a basquiat or a pablo picasso in the same way that you buy stock in uh publicly in the publicly traded markets so but art fine art is a massive massive asset class but it's incredibly illiquid as in you you either have to have 30 million to buy a basquiat or you don't get any upside and so what masterworks is doing is allowing people to purchase it with a minimum i think of a thousand dollars and what i learned meeting with those guys was how how great that that that uh that as an asset class how great it could be so for example david geffen um from geffen records a big entrepreneur uh during the financial crisis he was famous for saying that his uh fine art went up 30 percent while his normal uh equities went down significantly um um let me see what else i have a bunch of stats here so i think i think i think that's really interesting if i wanted to look at how this company could do i would look at etsy so as etsy has traded at a 50 to 80 price to earnings ratio which is really really good um i would ebay right now is is in the gutter but i'm really i think that marketplaces can be quite large and i think that i personally was shocked at how large um fine like fancy art is and i thought it was like i thought that there's only like a couple paintings sold a year that made a difference and in reality it's not it's not that way so what's your takeaway are you uh okay okay so let me explain a little more about art res from what we know so here's what here's what they say um the value proposition is that you can buy fine art in installment so you were saying masterworks let you buy a piece of a piece of art they sort of fractionalize it these guys say it's yours but you can you're in a monthly payment plan this has been a big trend in e-commerce anybody who's been paying attention to affirm or afterpay these are multi-billion dollar companies that are just saying even low priced items right here's a 40 item but you can buy it in four easy installments and affirm is doing quite well both of those companies are going to go public or it's looking like they will right afterpay is actually already public and affirm is i think going to go public and so there and there's there's more sezzle there's there's others that are doing this too so that's a very good business um to be in i believe and so so that's what these guys are doing they say they've sold 36 000 worth of art in three weeks this is uh unlike affirm and unlike afterpay they're not a payment option on other marketplace other websites they are their own marketplace and so what they're trying to do is they give artists the ability to sell their work they say most artists don't even sell their work so they say list it here we offer people the ability to buy in installments so more people can buy so we have more buyers in our pool and um they they get the artist to put their link to their store just like an etsy store in their bio so they put their art in res link at the bio and that's driving a lot of users because these are you know instagram artists or artists with an instagram who have you know 100 000 followers and they're getting into the bio of all these different uh artists and that's going to drive traffic that's a lot how soundcloud grew early on was going for these independent artists and then saying cool we'll give you an easy way to host your artwork in that case music uh but you know here share your soundcloud profile and that's how they got tons of traffic and built up their marketplace and so i think that's what these guys are trying to do i think this is smart um the art market is one of those markets that's bigger than you think because you don't even you don't even learn about it till you're already rich and once you're already rich you don't do start a company in it and um so i think it's one of those big invisible markets uh to most entrepreneurs who are scrappy and don't own you know like a pencil let alone a piece of art i uh so i would have agreed with you and before you start talking i i agreed that it was great but then you the way you described it if okay so i would i would be against it if if etsy is competent they can destroy these guys yeah i think it's gonna be hard though because etsy's niche is handmade crafts and i think that's just fundamentally different than fine art i think when you it's like putting a bottle of wine next to a budweiser right in the aisle it's it's a little bit i don't think the people who want their art to be sold or fine art to be sold or want to buy want to be next to somebody who's making bracelets that would be my that'd be my bear case against that okay i buy that i buy that but oh okay i get it so i see a painting on here it's three thousand dollars i can pay over time for for 24 months for 137 okay so my question is this is this pay over time feature even that unique enough to build most of your company on top of why not just like have a normal art store and just install a firm yeah that's a good question i don't know why they're not just using one of the existing installment plans uh you know why are they why are they owning that piece of it it's like an art marketplace but then also this financing program when they could just use one of the existing financing programs so i'm looking at it now um yeah i i'm changing my mind it's stupid okay we'll we'll see jury's out on on ardent res i'm not an expert in this area but what's your bet there's something there my bet would be i think marketplaces are really really freaking hard to start and um and so i for that reason i think that it's going to be incredibly difficult and they definitely haven't shown that they've done that yet but um you know so i would say odds are always against any marketplace being successful but i do like the fundamentals of what they're trying to do i don't think this is a stupid i don't think this is a stupid bet to take if you're an entrepreneur but i do think still likelihood is that it doesn't work like most startups i think that okay but there's a difference here of working and just building wealth and then working by raising money no i mean the business working not not raising money lots of companies can raise money um yeah but what i mean is should i think this if it for sure can make a living for the owners the question is is if they raise money then will it work or will it not my prediction is if they raise money it's gonna fail i feel like that's your prediction with most things i think you just don't like when people raise money for the most part no the next one that we're going to talk about carrot i think that could work okay all right let's talk about it okay so uh carrot uh it's they provide loans and a line of credit for influencers um and that's interesting and the reason it's interesting is i use i have a million dollar line of credit with a company that provides line of credit for um for uh media companies um this clearly works in some cases um influencers can it work maybe but the so the company that i use it was started by a dreamworks exec it has over 100 employees and they have billions of dollars and in and and i don't know what how do you describe billions of dollars in credit yeah um they have billions of a billion over a billion dollars to deploy i think it's great because i'm totally hooked on their company and i don't plan on leaving and i think i pay them like a thousand dollars a month for this what do you what do you use it for your company expenses or personal yeah company yeah so we don't really use it but when a rainy day comes and we need money i have that set up right and so uh and so the other example here is clearbank where they're basically providing credit to e-commerce companies and they're saying great you don't don't go raise money for this if you can show that you're credit worthy by looking at your shopify data then we'll we will front you the money you need for inventory or for facebook ads or whatever else you shouldn't go raise venture capital for to pay for facebook ads and so the interesting thing here is um the big ideas the real big ideas that come out of y comminator don't always sound like big ideas to start airbnb is a great example of that yeah you know when it was when it was on yc's list like this it would have been called air bed and breakfast it would have been like you know rent out an air mattress in my apartment and it would have seemed like a small idea and um this is one of those two where it's like do influencers really need credit do they really need loans what do influencers need you know this for and it just turns out i think that there's a lot of influencers and this might be a hidden big market it might be something that influencers really actually do need this capital they are not they're the traditional banks and lending institutions don't know how to how to assess an influencer for credit worthiness in the same way that they didn't do it for e-commerce and um the question i have is how does the influencer use that capital to invest and grow their business like for e-commerce i get it for your business i get it you're gonna invest the money you're gonna grow your business what does an influencer really do to to grow their business is it ads is it to pay for stunts that's good content like what are they doing with this money that's a good question and i don't think anything but let me uh go let me go a different angle here when you bought your house was uh was your wife listed as an uh an earner yes was she listed as self-employed um yes well what do you mean listed by like when like for example when you got your mortgage sorry when you got your mortgage did she did she say that she was a sole proprietor yeah did you say that you are a 25 percent owner of a business did i say that no okay um when she was getting approved for the mortgage was it hard for her um no she well it was a lot of paperwork but it was uh it wasn't hard like she had the the income to show it but um it just required like mine was simple w2 submit they're like yeah got it we understand your your economics for her she had like you know this roller coaster history and a whole bunch of different entities and like all this different stuff that like was very very hard for them in fact we i just refinanced because the interest rates have dropped like crazy and um we didn't even use her this time because the lady at the bank was like if we can let's just do this off your income like i don't want to do all that paperwork again for your wife that's what i think the opportunity is when i try to buy a home um because i'm an entrepreneur i told them i own i think the threshold is 20 they go they said do you own more than 25 of a business i said yes and they go okay we need to see the last x amount of years in p and l and i showed it to them and it was profitable or whatever and they still gave me a hard time i think that um if i was this company carrot i would i think that there's a big opportunity who can provide home loan for home loans for small business owners i think that's the real opportunity here yeah and maybe they had to do so they so here's some of the stats about them right they've loaned out a million dollars in the last six months the average payback period is 45 days extremely fast payback uh that the apr is very high because of that so even on a low apr because of the fast payback it annualizes at 40 and now they're rolling out a credit card after they do a credit card i'm sure that they would want to get into other financial services and if they can be sort of the financial services for influencers or the bank for influencers that's very interesting because this will always be a niche market that is overlooked and misunderstood by the traditional banking system and so that's the bull case the bear case is i don't know i don't know what the influencers need this money for i don't know if they can actually pay it back and i don't know how credit worthy they actually really are so the the strategy here is you get into a market you get a ton of you buy a ton of share you people like you and trust you and you're profiting and then you start launching more and more stuff to them which i personally love which is the brex model in this case right well it's yeah and it's what i do i mean it's what i did for a living we're built we build up a free email list that we sell more stuff and then more and then more and then more i mean yeah a lot of people do it um and but you got to get them locked in early uh and you got to get enough people so i think that that's cool and that actually brings us to a good point uh of our of the next one how do you how do you pronounce this and i'll tell you why there's a there's an angle here well what's this one called how do you pronounce that we're just gonna call it lila i don't know what it is it's liala i don't know i don't know how you say it they need to change their name because that's hard to pronounce right so it's it's stupidly simple it's uh it's a it's a product that helps women freeze their eggs uh pretty straightforward but what i think could be cool with these folks as well as carrot is once you get this customer on the hook there's loads of products that you could sell them in the same way him started with viagra and now is doing hair loss and then now they're thinking about doing testosterone and doing x and then doing y whatever i think you could do the same thing for both carrot really well and this egg freezing one hello lilia yeah yeah i think that's how you say it so bad name great idea great business you know this is one one of those you just close your eyes and invest is how i would treat it yeah um so the so here's some stats that i i went and found i this is not from their deck i just went and found this um okay and this number was shocking do you know that only according to cnbc only like 11 000 people freeze their eggs a year is that right it's not a lot yeah not a lot but it's growing at 25 a year um and i actually buy that i think it's going to grow significantly uh gen z uh i think are going to put it off more and more i also think that so large companies like facebook and google actually subsidize it and pay for it so to get your eggs frozen it costs between five and twenty grand a year if you're in san francisco it could be 18 grand if you're in a smaller city it could be six grand so it's really expensive it's very invasive it takes four to six weeks where you got to give shots in your arm and it's like huge needles it's a it's a it's just a it's intense um but you know it's about having children so it's a pretty big deal and you're willing to put up with all that um it's a pretty big deal my question is um will they be able to can will they be able to so first of all there's not that huge of a market right now 10 12 000 people what would this new company be able to convince a young woman to use them as opposed to her doctor right and the other other existing services that surely exist around this right like i don't know the competitive landscape but i do like where all the trends are going so i think that you know the data shows that people are having uh kids later they're getting married later and uh that this is becoming less fringe and less taboo over time and so that's what's going in the favor of this is that more people the market for egg freezing is growing and it's becoming more um serviceable now do they what i don't see here is some unique go-to-market strategy oh here's how they're here's how they're going to acquire customers differently than how anybody else would i also don't see um them really talking about their expertise and how they um you know why that why they're going to be able to build trust in a way that's better or different than uh anybody else so that's what i think is missing from this limited information we have here so you know how you and i talk about distribution and product right and how oftentimes product isn't an issue sorry dog bark um we talk about product and distribution and how a lot of people particularly first time people think well if the product's good it's going to sell itself in reality that's not the truth because there's way more great there's a ton of great products that die because they have no distribution and there's a ton of shit products that crush because their distribution is amazing and so in this case in the same way that hymns is just reselling other people's shit right like hymns isn't interesting it's just generic viagra their products nothing good it's just that they like smacked cute branding on it and they made it so men can call their call and get it and young men don't have to be embarrassed about going to the doctor you need to see something like that from this company i think to more to in order for for it to work because what the service they're offering doesn't seem particularly different right right yeah exactly they haven't made it less invasive less painful less cost they haven't innovated on the product side so that means they need to have innovated on the marketing side of the go-to-market side so that's what i don't like about this but i love the space that they're in and i think there's going to be a winner i don't know if it's this company or another but that's what's great about this one yeah and let me see do they have use i don't know what okay here it is i got some information on them um uh let me charge okay so it looks like what they're doing is they're not actually doing the work they're just a middleman for the clinic so in reality they're almost like lead gen yep so they have a 500 concierge service that they offer first so how do we educate you handled you through the process um and basically qualify the lead yeah so what they're doing is um they are not they are not actually providing the service they're just a marketing company for the service providers um if that's the case i like this i think it's cool yeah uh i have a friend who does a company called yo derm and uh what they do is the same thing around dermatology so it's telemedicine but in reality what they're doing is they said most people who need to see a dermatologist are going because of acne most people who have acne get the same prescription that prescription is you know something that they can just get quickly from a doctor the biggest bottleneck is getting an appointment takes you know 27 days on average to get an appointment with the dermatologist so what they did was they built a marketing company that basically says hey do you need to see a dermatologist this is a faster easier way to do it just do it from like facetime your doctor and then they have a bunch of doctors who just write these same prescriptions all the time for the same acne medicine because that's what people need 80 of the time and 20 of the time they say you need to go see a doctor it's not acne it's not just the generic thing and uh and then they're white labeling the actual acne medicine and they're the ones delivering it and that's the how big is that uh they're doing well i love that okay so we talked about cron art art and res carrot and lil lilia that's a stupid name you have a hundred thousand dollars to put in one which one you're gonna do all right let's take a look um it's not gonna be cron for me i'm also gonna say it's not gonna be lilia because even though i like the market for all those reasons we mentioned i don't know why this is the winning company i don't see them doing anything special and this is the what we have to tell people is once you meet the person behind it that could totally change your decision for sure right this is not based on the people at all because you could meet someone and you're like they're so formidable that's like you don't care what you sell i'm in right um i think if i was gonna do this if i was gonna this is crazy to me that i'm even saying this but i think i would be putting it in art and res uh i think i would put it in because i think if they can get the marketplace spun up it's going to be valuable and i think that uh this is an overlooked marketplace so so overlooked market so i like that it's a marketplace as a model not lead gen not not anything else and then on the other side i think if they can get um i have a feeling that the sort of fine art marketplace has not been affected by technology in the same way as uh all the other industries have and so i'm curious to see what they can do so i would bet the 100k on art and res and i would write it off as a loss because i would assume it's going to be a loss all right i would do uh cron okay why cron um i just think it's it's super easy for them to be in default survival it's so easy um like i think that they can get to like a hundred thousand dollars in monthly revenue like really fast i think their churn might be high but i i think that it's just because of the market size and because it's an impulse buy and if this just saves you a little bit of time i i just think that they can get to 10 or 30 million dollars in recurring revenue inside three or four years with very little capital and so their default alive pretty easily and uh depending on how creative the entrepreneurs are they could expand beyond that um so i'm gonna go with cron okay i like that i don't know who would buy them though uh well like for example microsoft bought sunrise calendar i believe uh it was it was a calendar that people really liked it was a pro uh professional calendar and uh they got bought for i don't know how much but i know like inbox got bought for 100 million for making a slicker inbox uh you know by google and then sort of thrown away um sunrise got bought so so i think that there's potential for an acquisition there by one of the um you know big companies that cares about you know enterprise and productivity and whatnot so there's a there's a chance there i just want to be evil and just clone half of these things on this list yeah that's not evil that's uh that's not evil that's just capitalism but i i do like i some of these ideas i think are really stellar i don't know how it's i can i tell you the one that i would invest in it's not even one we discussed uh i know we got to go i'll do it in 30 seconds company called duffle they're doing fast deliveries on college campuses and so that's a horrible idea but go ahead not horrible not horrible i'll tell you why what they do is they buy the popular stuff that kids want like ben and jerry's and chips and whatnot beer they put it in an apartment and then they deliver it to you on scooter when you order it so average card is sixteen dollars they make five dollars per delivery and they're delivering in a very lightweight way uh on the same in a very tight geographic boundary so they don't have a bunch of logistical issues there's a company called puff or go puff have you have you heard of those guys no what's that it's this but um it's basically it's this and they're doing over 100 million dollars a year right now and they're just two kids out of i don't know penn state or something like that i don't know where they are but somewhere in middle america and so i've seen this model work i think that this is a business idea yeah puff or it's good i think the website's go puff.com you're saying they do 100 million in sales yeah more than that i believe and so they're in you can see all the different campuses so then how profitable are they i mean i don't know all that right i don't have all their financials but i mean uh is 100 million like their net prop like their after they pay the drive i mean or is it like where the driver gets most of the money and most so they're they're at 163 million a year um is the is the thing and i don't think they even raise that much money like let me look at their fundraising for for go puff i don't think they raise too much oh no they have now raised a lot how much uh 866 million dollars oh you described it as two kids well it was soft bank invested in them and uh recently and is a huge round so soft bank backed up the truck in them but anyways i think this market works and i actually think it's great that soft bank backed up the truck and put the touch of death on this company if i'm duffel i uh i believe in what i'm doing there's a lot of college campuses out there to make this work can i give you two that i would do right now yeah okay this is just purely off of reading about their market and uh like a description of the company the first one is buildplane.com project automation for commercial construction i think that with the recession this can make this company a ton of money uh their previous companies were acquired so they're solid but uh just i love software that is in boring industries like commercial construction that can help people just save a little bit of money it's called right build build plane like i i that that will take off and be big i like that it's not sexy and then the second one is true north fleet did you see that one i didn't see this no um we give independent truckers the resource the resources of large fleets and so basically what they do is uh you know a lot of truckers are just small business owners right they're just like uber drivers but they just do truckers my my dad is in that industry so that's how i know about a lot about it and they're pretty raw they just you like up until recently they didn't use twitter or anything like that they would just have their cb radios and their cell phone and my dad would call them and be like hey i got a load for you to go pick up in uh bakersfield and then i need you drop it off at the walmart in this place like that's just how it would work and uh this company is is building bits of like software for small small trucking businesses and i don't i think people vastly underestimate how trucking is like the backbone of america and how big logistics is in our country so i'm very bullish on that one i like it okay cool uh yeah if you like this let us know we're going to do either more of these yc sort of company deep dives uh since this batch list just came out there's like 100 companies we could go through if we wanted to um and if you don't let us know be like that was boring don't do it again and um yeah we can go through a few more next week sean did you you had topics already that you wanted to go over we can do these next week huh yeah we'll do them next week or we'll do them on thursday thursday okay uh well thanks for listening this one was a little ghetto because we're all at home hopefully the quality was sufficient enough yeah i for one enjoy the ghetto pod but i miss i hate it
