so i've been on the other side of the so so when we were doing our idea lab i worked with this guy michael birch michael birch was is known as if you just google he's like one of the top growth guys in the world he sort of was doing and invented viral marketing before viral marketing was a word he did it because he didn't have money back in the day so he built one of the first address book importers where uh for this company called birthday alarm he had he was like and i think he did it before that at um rick marini's company i forget what that was called birthday was before that so so birthday was the first one where he was like hey i want people to send this to their friends what if i just imported all the addresses from their hotmail and then i made it easy push this button to send it and he's like he he literally told me at his house he was like i thought that 10 days later like i thought there's no way they let this go for more than 10 days and he's like it's now been 15 years and this thing still works and he's like um so he was working on viral marketing because he just didn't have a budget so he's like i gotta use my customers to get me more customers and to explain that you didn't explain it totally clear but someone signs up for your thing and says do you want to invite your friends here's your gmail contacts click select all and send an email to all of them and so in this case for birthday alarm it was i make a calendar where i'm and i'll invite you i'll say hey sam can you add your birthday to my calendar i don't want to forget your birthday this is before facebook existed by the way and so you would add your birthday to my calendar and they would say hey sam don't you want to remember sean's birthday that'd be nice like reciprocate and you'd be like yeah sure and then it would say hey sam you got one birthday on the calendar but you surely got more friends than one so why don't you invite some other friends here let me make it easy for you would you like to import all your friends from hotmail and you're like yes and then and he added one thing at a time to make it more viral so he he would add um a pre-filled message because he's like oh there people are stopping because they can't think of what to say right so here's a pre-filled message that i know works and then i just say send and so then uh he got this thing super viral so you know birthday alarm grew to 50 million members with zero paid marketing 50 million and um and then he's done this again and again since then with his social network bebo and others so when i worked with them the name of the game was viral growth and so we did a charity campaign they're trying to raise money for charity water well we made a story a website that was just telling a story of this boy john bosco with no water and then we said can we get this to go viral and so we did the same thing import import emails get people to send the story to their friends and raise money for the cause and we got it to go viral so i've literally been it where like nothing nothing nothing you'd come into work nothing no growth no growth no growth and you would just tweak the right thing and then all of a sudden you know between overnight something would have doubled and the next morning it doubled again next morning doubled again and i remember it just going from zero to five million people signing up for this charity thing within like you know two weeks it was insane and so i've seen viral growth and how counterintuitive it is like you don't think you know well yesterday we had 4 000 people so today we're gonna have i don't know 5 000 6 000 it's like no you're gonna have 16 000 then you have 32 000 and it's gonna you know it's gonna go up to the millions within a few days and so i've seen viral growth when you're talking about it in the good sense from a product perspective now it's viral growth of an actual fucking virus and so uh and you could see actually in the u.s somebody did a great graph where they mapped italy where everything's on lockdown because italy has started spreading like crazy and they showed italy day one u.s day one italy day two u.s day two number of cases and the bar graphs are like identical and the thing is we're just in like whatever day six and you can see by day 21 where this thing gets to if you don't like lock everything down right away so i am very fearful because i've seen viral growth i've seen viral spread and i know that it doesn't work the way it breaks our brains our brains think things go linearly but this goes exponentially and it's really hard to just comprehend an exponential spread and to take the story a different way than coronavirus which is that stuff that you're describing that michael birch thing you can actually still get all these cool plugins that auto uh automatically like allow people to share a pre-populated message to all their gmail contacts we use it and people still share yeah and the the math works out where you know um because you would think i would never do that i wouldn't email all my contacts we had a lot of people doing it but people do it and what happens is you know one percent or less will do it but you look at the math one percent of people do it on an average they have 326 contacts so for every hundred people that come in you get 326 people blasted out it doesn't work as good as that time because the email open rates are much higher than yeah but now people are like oh i don't know i never talked to sam so if he's sending me this this is junk this is spam uh now people filter it but in certain countries it works like we were growing like we could do this like clockwork in india in india people still open it like they did in the u.s 10 years ago and they forward even higher rates they don't care they'll forward everything to everybody and so india turkey all these little countries where we would see this crazy growth that you couldn't get in the u.s or uk anymore they kind of suck because the monetary value ends up you know the value per user is lower there but it does still feel good to get like and it definitely works and people are shocked by that yeah we did one through sms i remember and over the weekend it went viral and like you know during the week monday through friday everything looks fine is growing but like not at a crazy pace we didn't realize the viral coefficient was two and so over the weekend it took off um and started compounding on a big number and we racked up 120 000 and sms 120 000 bill in sms's holy crap going through um uh kazakhstan it's like we didn't even know we're growing we're going to grow in kazakhstan and it went crazy and turns out texting in kazakhstan super expensive and so 120 000 in two days we had to pay out that's crazy sucked what
