really high-end prosthetic and he put it on ebay and someone bought it like within a few hours for a thousand dollars zach welcome back hey how you doing good uh so this week you've got a story on a guy who's calls himself the flea market flipper who um has found goods and items online starting with like uh shoes baby clothes things like that and has worked his way up the line to now um buying and flipping uh construction equipment so tell us a little bit about this guy yeah um so it's a couple rob and melissa steffensen um out of out of florida um they basically run this site called flea market flipper um it's a really cool community they it's kind of an educational blog where they teach people and give them the tools of how to how to flip things and it could be anything like you said from uh you know baby strollers uh purses shoes all the way up to forklifts and um you know treadmills um i think rob was at the point last year where he's like buying like 40-foot harley davidson signs from like motorcycle dealerships and like shipping them across the country and selling them for like 10 grand so you can do some really interesting stuff with flipping but um it's kind of kind of this interesting world and it's it's an interesting way to make a little side income that is kind of accessible for anyone um if they have a few tricks that they can use it's not going to make you into a millionaire but you can make a couple you know hundred bucks here and there just off the junk you have lying around it it adds up i guess it reminds me of um so our founder sam par tells this story of when he was how he got to start as an entrepreneur when he was like in his teens um and then in high school i remember him saying like he went on ebay and craigslist and sold stuff he he did this thing where he approached like the graduating seniors on the baseball team and he bought their equipment for like not much money because he knew they weren't going to keep playing baseball and then he sold it on ebay so it's the kind of thing that i think as you say people at any level could do and especially now more relevant than ever with people being out of work and needing some side income yeah and another thing about the current time we're in is a lot of thrift shops are still closed so um more people are cleaning out their homes than ever before right now so you have this um like huge amount of excess stuff that people are getting rid of but there's nowhere for it to go so um you know i go for a run every day and i even see it around here outside of san francisco there's just a ton of stuff sitting on the side of the sidewalk that people are throwing away because they can't bring it to thrift stores um so you know um one one thing that rob recommends doing is uh you know sometimes there's not a demand for something locally so people will give something away for free on craigslist or facebook marketplace and you can take those things where there's no demand locally and put them on ebay where there's a national demand and suddenly you have a potential pool of 160 million people to um sell something to and there's always someone out there looking for something so in our house it's baseball cards and basketball cards and things like that uh so my kids are into like collectibles so i'm sure there's there's a like a big market for all kinds of different products and services what's the craziest thing you heard that he's flipped uh let's see there was uh he told me a story about how he flipped a prosthetic leg uh he he went to this flea market and this guy was had found this prosthetic leg at a state sale and had no idea what it was was kind of creeped out by it and just wanted to get rid of it so i think he he bought it for like 30 bucks and it turns out it was like this incredibly fancy really high-end prosthetic and he put it on ebay and someone bought it like within a few hours for a thousand dollars um and then maybe they flipped it for ten thousand so sure yeah i think it was worth somewhere around 10 grand so um yeah it's pretty nuts what people find fascinating well i look forward to hearing more about it in the sunday email that's going to come out in a few days and uh thanks for joining us zach yep
