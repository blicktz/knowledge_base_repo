you text me something you're like sean you're you're seven out of ten funny you're eight out of ten charming and i was like this is a sam par compliment i think i'm getting here i'm back you know when michael jordan came back to the league he just faxed in a one pager with just those words on it i'm back we have a lot in common him and i yeah unfortunately when he came back he was wearing number 45 and uh he kind of sucked that year and they got knocked out of the playoffs so i'm hoping you're coming back a little stronger us six seven black guys we have a lot in common you know what i'm saying me and me and mj um did you miss me it felt like a long time for me i don't think it felt like a long time for you because you were pretty prolific you kind of had a couple hits i did so many podcasts in the last three weeks i definitely missed you because that was a lot of content uh i don't know why i did that what i should have done in retrospect was say okay sam's out let's not force the issue when he comes back we'll come back strong instead i overcompensated when you're out and i was like no i am going to create all the content the world needs tonight and that's what i tried to do and also um we were working really hard ahead of time i mean i felt like i was recording a bunch ahead of time so you've been kind of grinding now for about five weeks now it feels like yeah the funny thing is we thought you were going to be out this month so we have all these guest hosts planned for this month that your baby came early and so now we have like a full month of guests uh coming up i can go away i can go away again but you did great i will we'll talk about some of the stuff i was doing but you were doing great so the sarah uh more podcast was phenomenal that woman is a superstar you did a very good job of getting some good stuff out of her you also did a non-pod thing that i thought was some of your finest work the uh all-in podcast video or the all-in ceo application if you haven't seen it go to sean's twitter and you'll see it got 1.1 million views i like this morning all right you ready welcome welcome to my five minute job application to become ceo of the all-in podcast this is the american dream baby i have worked my ass off for years just so that one day i could get to work with such a group of successful intelligent billionaires and jason calacanis that was very good and you did it on your own you even edited it right yeah i didn't have an editor uh and it was one of those ideas that so okay i'll explain what it is so the all-in podcast which is a popular business podcast um is they were like oh we're hiring a ceo and it's the it started by these four guys were just these super rich guys i the joke i make is the all-in pod is billionaires talking about billionaire shit and our pod is millionaires talking about millionaire shit and so the they were like we're hiring a ceo and it turned us into a real brand and whatever and so i um i was like you know it'd be funny if i did like a joke application to this pot to the for the job so i recorded this video problem is the video is good but uh i only wrote at the very end that this was a joke and like not meant to be taken seriously so people are texting my dad they're like hey i heard sean's gonna get the job for a ceo all-in congratulations my dad's like what's all in what's a podcast and i'm like and you're insulting them the whole time the funny thing by the way i told him i go my dad texted me that and i go no no it's just a joke and then he goes okay who started it he thinks like someone's like messing with me i started but you were you were like you're a ribbon on them it's kind of funny yeah it was so it's all fair because it was mostly funny stuff but you were giving them a hard time so that's pretty funny and then a couple of them replied and be like you've made it to the second round so i actually thought they handled it well did did they reach out to you at all no they handled it well uh they didn't reach out beyond just like the public replies or whatever um and then they played it on the pot on there they played the first five seconds or ten seconds on their podcast and um unfortunately that made it even worse because that's that part is where it sounds like i'm serious about it and then i start roasting them but they cut off all the me roasting them and just put the part where it's hey i'm applying for this job which is actually the best roast back that they could have done i think our our friend messaged us and said uh one of the great things about or what did he say he said uh a really uh powerful tool is to be able to take the popular narrative and blunt force your way into the conversation and you did it perfectly you did a very good job talking about a newsjacking that i think ryan holiday's jacking coined that term or at least he popularized it which is you take the current thing but you find a way to attach yourself to it and you sort of hijack the news newsjacking and uh it's not well it wasn't my intent i just wanted to try something funny i so i've been i'll tell you we do this podcast and i love this podcast but also i told you i'm not like i'm trying to not go start another company right which is all i've ever done for 15 16 years is go be like i'm a startup ceo i'm gonna start a company it's kind of my identity and i'm trying to shift that um and i'm having a lot of fun creating content but also it doesn't take that much time to produce this podcast like take some time for sure but like when you're used to working i don't know 50 60 hours a week it does i couldn't put 50 60 hours a week into this and again the smart chill move would be to just take that energy and go be a better dad go do some community service and just just better myself as a whole but i'm a flawed human being and so i need to direct that 50 60 hours of energy into some creative work project um and so i was like i've been looking for way like other content i can create other content formats that are going to be fun one of them was this idea of doing like something that's a little bit funnier it's almost the thing i did was kind of like you ever seen last week tonight or the daily show it's sort of like yeah i know that you've been loving last week tonight i know you've been loving that style yeah so i would try to do that style um which by the way very nerve-wracking it's hard it's one thing to be doing a podcast and crack a joke in the flow of a conversation it's another to be like in this video i'm gonna be funny i'm gonna tell jokes and make you laugh and it's like wait is this like within 10 minutes i was like is any of this funny it's just and i couldn't i couldn't figure it out bro i was like i was like i don't know if this is good or this is going to be a total fucking lame thing to put out there and that was a nice feeling it was good to feel alive again well here's the good news twitter is not a very funny place so even an eight out of ten can crush it yeah you text me something you're like sean you're you're seven out of ten funny you're eight out of ten charming and i was like this is a sam par compliment i think i'm getting here it was awesome i thought it was good our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better how's life as a dad so you created a baby you didn't really create it you you played a small role in creating this baby um but the baby's here now life changed life the same what's the situation it changed um i think i talked to 30 friends you were one of them and i think the predominant answer was you love this from a man you love your baby but you're not in love with your baby and i only heard about five of the 30 people say i was in love right away and the but predominantly people were saying um you know it's they're just like an alien at first and you don't really get feedback that wasn't the case with me man i i i was i was in right away i've always been what i always say with animals and children i'm softer than cream cheese i've always been soft with with those types of things and i was in right away baby i i loved it it was awesome we got a um first of all we did a c-section which is like magic um the doctor was like i'm starting now and literally i timed it four minutes later the baby was crying and out and then the doctor's like and now i'm putting your uterus back inside of you and like it's crazy man like that's a line you used to use uh right yeah yeah i was like uh jakes you'll be a coke doc uh wait were you in the room you told me you were going to be in the room i was in the room and basically what they do is you know mom is laying like one direction and then they take the baby out and they bring her like 10 feet to the side of her and i i go and check on the baby and i was like don't look don't look don't look what was your angle like were they like i still saw it i still saw him you're like why are you cleaning why are you cleaning all the glassware over there yeah i was like staring at my feet trying not to look and i i definitely looked it was pretty wild uh it was gory um another thing it made me view women as wizards um the fact that they could like have this being growing inside of them and then it like is out it's just like it gave me like almost a spiritual respect for my wife it was that was pretty magical um it's almost like you view her as a partner and also as like a sex thing like you know like she's she's sexualized to you after this i'm like you're a god like there is you know what i mean like i can't imagine like you are not like just beautiful to me you are like this like spiritual being so like the immense amount of respect another thing that happened i remember thinking um so the week i went in uh or the week we had the baby um i think the stock market was like dying or something i barely looked but i remember thinking like the volume of love that i had for this new baby was so loud that every other problem was just uh silent i just didn't care nearly as much and so that was like a pretty breathtaking thing to have did you experience that uh some of those things you just described so i would say uh the first six weeks after watching my wife uh give birth was like i was like um you know can i refill that for you um what do you need let's just sit down and talk about your needs for a little bit like how can i the peasant pleb that i am compared to you do just make your life one ounce easier and it lasted like only six weeks i gotta say i revered back to my normal self after that but like for six weeks the the visceral feeling of watching that happen was uh it made me just be like okay i'm you're a miracle and i'm here to uh ease your life in any way that i can because you just did the hardest thing i've ever seen um like you know i don't know what a c-section is like but like you know my life was doing all the pushing and all that stuff and it's just like a primal experience no epidural all that crap and so oh wow after that i was definitely like you like you're saying just in awe and you see you know like a lot of people ask me when we got married they're like oh you're married now you know is how is life is it different with you guys i was like no we've been living together for three years like literally nothing changed and then but the time something did change was after the baby and not even because of the baby more how how i saw her just changed you know i like i saw her perform you know an act of god and so that that was cool uh so definitely felt that didn't feel the instant attachment but um that's cool that you did did you do like skin to skin and all that was it like oh yeah is it like a pheromone thing or like is it like is it chemical or was it philosophical like did you did you think it or did it just like feel like there's just the chemicals in your brain going off what was it i haven't worn a shirt in two weeks i basically just for me it was that's not what they mean when they say yeah i went and bought a bunch of beaters i've only been wearing beatles basically for easy access i did it just to keep the kid warm i mean i i do it just to keep her warm and it feels nice touching her skin it's just like i just like touching her i just i men are a little bit different i've noticed i watch a video on instagram it's like all i'm just like playing with her face and like just like rubbing her rubbing her cheeks and like rubbing her chest and rubbing her back i just like touching her it just makes me feel good to touch her and uh i think it keeps her warm yeah we uh you also said something like it makes the other problems seem small uh that's definitely true right because everything's relative in life like you know isn't it crazy like i saw a video the other day on tiktok made me so sad it was this video it wasn't meant to be a sad video it was like you know these youtubers that vlog their life it was a guy vlogging his day except he was in peru and they lived in a hut with like dirt floor and his two kids it was like he wakes up at five in the morning he does his morning routine which is he does push-ups he was basically doing like andrew huberman but like you know the real you know like he's doing push-ups on the dirt floor he's outside in nature because his home is partially in nature and um his kids were these two small kids maybe like three and five years old and they were like just warming themselves up with like the hot water in the morning and then they were doing their school work on the like cot that they were living on i'll play this video it like it was sad and it's like heartwarming at the same time this is weird thing and especially you know like my daughter's the same age as the kid in the video and so like you just see the difference in quality of life and it's kind of stunning um it's not the first time right like i lived in indonesia my family's from india like i've seen poverty before but you every time you see it it's like you know just like re puts it back in the front of your brain rather than yeah but was the guy happy he was super happy and that's what i was like he was happy he was as happy as i am and um i'm like you know this is like some obviously like college wisdom but like it really is just we acclimate to whatever our circumstances are and we have the sort of like a baseline normal but it is also uh everything is relative and so it's relative to your expectations it's relative to your neighbors and it's relative to what you know and what you felt and so for him you know whatever was happening that day would spike him up towards you know peak happiness and if something was what went wrong it would go a little bit below and so like but the absolute the absolute should have been if you just look objectively if an alien was watching they would say certainly this person is at least 10 times happier on an absolute basis and it's like no not at all we're actually probably exactly the same and on an absolute basis um but one thing that does happen is if you have you know a kid like your your quote unquote problems from before are no longer problems or like you know your kid has a runny nose and a cough and all of a sudden who cares what's happening in slack or whatever else and i think that's one of the it's one of the many blessings that kids will give you the other which you haven't experienced yet probably is when you are talking like when a kid is little like maybe let's say a year and a half years old uh you're showing them things you're like look like oh my god the water is dripping or like look at this i can take this eraser and i can erase the words it's gone it's magic and like in trying to make the kid like see the magic in the everyday things like you obviously are also there for the ride and so you slow down and start to like even when you're kind of faking it for the kid you are feeling the same wonder about all the little things that's like the other huge thing that kids i think do for you i'm excited for that another thing that i don't think people discussed enough and i think it's probably because i hang out with a bunch of peter pans so like most of my friends are between 30 and 40 have like some type of financial success and just like go to spain when they want are single can pronounce yeah like a lot of my friends are like kind of selfish you know uh not not that that's wrong but what wasn't discussed with me ahead of time was i feel like a man i feel so masculine having a kid like i feel like um i feel like it's the final piece of the puzzle and that i can continue putting the pieces together but i have all the pieces now i didn't realize uh how masculine it would make me feel i think um i read somewhere that someone defined masculinity as producing excess resources to make sure that your tribe has what they need and i was like i get it i and i i know another i think that the definition of masculinity is looking up and defining the word masculinity to like put put some words to this that's the most masculine thing i could think of like i'm like hey i am what i am um and then uh i remember thinking how hormonal like i like i remember like uh like i have two nights after or the first night home i remember i just heard someone walking outside or something just in the street and i just like bolted up and i was and i and i was like ready to roll and then it's also crazy how the woman i was like in the doctor i'm like so when is she going to start making milk and like she didn't have it like two hours ago and they're like oh she's probably ready to roll like right now and i was like so you're telling me that you didn't have it and then like an hour later you do like they're like yeah your body just knows and it was just mind-boggling to me how primal and animalistic we are yet we try to avoid that totally totally it's miraculous is that not crazy to you like like where i was like i was like you guys where's the threshold like does she have to like do push-ups what do we got to do to like get this flowing yeah is there a dummy we eat and they're like oh just give it a few hours i had so many of those like hang on hang on hang on hang on moments with the nurses and they were like yeah i was like like this happened also during the delivery i was like okay and they're like hey you can like walk around like you you know you could deliver the baby standing up you could be on all fours i was like on all fours what are we talking about here they're like yeah actually it's an easier position less painful and i was like every movie or tv show there's only one position that they show they can't show but butthole on the camera so that's well i'm in the like second phase of the like labor process and i'm having to hang on hold on no way no way moment and they're like dude it's first of all it's just not about you right now you need to learn that's actually rule number one rule number two yes all of these things that you don't understand they're real and they happen yeah so that was crazy and then maybe i'll say the last thing i don't know how this has impacted your career but let's talk about money for a minute i have a feeling this is going to make me significantly better in my career because i think my hours will be more focused i also think that as she grows i'm going to want to show like uh consistency uh so like a normal nine to five or um it just to make an example of like look i uh i i'm here to provide i commit to what i say i i show up and get through things um i think it's going to actually make me more successful even if i have less hours do you think that's going to be true i think it's true because you're telling yourself that yeah like uh you know my my grand theory of life is that our brain is basically a giant labeling machine and that the my view of the world is that these it's like a box is coming on the conveyor belt that's just things happening in life and then our brain puts the label on it and says this means this oh this guy drove in front of me this means he's an and he cut me off verse or like this means like something else completely i could just completely make up a different definition i could be focusing on the plants instead of that and so our brain is this labeling machine and it's that's what defines everything that happens in our life and i think that for you you're gonna you're saying you know what this baby means in my life it means that now i'm gonna be more mature i'm gonna be wiser i'm gonna be more focused i'm gonna show her work ethic i'm gonna wanna um you know be less erratic i'm gonna actually like zen out or sort of chill out and and be a stable rock type figure so then you're gonna do exactly that it's a self-fulfilling thing right like um so yeah i do think it will be that for you but i don't think it's because of the baby i think that's because you're putting a really strong empowering meaning on the baby you did this by the way we should talk about and i'm so sorry to hear about sid your dog but i read your blog post so you said kind of a similar thing can you talk about that like you basically said like you were kind of in the f boy mode you get this dog so if you follow me on social media you'll know i've got this huge dog or i had this huge dog i've had him for 15 years almost and he was my best friend i love this animal and basically when he was three maybe or two years old i got a dui and i spent 24 hours in jail and i came home and he went to the bathroom in the house and i was i was so upset i'm like oh my god this dog didn't know if i was gonna come home what if i was there for three days this was miserable i gotta get my together i have a responsibility and so that was a turning point was i was like i have this responsibility i have to take care of him and it changed my life and i remember thinking like uh it felt good it felt good to care about something and some people i guess i could say this now that i have kids but people were insulted when i would say i was like yeah having a dog it's kind of like five percent of having a kid and people are like what how dare you and i'm like now that i have a kid i'm like yeah it was like five percent where like i had a thing that i cared for it was the animals obviously inherently probably less valuable but also uh like less work but i had this like inherent i care for you and i wanna i wanna make sure you have what you need and that definitely uh changed me for the better leading up to the baby being born i knew sid was gonna die soon i even wrote like a fake obituary for him before he died so i can like enjoy my last six months with him and we my wife and i were like we gotta get him to we gotta get him to the birth we gotta do this i we need to just take this one picture and we need to just to complete the picture or i needed to of like going from like moron idiot fuck boy to like a family man and i've got my act together i was like i needed to say something great you said uh dogs for guys in their early 20s are like a special thing specifically what did you mean yeah dog in your early 20s because when men in their early 20s when you're 21 you have you're no longer a kid so you have more responsibility and you are uh you don't get a pass for doing dumb things but you're still a dumb person and oftentimes that means that you're going to grow and when you grow the friends that you have at 21 a lot of times aren't the same friends that you have at 31 but your dog in your 20s is the only one that has been there the whole time and they've been giving you loyalty and love unconditionally and so a man and their dog in the 20s that's a very special dog they see the transformation they see the transformation and they're the only ones i mean not all the people who you're friends with at 21 they knew college sean right and you're still friends with them maybe but they don't know what you've been doing lately and then your wife and your friends now they don't know what you were and there's really only one one and they're there every day in your house and like you said unconditionally they don't judge you either but they you know and it's a powerful thing the point of my blog post was like i never truly cared about legacy because i'm like the feeling that i'm gonna have when i die is the feeling that i had before i was born which is nothing so why do i care and this dog died my my buddy sid died and i remember thinking like i did so much to please you and that impacted me which maybe i've had a little bit of impact on some other people and it was really because of my love for you and and so it changed my perspective on legacy and what's crazy is we were due like right about now november 1 and he died in october so we had him for 10 days after birth and i was like i kind of like it was a little spiritual where i'm like oh my god like the world worked like how on how like whatever 15 years is however many days that is that many days plus 10 days is what i got right and so that was like a very meaningful impact for me i posted that blog post what's crazy to me is i felt like a crazy sharing that because i used to make fun of people who like cared about their dogs as much and then i'm like oh i've totally become that if you ever i mean it might be too raw for you at the moment but there's a great um uh there's a guy who runs or like is the main host of sports center scott van pelt and he did a tribute to his dog uh when his dog passed on air on sports center for like three minutes he just talked and uh you know definitely gonna cry you know when you watch that and you know that feeling is uh i don't know anybody who has a dog that doesn't love their dog i don't know anybody who loves who loves their dog that wouldn't feel that way so you know it is completely reasonable it was the first time i've cried in probably 13 years and i was like oh my god like so it was pretty wild um but i'm happy it worked out and i have one bone to pick with you i wish you would have told me to have a kid sooner i wish you would have told me because you're you're i've always been like mr cool guy where you like you withhold a little bit of emotion where you don't want to express how wonderful it is and well maybe you just don't feel that way but i don't think that's true but like within days of having her i remember thinking there was no reason for me not to do this four years sooner because then i will have four years left because if i die at the same age i would have had four additional years i wish you would have told me to do it sooner uh i wish that that's one of my only regret and not a lot of people talk about that they always say oh wait you've got time man it's pretty awesome i wish i would have done it sooner yeah i i think uh my i i guess my personal advice would still be the same so kids are amazing awesome and so like so much fun um like you know the fun gets baked into your day you don't have to like go do anything like what you don't realize when you're in your like 20s or 30s or you're single or whatever is like to you have to basically chase fun it's like i'm going to coachella and then i'm going to this thing i'm going to go hang out over here and then we're gonna i'm gonna learn this new skill and i'm gonna do all these things you look at people with kids and you're like ah suckers trapped in jail with their kids and we don't realize is you basically took all of the dope life experiences you simplified them and you get to just have them in your house all the time and like that's actually what's happening to those people you think are trapped with their kids um but like the people in their kids you know you don't want to be that obnoxious condescending person with kids it's just like like my brother last of this one said he's like he's like you know the only real person that like we could talk real with each other and he's like um your life doesn't have any meaning until you have kids he's like that's just how i feel okay he's like i know i'm not supposed to say that i know that's not a gatekeep i'm going to gatekeep from now on when people say something like oh you don't know any better wait till you have kids you don't know what you're talking about he said that not to me but he's like we're talking about somebody else he's like they just don't realize it and they're going to keep talking themselves into how you know blah blah like how their life is so awesome without kids he's like but my life he's talking for himself he's like you know i didn't have any meaning until this and now i have you know uh you know my cup is full uh the other thing i would say though is that the four years you're talking about like there it is a one-way door to use the jeff bezos decision-making framework once you have the kid you can't un-have the kid really and so you you're gonna like your freedoms have changed fundamentally from this point forward and so i think that the freedoms you have like you know that age 26 to 31 or whatever are pretty valuable you should have them while you're there um and then go walk through that one-way door and like you know now you have a different set of joys but you do have a different set of a different degree of freedom uh i think that's much more important than like you you know worrying about these like kind of my age is 76 to 80 you know glad i had those four extra years i don't think you're i don't think life actually works like that i think you as good you had the freedom to do all the things you did and become the person you became you know it happened at the right time for you i think you settled down yeah um but it's been four years ago what were you doing you're living on sixth street in uh san francisco you're stressed i was learning the difference between meth crack and heroin and uh like the different ways that what you put it in your body walking around soma you're having a dare class without the dare officer in so much san francisco and uh you're stressed out building your company you're making 37 000 a year i don't think that was the right time to have the kid i think my advice was good to to say wait by the way i know that you why i i understand this perspective of why people don't do it i totally get it a night nurse is a cheat code everyone keeps telling me so those who don't know a night nurse it's basically this lady who is in this other room with the baby when the baby cries every three hours she goes and wakes up mom and says all right all right heifer it's time to feed all right like that my wife was basically a cow for three months and she's like hey uh whip the boob out you you're good to go and i sleep in a separate room um and my sleep has been awesome women i i don't know if it's my wife but i feel like a lot of women they go through the the waking up every three hours and they still have a pretty good day the next day maybe they're just running on adrenaline but uh for me uh i cannot wake up every three hours and still be a functioning human being the next day you need a night nurse too i need a night nurse i want someone to swaddle me i would love to get swaddled dude i still sleep with my wife's pregnancy pillow because i'm like this is incredible this is the level of comfort that was available to me like why is this only for pregnant women justice for non-pregnant women my knees haven't touched in bed for like the last uh nine months like dude knees should not be touching when i said you that one pregnancy pillow the swedish one somebody said this to me and i was like swedish pregnancy pillow who did i can i just get one off amazon and they're like brother just shut up and trust me and i did i ordered this thing it took like a week and a half to arrive and boy has it arrived in my life you know my daughter's four now that's four years i've been sleeping with this pillow i bought two it's incredible hey i've been wearing nipple guards when i go running so like hey i'm all about all the different uh pregnancy stuff um but yeah it's been awesome um i'm gonna try and not be that guy that posts all this stuff on social media but i might be you don't post your children do you well i don't even use instagram and stuff so i don't i don't really but is it a rule that you don't do it no no no i just you just i don't have a gun around to it i don't like to post that type of stuff uh i post like i'll tweet random thoughts or i'll do a podcast that's like what i like to put thoughts out there not necessarily like life pictures well i'm gonna try also not to be that guy but we'll see if uh we'll see if i can keep up with that all right well this is the uh the catch-up episode we'll just go ahead and publish this even though it's totally different than a normal episode uh it's us reconnecting rebonding um uh you know we needed a little skin to skin after what was only yeah two weeks at top bro let me put my cheek let me put my cheek to your chest man warm my cheeks all right that's the pod a little shirt man
