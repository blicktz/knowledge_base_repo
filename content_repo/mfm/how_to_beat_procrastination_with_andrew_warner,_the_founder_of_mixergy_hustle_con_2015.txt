How many of you guys are getting the Apple Watch? Yeah, it just went on sale today and all over San Francisco developers are sitting around thinking about how do we send them more messages on another device and get them back into our apps and that's fantastic for them but every one of these little alerts and messages is another distraction away from our personal mission our vision our goal and if we're coming to conferences like this and taking notes the way I've seen so many people do or reading books and really absorbing everything and making those connections that we need and we're still not building a business that's as big as we want it to be we're still not making the kind of progress we want to make I'm here to tell you that the problem is the distractions that we have in our lives all those distractions that are taking us away from our mission and my goal here today isn't just to tell you how to get through that isn't just to give you a superpower but to get you to use it right here in the room in the next nine and a half minutes that Sam gave me right here we're going to do it and use it and I know the problem because I felt the problem I live the problem a few years ago after having interviewed hundreds of the best entrepreneurs on the planet I sat down and I had to admit to myself that I was failing I was a failure I thought and I said why all I'm trying to do is since I've done all these interviews with entrepreneurs I want to start selling some interviews and or more importantly courses with them to my audience they're telling me my audience is I should start selling to them but why am I not even able to implement the plug-in on WordPress to get started right you know the problem right they're so easy but sometimes they don't work but worse than that why am I not starting to actually make some sales to people before I even get a plug-in why am I holding back what's the problem and when I finally got real with myself what I realized is that I had some problem and many problems that some of you guys might identify with I was sitting down and then email called me away and I had to go handle email you know what I'm talking about or my IM would go off or my cell phone would buzz all these distractions taking us away from our mission but I had worse distractions than that those are external distractions tell me if you can identify with this I had internal distractions that were way worse because I would sit down and you know how Sam told you that I had a business that did over 30 million in sales I thought well this next thing even if I install a simple plug-in it's not gonna do 30 million after install the plug-in maybe guys like Sam are gonna see it and they're gonna think Andrew's really gone down right he took a big step down so that was in my head I also thought well people pay to go to conferences but no one pays for content online by the way that's a lie of course they do Linda one of my first interviewees sold her company lynda.com for 1.5 billion right people pay for content she was able to generate revenue but that's a lie that was distracting me and then I thought well you know what my friend has millions of dollars in sales he has thousands of people who are members of a site paying them every single month I can't compete with that I can't do that by the way another lie it's not something I wanted to do from day one I just wanted to prove that people wanted to buy my stuff I just wanted to prove that I was doing quality work that people cared enough about to buy it I just wanted to get started I didn't need to build a multi-million dollar company right away but all those thoughts all those lies were distractions and that's what kept me from producing that's what kept me from using these simple plugins kept me from selling kept me from doing what I wanted to do and use all the knowledge that I worked so hard to get and the experience too so I finally said to myself if my head is just focused on all those freaking lies and that's what's keeping me from moving where is the truth what's the truth that I should be focused on and the truth was I didn't need thousands of members right away I just needed 200 members 200 people to say Andrew I like your work enough to pay you for it Andrew I'm gonna be here a member of your community for the next few months all I need is 200 and the truth was that my customers my audience was telling me charge us we they wanted to support us but I wasn't listening right the problem was I had all these truths that I wanted how big I wanted to build my business and instead of focused on that being focused on them and going towards my mission I kept getting distracted by email and getting distracted by the junk in my head so I finally just sat down and I said what is true for me and it's what's true is I want to build a legacy business and only ideas will do it the way that I want it not software and people will pay for it if I do a good job with it the truth is I wanted 200 members the truth is my audience loves my work I want to do more and so I picked one of those and I said I'm gonna focus on one 200 instead of walking into into work every day thinking how someone else was doing better I would walk in thinking 200 in fact you guys see I'm wearing some of these beads I'll explain them in a moment I'll just walk in I use these all over the world people have them so when I was on a trip somewhere I bought a set and I started to use them I would say 200 and I'd move that big fat bead right there the one with the knot and then I'd say 200 yeah I could do 200 then I move the next one the 200 if I get 200 I could get started and I could start really paying money for advertising 200 yeah right and I just say 200 200 200 and within a few weeks first of all I started actually implement what I needed to do I installed a plug-in but I got 200 members and they were all paying month after month after month and they loved the work and then soon after that I got over 200 new members every single month and the thing started really take off and today there's a whole organization there at mixer G that helps me do my interviews and create my courses and there's a community of people who are there who are members to listen to it because I focus not on the junkie email but on the mission and what I wanted and what I knew was possible 200 do you ever find yourself getting distracted from your mission I want to show you how to get back into it there's something called in cognitive psychology called target fixation I never understood it until my brother took motorcycle safety lessons when he got his bike he said look watch these videos they gave us in class everyone's gonna crash I said Michael you're getting a bike why do you need to know this and he said look at that and sure enough just before the crash all of them did this two things you could almost see that their attention was going over towards the wall you could almost see them saying don't hit the wall and then they would ride and hit the wall right it was target fixation you whatever you fixate on whatever target you fixate on is what you're gonna hit and so when I was fixated on the target of email and when I was fixated on the target of my friend doing better I was hitting walls but once I decided I was gonna fixate on my own target things started actually happened towards it so that's me my goal here isn't to tell you my story and to have you guys just here and learn what works for me I want you guys to try it with me and so we I went to a factory in China I called them up and I got 500 beads just like this to pass out and the team here is going to be handing them out right now I want to make sure all of you guys get it we're going to try the exercise right here together and I want you to have something that you can take with you when you go home because I've gone to conferences learn something good written it down said I promise I'm going to use it and I never used it and while they're passing it out I'd love to get a couple of people up here to help out Cory do you want do you guys want to help do you want to come up here the idea is this we're gonna have our word just like mine was 200 we're all going to share the same word and then we're going to start with this big do you guys see that big fat bead it's called the guru bead the one that has an out not on it we're gonna start by putting our thumb and index finger on that and we're gonna touch it and move it and then we're gonna use our index finger to touch the next one and the next one until we touch every single one of them and this holds you accountable it's so easy to say you know what I got it and do it one time and then get sucked right back into your rut which is I've got to answer email I've got to do this other thing no we're gonna focus on what we want not what other people are telling us to focus on not on those distracting lies in our in our minds I call it true mind because I'm gonna find something that's true useful and wanted to focus on it looks like everyone's got it right all right let's try it together for a focus exercise I'd love for us instead of using 200 that was mine I want us to use one word like a mantra together here so put your thumb and index finger on that guru bead that fat one with the knot let's hold it up or somewhere that you can see it and actually what we're gonna do is put it on your thumb and we're all gonna hold with the index finger we're gonna tap down that big one and we're gonna use and we're gonna say the word focus together ready one two three focus yeah now let's move over to the next one this is reminding us to focus one two three focus yeah next one one two three focus let's say it louder let's make sure that Sam who's in the back they're probably worried about what his next speaker is and if we're all on target let's make sure he even hears it go to the next one one two three focus yeah Sam he can hear us he's saying good now let's try it now internally I wasn't walking around on the subway on my way to work on 200 200 200 right I just mentally going in saying yeah I could do 200 I'll do it so why don't we try it all together but privately quietly try to do a full round and as you say it remember to bring back your focus focus is so important there's there's a story about how Warren Buffett and Bill Gates met at dinner for the first time and Bill Gates mom was there and she asked everyone around the table what's the most if you could sum up what got you here in one word what what word would you use to sum it up and Warren Buffett and Bill Gates both used the same word which was focused they're just so focused right and we're gonna get back into focus here together so why don't we start with the guru beat and we'll do it again just mentally think of the word you know what actually let's stand up and do it we shouldn't have to sit down the whole time let's stand up you could keep it anywhere by you how do you guys feel about it good Jack your product guys is clear enough am I doing a good job explaining how to do it all right right you guys all see him on product hunt with with one eye out and a tongue out yeah that's the look all right so let's try it let's start with the first one just think focus to yourself as you move that first one and go to the next one we're gonna touch each one of these make sure to keep thinking about focus if your mind starts to wander don't worry about it because your fingers are gonna move over to the next beat and your mind will remember hey I've got to bring it back to what I'm doing here the word focus the next beat hold yourself the way you would when you're really focused so you want to feel it as you're saying the word as you're thinking the word feel focused and reconnect and when you've got them all just grab a seat so focus is a good word to keep coming back to and I wanted one that we'd all have together but as you're trying this yourselves now that you've got this come up with a word or really short phrase that has more significance to you personally that's much more connected with your personal mission that's much more about what you want to do and use that word and as you're walking around and you're tempted to just check your phone for one more time I love it or check your Apple Watch which mine is coming in a few days I'm got nothing against it but spend some time just bringing yourself back to what you want to your own personal mission everyone else is coming in a few days I'm going to be a lot of I'm going to be a lot of fun to be a lot of fun so that's what I'm going to be a lot of fun you're not going to be a lot of fun and you're ... this is a lot of fun and you're not going to be a lot of fun and you're personal mission everyone else is going to get you distracted this these true mind-bead are going to bring you back to what's true for you I could do 200 what could you do I truly wanted to do 200 what could you what do you truly want to do keep bringing back to that all right thank you guys for all try for trying it I'd love to hear how this all works out for you i'm going to be here to say hello and let's give them a big round of applause for jumping up here thank you for trying it.
