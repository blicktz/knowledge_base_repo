on average a million streams is around four thousand dollars usd on spotify on spotify and we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now across our catalog things are just pretty crazy and i don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music you hear there's no money in streaming but i'm like that's because labels own 80 of your songs but if you own your songs there's a ton of money in streaming okay welcome first um so i don't know what the real intro of this is going to be but i i wanted to introduce this to you guys uh sam had put this on the calendar like hey we're recording with connor and uh brianna and i think he knows you guys in person or in real life or whatever and he kind of loosely said i was he said something like oh i was like is that the rapper kind of music person and then when i was doing the prep for this i was like oh it's these these people oh my god i love i love your stuff i am so excited for this uh as you can probably tell because i'm screaming but i'm so excited for this because i think what you do is literally amazing i think it is so smart and i think it is so impressive what you've done um you know we've had the chance to talk to mr beast on this podcast and we've talked to us in minhaj in the comedy world we've talked to some cody co on the youtube side who you kind of look like i think you know that um but i do i gotta say i think you are playing tick tock like a fiddle i think you have figured out like the thing every platform that comes out there's like there's like the people that like kind of come from the old world onto that and just kind of try to do the same thing but maybe shorter or faster or video or whatever um and then there's people who figure out that medium for what it is and i think you figured out how to do music on tick tock like nobody else um i don't know if you're a marketing genius or if you fell into that but either way it's working and therefore i am so excited to have this conversation because last night you could tell i'm kind of tired because i was binging your content and i was just so inspired i was so inspired i don't do anything in the music world i bet 99 of the listeners don't do anything in the music world but i was so inspired just by what you were doing so that's my intro of just uh fanboy because i can't believe how good you guys are what you do that was the nicest intro ever well thank you so much yeah no as far as the marketing stuff goes that's all brianna um which is why it's so fun to be able to do this conversation with her um because we we do everything together uh but so so many of my ideas that have gone viral are her ideas so let's give people a little context and we can either explain it or i do think it would be better to literally just show it so i'm gonna i love the show method so i have a bunch that i liked um dude you know how much i like this i was last night so i'm doing this on my laptop and i'm not logged into tick tock and i kept hitting the like button and like you know i was like trying to like it and it's like create an account and i almost created a second account just to give you the like because i was so i felt like you deserved it uh like oh thank you you don't you feel like someone earned it that's that's how i felt i love it play a video play one of the videos yo yo what is he doing oh yeah so he was telling me that if you uh if you cut a carrot a certain way you can play it like a flute he really thinks that's gonna work apparently it's a thing just ignore him ready uh yeah do me a favor pull up that pull up that one session yeah look they said that i couldn't do it so i went and did it w's only you know i've been winning top of the world the globe is spinning spinning if you know you know i've been on a what mission mission go okay let's get it got a little time on my hands like a wristwatch i don't got time for the brakes and a pit stop race through the gridlock take it like chris rock right to the chin still win heavy metals like slipknot got the driving i got tunnel vision i just hit my stride the way i run the business i've been making paper like i'm done to miffle see the end game i got one division look i don't ever bother with a critic hit him with a chronic color critic boom so you create these these little like um opening skits and you you don't hit them like okay traditional way of doing things somebody wants to be a musician they're going to fire up tick tock and they're going to just play their song maybe they play their song with a music video already baked in and if me if it's me and i'm just hearing the opening of a song it's usually pretty slow there's a little bit of a build up um you know just like the just a little bit of instrumental playing at the beginning or they might say hey i'm sean this is my new track give it a listen right kind of boring sort of begging for attention whereas you have these little opening skits that gets you curious of what's going to happen you're playing all these characters like you know eddie murphy in uh whatever that movie was you're tyler perry and you're playing all the characters and then then you hit them with a track that's actually like surprisingly good for how simple the intro is i don't know how how to explain it but this is how you got famous for doing this stuff on tick tock sure yeah no so i make music um specifically in the kind of hip-hop rap world a little bit of pop sometimes but yeah so the whole goal with these videos is to not make it seem like you're selling someone especially on tick tock the moment you feel like someone's like hey check out my song you're gonna swipe away so you have to provide entertainment first and we have found the best way to do that is through skits and it was really easy because connor's been acting since he was six years old so it was the perfect way to kind of merge those two worlds and it it worked yeah i saw you were in a bunch of like good luck chuck like a bunch of a bunch of movies i started acting when i was six in toronto where i grew up started with commercials when i was 10 i did a movie called cinderella man i played the son of russell crowe in that film and that was kind of the first huge project i was ever a part of first time i went to la for the premiere signed with the u.s agent and so from a kid i've just been doing tv and film my whole life and then when covet hit and production shut down i was like what do we do um i was working at alpha paw at the time the pet company um i left that job and then i was like okay connor's really good at rapping he's he's loved hip-hop for so many years why don't we try marketing that and he didn't want to because he thought tick tock was kind of lame like it was in the era where people just did those little dances so yeah i took some youtube videos he had filmed turned them into vertical pieces of content he's like i'm a thespian i'm not gonna be on tick tock i'm an actor i'm i'm i was naive i make films my biggest regret is not starting sooner on like social media specifically i'd always been anti that once he saw a video go viral and then it translate to streams the next day he's like okay maybe we can do that changed everything yeah every every time yeah let's pause for a sec yeah we got to say the background here because people said alpha paul so basically i i'm friends with ramon who then became me sean ramon are all buddies ramon is on episode two or three or four sean talks to him he had a pet episode two he had a soap opera company and then a pet company i remember ramon bought this pet business that seemed outlandish at the time turned into a successful business i went to vegas to hang out with them i think i was there regardless and i just went to hang out to the office brianna was his right-hand woman running marketing and everything else at the company i go to this brand new office that he has and ramon's like uh connor is brianna's wife she he's actually just gonna help us move he's uh trying to make it by the way or he's trying to make it in a movie that you showed up like uh high on drugs because you were afraid of flying so you're like you're like doped up i hated flying and i took up i took too much medicine and i got to i like i was still figuring out the dosage and i got to the office i was like i gotta go to sleep so i was like all messed up i was like i'm sorry guys i'm like intoxicated but i met i remember meeting yeah yeah he was moving boxes like you were because you were an actor and you're in between and you're just moving and then like months later he ramon was like hey remember brianna's wife or husband she uh he's like trying to actually become a rapper and he's actually good and i'm like the guy movie what really i don't buy it i don't buy it and then you had like some traditional rap music videos and i'm like okay he actually is quite good then uh ramon was like hey uh brianna's actually left alpha paul and she and she's gonna take over his shit and then i started seeing the tick tocks and i'm like oh my god this guy's the best and then you blew up and now it looks like you have like eight million monthly listens on your spotify yeah he ramon's telling me that you guys are independent so you like own all the music and he's like saying like dude their numbers for revenue are outlandish you can say if you want or not but like they're making a really good living now connor's going on tour he's with hoodie allen he's in europe he's selling out shows in europe and now you're like legit famous he looks like your top song spin in has 105 million downloads the other one has 74 million like you guys are killing it and i knew you just as this nice guy who was moving boxes and this was only i think this was three years ago this wasn't long ago maybe you know what the first time we met was at a comedy show five years ago in 2018. do you remember that it was like a chris delia show and then yeah you came to the office i think you and i were like butting heads that day and then ramon's like oh he's just on drugs and i'm like okay that makes sense yeah what ramon told me yeah voice message to me last night he's like yeah same sam came to the office but he was like you know a little bit like doped up from the the flight and he goes you know sam normally asks like pretty direct questions like add drugs oh sam was getting behind everyone's laptops like what are you working on why are you doing it working on and i'm like i don't remember that i don't remember that i'm sorry you're making my team nervous as hell and brianna you don't know this but uh i also saw your work before we ever met because you were behind a lot of the ads so alpha pause scaled like crazy so ramon bought this business that's a dog ramp business initially so it was literally like it was called sausage dog oh that's right wow which is also what they used to call my dorm in college but but then so so well played so then um it's like little dogs use the ramp to get up on the bed or on the couch or down from the couch i have four of them in my house because i got a little dog and i also know ramon so he sent me four four free ramps so there was uh so these ranch are great but i was like how do you sell these like are people looking for these he's like no most people don't even realize they want it so we got to like make ads that teach them that they want it and i was just getting into e-com i had i was ramones the reason i started an e-com brand because i was was sitting at his house hearing the shopify ching ching on his phone i was like dude i want that noise in my life how do you do that so i decided to start one and he to help me he goes he's like here um i added you to my ads account which is like basically like adding you as a co-signer on a bank account basically nobody gives their facebook ad account to somebody else but that's very intimate ramona is that kind of guy that kind of friend and so i'm in the ad account and i'm looking at all your ads that you created because you had all these video ads that were working to sell p pads and ramps and all this stuff and i was like damn i need somebody who's good at creating ads and i think was is it right that you were just kind of like at that warehouse or you just like come up with the concept yourself and figure out like test them is that kind of where you got this like quick video production you and your sister it was mainly myself and catherine do you remember catherine um catherine and i ran the marketing and then my little sister would help me but basically we would just try and like either pull at someone's heartstrings like we would start a video with maybe an injured dog and then instantly a person that has an injured dog can relate to that and they're like oh like and then we show the solution and then a cute little dog we literally bought a chihuahua she's upstairs just to use like for marketing ads and we would show her trying to jump up on the couch and instantly everyone that has a chihuahua is like oh my dog does the same thing boom here's a solution and it just freaking worked it was wild like i've i couldn't believe it we went from an office as big as a bathroom to like a 20 000 square foot warehouse within a year yeah i was i was doing a lot of moving connor was moving a lot connor would help film he would help edit the ads yeah it was a family production and then all the high performing ads we filmed in either our living room or chloe's living room yeah in our house and then when i was like okay i really want to do my own thing we want to start a family i need to leave this pet company it broke my heart because ramones my best friend but i had to ultimately leave and i was trying to start other companies i'm like what can i start i started like a coffee brand a like a christian brand and then our friend cliff weitzman he's the ceo of speechify oh we know i believe you know i love cliff he says hello i was talking to him this morning i said i was going to be on him yeah cliff was over for dinner and i was just venting my frustrations of product boredom and he's like brie stop like this is your product he's like chris jenner the out of him so the next day i stopped i had a huge order an inventory of coffee and i let it go to waste and i'm like we're going all in on this and i pretty much just used the same mindset i used to sell the dog ramps to sell his music it's like how can we hook someone in and how can we tell a story around this song because a lot of music these days is just like a really cool beat and like some generic lyrics right but i'm like there's a lack of storytelling and i think that's what music online is missing and we did it so and we're doing it independently so so you can see it because as i was doing my my binge i can't even call it research i was just uh enjoying myself going down i did the tour de france down your profile the first video actually on your youtube channel is pretty dope i don't know sam have you seen the very first video that they the first song that he posted is that is that the one where you rap about how you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what is it called the s word or what what did you what you call it it's just s just the letter s yeah um so you rap about how you used to have a stutter and then yeah in the song you're basically every like a bunch of the words start with s and uh by the way you sent me down a watsky rabbit hole too last night like we love huge huge inspiration for that i'd never heard of him he's dope um so anyways the that's the first song and it's like okay this person clearly has talent but also it's like i don't know not different yeah it's never been easier to go on i don't know fruit loops and make a beat and and and then try to try to rap and like do 15 seconds of a good rap like that's i guess never been easier would you say like it's kind of more competitive than ever to do that part totally totally i mean there's what 60 000 songs uploaded every day more i think the data is closer to 100 now but roughly i'd say to be safe 60 000 songs uploaded every day yeah the the the ease of being able to make music now especially in the hip-hop space with with um programs like fruity loops where you can find samples royalty free samples yeah um it's yeah a lot of people are making music way more efficiently than ever you can see like kind of the progression like okay you're getting some views you're putting out some good tracks but like there was a i could almost draw a line and be like then they figured out how to create like hooks for these videos yeah it was the presentation that was how to present that different after that is that when you joined uh brianna like is that kind of when you chris jennered the out of him yeah that's when i really stopped trying to do a million things and focus just on him and the biggest moment for us was creating a series that's when we started the spin the globe series where he would spin a globe and land on a country and collab with an artist that took us from like here to like yeah that took off like crazy that that's that first video that we did where we landed on zambia and found the zambian artist that that video has 72 million views on tick tock and 72 million views on youtube shorts so explain that video yes yeah so it was an idea where i had this song with this artist named killa who's this independent artist from zambia when we first worked with him he had less than a thousand monthly listeners he had 189 monthly list and now he's over a million because that song which is incredible wow and it's like changed changed his life um but essentially we were like all right how can we market this and i was like all right we need a strong hook in the first two to three seconds let me play it i want you to break it down sure no please do yeah yeah all right i'm gonna spin this globe and wherever my finger lands i'm gonna find an artist from that country to collaborate with me on a song and see what happens zambia all right well let's find out more about zambia i started researching some up-and-coming artists and one guy really stood out to me his name is killa he's a rapper from lusaka which is the capital of zambia i felt like his style and his voice would sound perfect on the song i'm working on so i reached out to him i sent him the beat and then a few days later he sent me back this down for but the only thing that i'll be down for is being top five but like down four i'm down to earth like the ground floor but i've been flying so long i tend to ask people what's the ground for man i'm only headed up see my flow volcanic it's the fire i erupt heard the fans getting rowdy because they haven't had enough you know i'm running the city you're just running out of luck yeah i said that with my chest so that whole thing five seconds there like the speed that you hit them with that initial hook of like you're already started you're like mid-word you're like all right i'm gonna spin this globe now you're doing something interesting visually and and then you set up the premise the stakes of like wherever my finger lands i'm gonna find an artist and do a song with them which okay i've never heard of that before so where does this idea come from and like how much time did you put into that first getting that first five seconds to be good i was literally at the gym with connor's mom and i thought of it and i texted him i said i'm start i'm stopping at target we're grabbing a globe here's the idea and his mom parked the car i ran and got it was like 19 bucks and to be honest at the time we didn't realize it would blow up and we posted on a sunday and it got three million views the same day and i'm like oh okay this is a series we have to do this again and instantly i went on my phone i'm like what country's next and i searched hashtag dutch rap because i really wanted a dutch artist i think that language is so beautiful and i found this guy named ben's then we did episode two two weeks later and boom that's spinning and it that's the song that now has over 100 million streams on spotify in less than nine months that's so insane that's it is insane yeah so that first one that that you were just playing um it really was just like okay how do we make content around the song what's the contentable moment and what's something visual what's something visual we can do right so for spinning like the the other one you played with the carrot flute it was that idea of like all right this flute is such a strong element of the song i remember watching a video back in the day where someone made no no no no christian our brother-in-law was making a carrot flute at christmas and we're like you're an idiot what are you doing and it actually ended up working and i'm like what if we bring that into the video right and then that's what made the song now people like call him like the carrot flute guy and i'm like what so for this one the contentsable moment for us was like all right we have this artist myself from canada we have this other artist from zambia a country that most people don't even know where it is on the map so you you you actually you actually knew the artist you had the artist idea first you're like how do we tell the story of that almost in reverse engineer the story correct for this one we had the song first for every other one we were like we had no idea this was going to blow up all our content that had performed well at this point was skits and every time we posted a non-skit it never did as well so we really were just like let's see what happens i was very much inspired by like content creators like um mr beast yeah as you can tell from like the whole editing style and i i edit all my tick tocks and so like the one word at a time i love how in videos it it starts the first frame you hear all right guys today we're gonna blah blah blah he just gets into it right away and so i was inspired by that hence uh this intro so yeah the first one we had the relationship with the zambian artist first but after the first episode it was very organic and we found the artists like literally two days before the song was recorded and why do you think this video popped off like that i think the hook is really strong i'm going to spin this globe wherever my finger lands it's like all right what's about to happen is he going to go there um immediately you're interested where he's going to land right and it's it's visual you see a spinning globe now now you're going to stick around and see all right let's see where it lands i land on a country like zambia something most people haven't heard of and i say i'm going to collaborate with an artist now there's another hook of oh what's this guy going to look like what's he going to sound like what's the song going to sound like and then they stick around to the end even going to be good right totally and how many times did you have to spin that globe to land on zambia oh gosh i couldn't even tell you way too many times yeah that's another good tick tock like uh behind the scenes but yeah every every couple seconds like every four to five seconds there's just something new there's like a new like if you're thinking of leaving you're like okay wait maybe i'll stay i'm thinking of leaving oh wait i want to see him oh he's about to start i'll stay like there's even with the carrot flute video you'll notice every time there's like a dull moment we have of the drill right and it's like oh i'm staying like the weird brother pops in and like surprises it's like every kind of like every two or three seconds almost like the attention is about to lapse open up a new curiosity we even we even do that with the music creation so if connor's writing a verse and the flow is the same for too long i'll be like that's not contentable i need you to switch your flow up faster so that there can be a new moment where the beat drops and the producer goes yeah like yeah when once we started seeing how well the content was doing for the music i started approaching my my creative process with writing the music thinking about what the content would be and a lot of times the content would come first so i would think you know that whole carrot flute video did so well and then we started thinking what other weird instruments could we use and then we would think of a weird instrument like a xylophone and then we made a xylophone beat oh or one we wanted to do one where the fire alarm goes off mid recording session but he's like wait stay that sounds sick and then they bring out the b-pad and make a song we wrap over a fire alarm yeah yeah so a lot of times we would think of the content first and then make the song was there like a revenue number in mind that you guys need to have in order to make this a full-time job yeah my my dream was like i want to make ten thousand dollars a month from this i'm like if we can make ten thousand dollars a month i'll be like the happiest person in the world and i don't know if i don't know if you guys know how it works but it's roughly there's a lot of variables but on average a million streams is around four thousand dollars usd on spotify on spotify and we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now across our catalog things are just pretty crazy and i don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music you hear there's no money in streaming but i'm like that's because labels own 80 of your songs but if you own your songs there's a ton of money in streaming and i kind of want to just bring awareness to that yeah well what was like the all right so you guys were just doing your thing and then there was that that pop moment what was the first month of sales on the pop like when it when it when the when the first video really worked out there's a three month delay in accounting so whatever you get from like january february march you get it in april and i remember that pop moment got us our first six figure month yeah and we lost our minds what were you making per month before that like uh was it like kind of under ten that under a thousand dollars to over a hundred thousand yeah yeah yeah no that globe series really like if i showed you the chart of my spotify for artists you see my daily streams were here and then it just explodes like way up what's really cool is that a lot of people have a big moment and then they slow down they get comfortable but the second we had that big moment i'm like we're pulling all-nighters we're going harder than we've ever gone so you can see the chart it goes up and it stays up which is like the beauty of it because we didn't stop like i literally remember our baby was sleeping he was four months old during the globe series and we would take turns pulling all-nighters connor would be editing the videos go in give him a bottle keep editing it was crazy we were on crack i don't think we would i don't know how we did it but last night when i was watching all the videos i thought connor is a genius and then now i realize that brianna's a genius actually and um and actually you could just go get a drink of water i just have a thousand questions for this is so uh amazing so you really did christian i'm curious just from relationship point of view uh when did how did y'all meet and when did you meet and like at the time was it like i'm gonna be a rapper and you're like you got it honey keep go for it no we were 10 and 11 years old we lived in the same apartment complex um yeah when i was telling you earlier when i did that movie cinderella man that so the the first time i went to la for that premiere uh after that i started staying in la for a few months every year for auditions and stuff like that and we would stay at this this apartment complex called the oakwoods apartment um which was kind of infamous for having like a lot of child actors stay there and brianna's little sister chloe used to act and so her family and my family lived at that apartment complex at the same time and i was 10 and she was 11 and that's that's when we first met yeah and we stayed friends we swapped aim addresses and then like it's just a cool story because you were supporting him i imagine i'm i don't know what the life of an actor is like but you're yeah you you were you were supporting him and then you know now you guys are a team honestly it's like flip-flopped because his acting was much more lucrative than you think like when we first got married he was on a series called x company he did three seasons of that and he was a lead on that and it does pay quite well i don't know if i'm like contractually even allowed to say so i won't but at the time he was more supporting me and then i uh was working and i did i was a nanny at the time so i wasn't like bringing in like huge amounts of money and then i did the pet company stuff and during that time he wasn't working so then i was supporting him yeah and now we've come to this like even ground we're working together and supporting each other and our family my sister my brother-in-law my little brother everyone quit their jobs and they're all working on our team so it really just is a family operation we go to coffee shops every day they help us edit they help us like manage the house they're watching our baby right now so we could do this my brother-in-law christian mixes and masters all the music he produces a lot of it that whole carrot flute he played that on the recorder um so yeah we we keep it all in the family we all swap who supports who and i knew i'm like one day there's going to be a point where we can all just support each other with this like big thing but i don't know what's going to be i wasn't expecting it to be connor rapping music we had a guy on the pod a long time ago you might know him his name is mike brown and it's one of the earlier episodes and i forgot what he was doing exactly it was some like mineral oil exploration so he would go he would basically knock on people's houses and be like hey did you know there's like some minerals under the ground that you live in um and if you sign this paper that says like cool um you have the rights to like get that get those minerals out dig those minerals out or whatever mine them um you can get paid this amount of money today up front you can get this amount of money today and if he got like if there was a hundred houses he needed all 100 to sign and if he got that then he could sell that that bundle of of letters saying yep you have the rights to a company that actually does the mining and he was making millions of dollars doing this in texas and um he was like yeah i was doing this and i was like that doesn't sound like it takes a lot of people he's like no it was just me and then my he's like i brought on my two brothers and i was like oh what's that like working with family because like you know you hear different things this is before i started a business with my wife and i was like you know what's that like and he's like uh he just looked at me like i was stupid and he was like what do you mean so it's the best and i go oh i mean i guess you guys get along or work so he's like no of course you know it's not all perfect but he's like my theory of life is you find the people that you love and then you do life with them and that just like has been ringing in my ears for like three years now it's like find people you love and then do life with them find excuses to do things with them whether it's work vacation or learning something together or joining us you know learning a sport together whatever it is um would you say that's accurate for for you guys or do you guys have anything that maybe will ring in my ears for another three years about this i'd say i'd say it's accurate but there definitely are like we have to plan date nights or else we will never spend time together as a married couple we turn into just business partners for a while and that's it or like for example we'll get in an argument as married couples do but then we have a podcast interview the next morning or a video to shoot so we have to put aside our pride of like who's right or wrong to make the work come first or my siblings if they get in a fight i just had this talk with them last week i'm like you guys are messing up my ecosystem we have like a family ecosystem right now if you fight with you then now connor can't mix his music with him and then if he's so everyone just freaking get along so sometimes i have to like be that person that's like stop fighting because business you're up the juju yeah literally and then i'm like there's a point where we're gonna sell everything make a ton of money and then we can all live on a farm and fight all we want but for now freaking get along i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better and you just did a so like the way that this is transferring to like actual wealth and money and everything is the spotify you get paid off that i don't know if you can get paid off tick tock or not but you just did a tour as well so you you and hoodie allen did like a i think what did you say two or three weeks it was three weeks in europe yeah i was opening for him i actually wrote down our revenue streams just because i didn't want to forget i'd say by all means go for it yeah yeah it's like sam's gonna ask about revenue streams i better be prepped we have streaming as the number one by far we have youtube money youtube actually pays quite well in in regards to social media platforms youtube is like the platform yeah i'll just say this really quick because this is kind of cool so i found out that in the so i i was pretty late to youtube shorts i watched a mr beast podcast where he was talking about you know youtube shorts being the future i was like all right let me just try this and what i did was i took all my popular tick tocks and because i edit them i have them all my computer saved and i just repurposed them on shorts and you know without the uh tick tock watermark or anything i took the original you know and just reposted and youtube emailed us and they're like you were the most subscribed to artist in november yeah of all artists in the month of november yeah they said i was just reply damn right send i said is there like a plaque for that or something yeah so i got 800 000 subscribers in one month just just from posting every day for a full month all my popular videos including the globe stuff i heard something funny by the way i don't know if this is true or not it might be a conspiracy theory but somebody was saying like uh obviously this part was i think showed to be true which is if you just re-upload your tick tocks with the watermark uh like instagram and youtube i think we're deprioritizing they don't like it but so the original file is good but actually they also scraped the metadata the name the file name i don't know if you guys are is this true or are you guys aware of this if if you have the same like mp4 file name underneath they also are trying to match that to just see like oh we should start changing somebody told me that i don't know if that's true or not it could it could be possible i don't care like that globe video we didn't change anything which is kind of weird that they both they both have exactly 72 million views on both platforms and i i posted them months apart because like i said i was late to shorts um so now because of youtube that's an extra five figure so yeah so that's that's why i brought that up was i which one grows faster youtube shorts or tick tock what do you where do you which horse do you see winning it's tough because the tick tock algorithm changes so much but i think right now we're more excited about youtube because youtube lets you pin a comment and a link to stream the song but tick tock doesn't they removed the pinned comment feature so it's harder to convert tick tock views to streams right now i had a call with tick tock and i said bring that back so hopefully they bring it back and even more interestingly enough on tick tock there so maybe my manager right this is amazing youtube is much more creator friendly uh as far as you know when you want to promote something like that that video um that first globe video that i post on youtube i was able to make the pin comment the streaming link for the song yeah and that comment has like 40 000 upvotes and so it definitely allowed people to get to the streaming way easier than tick tock tick tock at this point too even if you try to write the word link in bio or even spotify they'll hide the comment and we've tested this i've written that i've posted that comment under my own video logged into a different account to go there and the comments gone and so they don't want to encourage anybody off the app obviously so business but finish this out uh so it's spotify it's youtube then brand deals okay recently like the last couple you can negotiate like six figures high six figures depending on the ask i'm sure we could get even higher but like in our current state current followers it's like six figure deals syncs which is like getting your songs and commercials or tv video games video games all that stuff um publishing um can you explain publishing real quick in like two sentences it's hard to explain two sentences but yeah pretty much like a song has two parts to it there's like the master which is um um also called the sound recording which is what the uh streams are yeah what the streaming royalties are and then there's the publishing side which is like the writers the songwriters um and so the publishing um you get paid for like performance rights so if it gets played on the radio if someone wants to cover your song and use your lyrics so so it's sort of like a different part of the pie that's so pub and then merch and then live shows so those are like our one two three four five six like seven streams of revenue and people don't know this like are you negotiating all this i mean that's very impressive if you're the one also doing the the publishing stuff and commercials and things like that i mean that's i was up until like three months ago for the sinks i still am like if he needs to get his stuff in a tv show or movie or a game i'm still doing that but for brand deals we brought on a brand agent team because i just don't have the bandwidth i was like losing my mind because being a mom comes first and if judah's sick or having a tough day and things are due i'm like i need someone else to take this so we do have a brand agent negotiating the brand deals um but everything else is us and so you um you have these uh revenue streams most of the time i've heard that touring is like number one for a lot of artists you put it at the bottom we were just talking about this on a walk last night i'm like how are we going to talk about touring because it's just not i don't like to speak confidently on anything we've never done ourselves yeah um of course if you're at like drake taylor swift level blah blah you're bringing in hundreds and millions of dollars but just for context we opened on the european tour and i had a chart of the money i'm pretty sure we just broke even on that one just because you have to like rent a bus you have to pay a tour manager you have to pay for everyone's travel your dj merch look like the list is i think about that because it's obviously a lot of effort you got a little baby at home um you could you probably reduce your output on tick tock because you're touring because it takes up so much time you're breaking even but there's the fan love and you're like okay this means something and like that matters um and you know i think most artists just give you the politically correct like oh i do everything for my fans and blah blah blah but like there's a reality there's just trade-offs to everything me and sam experienced this and i'm super small level with the podcast where we did a couple live shows they're fun but they're a lot of work you don't make any money off of it and it's kind of like well that was just one episode like we could have just done so much more in that same amount of time so we kind of and we both sam doesn't like to travel and i got little babies at home so i'm not i'm not looking to travel either so we kind of don't do it that much how do you guys measure that uh think about that trade-off of like the live fan experience which is create super fans but you lose all this other stuff we found a really good medium for this we met in the middle connor's booking agent i totally forgot to mention her earlier which is ridiculous because she's iconic uh connor's booking agent her name is kara lewis she also repped like eminem and a bunch of other really awesome artists um and i've talked to her about it she likes yeah oh my god yeah young gravy who else she's got it she had travis got at one point she's got ice spice right now she's literally the best there's an article about her like and it's called like the most terrifying woman in music i'm like i want that to be me like that's me next anyways so we've come to a conclusion with her that right now while jude is in these early stages of life and we're really just trying to build build build we'll do pop-up shows so for example we're doing a pop-up show in chicago in november and then we're going to do a pop-up show in toronto his hometown a few days later and then he'll accept like festivals like uh like a month ago he went to calgary for a rodeo and he did a festival where they offer you a certain amount of money and you play for 45 minutes i'm like easy right he's gone for two nights so we're gonna do that and then just keep doing pop-up shows to have fan love and like connect with the audience because it is really magical to hear people sing his songs back to him in person yeah but the tick tock experience is good too though because the thing about digital stuff is i see it and even though i see a hundred thousand likes or tens of millions of views on it i'm like i i don't know who else knows this and then i saw the video of you in europe and you do really cool tic tacs of you like before the show and then during the show and i'm like holy this guy this is a movement you know this is actually uh it's it's sort of like when casper and all these companies that like when digital companies started advertising and buying billboards in the uh subways and shit like that you're like oh it's actually adds value to see it in real life as opposed to just on my phone even as a digital viewer you know what i mean totally that's a great comparison yeah yeah so for us right now shows aren't like live shows like a festival is a money thing it is a revenue stream because he gets paid for like 45 minutes but the concept of touring for us it wouldn't be lucrative enough at this stage for us to invest the time energy funds blah blah blah into it but when he does do shows it's purely fans i know a lot of artists will like charge for vip meet and greets i'm like why am i charging a fan to say hi to you they're the reason we have a career no like he'll stand outside and talk to absolutely everybody there for free he'll go to the merch tables sign merch the venues will try and even like fee us for that they're like if he's at the merch table there's gonna be a fee like that's so silly but anyways when we do do live shows it's gonna be completely just for the fans and not a revenue stream how big of a venue can you sell out right now you think we've honestly never tested that because we've never done a headlining solo show but i'll get back to you in a few weeks when we what's your guess you can guess our our hope is somewhere between 900 and a thousand those are like the oh dude you're gonna crush that well hey you know here's the thing so i mean technically you could like who knows you could sell out a 5 000 venue like you never know but in the touring world you have to like build a proof of purchase first so like you can't just go from zero to booking a massive venue you have to start at this venue and then your booking agent can negotiate this venue and then this because you have to like show them hey he sold x many tickets here so now your venue should take him because you have to negotiate with like the the promoters and the club owners and so it's hard to say like touring's a tough topic because one we're not versed in it enough and two it's too complicated of a business to be like i can go from here to here you have to build it's not as much like tick tock where we can go viral overnight and your life changes yeah it's true sorry if that's a lame answer but it's just so mike posner went to my high school my college when i was there and we were all like this is a guy in the other building that's trying to become a rapper like what is he talking about and um that he did so that was kind of amazing um and one of the things he did when he kind of came back so he like had his high like the traditional way and then he kind of hit a low where like he wasn't making hits anymore like his first album was like whatever big and then like he kind of dipped a little bit and then he like reinvented himself and he's like i'm gonna walk across america so he started doing things that i thought were interesting because he added new layers to him new dimensions new content kind of like ideas he wasn't doing it for that reason but it worked well also and he would do these pop-up shows just in a park where he would just be like i'm just gonna start playing in this park and see what happens but like like it kind of didn't matter what happened live like some people got a magical experience that came or were there most people weren't there but he's like what does it matter if like okay let's say there's 50 people here that are having like a hundred out of 10 experience because like something over the top cool just happened and okay i don't have 900 other people here but this video looks so interesting and it makes me more interesting than the how a traditional artist does it so the content would always pop off and his brand would be kind of like the people's champion in a way that he would just do these free shows in the park rather than um rather than like how you know an artist would traditionally do things so i think you know there's something to flipping touring on its head and be like i am going to do these fan things on my own terms but i'm actually going to do them optimized for content and not filling venues because content's my game anyways if i just keep building that mountain right that's what mr beast does he's like if i just keep building this mountain on it always it like everything in this business it's like what's your goal like if your goal is to be a mega superstar and perform in arenas then yeah sign with a label and do those things and dedicate your life to building your touring resume so you can get there but that's just not our goal at least right now so we're just focusing on making as much music as possible because i i forgot who said i think it was this artist named mike stud he compared songs to real estate he's like if you can buy a piece of real estate every two weeks why wouldn't you some of them will remain shacks on the beach but some of them will be mansions in laguna so that's our mindset right now i'm like we're investing in as much real estate what is your goal what's like your what's like do you guys have like a like do you want to do this for 30 years are you trying to just get super rich i mean what's like what do you write on the whiteboard or on the fridge business business like he loves the art and we love to make good music but ultimately the goal would be to scale this like we would scale a business and then uh potentially sell the catalog someday because it can be evaluated similar to a what number what number excites you 50 million at what age three or four years from now yeah okay i'll be your advisor no charge just add a zero to that number okay because that like you guys uh 50 is you guys you're already fingertips away sean how's 100 million no no out of 500 is the number what did what did bruce springsteen get dude i think bruce springsteed got 300. you know i want to say something here that's a little bit so i've definitely uh this is probably the most i've ever like you know complimented any guest on this podcast before i'm usually even if i like him i you know i'm hard to get a little bit uh sam's usually just like saying sam usually fangirls pretty easily he's like he's like so you're hot and i just love people that are hot and like you know you're fit so like you know you're awesome and uh you know i usually keep it you know a little close to the vest but but you guys are you're the you're the creative version of hot and i think that's amazing and you're hot yeah thank you yeah yeah we'll take the physical as well the thing that i would say that's kind of an insult is when i watched you on youtube i didn't have the same fun as i did on tick tock so like i watched the full songs and i was like these are good songs but i didn't like you know i wasn't like hooked and i wasn't um like i wasn't as like i felt like the things you guys are doing on tick tock i've kind of never really seen before it felt so original and um it almost felt like a different thing than like music which is like a thing i understand and there's a bunch of like pre-established music options that i can go to i'm curious do you guys feel this uh a do you feel the same way and b like is there any part of your ego that's like no i like i want to be a traditional take me serious rapper versus like no this kind of like these tick hawk quick hooks almost like half songs that's my thing and i'm actually creating a new lane over here how do you think about it the goals are different on those platforms on tick tock our goal is to reach new listeners and youtube is more to nurture the listeners we already have um and to nurture the platform because it does pay well so more views on youtube is more money in our pocket from the adsense and stuff like that but yeah with youtube we're not approaching those long-form videos with the goal of reaching new people if that makes sense it's kind of hard to explain and then also sometimes if the videos are a bit more polished like for example he did a song with baby no money and that was a very polished music video but like that's like baby's team right they were like all right if we're gonna do a song with connor connor's got to jump into our world and do a music video i'm like great then you got to jump into our world and do a skit so yeah well the thing about your skits is like first of all like i i see a tick tock video and then i listen to you guys when i work out like i i associate it goes video first then i listen to you while i'm exercising that's our goal but i um when i see the video like you do this you have this amazing thing where you basically you're clearly an actor you have three characters you have the producer then you have you the rapper and then you've got your nerdy brother or cousin or whoever you're supposed to be the guy yeah like the guy who wears the turtleneck and i get to know the characters and you do such a good job i was telling sean i was like i forget you forget that it's you know it's connor and you do even obviously it's you don't dress up or anything just the same person you do such a good job that i'm getting to know the characters it's very much like uh the dr doolittle or whoever it was well you know tyler perry where they played the it's the same actor doing multiple characters but you're not even dressed up i get to know the characters and i like see the the weird brother come in and i'm like oh he's about to do something funny um and i get to know the the personality of the producer uh version of you it's so good you do such a good job of like adding characters that when i listen to the songs i am like i'm remembering that video and that's what makes me like it whereas if it was just the songs they are good but i the the the skits add so much meaning to it i'm like oh this is the carrot one you know what i mean so cool um and the funny thing is so like like music uh like if you listen to an album they they've always done these like skit type things in them like back when i used to have cds like kanye's you know uh college dropout album there would be these little skits but they weren't that good and like they they weren't that funny they were kind of long and like um so that concept's been around how did you guys come up with this idea to have these characters how did you come up with the idea for the characters uh like what was the inspo behind that characters was really just like we don't have anyone else like we're really like we don't really hang out with many people uh we couldn't think of anyone who could play these characters as well so i'm like kind of just freaking put on glasses and just be yeah it was just it really was just the most efficient way to do it and i i had control over the whole process because i was i film it all myself i set up my iphone film them late at night when the b it's like you can't coordinate that with other people like hey can you can you come over at 11 pm for a tick tock like no one's gonna do that so we just do it we still do a good job of getting like you have this other video uh i forget i don't even know who the rappers are like eventually i figure out oh this that's hoody allen but in the video i'm just like oh it's a the skit is like it's a late night thing the janitor has to fill in yeah and i just know the actor as the janitor not even the rapper that you see him rapping and i'm happy it's really good this is like really creative stuff we would love to our dream would be to like um almost make a not a parody but of like the office but call it the studio where we can kind of extend these characters a bit more and like go a bit deeper into them and maybe bring on a few new like if we have a episode of the studio where connor's all these characters and then the guest is like idris elba comes in and he acts on it and then we get courtney cox to come in on the next episode and we use these connections connor has from acting to now elevate his tick tock skits yeah that'd be fun and then i have another dream of like pitching spin the globe to netflix i'm like how cool would that be if it's a 45 minute episode of connor spinning the globe lands on a country then he actually flies there and we meet the artists and we see their culture and we see the music scene there like for example zambia we have to go there because it would blow your mind he couldn't send us his video because he only had 12 hours of electricity allotted like per day and he said until we get a heavy rain the government will not increase our electricity so i can't send you my video clips so we were waiting to post this episode because you don't have electricity in zambia to send these videos so i'm like i want to go there and see this and like bring awareness to it and i think that'd be so cool because you have food shows on netflix you have like zach efron changing the world everybody feeds phil everybody or somebody if you feel yeah i'm like connor should go there and do that but for music i think that'd be so sick well you there's a few there's a few like paths here i think and there's a few examples one example which i'm not relating it as an insult but weird al yankovic like i bet you i don't know this for sure but i would bet you that weird al probably out earned most every artist from the 90s i bet you he crushed it in terms of obviously it was in the cd era where it was 22 for a cd that costs 50 cents to make but i bet you weird al crushed it and then the other guy and again i'm not saying it's just because he's another white rapper but lil dicky you know he's got that awesome show dave he's done a really good job of parlaying this thing into more than just music and rapping what i wish dave did though which i was so disappointed in the songs on the track were so good and he's just now releasing them i'm like those songs should have been out because i would have dreamed it so not only are you making money from your show but you're also making money because your spotify is about to go up so that's another thing if we were to do spin the globe all the songs would be out you watch the episode and then you can instantly stream it yeah that's another part of our rollout is is we we don't promote the song until it's out some people promote the song months in advance they do pre-save campaign stuff like that what were you going to say about that sam well what i was going to say was you weird al and dave are like uh i actually think weird al is even more talented than dave but they're both like this like cut cutesy type of thing i actually don't view you that way i view you as like significantly more serious like you like you're not like i'm laughing with you never at you whereas with dave it's usually at you know what i mean but he's still done a really good job of taking these over-the-top music videos and turning them into a thing but uh i actually think that you have more potential than him for sure because uh with you you're relatable but at the same time aspirational and like you're still serious but at the same time funny i don't know i just i think that's a nice compliment but it's so hard to respond to because that this is that's just hard to respond to i don't know how else to word it but we love dave and he's little dicky's so good and i'm just saying i just admire you guys i just i think that you like you're you're gonna you're just you you both have the it factor and it's so evident and i think the reason sean said add a zero to it was because we don't know anything about music but we've hung out with a whole bunch of rich people a lot of billionaires and and like you see like some patterns in certain things and it's like oh well this is yeah like we don't know how big this is gonna be it's already big but it's gonna be significantly larger than the way it is now if you have a little bit longer of a time horizon and just keep like doing pretty good how long does it take you to create to create a video or a video with a song so what is the creative timeline for for you know one of these that you make it could be like are we talking the songs made or the song isn't made yet yeah i guess either way or like for example this uh the top video right now on your tick tock is this collab the branded collab that you did um yes with ruffles and kfc um so you did that i assume you basically had to you made something specific for that it wasn't something you already had made right correct um so how long does a process like that take you when you're going to create something from scratch or is it just some days it's one day some days it's three months it's hard to say like do you have a kind of a consistent formula for creation for songs some days it can be three hours and some days it can be weeks because he's stuck on something sure but for videos i'll script something in like 20 30 minutes and then he'll film himself for a few hours and then he'll edit for a few hours yeah on average i'm probably filming for one or two hours and then editing for one to three hours and do they all have to be full songs or do you just do like i make you know three verses and that's for this tick tock video but i'm not turning it into a full song do you ever do that no for now we only will invest time in a tick tock if it can convert to streams or else that's just not uh lucrative for us i was like my i have like brain fart but yeah uh for ruffles they only requested a 30 second demo so for that one specifically he only had to write 30 seconds of a song boom done easy but normally it's a full song needs to be done or we won't post it because tick tock doesn't pay you for views yeah but it does indirectly because uh let's say something goes viral now your fan base grows the next video you put out with a song uh you know it's gonna gonna pay like totally um you know one thing but if the song is out we can show you the charts it'll be like it's so much different if the song's out yeah but i hear what you're saying but like you know for i admire people who kind of like uh there's a temptation anytime you're doing something new uh because new stuff is so unproven there's a tendency and a temptation to like take the energy and the momentum from the new thing but shift into the proven game so for example i did a comparison once of joe rogan's podcast which is like an interview talk show type type of thing and i compared it to the top like the tonight show and i was like okay you know just i forgot who's the host or which show i did but like let's say jimmy fallon was the the host of the show and it's basically like if you just compare across every key metric so it's like audience size joe blows joe's podcast blows away jimmy fallon and actually has for years and years and years like once joe got the spotify deal that it was like it got kind of like legitimized but way before that joe was making a ton of money in a huge audience like five years before that but people didn't think of it like a business because they just didn't have a headline of a hundred million dollars a year to spotify that to like latch on to so audience size joe is bigger uh production it's joe's podcast i think is joe jamie and like maybe one other person so like three or four people total to pull off that show the tonight show has like 50 people behind the scenes just to like run one show um like episodes per year he has like more output with fewer people bigger reach and the only thing that was missing was like it wasn't didn't have like a category that it fit into really it was like it's a podcast okay podcast like is that a business i don't really know like seems like there's a bunch of those uh but joe stuck with it and like he had a lot of offers to do other things but he just stuck with it let it build build build build build so that then by the time you know it got really really big he could promote whether it's his own product like on it or some other you know athletic greens or whatever some product that pays him and start making ludicrous money and mr beast kind of does the same thing where like he flirts with this idea of like i could go create a netflix show but the reality is if you talk to him and you've seen him do what he's been doing over the last few years it's just like build audience build audience through this like he's like why would i leave youtube i can reach more people in the super bowl and you're like yeah but it's different but he's kind of not wrong like he he is right it seemed like this frivolous thing and then now people see mr beast is like kind of a business entrepreneur guy but like it's because of like it's because he committed to this new lane like many years ago and i guess what i would say for you guys is it seems like you guys have a new lane of this kind of like what i'm it's almost like fast fashion but for music which is like these tick tocks that are hooky and and catchy and skit based and like they can get millions of views and build you a huge fan base um and i actually think if you just stay with that and you don't try to be a traditional musician you're going to end up way bigger than all the traditional musicians it's the problem is it's just like a little bit unproven where that goes exactly or like and it's very tempting to like take offers from legitimate brands and and legitimate like paths that you've heard of but the good news is you're you're making millions of dollars along the way you're making millions now so at least it's at least you ain't broke and we've talked to every major label it's it's not like i our friend nick said that he's like we're independent by choice not by default because you'll see in the comments like why hasn't anyone signed this kid yet someone signed connor and i'm like they've tried we will not because that's not our goal our goal is to like do this ourselves do things the way we want to do it and honestly like prove to other people that you can do it um because i had no idea that this was possible and i'd love for other people that are making music to know it too how old are you guys i'm 29 and connor's 28.

wow and early on i remember you had this cool video with courtney cox and then you had another one with uh what's his name idris those are cool have you had any other uh like heroes or celebrities reach out that you that floored you um there's one guy i really look up to his name is russ he he's uh yeah he's a huge independent artist he really kind of wrote the blueprint that i followed if you want to talk to into someone about independent touring it would be russ because i know russ does it and he sells out massive like if you want to talk about the financial part the business part of touring he'd be the one to talk to i love his his song civil war gets me pumped up great song yeah he's he's amazing but yeah russ russ reached out yeah so he he like dm'd and showed love which is just really cool because he's sort of been my north star as far as just like how to do this independently he wrote like unsolicited advice stay independent you'll be making ems like clockwork and i'm like that's all i needed to hear like thanks russ that was that was a really cool one for me he only talks and raps too that's amazing uh his dms are also raps it's so hard because that the the dms are so like um simu reached out oh simu leo yeah yeah yeah he he's amazing um yeah i can't i'm like you know when people ask you a question on the spot and you're like name a song and you're like uh i don't know any songs yeah there'll be random things where like i'll notice on tick tock like oh logan paul liked the video or t pain like the video like you know there'll be little things like that that's cool as far as like directly talking to someone the big one that comes to mind is is russ just because he's someone who i'm trying to emulate as far as the business goes i know you're in vegas is it translating into off the screen stuff you know are you walking around uh downtown vegas and people are coming up to you has has that been happening yeah that's that's been the weirdest part because like i said we stay in our bubble and we hadn't been leaving the house much especially during covet and then we went on a trip to salt lake city because we love utah it's so random but we went there and it was a ton and especially at the airport like the tsa agents are always like oh my god wait they'll like look at his id and then be like the music guy like we love your stuff and i'm like that's crazy but the best is when little kids come up and they have their little are you a youtuber and they're so cute and it's like hey yeah what's up and we had like a five-year-old super fan come to calgary to meet him at the rodeo and connor took him to tim hortons for donuts um but yeah that that's that's really cool because you get to see it translate in real life and especially when it's kids and you're like oh that could have been like a core memory for that kid that's really cool yeah now that you are winning in one lane what i found is that when when people are are let's say winning and let's say that right now you're winning in like this content music game um you'll often see it's like kind of like neo in the matrix you sort of see the game a little differently you sort of see opportunities that you know like oh i feel like other people could be doing this in this other lane or we could do this but you know you know we think that would work but you know we just have our hands full so we're not going to do it but like do you have you seen any what i call adjacent opportunities for either content creators or in the business side like have you you've come from a business brain right so like do you see other opportunities i just had one the other day this guy kevin he has this account on instagram called icon brick and he makes lego animations and i've seen a couple big rappers and labels hire him to make lego animations for their songs long story short he's an incredible songwriter and i was telling him the other day dude put out your own music and use this platform you're building to promote your own music like yeah every like 10 to 12 videos you're doing like other rappers but then slide in one of your own videos in there with your song wow this is sick i'm watching one of these videos now oh they're incredible we're actually really we're uh releasing a song with him in a couple he only has 127 000 followers you're buying early on this guy this yeah dude he's in he's insane i'm like that's a double revenue stream you'll be making money from labels paying you to make lego animations of their songs meanwhile you'll be pocketing spotify revenue for your own songs so that's like a perfect example um that just won't happen that one happened recently so i can think of it i can't think of any others that are super recent you know what's crazy is with tick tock like it's just crazy how sound bites are becoming songs so you know like there's that one on tick tock where where it's that lady going uh i want to thank my man thank you for my man i saw that the other day it was just uh so she said that at like yeah she she just said that at a uh at a award show and that turned into a clip and then yeah it was just it was her saying it and i don't know if she did it or someone else turned it into a thing and then there's this other one where there's this guy he's got a 30-second video um uh where he talks about his uh his boo thing uh but it it it's literally a 30-second clip of him rapping and i'm googling for this guy and he's got it has a million likes on instagram on reels and i'm googling to i'm like i want to see the whole song it's not even a song there is no whole song it is just like his 30-second clip and it's it's pretty amazing how uh like things are happening with music where like it's just a clip of a thing it's not even real i guess the best example of that is the corn kid remember that kid that was like i love corn and it became this viral song on tick tock for like six months yeah it's amazing to start that's actually something we've clocked and we've wanted to be uh careful of because sometimes people have their song go viral the sound but people don't connect that sound to the artist yeah so there were a couple like viral sounds if you asked me who the artist was i'd have no idea so i was like we need to be very cognizant of that and like make sure that we attach you to the songs as much as possible which is why we're so like long form skit focused rather than like let's make a sound pop off because it's great it could be like a moment and a spike for a song but long term the goal is to attach connor to his music more do you uh on your way up like kind of like when you were moving boxes at the alpha pa warehouse and you're you know in between acting gigs you're maybe trying to make it in the music game and it's it's not obvious you're like now you're winning and winning feels great but you probably spent many years losing that's how i felt in the world of entrepreneurship i from the ages of 21 to 29 i was only doing startups that failed that's like i don't know eight years straight of just getting my ass kicked did you like dread going to family events because we dreaded it because it's just like the hey how are things going how's the how's the little music thing yeah no people would be like what's what's the new one because they're so used to me every year having a new story about the new thing that's gonna be the big thing and i was like oh damn you're right there is always a new one uh like i wish just one of these was the one and uh you know like that that was it so was there any i guess like moments you remember from the kind of the bottoms uh that like you know either a decision you made a talk you had with yourself some advice you got that like sticks with you or helped you during that time it was just it was brie it was like you know i i i don't have a bunch of friends which that sounds strange i'm i'm a very social person and i get along with everybody but my my core circle is very small and i spend 90 of my time with brie whether that's us working together or we go on walks every night and we just talk about stuff and yeah there was definitely a period especially when covet hit and productions completely halted so i had already a year before that been struggling to get acting work and then now there weren't even auditions and i was definitely at a low point and it was like what do i do and um brie was somebody who very early on i had shown my music to and this was prior to me show like i used to just record at home by myself i didn't show anybody it was just a hobby i had because i loved hip-hop but i was afraid to put it out into the world because i was afraid of the judgment i would get even had an alter ego called like he's gonna kill me yeah yeah no no it's called unidentified unidentified i used like a fake name and i would up i used to upload music on youtube anonymously just because i wanted to see what people would think about it and i was like that's stupid right uh without like attaching me to it and i was afraid what my friends would think like oh of course like the actor wants to be the rapper now and i was like frozen with um judgment fear yeah exactly and and brie has always from the very start just been such like like my my number one supporter and has given me the confidence and so when i was in that low point and music was something that i was sort of playing with she was like go all in on this trust me try it like try tick tock like what's the worst that's going to happen like nothing's going on anyways you know and so she she was the one that instilled that confidence to like go for it and ramon instilled that confidence in me because i got hired at the pet company as a social media assistant and i met ramon and then after that like a month later he's like yeah no you're my creative director 100 and anything i ever wanted to start he's like i'd be your first investor i'd be your first investor and he believed in connor so much so i was taking that confidence from ramon who was my mentor and i instilled it in him and ramon told me he was like i'm i'm whatever they're doing i'm in and i'm like you're an idiot man there's no there's no money in music like what's there to invest in there's nothing to invest in and he was like i don't know but whatever there's something here well i'm in and you were you were home schooled he told me i was home schooled yes up until high school i went to uh public high school but prior to that i was home schooled yeah and uh do you think that that like did that help you in any way in terms of what i think so because when i was home schooled i used to like start businesses i showed ramon my business card it was like brianna peterson it was like violinist pianist vocalist dog walker pet sitter babysitter hire me for anything like i would i just had so much time on my hands and also creatively i would write children's stories i would uh i have old videos from the apartment complex i wanted to be a director so i would go around filming all the kids um like documenting their lives so being home schooled gave me a lot of time on my hands and i think it gave me like a a need for creativity that most kids didn't have because when you're in school you're constantly entertained by other kids but i just had my siblings and i so i had to come up with ways to entertain ourselves so we would remake spy kids we would remake disney movies like we would film them ourselves edit them like so all my family jokes so like you've been doing this since you were like four yeah you've always been making content yeah so no one's asked the homeschool question before and i never really thought of it till now that i guess homeschooling really did correlate because it like forced me to be creative well the we we have like a large male most of our listeners are men the takeaway here is like like get yourself a strong woman to be your partner here i mean like like like this is this is like a good this is a really great marriage it seems like you got to get yourself a strong woman to help make this all happen um i'm a huge fan of alex and leila hormozzi i think that they're a super power couple you know what they live in vegas i think so i'm like gonna try and run into them at milk bar one night because they never skip dessert whatever they say but they're a huge inspo for the husband and wife business relationship because there's really nothing cooler like we get to work together be parents together well i think most people actually it's horrible you guys make it work because you're you you are both emotionally stable you have similar values it seems you have similar goals i think in most cases it's not awesome i think working with family in most cases is horrible well thank you no i mean and we have our moments i don't want to make it seem like it's always just so so easy because like brie had kind of alluded to earlier it's really easy to fall into this like we work together we're co-workers mentality when every so often it's important to remember that we are husband and wife and we need to find that balance so we're co-workers who kiss what's the big what's the deal exactly yeah no big deal we all do it yeah don't tell hr um you uh we'll leave at this sam's about to be a dad you guys recently uh had your first baby any uh any advice by the way sam have you heard it there's their song about about their son there's a line in there he's like uh it was it it's like you got my eyes and i got your back i was like oh that's sick yeah like i remember watching that video and i was getting emotional and and that's why i was like i think you're better than weird al and dicky and all these people i mentioned before is because like i see your stuff and like they don't inspire me i like them you inspire me i won't take any more little dicky slander on this podcast for the record uh i feel like you know i let the first one slide the second one you know he's cool but i see hotter stuff and i'm like oh like little dicky is like oh bro you just haven't looked into it enough dude he's inspirational i'm staying out of this conversation i love him but he like his character of like this neurotic jewish guy of like always complaining like i i don't think i want to be you or like i want to learn from you in terms of the day-to-day life it's more so your career is amazing and i respect it and i like your music but with conor like when i saw that song i'm like dude the values that you're talking about the songs like i'm on board with like i've been i'm inspired to live a little bit better i love hearing this from sam and i'll i know we have to wrap this up but i'll just to jump on this point so many artists have come to us and they're like connor needs more of a brand i'm like what do you mean like he's not he's too normal like he looks like every other guy on your street blah blah and i'm like i'm pretty sure that's why people really like him because and you're way hotter than the average guy let's be real sam what's up with you and like hotness oh don't give me wait till we you should show me your calves if you got good cab that's my one thing why'd you bring it up why don't you bring it up show him my cab give me six months i'll show him my cat they're like they're just like he's got a private instagram account for just calf work and he's been working on it for years wait no my only calves picture after they're not great but we're working on them we're working on the calves but um yeah no just that's really cool to hear because the realness has always been something that i've had a gut instinct to stick with so it's cool to like hear that confirmation from you this is the first time uh that um sean has fangirled out a little bit that's so nice it's me sean it's so nice to finally meet you and thank you thank you for the support and for watching and listening it genuinely means a lot sean asked about baby advice yeah any dad the number one the number one advice we have is like and it's so cliche but just be so present in those newborn days because they flew by genuinely we look back at old photos like a baby photo of jude will make me just cry instantly because i'm like i wasn't um i wasn't like oh no i was like i was so focused on business like too much so i wasn't like i would like hold him and wait for him to nap just so i could go work more but i wish at the time i was like enjoying it more so that so that you don't end up crying on a podcast one day here we are no the anytime we get crying we know our views are going to go up so thank you and don't go on tour for three and a half weeks because it was fun but he missed uh he missed a lot i think you're doing it right i think even if maybe there were some moments where i mean were you were you maybe think you weren't present i have a feeling just watching you on social media i have a feeling you're doing things wonderfully and the things you've said on the pod about the family business and everything i i think you got i think you're crushing it in life in business you're crushing it in life you're probably crushing it even harder yeah so thank you and i know i know what you mean i look at those photos and i i literally don't even remember i'm like i don't remember her looking like this right and it's like obviously i remember when i see it but i'm like oh man that just feels like two different times and kids are this funny thing where like for me at least all day i'm like oh my god i can't wait for you to go to sleep or just like get a moment of free time and then as soon as we have free time that's all me and my wife talk about is it's like okay wait what do we want all this free time for all we're gonna do is talk about the kids anyways um like the funny things that they did today so it's like uh it's this cup that like you know you can never really fill up enough of but at the same time you're like um i don't know it's like this weird dueling thing i don't have like the words or the wisdom to like articulate it but i definitely feel it where it's uh you can never spend it's like an infinite amount of time you could spend but it's really not about the like you know the duration of the time it's kind of like did you kind of sink in and appreciate it versus um just like being there because i've had many days where i spent hours and hours and hours but i didn't really like i didn't really let it sink in you know i was just kind of passing the hours which is a little bit different so yeah i know something once where it's like as soon as your kid is annoying you put your phone down because if you're present in the moment that kid isn't annoying but if you're trying to multitask you're trying to be somewhere the lines and that's that's when it becomes annoying so we've done a really good job at like as soon as the babysitter leaves at three like we didn't we're just fully present we're not but when he was a newborn we weren't doing that as much so you're gonna have more um i don't know if i want to go through the whole pregnancy thing again it was really tough on me especially mentally after i'm already a very anxious uh person so i think having a newborn to care for while recovering from giving birth at home um was pretty intense for me i don't know if i would want to do it again but we'll see i know we want to adopt i've been looking at adoption websites i literally lay in bed and like cry looking at them because i just want to adopt all of them but yeah i think we got to see our son we got to see what our dna would look like combined he's so funny he's he's amazing he's a little connor um but moving forward i'm like i don't know if i need that urge again i think i would just like to adopt a little vietnamese baby from where my grandma's from and honor her in that way you got to make sure they can rap too yeah if they can't rap we're not that'll be part of the application i'm like they can't use three syllable words by 12 months they're out yeah if they can't play three different characters in this skit yeah they didn't pass the time yeah no we definitely want a versatile child to adopt yeah we need some headshots uh well we appreciate you guys coming on you're amazing oh my god we appreciate you guys having us yeah this is an honor thank you i feel inspired talking to you i imagine sean i imagine sean does too and uh producer john jonathan was texting me and he goes i'm loving this they're so damn likable jonathan that was my biggest fear not being likable because i never really come on camera or do stuff like this but i knew sam so i was like okay i know sam i want to do this but normally i'm very fearful of criticism i've always been pushing i think you need to start like like your own personal brand like you're you're so knowledgeable in the music space that like and and you're always behind the scenes no no one knows who you are no one knows how impactful you are and what i do and i think i think you need to start putting yourself out there that's very nice for sure well totally i mean if you look at um their marriage and end well so that's not the great example but the rock's wife uh i forget her name then um what is her name uh danielle they did yeah but but they still work together they have an interesting dynamic oh yeah they still work together and she's known as being a pitbull like she is like feared in the industry she's sharp and i think she has more talent underneath her now but that's like an interesting example other than the divorce thing of of the business going well besides that besides that uh we'll workshop our uh our next analogy for you go back to the lab on that one well and people people hate on chris jenner but uh in my opinion i love chris jenner i think i'm like i don't know man she seems like she still has a pretty healthy maybe i don't agree with all the tactics but her kids and her have a great relationship and it seems like it's worked really well and everyone's provided for i was interviewing a nanny that nannied for them and i was like i was like i'm probably not gonna hire her but i did like five interviews just to dig for information about what they're like and she was like i think by the third interview she picked up that i only wanted to ask her questions about what it was like there and um and i i was like yeah i'm super curious can you just tell me some things and she was like not really and i was like okay i respect you for that that's that's fair uh we like the kardashians i once made connor binge watch a whole season with me i didn't i didn't get the appeal at first and then afterwards i'm like oh they're all just killers like they're all killers yeah like and you know you don't have to agree with all the stuff they're trying to do famous but they seem like they have a great relationship they're doing well they have yeah yeah they all stick together the loyalty of that family seems strong um well thank you all for doing this this is awesome thanks for having us thank you so much everybody go tick tock is that the first place you want people to follow you sure yeah i mean just um well honestly i think instagram is safest i was gonna say streaming services just like going to your favorite streaming service typing my name all of it typing my name connor price you'll see all my songs there yeah uh but yeah tick tock instagram oh you know what can i plug one thing sure any streamers or video gamers uh yes watching this all of connor's music is dmca safe so you can put it in your videos without copyright yeah i created a playlist on spotify uh under my channel that's called like dmca safe copyright free where it's all of my songs that are copyright free because i have a few songs that i did with other artists and they have their labels get involved so you can't use them but i have a list of all of the songs that you could use on your youtube videos your intros for your podcast whatever you want unlimited use um because i don't do youtube id i think the long-term value of having creators use your music is way more than like trying to get a few dollars every month because somebody use your song in a vlog so yeah if you're a creator and you are looking for copyright free music i have a bunch of that that i want people to use and brie you're on twitter but you don't have any follower or you're like you're i don't even do i have a twitter i don't even know oh i found it wasn't i was gonna say you should promote that because i bet a lot of people are going to want to dm you oh i signed up on threads i have threads okay hit her up on threads but friends doesn't have dms you're going to get a lot of opportunities from this you you just got the brianna price handle oh yeah i got my brianna price handle on instagram so yeah just search her up on instagram because you're definitely active yes someday i want to and i just got this instagram handle i've been dying to get it's called home studio because i want to start a newsletter for independent artists and then eventually oh i saw your newsletter it's really horribly named by the way you need to change that name no i stopped that the independent one yes i stopped it yeah that's done that's done the idea was good thank you the spelling was the worst i know i got it that's done don't worry so i'm switching i want to do home studio because i want to build a newsletter for independent artists and then also then turn that into a potential we sell like home studio kits where everyone's like what mic do you use i'm like just buy connor's kit it comes with a mic headphone interface smart everything you can use to make money from home and i'll record all my songs using that kit so it sells itself amazing uh you guys are awesome thanks for coming on i have a feeling that the next time you guys come on you'll be 10 times bigger because you have the talent for it and i think you've stumbled into something really really amazing and i think if you just keep going it's gonna it's gonna get really big so thanks for coming on and uh that's the episode that's the pod that's the pod thank you thank you
