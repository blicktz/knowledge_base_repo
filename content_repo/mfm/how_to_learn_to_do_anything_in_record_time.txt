the the opposite of what people think people think you should go learn some secret theories that you don't know and then you need to like develop your own voice and like come up with original content it's like actually that's a really slow way to get better so i was saying i i have a lot to ask you about this document what did you say i was saying are you gonna ask me about my fresh green smoothie maybe my green goddess salad or maybe green can of mountain dew giant steak that the chef made you know what kind of life am i living here this is an incredible life um well i would say maybe like now is not the best time to eat a salad and a steak maybe like later it's like you literally are eating a steak right now yeah i took one bite right the countdown to recording was like five four three two one i was like i gotta get it in um before we really get into stuff um so did you see that picture that i shared of you when we first started recording yeah that was great so and i was kind of reflecting on it and the reason i was reflecting on it is the hustle like the the the newsletter the hustle has a daily podcast coming out and they've worked on it for like months when we started i mean you rented a studio at first but then it was you and i like i'm pretty sure we just used our iphone headphones and we were in that shitty like closet yeah we were in a club we were basically in a closet with on a table where we were so close together that any time i talk your mic picked it up anytime you dug my big so it's like awful awful recording you can see the in the photo you posted about like us recording i'm like hunched over i got my glasses on i didn't wear my contacts i'm wearing my jacket still because i just walked over from my office and just like we started recording instantaneously i'm looking at my phone you know like uh really wasn't you know you know some people are like you know you wear a suit you know act like act like you you're gonna be where you want to be or whatever uh i definitely wasn't doing that i was just sort of like uh whatever none of this video stuff matters all that matters is the audio let's just do that which wasn't entirely wrong but what what i was proud of was that when we did it like we really oftentimes we would just use the iphone and just like an audio file and the uh like i said i'm recording this on an iphone are you you're using your iphone or using the fancy well we have fancy mics now but like there was one time where i remember like we literally like it was like a speakerphone in an iphone but the the hustle guys they've got this podcast coming out and they're doing it every day i'm and i'm gonna pop on it sometimes i i they're gonna ask you to pop on it sometimes too but they're doing a daily podcast i think it's gonna work it's so it's so much work though daily like about the news or about what yeah they're doing a day it's called the hustle daily show so it's easy right and they're doing a podcast every single day it launches wednesday and um we were talking about i just left a meeting where i was helping them get it off the ground and i was like what what i told them was it's gonna work right away i think so like when your episodes when it was just you came out it took off right away but then it goes down when like the when the novelty wears off and that's when you've got to like actually develop the skill and i would actually say sean i would say you started out pretty great but then and i would say i started out decently as well decent as well but then we like developed the skill and that's like when it really starts getting good and i'm like don't forget guys when you start doing this it's like a skill this isn't like some people like you were talented but you still have to like hone this in yeah and by the way the best way to do that is just to be a fan of other people's work uh because if you're a fan of other people's work you'll pick up on the little things that they do that um it's like man why do i love this i love this because blah blah and you're never going to recreate that but if you see five examples then you start to realize what the bar is and where you need to be and so it's like you you talk about this with copywriting how do you come up a better copywriter it's actually other people's work the opposite of what people think people think you should go learn some secret theories that you don't know and then you need to like develop your own voice and like come up with original content it's like actually that's a really slow way to get better the way you get better is you do copy work which is you write other people's you literally hand write word for word what somebody who's writing you love what they do and uh you write that and i do this uh still i do it as a warm-up basically so if i'm gonna write something i'll first spend five ten minutes and actually i want one of the pieces i copy work is yours you have something that you have this post it's very hard to find because every time i want it it's so hard for me to go find it again so you need to like put this front and center somewhere which basically it starts with let's let me be perfectly clear you're reading this because i want you to yes that's a good one right this yeah it's like i'm casting a spell but i'm not forcing you to do something you don't want to do you want to know what i'm talking about and you like write it like that and so and i know it because i've copy written this same thing like a bunch of times and um and i just love that let me be perfectly clear let's be perfectly clear it's so good and then you're like you're reading this because i want you to every line is getting you to further down the slippery slope and you're like you're explaining what's going on uh so that that one is brilliant i love that one that you do i have another one that's uh the scott adams one the day you became a better writer yeah he goes um and the first sentence is like the most important part of that whole thing right i forget the i forget it what was it do you remember i don't know ben ben pulled that up but but basically the this method is actually applicable to many things so if you want to learn uh you know how to play the guitar you can first learn all the scales and you can learn music theory and then you can try to write original songs but man that would be a really hard way to do it the better way is you take a song you like you figure out how to play those four chords and you're like okay so you play covers right yeah and you play a shitty cover initially then you get better and better then you might add your own twist to it and you go from there uh ben make that bigger i can't i can't uh i can't see it you know this is what is this screen for ants so this is written by the guy who created dilbert who's a beautiful writer i i can't read it from here what's that first i went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in quote-unquote business writing i couldn't believe how simple it was i'll tell you the main tricks here so you don't have to waste a day in class it's great and then he references the first article and he goes by the way the first what's he say uh the first sentence is like the most important thing go reread that sentence up that that i wrote when we started this out i re i wrote and rewrote that dozens of times it makes you curious that's the key and then he goes write short sentences avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence readers aren't as smart as you'd think it goes on and on uh but it's a short very short post but it's very good and um and so yeah whether you want to if you want to learn to cook first start with recipes nail those then do original creations if you want to learn to play music first start with covers then do this um and so like like for example i'm about to teach my power writing course again so i took like five months off and i'm going to do it again at the end of uh end of this month um and in it i have one section which is just the habits you need to become a better writer and the first one is copy work and then i make them do copy work right there and i remember asking i was like i'm gonna use 10 minutes of our course time for you to write this because i know if i just tell you to go do this you're not gonna do it you're gonna feel like it's weird you're gonna say like okay i get the idea but like i'm not actually gonna go do that before i need to write i'm gonna give you one rep at doing this right now i said go write come back they come back and i was like what did it feel like and they're like they're like it's weird it's like i feel like my hands aren't my hands they're their hands it's like my my tongue isn't my tongue it's their tongue right like my voice like i can almost pick up their voice by the time i'm written the third paragraph it's like if i then switched and was writing my own stuff it'd be in that voice and it's like yeah that's exactly the point it's like it's a hack to getting your stuff to not be flat and boring or cumbersome and like not be stuck with writer's block where you just have an empty page that's intimidating you so for trends um they were doing this thing like a contest to see who can launch a product and i was like oh i'll play i'll do this and so i didn't use my twitter as a way to promote anything because that would have been a little unfair but i did use my facebook and basically i was like i'm gonna create a copy work course i think i called it copy that or something nice and um it's just gumroad it was for 50 and i just gathered like my 12 favorite bits of copy and i made a pdf and i explained why each part is interesting and the person who receives one they receive one every 10 days and they have to write it by hand and they get commentary as to why it's cool and uh i think it's going to be good i i'm releasing it in like three days and i've been like spending all my time doing it that's amazing that's a great idea what's uh what's the url for that uh you you liked it so i i don't want to show the url yet oh because it's an unfair advantage or whatever yeah it's an unfair advantage but if you go to my facebook uh you'll see but basically i tell the story about how here i'll send it to you about how ben franklin used to use copy work and it was one of the best ways to learn how to write but for some reason we don't do it anymore and i just did what you did where i talked about how you get to feel the texture of other people it's called uh i just i just call it how to write irresistible copy yeah i just sent it to you and uh there's a lot of um it's like you know so when i made the power writing course i was like okay i'm literally gonna only is that you have 10 days my goal was i'm gonna make you a like two times better at writing in 10 days that was the mission from the start and i was like i don't think it's that hard because most people they themselves feel like they suck at writing and they kind of do second writing and but like most things when you haven't tried to get great at something or you don't know how you how to get great you're actually not that far away a couple tweaks will get you double like twice as good or three times as good and then you know to become the best in the world yeah that's a whole lifetime of practice but you can double your skill in pretty much anything if the right guide gives you like the right couple things to do and copywriting uh copy work is one of those that i was like this is one of the central ones and uh people aren't gonna believe me but it works and so um i yeah i devote one of my little sections to it in the course by the way i should just put out the course name otherwise they're gonna get mad at me for talking about the course and not telling people go go go do it so i'm teaching it in february i teach it myself with my bare hands i it's live on video it's recorded if you miss it uh and go to powerwritingcourse.com and so i think we have like uh 200 spots we opened it up like two days ago 100 people took it already wow really see if it fills up yeah how many people came to the first time also 200 people i did 160 the first 150 the first time and that was capped then the second time i did no cap and uh it was 350 students did it oh my god this time i think i'm gonna shut it off after 200 um but i'm gonna teach it yeah basically i'm gonna teach it uh because i like the slightly smaller group sizes so i can just give a little more feedback because it takes a lot of work because after the thing you write your thing and then i go in slack and i'll give you like direct feedback on it and so that takes more time than actually teaching the course or coming up with the content is like going giving people real feedback so i don't do it for everybody but after every session i'll give like 15 20 students direct feedback and then so over the course of the 10 days you're gonna get it from me at one point that's sick uh yeah i know sarah took the class or did sarah take it or who some one of my someone i'm close with took it and they said they loved it and goggin the founder of maven said that it was one of the most loved courses yeah they actually have hooked me up so maven is uh really helping me out because they knew i was lazy i was like i'm probably never gonna teach it again like why it was like one of the highest rated courses and i was like well it's just like work to like like what's the work i'm like well i gotta like send an email out to be like join it i was like i feel stupid asking so i'm just like you know i just don't want to do it um and they're like you already made all the content it's highly rated all you got to do is like send out two emails so they just sent it out on my behalf and i was like thank you all right i'll teach it then because i like the actual teaching and look at the home page so if you go to maven.com you see sean and then right next to him you see sarah my wife how funny is that yeah does she love teaching it she did hers right yeah she dug it yeah is she doing it again yeah she will yeah i think that's the trick is to do it regularly because you just get better at teaching it um all right let's do some other stuff wait but before we do all this stuff uh what's his name ryan is coming onto the pod so everyone ryan will be on in like 30 minutes ryan is he's the founder of bolt and so basically ryan's pretty impressive dude so i invested in bolt he has built two projects that are worth over a billion dollars and he's under like the age of 28 and recently a bunch of people heard most people hadn't heard of bolt and then he went on twitter and started like basically he took he took shots at y combinator and stripe like two of the most beloved startup organizations and he basically was like they're the mob they're the mafia and he's like and why is he's not worth doing and here's why and so controversy you're picking a fight really works and so uh i want to talk to him about about that and see what he has to be good and i think he's gonna bring a couple ideas so let's see what happens let's talk you want to talk about dan price well what's your crazy damn price story well okay most people probably don't know this so so you i think you know uh because you wrote about it in 2015 which is way ahead of the curve so listen to this why don't you explain this and then let me explain my piece let me explain how this how this happened so i'm reading so we have this document and sean was like writing in the document right before we started and he wrote crazy dan price story i don't know what that's our little secret we we we write the topic so you get the other person curious but you don't you don't fill in the details so they don't know what you're gonna say so the reaction is authentic yes so i don't know what you're gonna say but in 2015 i wrote this article and the headline said so dan price is the guy who kind of looks like jesus he's based out of portland i think he's the guy who famously said from now on everyone the minimum wage at our company is 70 000 a year i'm reducing my salary the headline to the article i wrote in 2015 which at the time and still has not gotten picked up a lot it says dan price the gravity payment ceo paying everyone 70 000 is full of shit turns out 90 of the dan price story is completely made up but he's making a fool of all of us and and basically i like wrote about how there's like three things that are very weird that happened with the story and a lot of this by the way is opinion some of its facts but there's a lot of uh allegations so so take that for what it's worth but uh a few things one prior to him raising everyone else's uh salary to 70 000 he was paying himself 1.1 million dollars and that's for a company that was only doing 16 million dollars in revenue well why is that weird well because uh he was being sued by his brother and his brother was suing him the brother was suing dan who's a co-founder the two brothers were founders was suing dan for dan was paying himself too much money and it's kind of like the brother had a profit share the brother was a was not active full-time so he didn't take a salary or had a small salary he was there for the profits the funny thing was there's no profits because the brother is taking a humongous salary and reducing profits to like zero so that's why yeah well the the brother quit so dan goes oh well and i don't want to share the profit so just boost my salary and then immediately the brother sues dan and so he's like oh well maybe we should reduce my salary and everyone's salary and i'm gonna make this and second and worse he was accused of listen to this sentence dan price is accused of repeatedly waterboarding and beating his wife and on october 28th this was i think 2015 his ex-wife gave a ted talk where she talked about how dan was punching her in the stomach and slapping her in the face and she had to go lock herself in the car because she was afraid that he was gonna like kill her so like crazy stuff so anyway i this is allegations but like if it looks like a duck and quack like a duck it's a duck there's it's allegedly a duck yes there's just a few things and then here's another funny thing price said of himself i'm just so sick of the attention it just feels a lot like it's he feels like such a big investment of yourself there's this episode of the office where michael scott was like these people wanted to talk to him about this uh thing going on dunder mifflin and he goes man i was amazed you know i was like i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but like the media was contacting me so i decided to call a radio station and i did it and i called this other radio station i did an interview and you know like it's just crazy that they're all coming to me that's like what dad's like he's like i'm sick of the attention why is everyone coming ads he runs ads promoting the story of the ceo who reduced his salary and everybody else in the company makes 70 000 minimum wage and he's like barefoot and then even further you know the guy doesn't wear shoes he loves the earth and he loves the world and he says all ceos are too greedy um you know be like me and then his employees i don't know if you heard this part this is after your this is after 2015 so you probably didn't have this in your thing there's this video that goes viral of his employees gifting him a tesla because they're like dan you've sacrificed so much oh my god you have you have so little we're gonna give you this tesla so they all pitched in and bought him a tesla and he's like crying he's overwhelmed uh blah blah blah blah so they got fooled because basically so yeah he pays himself a high high salary brother gets mad brother whatever he ends up buying his brother out at a discount cuts his salary still takes the money as a profit like he still gets the profits from the company as the as the owner of the company but it's just not a w2 salary it's not a salary so it's actually even more tax advantageous it's just like you know zuck takes a one dollar salary because he gets paid in stock um you know it's crazy and then he and then he makes bank he does fifty thousand dollars speaking gigs doesn't share that with anybody he has a five hundred thousand dollar book deal because of his like story about you know ceo greed and uh you know freaking waterboard his wife i was like this is crazy like what what is going on um this is a crazy story to me and it just reminds me of like anytime somebody really goes out of their way to tell you how virtuous they are you can pretty much take it to the bank that they are they are overcompensating from for something that they are not as virtuous as uh as the effort that they're taking to tell you how virtuous they are it's like it's like fox news saying fair and balanced it's like dude like don't piss on my back and tell me it's rain like don't lie to me like just be you that's fine piss on my leg who pisses on your back just like beyond us like like so like this whole thing that his whole shtick the wife thing is like if that's true that's obviously that's its own category and that's unforgivable but the whole uh pay thing it's like dude like it's kind of like it's kind of like lance armstrong a lot of people aren't mad that lance armstrong took the drugs they're mad that he was so cocky about it that he did a commercial saying what am i on i'm on my bike eight hours a day busting my ass what are you on and then he sued a guy who was accusing him of taking drugs it's like dude that was the part that was a little like when you went overboard and that's like the cover up is worse than the crime for yes the cover-up is worse than the crime uh yeah that's crazy um okay so i want to do a couple other random things uh i want to talk about this this business i heard about that i think is kind of amazing i don't know if you looked into it but it's called canna do you know what i'm talking about uh maybe tell me more all right so this guy uh david friedberg who's gotten really pop he went from like you know didn't have a twitter account to now very popular because he's on he's one of the four people on the all-in podcast which is pretty popular podcast um you know if they're you know if we're not the best podcast in the world you know they're their second best type of thing you know they're they're a great podcast so basically it's chamath it's jason calacanis it's david sax and then it's this guy friedberg i'm pretty much everybody had heard everything in the tech world i heard of the other three nobody knew about friedberg and friedberg has been like the um the like you know the revelation he's actually you know my favorite one on the pod and many people's favorite one in the pod why is that well he's kind of like a science background and he's an engineer like scientist who goes into business and so the first business he built was called climate corporation and um it's ended up it was basically telling farmers about um whether it was like weather data and kind of like giving farmers uh information about what they should be doing with their crops and things like that so it was like a data company for farmers i don't know a ton about it but i think that's any and i think they raised a relatively small sum for the amount of which they sold for right so actually i should go back he was early google pre-ipo he was like uh one of larry pages favorite people the founder ceo of google at the time and he was working on special projects for them then he left he starts climate corporation ends up selling it to monsanto the big evil you know whatever company in the agriculture space um for like a billion then he starts yeah for like a billion dollars then he starts um this company that's uh what's it called last metro mile metro mile so it's an insurance company and it was a pretty innovative idea it's like get in your car and instead of like if you don't drive your car much why should you pay the same amount for insurance as somebody who drives a ton right so it was like pay per mile insurance and even better it was like they install a little thing in your car or whatever it could basically see do you speed a lot or not if you don't speed a lot you should pay less for insurance so it's like a dynamic form of insurance that was a cool idea ended up going public in a spac and then famously the spac kind of has crashed since then it's it's been obliterated it got obliterated it got bought by lemonade for you know like a third of what it went public for so you know not a great cap is is 209 it previous market cap was like 4 billion yeah so uh so i ended up getting acquired you know whatever the public story wasn't great but you know built a company that ended up going you know generating hundreds of millions of dollars uh so so anyways another good win so now he's got a new company so he actually he has a he has like an incubator for himself called the production board and basically it's like not vc it's like google backed it for like a billion dollars or something crazy and then blackrock and a couple others backed it for so it's raised a ton of money and all it does is it builds its own companies in-house one of the companies that they just announced i think is really cool so anyways that's a bunch of backstory and by the way i think i got like a third of that wrong but whatever you get the general idea of who the guy is so his new company is pretty dope and it's this trend i've been trying to follow which is 3d printing but it's basically printing beverages at home so what does that mean they're going to give people a machine so you buy this machine and think of it like a printer and it sits in your kitchen and when you want to have a drink whether that's you want um you know like a lacroix you want sparkling water with lemon flavor you want a hot tea you want a white claw with alcohol in it you want a white wine whatever drink you want you push a button and it'll dispense that beverage for you and it does this because they basically realize and he tells a story it's pretty dope he tells a story that like um he was at a dinner and the scientist is there and the scientist kind of educating him on this he's like you know almost every drink is all water right so juice is like 94 water uh coca-cola is like 95 water wine is like 95 water everything is like 90 plus percent water and the and then you know it's like x percent sugar and alcohols and then like one percent is the flavoring that gives it the unique taste that makes it taste like iced tea to you um and it's only one percent of what's actually in the beverage and it's like so isn't it crazy that we like have factories that produce you know we we go we get we get all these like chemicals and water and whatever we put in a factory then we put it into bottles then we put the bottles on a truck we truck it to a store it sits on their shelf then you drive to that store you take it off that shelf you drive it home you put it on your shelf at home and it's in a bottle plastic thing that then goes into the you know recycling or the trash and wow that's a lot for like something that's basically water and we all have water in our own homes piped you know already through the water system so like why why instead of doing this central manufacturing and like kind of brutalizing the environment and having this high cost why can't i just add the flavoring at the end point at your home using the water that you already have and create these beverages on the fly and so after years of like r d and testing they basically got it to the fact where here's what they do the machine basically takes your water and it can either make the water really cold really hot or carbonated and then it has three cartridges there's a sugar cartridge there's an alcohol cartridge and then there's the flavor cartridge and all you do is you just select what drink you want and it'll say okay we're going to put out like one micro liter of you know um of this ascorbic acid because that's what gets you the soda taste and then we're going to add some sugar and then we've got no alcohol because it's a soda or if it's a white wine it's going to be like here's the alcohol a little bit of sugar and then here's the flavoring that's going to give it that you know the the the palette of uh of a white wine and so and the idea is that with those three cartridges you can make basically an infinite combination of drinks because one the flavor cartridge itself has like 85 different flavors inside of it that can be mixed and matched and so i think this is kind of amazing it's going to be like let's say you could pull this off now all of a sudden we're not buying bottled drinks everywhere we're just able to at our end point have any drink we want for any you know my mom wants tea my dad wants wine i want soda and my wife wants flavored water she we can all get that out of the same device for a fraction it's just like a it's like a better coke freestyle machine you know that's exactly the analogy i love it's an at-home mini freestyle that can do you 10 10 times more than what the freestyle could do i used to go to the movie theater near my place in san francisco i would never see a movie but i would walk into the lobby just to get a coke from the freestyle machine because you could make coke zero cherry vanilla or coke zero orange vanilla and i loved it and it's the only place you could do that and so i tried to get one for my office and the terms were ridiculous it was something like a hundred dollars a month for life or like it's like a it's like a crazy like it's it's they make it challenging to get a freestyle machine and they are so cool and they are so good and so this is just like a home freestyle machine but for every drink ever right yeah because you know like as kids we used to go to like the normal soda found that has like 10 spouts and it's like you do the rainbow you just put all of them in the cup and it's like oh that's how i want my drink right and freestyle took it one step further because you could be like i want orange i want like it's a long tail of flavor so you could be like i like black cherry mountain dew and i might be only 0.1 percent so like mountain dew can't afford to bottle that because they're like dude it's such a small market but with this it's like the long tail of flavors gets done and so the analogy is like it's like tv so back when we had three channels they could only program the most general stuff that the average consumer is going to want so if you're a fishing enthusiast then we only have three channels on tv it's not going to work for you but then you get cable and now you get you know hundreds of channels let's say so now there's a dedicated fishing channel but then let's say then youtube comes along and youtube's like no we can literally anybody can create from their own home and now we'll have every variation so you want only bass fishing in spanish because you're a spanish speaker well now there's a channel for you and um and so that's the same idea the way that we did it with content where once the means of production went to the home now you got every single supply demand like niche got filled uh that's going to happen now with beverages where every flavor is going to be done and even better you get the economic savings you get the environmental savings you get the flavor personalization right like start one of the reasons starbucks is so successful is because my wife can go in there and order a venti skinny you know latte half decaf with oat milk light ice and blah blah and with you know one packet of stevia and it's like her drink is her drink and starbucks is willing to do that whereas you go to you know a normal coffee shop you can't get can't get that done so that's going to be at the home and even further now it also creates a business model for so like me and you we could basically say uh let's say sam loves root beer we could create my first million root beer all we do we don't have to find a manufacturer and a bottler and a whatever all we do is we just create a recipe it's a piece of software it's like it's like a piece of content you know it's a it's just like three variables and we could just send it to your device and you could print it out for you know 55 cents great and we would get our share of the royalty from everybody who does that and so all of a sudden you're gonna see just like the rock made his own tequila and so did george clooney you know that will go down to you don't need 100 million followers to do that you can now have 10 000 followers on instagram and create your own beverage and people could print it at home and you could get your share of that how cool first of all diet root beer is one of the best sodas of all time because it has no caffeine so you can drink at any hour of the day it's not sprite because sprites whack and it's diet no calories and it's like creamy it's the best the second point was it's not sprite well because like you could do i used to drink diet like seven up sometimes but like that's like some ratchet stuff but it's got it it just that's kind of weak that's like a a refreshing i want like a hearty creamy thing so i used to drink a diet root beer a day but for some reason in san francisco i could only find it in the asian neighborhood so my office the craigslist office was in an asian neighborhood and so i've always wondered like do asian people love what they were um the the v to me's grocery store always had the best selection of diet root beers they had like four different types uh anyway i love that goes gets a 23 and me test just yes just now a little nom in me yeah the um the second thing is we used to have this lit list of um companies that you should work at in order to like get rich that are growing i would put this on that list and what was the name of his uh tpb the production board and it's basically like i think the theory is like we have to produce real things for the world to move to work and what if we could rethink the way that production happens in these different systems so okay how does quinoa get made how does how do beverages get made how does uh you know like um this one fertilizer get made and if we can find a way to use new technologies to like improve the means of production those are all big industries i think that they've got overall thesis lab generated protein or like lab generated meat i guess he's a vegan for example so he's like you know he's he agreed with me which he's he said something that's pretty controversial he's like i think that the way people will look back on what we do with animals and see it as worse than slavery and then people got really mad at him for saying that and he's like no like just i meant it okay i'm not saying it's it is worse than human slavery i'm saying that the scale of mass murder that happens on an everyday basis there's no comparable to it i'm on board with that the other day i ordered uh i ate 15 hot wings and i was like i just ate seven and a half chickens so so so so so so so so
