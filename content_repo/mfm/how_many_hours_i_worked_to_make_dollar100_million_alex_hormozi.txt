you seem like a grinder when you were building these businesses were you just like uh doing 80 hour 100 hour work weeks and what about now because you're like yoked you're a huge you're like a bodybuilder so so like how did you balance like uh being fit and getting married and you but i don't know you well but you seem like you'd be grinding hard so my wife works in the business with me so we are true 50 50 partners like it's very rare i like i recognize how rare it is she actually is 100 matched with me and like should just as much be on this call because she runs the other half like she from a work standpoint she has more output than i do um she is the operator so she builds the infrastructure she does the recruiting she sets the they are the hr stuff she does the culture she like she does i mean she runs everything um i just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long enough um to see it come true but in terms of grinding we this is what we like i love business like i love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this and so i do as much of it as i can and if we want to go out to dinner we'll go out to dinner you know but like we're we're i was just saying we're single so we don't have kids and so we work from like five ish to four ish you know um and then you know usually in the middle of the day we'll probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and go out to dinner at night and that's that's kind of our lives you seem pretty um this isn't i would say i'm a little bit i'm i'm definitely this sean has a little bit of it too like manic's not the right word but like neurotic maybe is a better word um where it's like uh you're there's something that's deep rooted inside of you that's kind of it's not like you want to do something necessarily it feels like you're it's more compulsive um or obsessed you're obsessed about stuff which i am as well um where if that's true what's that rooted in what are you trying to get done so i think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval right um and then i think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint i got immediate feedback that was positive and then i was conditioned to continue those actions now uh i continue to do them without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with so i don't i don't think i suffer you know from the insecurities as much as i used to i'd say i'm probably 30 better than i was at the beginning and it might just be because i have this massive big pile of money that i can use as an emotional crutch to why i'm not a piece of um that would help i'm just being like i mean if it were all disappeared i'd find out how much actual growth i had or if i just compensated by circumstance and you know compensate for deficiency i don't know you can send it to me and we'll we'll find out we'll see let's run the experiment i'd like so there's the compulsion and like this last year i pretty much took off like it did not work that much um and so i saw the difference and like i have i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing and their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant to me you said you took last year off what'd you do what'd you get up to we went out to dinner every single night to a five-star restaurant for seven straight months we went to i mean we we moved to vegas temporarily um we traveled a lot uh went to cabo went to scottsdale went to sedona with the flagstaff um traveled all over um one out did did stuff um felt felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not a lot to do um it feels good having that rest though i mean when i sold my company which was a year ago last week the first six six months i was like i need to decompress it felt good to have it and then and then i was like and i'm in that phase now where i'm like all right now i'm ready for war again you you can't like i i like you can't be in the trenches i think like or rather you need breaks from from being in the from being at war i think and maybe even phrasing it i'm just throwing this out there like phrasing it as instead of like a break is a shift in how you're thinking because like it's really like it's going from dirt to clouds but i still think it's high leverage activity you know i mean or like output it's just a different type of output you said something on one of your videos that um you're one of the only other people that i have heard say this phrase i use it a lot which is yeah i had a season like or this season i'm doing this or i had a season where i was really just focusing on x and that's been like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach he's like my mindset coach plus trainer he does this all the time where he's like he's like i'm in a season right now where i'm i'm just uh he'll be like you know i'm i'm practicing not waiting and he's like hey he comes up with these little themes or he'll be like right now i'm in a season where i'm gonna eat whatever i want and it's kind of like in the entrepreneurial world it's like time boxing it's like all right i'm gonna give myself two hours to get this shit done or i'm gonna launch in the next two weeks no matter what right like we i've used time boxing for productivity and now this season's thing it makes every like decision you're making less heavy of a commit because you're like it's okay yeah there's there's beginnings and ends and this season is gonna feel a little different just like winter feels different than summer that's how i use it do you do you use it like that i just noticed you said that phrase 100 yeah and maybe it's a fitness thing i have no idea um i i yeah i i have no ownership over it right yeah it's like yeah i mean i i think about it in terms of entrepreneurial seasons um and i at least for me might have been like five year chunks and so this is going to be my fourth season um and they've roughly been about the same length so i think that it probably takes me like three ish years to like really see something through and then two years to figure out how i'm going to transition from that thing or realize or monitor you know whatever um that's what i it's kind of like a pe cycle almost
