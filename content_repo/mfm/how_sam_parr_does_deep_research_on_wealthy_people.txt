one interesting thing that i found so what i like to do is i like to find out who um is buying different parts of real estate or different real estate so i go to therealdeal.com and there's this one segment called yolanda says it's like this fake author named yolanda he goes i heard a rumor that this person's buying a house the owner is this this and this yolanda hears that um they're gonna offer this much money i have no idea yolanda is a fake person but it's just like a blog a blog it's a gossip blog yeah for real estate mostly in new york and la though so they're kind of famous famous e-purse people doing it and what i love to do is find out who bought who's buying the real estate and then i go and research them and the reason why is one of the best ways to figure out if someone's actually wealthy or not is by the real estate holdings that they own that's one of the few things that it's really hard to fake i mean you could fake it but if someone has bought a 20 million dollar home the likelihood that they're worth a hundred million dollar plus is incredibly hot um you know it's hard to like that right and so real estate holdings is one of the best way to get an indicator of someone's wealth or it's a great way not the best way but it's a great way and i found one that interested me a ton this guy's name was brian carringer and he uh bought a house in malibu in 2019 for 20 million dollars i hadn't heard brian i know a lot of internet entrepreneurs um i hadn't heard of them so i researched them and this is the guy who started dictionary.com kind of a crazy thing when you think about it because who really thinks of dictionary dictionary.com so in the 1990s this guy started uh in 1995 he started a business called lexico publishing and lexico publishing owed thesaurus.com and dictionary.com and he bootstrapped it and he grew it and he sold it in 2005 to iac for a hundred million dollars and then uh two years ago iac sold dictionary.com to dan gilbert you know dan gilbert quicken loans yep he sold dictionary.com for uh or they sold dictionary.com for a hundred million dollars so they they didn't do a very good job with it but dictionary.com gets around 40 dictionary.com and thesaurus.com gets around 40 million uniques a month and does about 20 million in revenue and they have barely any employees i believe dozens of employees it's incredibly fascinating because this is what i call it how do they make money it's just ads ads sense or is there or is there something else just ads uh-huh yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back
