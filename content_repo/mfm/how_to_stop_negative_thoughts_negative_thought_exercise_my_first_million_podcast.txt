the last thing that i do this is an exercise i thought i this was unique to me it's not so i used to do this years ago and i still do it to this day and it turns out there's a name to it it's it some people call it a negative a negative thought exercise i call it looking at the downside and so what i like to do in order to control my emotions because the thing with controlling your emotions is you have to control the up and the down because when you start a company or when you start anything typically you have a fair bit of highs and the highs are probably as good feeling as you as you think or maybe even a little bit less than you think but the downs are typically way worse than you can imagine it's really hard to control the downs because when you start anything controlling the down is the hard part and most people are shocked at how low you can feel when you're starting something even when things appear to be going well and so what i like to do is i like to think in my mind i'll close my eyes i do this a lot a lot of times in the morning i'll do it at night as well as i close my eyes and i think what's the worst possible outcome right now and so it could be i get sick my family gets sick i'm gonna die and i visualize what what that feels like and if you do it for long enough with your eyes closed after about five or ten minutes you can really feel what that feels like and then i do two things i say to myself all right that is the worst that can happen i just experienced it anything else that happens today it is only upside and it really makes you have a lot of gratitude and appreciate that that hasn't actually happened and the second thing that i like to do with this exercise is and this relates particularly to starting a company or getting a job or moving somewhere else that's new and just starting your life is i try to protect the downside so for example if you are going to start a company you can ask yourself well in order to start this business i need a little bit of cash and so you have to be very specific you have to say how much cash do i need well right now i'm spending three thousand dollars a month how much how many months saved do i need in order to feel good about this and so let's say we come up with the number six that means i need six times three thousand dollars i need eighteen thousand dollars in savings i'm going to go out and get that eighteen thousand dollars okay i've got that eighteen thousand dollars what else is the worst case scenario here what's the downside here well i spend all my money and my business goes under now do i want to be homeless no i'm not willing to accept being homeless okay so what's the next so i have to protect myself from being homeless how would i protect myself from being homeless well i would probably get a job driving uber because i have a car do i want to am i willing to accept that no i'm not willing to accept that or maybe you are and then that's the worst case scenario but the one stage up could be maybe well i'll just get a white collar job um at a huge corporation and i'll just be a cog in their big wheel and their machine and it won't be fulfilling it won't be glamorous but it'll be a really good nine to five with benefits benefits so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go and make friends with recruiters at those companies right now even though this isn't even coming close to half it's not happening yet and so at least at this point if something ever bad happens i know that i have a connection at ibm or i have a connection at target headquarters or i have a connection at intuit or just the biggest companies in the world and the likelihood that i can get a job there is relatively high am i willing to accept that that is the worst case scenario yes i am willing to accept that and so what i do is i go up the scale of like all right where's the lowest that i'm willing to accept now i'm going to lock that that that in as best as i can so now anything that happens above this i am happy and it is only upside and so that's what i like to do to control my emotions when it comes to taking risk
