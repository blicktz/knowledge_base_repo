all right what's up y'all sean here and this is going to be a different type of episode this is a i'm calling a master class so master class didn't invite me to do a master class because i'm not famous um but f them i'm gonna do it myself i know how to do some things really really well one of which is pitching and so if you're listening to this on the podcast feed uh it's gonna be slightly not ideal because i'm gonna share my screen i'm gonna show i'm gonna give away one of my little assets which is my dummy pitch deck so this is literally a template for how i do my pitch decks that is uh for any business that's trying to raise money uh you want to send a deck to an investor and you want to have them understand what you're doing be excited about what you're doing and cut you the check this is a deck that i have used to raise money i have sent to other founders or help them raise money i also in my power writing course this is one of the modules uh this is one of the examples one of the templates i give away so normally people pay a thousand dollars to take that course this is one of the little things in there i'm giving this away for free right now so if you're on the podcast feed you're not going to be able to see my screen so what i recommend you do hit pause open youtube type in my first million that's find our channel subscribe to it and uh and now you um you will be able to see the screen here because it's going to be a lot better with the visuals but if you're on youtube already all right you're here so here's um let's let me pull this up so this is my dummy pitch deck and uh by the way i'm doing this kind of live and improvise i haven't looked at this in a little while so there might be some uh some funky stuff going on but that's okay we'll we'll improvise as we go so the first thing is uh your title and a small subtitle explaining what you do and as we go through this pitch deck i'm going to um write in an example from that that i had done with a founder uh in our power writing course okay so for example uh here with the this is your title so they go we are shooney and i was like okay what the heck is that and they go um you know first they said we are an app for people with insomnia and i said okay that's kind of you know that's that's okay what's a subtitle that says the outcome um and maybe your special sauce and so this is what we landed on so we go they said we are helping millions millions of people fix their insomnia with skills parentheses not pills so that took a little bit of workshopping to get that one-liner but when you have that one-liner feels so good uh when you get that one-liner so i think this is great what are we doing we are out here trying to help millions of people fix their insomnia with skills not pills all right so that's your first line first slide now let's get to the good stuff so this is where you want to you if you have credibility you want to lead with it which is basically in the beginning of any pitch an investor is trying to figure out should i even care should i listen and should i listen is going to come down to one of two things number one um do you have something that i want so that's kind of what the title slide sort of hints at what do you what do you actually do and the second is um or are you somebody that uh is legit are you worth listening to do you have credibility or some some gravity to you about what you've done so if you have accomplishments i like putting that as slide two so a bit of credibility uh if you have some accomplishments set the stage this is your quick intro which sounds polite but it's actually a place to humble brag and um if your company doesn't have accomplishments then skip this slide don't put this here you don't want to lead with i'm not that interesting so uh in shooney's case i go why you know do you have any credibility and they go well our co-founder or a partner is this guy matthew walker who wrote this book why we sleep it's a i was like oh i've heard of that book it's like a bestseller they go yeah exactly so i go perfect so our title became we literally wrote the book on sleep um and then basically i explained um our co-founders you know our founders book why we sleep is a new york time bestseller with over x million copies sold or whatever the thing is um so that's like one of them and then you know the other person and i'm a ai research scientist who has who was responsible for a 500 million dollar plus is a business unit at accenture uh we built this app in five weeks and have uh over you know whatever xxx downloads with zero paid spent right so something like this um you're trying to show that you were highly highly credible and then you know i would put the you know the the um like the title of the book you know the recognizable image or some image here um in in big words and again forget the formatting right like i'm not working on slide design right now that's why i just took the times do roman black font white slide because i'm not worried about design that will come at the end we'll do that later for now it's what is the story what is the storyline that's going to get somebody hooked so here we're saying uh we have a compelling initial thing we're helping millions of people fix insomnia with skills not pills secondly we're legit you should listen to us we literally wrote the book on sleep one of the best sellers we wrote that i'm a good business person an engineer that's the dynamic duo that's going to build this thing okay great so now you're going to say most customers have this problem and it's going to be backed by either really compelling data or a personal story um and so you know i'm going to just copy paste kind of what i did for them here so most customers have this problem for that we did 25 of americans have have insomnia that's 75 million people right and then we added to that the personal story so that became including me i had insomnia for years i tried pills but felt yucky i tried to sense the oils that did nothing finally i found something that worked okay so this is your problem slide your problem slide with a big headline number that punches you in the face shows how big of a problem it is and ideally maybe a personal connection to it i had this problem i knew this problem i either i had this problem or i was a doctor and i saw thousands of patients who had this problem i've helped treat thousands of patients found this problem right so something like that that connects you to the problem is ideal and then you want to do the current solution so before what people are tempted to do is say here's my solution here's why we're so great um instead you want to say here's how they try to fix it today so what we did for this was we said so how we solve it today we did americans spend 75 billion dollars per year on sleep aids to try to fix their sleep problems they barely work they have side effects and they're mostly using fake science right so that's what we put as the uh the secondary thing here um and then here i would maybe put some images of the categories right so i would put like uh you know whatever some shape here so let me get a little shape i'd be like uh you know pills or you know sleeping sleeping pills is x billion dollars um whatever you know nasal strips is this you know whatever the whatever the other sleep aids you know essential oils or whatever people use to solve this problem so i would kind of show they try a b and c none of that shit works and this is where you now come in with the steve jobs moment you get your turtleneck on and you say but what if instead there was a simpler solution a beautiful solution a solution that totally fixed this problem with no downsides whatsoever right this is essentially what you're going to say and so um you know this is where for them we basically came in and we said um you know instead here's our solution you know instead we built an app that will uh teach you how to sleep without having to take medicine so that's the headline that would come here and then beautiful picture of your product um and then you you kind of reinforce it right like that's us we do that thing um you know so if you if you gave a hypothetical here like what if there was an app that did blake blake blake then you say that's us we do that thing or in this case just put it all on one side that's fine now here's a key thing that most people miss so what they do typically is they go solution and then they just go solution solution solution they just start talking about how the solution works under the hood everything about the solution as an investor you don't need to know how the whole product works yet you instead need to know is this big am i going to make money right that's what the receiver of this presentation really wants to know am i betting on credible people are they solving a big problem does their solution make sense and how big can this get so now we go here we state the dream so we explain the big plan the big vision for how big this company could become you know this is where you might say we're we're building uber for freight trucking right that's like we're building this big thing in this big industry um that's a hundred billion dollar industry that's totally broken um you know so i so as an investor i'm thinking wow if they actually fix this problem that would be a big deal um so you know for these guys what they did was we said this our dream what calm and headspace you know two billion dollar company one billion dollar company did for meditation we are going to do for insomnia depression and anxiety and then you know we then added the sort of subtext these are 200 billion dollar annual markets it's 50 times bigger than meditation um and then we we follow on again we make this even more persuasive so you want to anchor it to something that they already know and then you want to um so why did we use headspace and calm or why do we use it's uber for x uh because it anchors it to something they understand something that they know right we're building you know i built an esports app and i said we're building little league baseball for fortnight or for esports okay little league baseball produces x hundred million dollars a year um we're going to be able but but more people play fortnight than play baseball this is going to be a bigger business than even the little league is and so we were able to take something that sounded very niche right like youth esports but make it sound a lot bigger by pitching it connecting it to something that's already big and then saying we're doing that but in this big space so um so you know here's here's where this slide landed people with these illnesses are sick of taking pills for every problem we can get clinically verified results with habit-based app therapy um and i think the key here is what this thing you recognize did for the x we're doing for y y is much bigger than x 50 times bigger than x and people really have this problem all right so now you're going to get to your traction slide again as an investor i'm trying to figure out is this actually going to work the easiest way to answer that question is to say it's already working look at this shit so so far so good and this is where you put an impressive chart um so your what is your hero chart how can you show that this thing is working so what is your what is your most hero metric and this is where pitching can't save you if your chart sucks your pitch is going to kind of suck um you know no pitch can fix a terrible business you shouldn't be pitching a terrible business you should be pitching a business that's working or going to work and so you want to if it's already working you want to show that if it's going to work you want to say why you believe it's going to work maybe you have a wait list that's really big maybe um you have a track record of doing this with other products um you know what can you show that would give me faith that this isn't all just talk there's some evidence so this is where you put your hero chart now you go back to under the hood so now you're going to say all right now you're interested correct i told you the problem the solution the big vision of how big this can be and the evidence that we're on our way so now what you're going to do is you're going to say let me tell you how we're different right uh does this already exist is this really that different than anything else and this is where you're going to highlight your differentiator what most people do is they just explain their features that's not what you want to do you want to say everybody does x and we do y right that's the core differentiator so let me tell you how our approach is different yet sensible uh others do x we do y and this is where you're talking about either your product strategy your business model your growth strategy etc right everybody else charges for this stuff we give it to them at cost but we have a annual subscription that's costco um it might be product you know everybody else tries to solve this problem with pills we do it with skills through this app that teaches you daily habits right um everybody else tries to grow through paid marketing but we do youtube content that gets millions of views and therefore we're able to you know acquire customers for pennies where everybody else is paying ten dollars right this is the the type of thing that you're going to do product business model or growth strategy how are you different than everybody else our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better now we zoom out is there a bigger trend that you're a part of again this is all about instilling confidence confidence confidence confidence um our you know one way to instill confidence is we're not alone doing this this is something that you're seeing the whole world is moving remote um you know the you know the way that peloton did this for fitness we're doing this over here in this other space so you want to be able to zoom out and show that you're part of a bigger trend so in their case i asked them this question i said what bigger trends are you you guys a part of and they ended up telling me we didn't we didn't design this slide but there's three big trends one is app-based coaching calm headspace they've proven that people will do app-based coaching the next one is telemedicine there are billion-dollar companies now that people are comfortable getting doctors a doctor's advice over the phone and lastly is that insomnia depression anxiety are rising due to technology overload the pandemic the recession the whatever else and so we are we are surfing these big waves we're not the big wave ourself we are surfing the big waves now you want to answer the why now question so can you explain why this ideal would work today but it wouldn't work three years ago five years ago or ten years ago what has changed did a rule change did uh technology change did social behaviors change and so um you know for example in their case when we brainstormed and again it's not about slide design it's about being able to make a persuasive case and so each of these slides is part of your persuasive case this is your why now so why now well this wouldn't have worked five years ago regulation did not allow for digital therapy with licensed doctors so there's a regulatory inflection point also in the last two years due to covid everybody had to have a telemedicine experience we went from 10 of people having tried telemedicine to 80 in two years so the whole world got to sample this and now has an experience doing this there are going to be more comfortable today than they would have been you know x years ago okay why are you the one to do it what's your track record your credibility your expertise you want to reinforce what we did up top or if you didn't write that up top you want to write it here so this is your why why you um okay now the business part how do you make money doing this if i give you some money you know uh what will happen and so this is where um usually i actually kind of left one out here so what i would do here is i would separate these i would do how the money gets made this is where you do your unit economics so you show that you've actually thought this through that the business is sensible uh you know we put in x dollars it costs us y to produce the product or service and z is the the net profit at the end of at the end of it and so you know for these guys they were able to say we make a hundred dollars per session at 25 net margin here's our uh and then they had a graph of their user unit economics and their payback period so they their payback period was um they acquire users for x dollars and that means they break even in three months on that user so that's a three months is a good good payback period so that's the unit economics side now you're going to do the uh what milestones will you hit so if i give you this money how will you make this the um uh how will you make this the the big um you know the big big results so you know here's you know you know how will you make progress so that the valuation goes up and my shares become worth more uh so you know this is what we came up with for them which was they're raising two million to do their pilots to get our first 5 000 paying customers key drivers uh allow people uh in from the you know what are we going to do to get there we're going to allow people in from the wait list we're going to hire three more coaches and we're going to roll out our company plan that lets corporations buy this for their employees so those are the key things we're going to do to get to 1 million arr and now i'm telling you if you give me two million dollars i'll turn that into 1 million of annual recurring revenue um also on the uh why you we had a good version of it for them uh so you know i'm a fan of being bold with this stuff so we're the team for this we're world-renowned sleep experts and ai engineers instead and we wrote this instead of trying to get people to play eight hours of candy crush uh per day we've decided to help people help everyone get gets better sleep at night right so i kind of like this this vocal style of being a little bit ballsy not everybody loves that um and sure it could turn some people off but you want to attract the type of investor that uh likes you and so you know as long as you attract as long as some people love it it's okay that some people hate it you you you know as long as just not everybody hates it um all right now this is one thing i see a lot of people miss out on sweeten the pot so you want to take some of your good news and move 15 of it to the end of the end of the show so what can you save for the end it's like your little good news dessert at the end of the at the end of the thing so um for them their pot sweetener was this whoops um they said one last thing we just secured a partnership with nih they're going to be giving us 500 000 in this round no dilution there's over 2 billion in sleep funding grants available and we will tap into this as we grow nice uh just a little bit of good news at the end that shows more momentum more progress a key partnership you just had uh maybe it's a revenue milestone or it's um you know some some key thing that's that you didn't put in your main traction you just took a little bit of good news out saved it for the end to leave them on a high note and this is at the end call to action so get in touch um you know we're closing out this round if you're interested email me here uh here's my email address that's the that's my dummy pitch
