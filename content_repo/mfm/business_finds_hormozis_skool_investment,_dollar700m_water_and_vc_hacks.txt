it's insane i think it's insane and brilliant that's a good nobody knows about this account by the way this account only has 750 followers so i kind of maybe i'm blowing up my own spot here all right what's up it's time for the first ever friday quickie this is a little idea me and sam had where we share basically the little things that we saw this week that were either the best article the best tweets the best um you know a little video that we saw normally this is stuff we just only share in our group chat um and we wanted to try it out on the pot showing it to each other i don't know what he's going to say he doesn't know what i'm going to say we each have three so we're going to do a list of six things let's run through it uh sam you want to go all right you want to go first oh jinx i'll do i'll do when i have a quick one so this is a genius deal flow hack you ever heard about how hedge fund traders will like move their servers to be as close as possible to the pipe or they'll use a certain kind of wire so that the trades get executed faster i used to hear all these things about like how in traditional finance people would go to crazy lengths just to get that little edge that little extra edge and i always felt a little sad that us you know the soft boys of silicon valley we don't really do that we're all nice paying it forward just blogging everything that we know there's no like kind of uh you know real secrecy the real ruthless secrecy about things until i saw this so our buddy sully tweeted this out that there is a company that started to help vcs improve their deal flow so he was like basically every vc knows deal flow matters normally the way you do it is you're hosting dinners or conferences or you go on podcasts or you make you know a patagonia vest that you give away shit like that but they're like the problem is you're you don't know what deals you're not hearing about so what if there was a way where you could know about the deals you're not hearing about so what they did was some company basically puts a photographer in front of the offices of like sequoia and andreason and all these like the top funds is this real or an idea i think this is real so when people are leaving the office they're like hey do you want a picture in front of the sequoia thing i'll send it to you they take a picture because it's a great moment for the entrepreneur oh this is when we pitch sequoia and they're like great what's the name of your company and they're like awesome and they basically sell that list to all the other funds it's like hey did you know these guys are out raising they were talking to sequoia and um he's like he's like i heard about this and i thought it was amazing genius deal flow hack he's like the vc who told me about it was like we don't pay for this but i know it exists and others do um i think that's brilliant what do you think i think it's brilliant i think it's insane i think it's insane and brilliant there there's another version of this that i follow there's a twitter account called like stealth something and it's anytime somebody who had like working on something new or stealth blah blah blah anytime they change that to like the name of a project it immediately tweets out this person just announced they're doing this thing and so you could reach out to them be like hey you know that's really cool i like what you're doing what's the name of that handle all right so that account is called stealth co spy so if you go to at stealth co spy it's a real-time notification of any time like people it also tracks like linkedin like if you leave a company that they consider like a high trajectory like fast growth startup it's like this person's leaving to do something new and you could see it so like for example the last tweet was julia is now building in stealth mode uh she's the ex data science director from github and now and she lives in boston here's her linkedin she just announced she just posted that she's she's working on something new that's in stealth this is awesome or it'll be like noah comes out of stealth he's got a platform for no code sdk tooling for enterprise llm applications here's the link here's his linkedin this is awesome all right that's a good nobody knows about this account by the way this account only has 750 followers so i kind of maybe i'm blowing up my own spot here this is a good find there's also that for when people remove their employer off of their twitter handle or their linkedin and they'll be like this person is now available i like this um all right let me give you another one so i was reading reddit the other day and i found this old post it's over a year old do you remember jake cassan or casson i don't actually know how to say his last name but jake so we started movement watches and they were one of the first like d2c guys to go big and so they started this company where they sold watches they got popular on instagram i think he sold it for a hundred million dollars then there was another hundred million dollar earn out which i'm not sure if they hit or not but the company was bootstrapped so he made north of 50 million i would imagine i found this post i don't know why he did this but he did and i think it's great but he didn't really talk about it on social media but i found this on this subreddit called find a path for those who have a hobby passion or a passing win that they want to make a living out of but don't know how they can get there so that's the the description of the subreddit but he's got this description or this post on the subreddit and says i sold my company movement a few years ago for a lot of money and thought all my problems would be solved i made my life really cushy and comfortable and i optimized to be as stress-free as possible and then he goes on to say that he's new to this subreddit and he's still trying to find out what he's what he wants to do to his with his life and that he set up his life to be easy and now it's been two years since he sold the company and he's 31 single he never has to work again but he's never been lonelier and depressed or depressed than ever and he basically talks about what he's trying to do in order to find his passion and i think that what's interesting about this post is a people never talk about this type of stuff like publicly where they put their name on it and they truly say how they feel that's fascinating and b he like you see his replies of people saying like asking him different questions and he goes through really detailed replies of what he's trying to do so he's like i love video editing and making movies so now i bought a camera and i've been sure and i took a youtube class and i'm trying to learn how to take pictures and film new videos and chop them up or whatever and it's super fascinating to see behind the scenes of someone who's young i think he was 29 when he sold so 29 worth tens of millions of dollars he's pretty lonely he's depressed and it's really fascinating to see someone break all this down i thought this was a really really fascinating reddit post that i didn't see shared anywhere i love this um i thought it was awesome i saw it because somebody on twitter goes i wonder what the guys who like crushed it in the early wave of ecom are doing now i bet they're just killing it somebody tweeted this and then this other guy goes actually i just saw this post on reddit this is a year ago he's like i saw this post on reddit from the founder movement saying exactly what he's been doing and actually you know he's been kind of wandering and trying to figure it out um and then i read this thing i was like dude that's the magic of the internet someone just tweeting a random question somebody else being like oh here's the obscure reddit post that's like filled with you know the answer to your question and also just that this guy you know i almost felt bad i didn't bring this up on the pod because i was like it's kind of personal it's kind of personal maybe he doesn't want this like you know on blast i mean he posted it publicly on reddit so i guess it's fair game but he's being very vulnerable he's like you know i'm loner than ever i'm deeply depressed and i'm trying to figure it out um but props to him for for doing that and doing it with his name on it because he could have very easily just like done this same thing and just say i sold my company he didn't have to say who he was um so you know respect to him for doing that i really really appreciated that i think it's awesome i think that this is a problem that not a lot of people go through but it's really fun to for people who are dreaming of making money or who want to sell the company what happens on the other side you know i think someone described this thing as called the second mountain so you've climbed the first mountain but you still need another mountain to climb and and he talks about they're like why don't you start another company he was like well in the past money and ego were the huge motivators for me and i kind of those motivators are gone now and so whatever i do next i need to find fulfillment and to help others in some way and so i think it's really interesting um all right what do you got all right number three i'm gonna do the hormosi bump okay so uh alex hormosi a friend of the pod good dude he bought a company recently school from another guy who has been on the pod talking about school the original founder of it sam ovens so that's like his new thing and that was like he's he tweeted out he's like this is the biggest bet i've ever made uh you know i'm investing a bunch of money into this and now he's wearing a school hat on every interview he goes on and every video he creates and he's you know trying to promote school it's an awesome product school's really good i haven't uh i've never used it you actually used it yeah it's a good product that guy sam is very savvy and it's a very good product yeah and so basically it's a um it's like a community building tools people you can make create a paid community and people can join it on there um it looks like it's heavy and like the like affiliate marketing like drop shipping type of game when i went and browsed like the top communities that were on the site or whatever um anyways i think it's a it's a good good investment so i was curious how much of a bump do you think school got in web traffic after her mozi did it because obviously he's doing it with this belief that hey i've just spent two years plus building my audience huge audience um of entrepreneurial people and i'm going to invest in this thing and then i'm going to try to use my weight to drive traffic so i can you know this is very much the same strategy i've used which is you could buy something at a fair price knowing that you have a growth lever to bring more traffic to the site so i'm curious how much do you think it went up so i'll give you the um the before yeah what was the before before was let's say uh web traffic was in let's say three months ago if i was let's say no one two three four five five months ago was at about eight million in in monthly monthly visitors what do you think it is i would guess i would have guessed 10 or 12. all right everyone a quick break to tell you about hubspot and this one's easy because i'm going to show you an example of how i'm doing this at my company when i say i i mean not my team i mean i'm the one who actually made it so i've got this company called hampton you can check it out joinhampton.com it's a community for founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and i went and made a landing page so you can check it out at joinhampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that i made and the hard part with this is with hampton we are appealing to a sort of a higher-end customer sort of like like a louis vuitton or ferrari so i needed the landing page to look a very particular way hubspot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their landing page builder and it's super simple i'm not technical and i'm the one who actually made it and once it's made i then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and i can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that i did this is where the revenue came from so it came from twitter it came from linkedin whatever it came from i can actually go and look at it and i can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this i highly suggest it look i'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of youtube and get started all right now back to mfm okay so it went from eight million to in january it looks like spiked at almost 17 million according to like similar web which is not exactly accurate but directionally correct um so almost double the about double double the traffic for that month now a lot of it is people just coming and checking it out because of the announcement it's not like necessarily the most sustainable thing but let's now look uh wow so go mostly through february so what's the february numbers looking like but check this out so circle dot circle dot so i think they're called circle.co or circle.so they're a community platform that's a competitor to school they've raised i think tens of millions of dollars school has more than double their traffic they had doubled their traffic before they even took the money right that's insane and sam actually told me and he posted it on their about page that he has invested 10 million dollars of his own money which i i think was a large percentage of his money that he had into making school reality yeah it's interesting what these are so i just sorted by paid so you can see it's the digital growth community which is like basically internet marketing number two mark's manifestation thing pay 49 a month and you join his thing it's got 284 members um digital wealth academy right it's like it's a lot of the like uh the adonis school like-minded men who want to live the adonis lifestyle right it's like a lot of like andrew tady type stuff uh which i find interesting but it's cool because you know i think you've done a bunch of paid communities on facebook and now slack and other places uh you didn't use this for hampton right no because when we started i didn't know enough about it and i didn't think it'd be any good but then i met sam the guy who started it and we were already on slack but i was like oh you actually are really smart i should have i i kind of regret not using it and i have nothing to do with this company but i thought it was awesome but they have a bunch of like non-businessy stuff so there's like a stuff on like style and clothing and then there's one on meditation so there's stuff on non-business stuff it's just it's like anything aspirational you would want right so what do you whatever you want you want a better body you want a better style you want better you know finances whatever it is that's how you get there i think it's a great move also just in general the business model of i take a kind of crappy but high volume business model which is let's say media but i use it to buy assets in the best business model sas which is what he did right so he converted his youtube fame which doesn't pay very well into owning a sas asset which is like one of the sas is one of the best business models out there so good move by alex uh on that one and congrats to to all involved on the on the big spike i hung out with sam ovens once my wife and i we were at a restaurant with him or some kind of a bar or something and we were just talking and sam ovens is he's a wonderful person but he's uh he's almost a little awkward like he's he's really awkward in the sense of he's comfortable with silence and it got to the part of the conversation you're like turns out i'm awkward yeah yeah he's he's actually kind of normal i guess yeah it was me and it got to the point the conversation where there was some silence and i was just like i was just like i'm gonna sit in this for a minute let's just see what this feels like let's sit in this silence and so we sit and we finish the conversation and there's about five seconds and he goes i delivered my baby you know and he's he's from new zealand and i was like uh what what do you mean you delivered your baby with what he goes my hands and he tells a story about how like his wife went into labor and uh like the paramedics couldn't make it in time and he's like i just he delivered it but on his own and uh it was a and he just threw that out there and i was like oh i would join a paid community of him just sending me a voice note every morning of that yeah that was like that was like the silence breaker was i delivered my baby and i just thought it was awesome i was like you're the best person i've ever met all right let me show you another one there's this tweet i saw her name is julia chang all right so this uh she just shared this woman uh on instagram named amanda wolf so she goes through what she does is she gets people to share their finances and then she like is a personal uh finance wizard or something like that and so she writes out all the all i don't know what do they call these people she's some sort of magician she's a witch i don't know whatever you call these people but it's normally like people who are making like 80 grand a year and then she talks about like you know this looks normal this doesn't work look normal she got this couple that's 39 and 37 years old a husband and wife one's an attorney one's a cio their net income or their personal income is 3.7 million dollars they live in alpine new jersey and their expenses each month are roughly 77 000 and they break through or they break down what their expenses are so the biggest one being mortgage 29 000 utilities 1200 but then it gets to like some wild stuff so where does it say they're uh oh the 29 000 mortgage wasn't wild that's wild that's wild but but but but a 29 000 mortgage i think that's what it costs to have a like four million dollar house i mean so that i i guess that makes sense but their personal trainers are four grand a month and she breaks down all these expenses and i thought it was really fascinating to see kind of like what these people are spending on and like basically how you can make almost four million dollars a year and you're not really saving a lot of money at all it's pretty ridiculous how much these people spend and so they they are able to invest so they invest like something like a million dollars a year so that's a ton of money but then she kind of like uh shows that off in a weird way where she's like look they only have twenty three hundred dollars left over each month after they invest a million dollars each year uh but it's kind of ridiculous to see like these expenses sorry the mortgage for 29 000 is 5.2 million dollars at a 4.25 uh interest rate but pretty crazy right to like see these expenses of 80 grand a month and so what does she do i see it all written out with nice handwriting here does she just like cross it out at the end and be like no start over change change this like what is the what's the punchline of this what does she take what's the takeaway well her takeaway was just basically like i don't think her takeaway is important just like crazy right yeah it was just like crazy i mean i don't think that the the takeaway her takeaway is actually that interesting to me but i do think that four grand a month of personal trainers is ridiculous but a nanny ten thousand dollars uh their kids school twenty five hundred dollars kids tutors and coach is three thousand dollars my takeaway is just i if they live in alpine new jersey i bet they work in manhattan then just that lifestyle out there even if you are making close to four million dollars a year it is really hard to get uh terminal velocity out to the point where you don't actually have to work anymore so in order to uh in order to not work and spend a million dollars a year you have to have something like 25 million liquid i think that would be the number right around there if you want to withdraw three percent of your money every month a year sorry a year and so in order to like actually save up that amount of money even when you're earning almost four million dollars in the manhattan area really really challenging if you live the life like these types of people and i thought that was wild yeah i think that's the key is if you if you want to spend twenty nine thousand dollars a month on your mortgage if you want to spend ten grand on your nanny another you know basically eight grand on miscellaneous and personal trainer six thousand a month on shopping right like the shopping is separate from like just on shopping fun and dining out is four grand four grand and six grand right so like 14 grand a month on shopping fun and dining out um i don't know if you're not having fun with the shopping and dining out maybe don't have another maybe don't spend another 4k on the fun right like you gotta this is just excessive spending for that level of income i think i agree but it's just interesting i think a lot of people who earn that amount of money by the way i think they spend that way i think the real takeaway of this is whoever posted this is just good at social media they're like how do i enrage everybody okay let me post this um because all this does this is just engagement bait right you're just everyone in the comments is just like oh man what the fuck like i can't believe this this is not real these people are so out of touch they get like so angry about it dude i know so many people who live like this by the way i know a lot of people who live like this who make multi-millions and they spend almost all of it i know a lot of people who earn millions of dollars a year and they still live almost paycheck to paycheck it sounds crazy but i know people like having dumb friends you know you are the average of those five people you're spending time with those five idiots that are somehow burning four million a year dude it's insane man if you live in the east coast man it's insane you spend a lot um all right you do one and then i have one more all right my last one uh quick one did you see this liquid death marketing campaign that they did no oh okay genius so super bowl was a couple weeks ago and they were like hey all right how do we we want to do an ad we want to hijack this moment of this marketing moment but we don't want to buy a six million dollar super bowl ad so they they go they put on ebay um they they called it the biggest ad ever and they go we have a national run of half a million liquid death cases and it's the side of this box and you can have this ad space it costs you six million bucks to get in front of 110 million people on the super bowl but 200 million people are going to walk through the doors of these retailers and see see our uh our liquid debt thing pretty big leap of faith by the way that all of those people who attend a grocery store will look at this ad but whatever and they auctioned it off coinbase ends up buying this thing for half a million bucks so they get first like pump one of pr in the marketing community um because marketers are like oh so smart then pump two was coinbase actually pays them five hundred thousand dollars to buy the ad space so they got 500 grand off this thing that was just excess inventory for them anyways and then pump three was the news that somebody actually bought it and they got three hits out of this thing very smart marketing by liquid death dude the guy who started liquid death he came on our podcast i think two years ago so they were getting going but they were still big but they weren't this big and if i remember correctly his background was he worked at an agency and my takeaway from the podcast was basically when you're selling water the product's not that important it's just water and i don't think it tastes particularly different than any other water but he was just like i'm really good at advertising and i'm going to do all these funny things in order to get eyeballs and i would not have predicted that that would have worked and it has he's he's he's completely crushed it his name's mike uh i don't know his last name actually i just remember him being i don't know how you pronounce it uh but if you can go back and listen to that pot it's really good he was really fascinating yeah that was a few years ago and they were a lot smaller than now they're like prepping for an ipo or something like that it's pretty crazy um i don't know how healthy the business is but it definitely went way further than i ever thought it would probably way further than you ever thought it would too because it's basically the bet was we're just going to be incredible at marketing like that was the entire bet was uh yeah it's water um and then we're going to be absolutely incredible world-class at marketing and that'll be the thing and they pulled it off props to them all right here's the last one so i found this article it was from house of fresh.com so if you if you google house of fresh and then david and goliath you'll see this article but i'm going to tell you what uh why i was interested in this so do you ever use review sites like decide which product you want to buy not anymore but i did for a long time me too i did for a long time and i started diving deep on on this and i was like okay so how does buzzfeed like which is like a i don't even know what their specialty is know which air purifier is best like i don't know if they can actually test all this stuff and i started noticing that there's all these websites like menshealth.com and a whole bunch of other stuff reviewing products or posting like this is the 10 best these items and i'm like i don't think that they actually review these things but maybe i'll trust them well i read this article and at this point i'm not going to trust any of them so let me give you like a little breakdown so this company that wrote this house of fresh.com they're a small company and all they do is they review air purifiers and that's all they do and they're like a missionary in the mercenary game meaning most of the people who review air purifiers they're just like buzzfeed and they're just like look we can rank on google so we're just gonna like read a bunch of amazon reviews and we're gonna like whatever pick the one that looks best and we're gonna put that at the top of our list whereas these other guys house of fresh they actually buy the products and they don't they're not given it so they're not like owed uh good coverage to any of the uh manufacturers and they test it out whatever well they did this big article explaining how review sites work and so the takeaway is basically 16 companies so it's like meredith uh which owns a whole bunch of uh different magazines dot dash which owns a whole bunch of stuff buzzfeed um penske media who we talked about in a podcast uh they own all this stuff and they basically 16 media companies get 3 billion clicks per month and they basically dominate uh google and it's really hard for any small company getting into the review space in order to they can't actually rank high because these 16 companies control the whole thing but this article went and dived deep into how they're doing reviews they basically hire a freelancer just to like go out and do whatever and then they post the article on their websites but then they own like they each own like 50 different websites they'll post it across all the other websites and they don't actually show how they're doing the reviews and the takeaway is that they're really likely what they're doing is they just go to amazon and they just review what amazon people have actually said and they just aggregate those curate them and put that into their article and it's not a great way in order to like find out actually what's best because you're trusting someone else versus going out and doing the research and i read this article and my takeaway was two things one i don't trust any website now that's doing reviews but number two i only trust a few of them there are a few so i used to trust wirecutter now i'm nervous about trusting them because they're owned by the new york times and so it's owned by much larger companies so i think they have different incentives besides that there's very few companies out there who i trust for reviews i go to reddit but that's even hard but i think there's actually an opportunity to create some type of trusted review website i don't know how exactly you could do that and get big but i'm pretty certain you could still do that while remaining small but there's a whole bunch of like these niche websites that used to uh talk about really interesting stuff there was one for vpns there was one for mattress companies and then the mattress company like casper did or the large vpn companies they go and actually buy the review sites and they put their link up top and so at this point i'm skeptical of the entire industry and this may be not trust any reviews and i've already written written lots of articles about how amazon reviews most of them or a lot of them are total bullshit i used to have friends that would make products and they'd be like hey i'm gonna make this product free on amazon will you buy it so you it says that you're a proper uh customer and then just give me five stars it's all a circle jerk and i don't trust any of the reviews online at this point and it's it makes me very skeptical 100 agree this is crazy um it's gotten completely out of hand this is uh so it's the main way that like or not the main way it's one of the major ways that news sites actually stay in business is that they basically sell their seo juice to the highest bidder this is for everything like what you're talking about air purifiers but also mattresses but also everything it's it's all just seo hacks so for example if you want to find the best mattress and you google best mattress you're not going to find the best mattress you're going to find who is the best at seo which mattress company is the most aggressive at seo is the only answer you get when you google best mattress and i'm totally with you i wish there was a better solution to this because there's more products than ever and you do want to find out if they're any good or which one to buy it's just that you can't really trust any of the current solutions i actually think that there's probably something you could do with a combination of video and subscription so what i would do is i would say hey we're coming out we're calling out the bs that exists in this space we're going to do a subscription product you pay for this and you're going to get access to like the super high quality reviews only like conscious consumers will do it and so you start small but again it's like the athletic so you're going to get people to actually care enough to pay um and then you tell them like look because you pay now you get no bias in the uh in the results we are not going to take affiliate commissions anywhere i think if you drew the line there there would be a market for that um maybe you could even let people sort of share their subscriptions so that a bunch of people could you know chip in and basically say cool i want access to and it's 100 bucks for all of us in order to make the economics work um i completely agree that's the solution is somebody's got to say i'm going to choose a different business model i'm not going to get paid on my affiliate links and that's the person that would end up getting trusted because their incentive is not to just push you know affiliate products you know how there's that uh infographic or image where it's uh where it shows that like four companies or five companies own like 80 of the food in the grocery store yes that's what this article has they have one of those infographics where it's basically 16 media or 16 media companies hurts dot dash bustle ziff davis the arena group red ventures and a handful of others and it shows all of the companies and titles that they own and you scroll through this and you're like those are all supposed to be the reputable ones and i'm like i don't trust any of this anymore and so it almost makes me a little bit of a conspiracy theorist when it comes to this stuff and it completely ruins like my my browsing experience because now i see this stuff and i'm like i can never go to those websites in order to get reviews and so kind of opened up my eyes it's kind of interesting uh you can see it house of fresh just google house of fresh david versus goliath very fascinating article that has kind of changed my opinion on review sites and they do a huge breakdown all right is that the pod for our what are we calling it quickie friday the quickie the quickie all right that's it that's the pod cool so okay so okay
