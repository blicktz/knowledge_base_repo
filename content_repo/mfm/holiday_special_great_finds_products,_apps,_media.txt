what is it about this writing style that's so slippery that i just can't get it's like a tick tock feed i can't get out of it you know and so i would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this you can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens all right we're live cool sweatshirt um what's going on oh dude i already told you i couldn't i can't talk about it on on air but i am uh you know there's some days where a fire there's a fire on the third floor and you got to grab the extinguisher and go put it out and so that's what i've been doing today is putting out and i'm glad that i did this which is we had a bunch of family coming in town for thanksgiving wife was like oh yeah it's great we got my sister coming we got this person coming this person's coming from india it's like oh god okay um she's like you know we should host thanksgiving i said you know i love the giving spirit i love the idea but we're not hosting anything on thanksgiving why because we have an e-commerce company and black friday is the biggest sales day of the year and she said well what are we gonna do like you know it's just gonna sell online like we're not gonna go to the warehouse or something and go fulfill it you know so what do we do i said sometimes you got to create space because you just want to be available you want to have buffer you don't want to be fully booked in case you need to do it maybe you have an idea that something you could do to drive sales or in this case what if absolutely hit the fan and you had to do something to recover which is exactly what happened today i created space my coo was like oh i'm just gonna go pick this person up from the airport that day it should be no problem guess what she's in the car the shits hitting the fan and she can't get to a computer and she did not create enough space and so that was a great that's an evolution for you because you are not the man at creating space i was not a space creator uh that's that's come with you know some gray hairs and wisdom is is this idea so i'm glad i did it because shits hitting the fan today and you know i'm just hoping that i told you before this i'm hoping that uh you know my my safety my savings my under the mattress savings of good luck needs to be cashed in today i'm just i'm reaching under the mattress i'm hoping it's still there i feel like i put it there i'm hoping that good luck is still there i need it today well okay so i've got so what we're gonna i we're gonna talk about products and media that we like but and i have a couple i got one thing in particular that's gonna make a difference on your day today actually okay um we can talk about it later but so today's episode is we're gonna talk about products and media that we've consumed throughout the year that we think are cool because i like talking about gadgets and and media and so do you um the stuff that you talked about laps last episode was actually quite amazing uh that article about um uh data and how it's easy to uh read data incorrectly kind of like a great find it's kind of is that the idea great finds these are exactly lines we've had this year whether it's a product or it's a piece of content great finds i think that's in the the thanksgiving spirits like you know being thankful for it but also people have time over they hopefully people are creating a little space you know you spend some family time and uh but but people have time over the holidays and there's a good chance to either buy this as a gift for yourself for somebody else or to just check something out that you haven't tried before all right well let's start do you uh you name one and i'll name one or i can name a couple what do you want to do okay let's do let's do i think we both have an app that we really like uh two different apps so let's do the category of apps so what's a great find you had that's an app this year okay unfortunately a lot of things i might name are going to involve fitness a lot of them are going to be money really this influencer life bro like a lot of them will be money related though actually and relaxation and mindset so uh the first one zero it's called zero i believe kevin rose started it okay so i i never thought that i was intermittent in fasting but in order just not to overeat throughout the day i just wouldn't eat breakfast turns out that's called intermittent fast is that i but that's not why i did it um this app called zero it's free they have a paid version which honestly i don't think it does anything but the free version you you you say when you had your last meal and it just tells you don't eat until and then you uh in my case it's 16 hours it's awesome i love it i can't believe how that one app actually makes me want to stick to it as opposed to when i'm on my own so that's that app has made a meaningful change in my day what are you fasting you're doing uh 16 8 are you doing more intense than that i do i do 16 8 so basically i'll stop eating at 8 p.m and i'll eat again at noon right so six that means 16 hours not eating eight hours eating and when you eat in your eight hours are you like you know eating kale salads or you eat whatever you want in those eight hours what do you i don't eat whatever i want i usually eat meat and vegetables that's what i work hard to do size or no portion sizing within that eight hours you're fine you just eat until you're full um yeah i i portion control yeah definitely i i eat very yeah for sure i try to eat 2500 calories a day good good um all right so i have uh anything else on zero i think that's a that's a good one i have i've tried that as well uh i like it it's a super clean interface it's like i like apps that just do one thing really well and that's what that does um okay here's an app i think i've talked about this but i got big into breathwork and so uh there's two apps that if you want to have kind of like a happier life there's a lot of apps that will distract you instagram tick tock whatever there's apps that will make you more productive but they'll distract you from the real world that's like email slack maybe twitter um and then there's apps that actually center you and ground you and so my phone had enough of the distraction apps i had enough of the productivity apps where i was lacking was hey how can i use this magic wand that's how i think of my phone it's a magic wand i make i just i install an app and that's like a spell that i just could do some magic thing i can get food to appear at my doorstep or i can you know summon a car or i can do all kinds of different crazy stuff i can put my you know my mom thousands of miles away her face can show up on my phone well this one gets me grounded and so there's two apps i want to call out one i think we've talked about before it's called the five minute journal um i ended up meeting the guy who who made this app i didn't know that was an app i thought it was a notebook there is a notebook and then there's the app apps i think that's cool it's a paid app i think it's three bucks or five bucks or something like that which is so funny because when i saw that i was like i don't pay for apps i was like wow like my threshold for paying for on a phone is so low compared to like you know right a parking it's a parking meter but i get to use this app forever that some guy created and coded and makes it do all these things so five bucks and what it does is you open it up and it basically just has a quote while it loads it's always a good quote they do they have good selection and then it basically says one of three things you're grateful for today and the act of writing those down is great this looks great um you know not to get super cheesy but basically the more grateful you are the less stressed you are you cannot be grateful and stressed at the same time you cannot be grateful and afraid at the same time you cannot be grateful and angry at the same time so if you just want to not be any of those bad things just focus on being grateful rather than not being whatever it's like when you tell somebody relax when they're really pissed off guess what they don't really relax very well so you're telling somebody to not be angry or not be stressed doesn't work but telling but getting somebody to shift their focus to being grateful works actually really well what questions does it ask just says what three what three things happened today that you're grateful for and it's today it's things that happened today not like what are three things in your life that you're grateful for and you just sort of monotonously you say my health my family and my friends it's like no what happened today that i'm grateful for what's a moment of today then it forces you to slow down time because you're like what did i even eat for lunch today what did i do today and then you're like you think of one thing and you're like god there must have been something more than that that i'm grateful for you kind of suck at it the first day and you suck at it the second day by the third day something happens during the day and you're like ah i'm gonna write this in the app tonight um like that's the thing and so it forces you during the day to actually take note of what you're grateful for which makes you a more grateful person all right that's so uh let me just tell you something really quick so andrew huberman one of the things on my list andrew huberman recently had a new video come up come out called the science of gratitude and how to build a gratitude practice andrew huberman was on our podcast he's got this amazing pod youtube channel where he talks about the science behind different things and how you can use it to help you and his latest thing is on gratitude and he says that he's been doing gratitude and i don't want to get into the science but basically there's something about like the prefrontal cortex and how gratitude actually releases dopamine and it's proven to make you more motivated and happy and he said a lot of people including him did exactly what you did and he goes i think that works but we have loads of studies that show that the actually slightly more effective way is to do one of two things and i believe those it is um you try so the most effective thing is that you you read or you remember you read something that someone has written to you and so someone's expressing gratitude to you of course that's not entirely practical right and so there's a a few things that you can do the first thing is that you can think of a story when someone was helpful to you and you if you focus hard enough it actually feels real and the second thing that that that i do me and my wife is every couple days we have a set time that we sit down and we say here's what i'm thankful i'm thankful that that you did this and then the second thing that you can do is you can actually think of a story and what my wife just do the opposite we just say everything we hate about each other every two days and uh and then that sounds good then we get i get it off our chest she loves she's really good at the game i'm getting better uh it's just it's a good thing it's called the hateful eight just eight minutes of just like hitting on each other um and uh the second thing that you could do is you can think of a story of of someone being helpful to another person and they put these guys i believe in a mri and they scan their brain and they watched a movie or a story about holocaust survivors being helped and surviving and it like changed something in their brain and it was proven to make them more motivated and happier why is that the most convincing thing ever everything that they're like they did an fmri study they scan people while they watch this the brain lights up like a christmas tree it's like the most like that's the most i'm just gonna make that up whenever i want to be more convincing with my thing i'm like yeah people who buy my my power writing course uh we've done brain scans it shows that actually there are there you know how there's a part of your brain you can't access with this course you actually access it the scans they speak for themselves i did a transcendental meditation thing and uh it's like a style of meditation and they like i went to the seminar and they're like it's proven with brain stance to be different than mindfulness and i was like really i mean like you're both you're you're kind of the same thing you're being quiet and just like like i don't understand how but anyway that's what they said so uh anyway go ahead your second thing well one more on that gratefulness thing there's one other technique that i it's less convenient but when you do it it's awesome it's called flooding have you ever heard of this no all right flooding is when you basically you create a flood of memories of great moments in your life the easiest way to do it is you open up a photo album and you flip through it or you go through your camera roll so if like me and my wife we get together we'll have our camera roll open and we'll just be showing each other photos from you know three years ago remember that trip remember that day remember this thing we did laughing about it what happened that day and just if you just do that for even 10 minutes you just revisit those photos i'm not a big photo guy i actually hate taking photos in the moment i find it to be just incredibly like off-putting and my wife's like the opposite she loves taking photos of everything but i gotta admit this flooding is amazing it works i literally love her more after we do it because i remember all these amazing times i've had with her and i don't have to try i just like look at the photo and it's there it's better than better than my imagination so that's what you're gonna have to do today in order to get over your heartache your money loss i know i know we'll have to figure it out one more app one more app so the other app is called other ship uh so this is this just came out i invested in this thing because i'm a believer in it i struggled with meditation meditation was very hard for me so even though i was friends with the founders of calm and they gave me a free account or whatever never really used it couldn't couldn't get myself to enjoy doing it and i'm the type where if i don't enjoy it it's just very hard for me to stick with anything i don't enjoy i don't have enough willpower don't want enough willpower i don't know what it is but i'm not great at it so i wanted the benefits of meditation but i didn't enjoy doing it breathwork has become like a revelation to me it's a form of meditation it's very similar but focusing on breath at a guided breathwork session so i've tried wim hof loved it wim hof has a great app too it's a free app and other ship is like a souped up version of wim hof and uh this guy robbie created it he's amazing at it he guides a lot of meditations himself he built his own like home oasis in his he was like really early at ethereum and he like he was the first marketing guy at the ethereum foundation when it was like whatever you know 60 cents or some so he's just like mega rich so he got like you know even with barely putting any money in he got like kind of loaded and then he sold some of it and was like okay i'm gonna turn like half of my i'm gonna make this huge like kind of cabin out the garage type thing like a mega garage he turned it into like this like 20 person sauna plus cold plunge plus like amazing meditation room plus greenhouse and all this other you went to it uh no he's invited me it's in canada i haven't gone yet but um it's amazing he hosts a lot of people there he invited us actually so you're welcome to go anytime and um they do like guided whatever like micro dosing lsd if you want to do that or whatever no you can do you can do anything you can do anything in this place long story short he got really into breathwork along this journey and create now this is what he does he's like i'm gonna i created this app i'm gonna i'm gonna bring breathwork to the masses and i do it every morning and it's amazing so that's my uh other ship is the name of the app all right i dig that all right i'll tell you one all right so there's this subreddit that i go to and i love it it's called uh fat fire and the idea is people who want to retire relatively young with a lot of money so they can live a fat life without working um and there's this guy and so basically if you post on there a lot the mods the community leaders of the subreddit will verify your net worth to make sure you're not full of shit by the way did you have a goal like this like i want to retire by x age or i want to be like yeah this wealthy by this age what was your like how did you phrase your goal uh i i wanted to have 20 million dollars by age 30. gotcha all right that's what i wanted that was my goal i created that goal when i was in my uh when i was like 19 or 20 years old i mean i can't confirm or deny but you know mission accomplished is what i would say i i sold my company i achieved it at 31. i sold my company at 31.

right um and so my that was my goal because i asked a rich person who i knew i asked him how much money do you spend a month and they told me sixty thousand dollars a month and at the time i was like i don't know like i can't imagine there's a world that sounds absurd yeah yeah i'm like that just sounds crazy but whatever like i asked like eight people and this person had the highest number and i was like okay i'll just do that because i'll be conservative and then if you withdraw only three percent of your 20 million that gives you like six hundred thousand dollars uh a year to spend there that that's that number so i just fire philosophy and fire stands for financially independent retire early so yes so you can you can you can spend a percentage of your portfolio of your liquid portfolio and basically it continues to grow have enough money that the earnings the the the sort of compounding earnings on the money being invested in something safe like the stock market s p 500 type of thing can um can cover your burn rate so there's two things that matter what is the what is the amount that i have invested in and what is my life burn rate that's why a lot of people who like fire they go move to like you know bumfuck you know middle of nowhere and they like oh yeah i got rid of my car and it's great now i can you know i got rid of everything i own and me and my wife we only eat apple cores and now we are retired it's like but fat fire is different fat fire is like no i kind of want to ball out i'm not trying to like skimp on my lifestyle so okay what do i need to achieve and what do i need to optimize while still not giving up like what i find to be enjoyable in terms of lifestyle yeah so that's how i made up that number and i don't even i spend fifteen thousand dollars a month so i don't spend even close to that but i i saw this thing yesterday which is somebody was saying they posted like my company here's what my company's revenues were for the i think his name is chris cantino uh it was like oh companies revenues for the first seven years and it was like you know zero thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand 150 000 350 000 7 million 21 million or something like that right i i'm making it up but it's some slow build and then suddenly things really take off and i think they sold their company it was a soap company i think uh for 100 million dollars i think i have that right is that correct you know this guy no i know who you're talking about though he tweets great stuff you said his name right yeah so okay so so he tweeted that and i started got me thinking i was like it it's true a lot of success i would say the common you know when success comes through the front door this is how it arrives slowly and then suddenly when it rains it pours for sure when it rains it pours and i started thinking okay is that true in my life and i started writing down i wrote down how much money i made from the age 20 to the age 31 because i also got wealthy basically at 31 and um and it was like you know zero thousand dollars then negative thirty thousand dollars with that first startup then i i got a job and the job paid me 120 000 i thought i was doing great that was 120 120 120 120 and then went to 160 and then it like stayed there for a bit and then i totaled it and i said wow at age 31 i made more than the previous 11 years before that combined and i was like you know and this is my advice to young people always is if you're going to take a non-traditional path like entrepreneurship or betting on yourself rather than a corporate career track corporate career track you should be increasing you know every two years by a certain fixed percent and you're great that's your lifestyle if you take the non-traditional path you go try to be a content creator entrepreneur or something else um it's going to be this slowly then suddenly path and don't if you're 22 don't count your earnings at 22 or 23 or 24 you're going to check the scoreboard at age 30 was my my motto my advice or or or regardless of 30 or not after like eight or nine years and you give it give it a decade and you what you need to is total it up in 10 years how did i do versus one counting every year because you're going to lose lose lose lose lose win big and um that's off that's often the path so i was curious for you if you did that is your path similar or if you charted it out for 20s to 30s i don't know if you want to share the exact or whatever but yeah i can share some i mean when i sold i had saved a like seven figures of course that includes my wife and i and she also uh worked at airbnb and so airbnb went public and she had worked there for a long time airbnb went public in december i sold my company in february so it was like uh december 1st and then like february 1st it was like that those two or three months was like massive right and so but prior to that ignore that take her out because we don't want to put her business out there so let's just talk about you um you in your early 20s what were you making so um from age 22 to probably 26 and 27 i paid myself something like two grand a month so in the brain so the first year of business i probably paid myself twenty thousand dollars for the first year and then i paid myself forty thousand dollars for the next two years and then um seventy thousand dollars and then the last year that was 24k a year and then 40k a year and then you said 70k roughly you know it was like 20 40 40 70 yeah so that's four years in and then the year we sold i'd paid myself close to three hundred thousand dollars right um and i had a few other investments like some angel investments and um like some weird things that kind of paid off but basically like for the longest time i mean i was living i the way i rigged it was in san francisco my rent was only 400 because i rented out this big place and i only had 25 grand in my name and i spent all of it to rent out and furnish this place and then i rented it out to people who basically subsidized it for me so i was living like a poor person and um so i was able to save a little bit of money living like a like a wealthy person really you were living in a place and it was only costing 400 a month which is great example by the way because there's a lot of people that will be like oh why don't we have to san francisco but i can't afford it all you're saying to me is i lack creativity and resourcefulness because what you did is available to everybody go find a place that's at market or slightly below market price and what you did i think is you cut a deal with the landlord you were like i'll never call you for anything yeah i told them it breaks i'll fix you i think you live there for like a decade or some shit and you never like set like seven years yeah seven years to the person yeah i never saw him i had not once have i ever seen him if you showed up at the house you wouldn't know who the heck it is i would not i don't even remember what he looks like i couldn't even tell you what he looks like i think his name was chris and so you cut this deal and you're like look i'm you basically became the landlord well i showed i showed up and i was 22 and it was a four thousand dollar or five i forget how much was it forty five hundred dollars a month for a four bedroom house and he goes is it just you i go look it's just me right now but i'm gonna get like some friends to move in um i'll like sign a lease a sublease with them and i and i can have you approve it right but basically like i'm gonna pay you on time all the time and my the preferred relationship you and i have is i never see you again and are you okay with that and he goes yeah he goes don't don't be late and i go okay deal and we were never late i never one time i i i'm an idiot one time i shot a bb gun in the toilet and it broke the toilet and so we just went to home depot and like bought a toilet and just replaced it you know what i mean so we would do stuff like that all the time if somebody said hey which of your friends shot a bb gun into the toilet i feel like i'm like oh you know sam sam's great he's a great guy i bought we bought like an airsoft gun or something we're like let's see how strong this is and we could be able to shoot it in the house because it went through the couch uh anyway anyway it yeah and so at this point yeah so it was a slow build it took like five six seven years but then what's crazy is i'm 32 now i started hustling at age 20 probably 20 like making like real money on my own like livable money and at this point at age 32 i'll make more this year from a couple like side investments like a real estate deal that i did i'll make more this year than collectively all of my salaries combined while working at the hustle exactly and that's that's the exact same same case for me and i think that's actually really common and i think the reason i bring that up is because it's interesting to me b i think that's really comforting to people because when you're in it and you're not making any money and it looks like other people are all making hella money it feels it could feel very bad and you can question if you're on the right path or not and this doesn't mean you're definitely on the right path but it means when this path of entrepreneurship works that's commonly what it looks like so don't be surprised um all right so let's get back to which by the way um when i was getting going i was always so envious of other people like my friends i'm like you got a job at google you make 150 grand a year and you have all these benefits i haven't been to the doctor forever this is awesome i'm so jealous so you'd come to my office and you'd be like dude this is your office i'm like yeah yeah and then you would be eating something you'd be like this is this cheese just always available whose cheese is this they just bring you this cheese i felt like i would be like you'd be like look this cheese is from whole foods this is expensive cheese i'm like bro stop talking about the cheese right now but it was like i remember you were noticing all those things in a funny way i was like you guys have an espresso machine he's got a woman's bathroom what the hell is an espresso machine yeah i remember i was like freaking out that you had an espresso espresso machine i was like what the hell is this and i i remember like i used to take food to go um so anyway um yeah it accumulated quickly and i think it for most people it's i mean it like i think that it's basically it's like you're poor you're poor you're poor and then it's like suddenly it's like oh holy crap i'm not anymore and you know you you have that moment and there's this subreddit called fat fire and they talk a lot about that and there's this guy who has a series of threads called confessions of a hecto millionaire and he's doing like eight parts and i link to it in there i see part five here yeah and the mods have basically um approved it so basically the mods have like this guy dm'd him dm'd his accountants or account information or something so they like verified that he's uh as wealthy as he is but basically in the beginning uh thread he says um you know i'm worth north of 100 million dollars i got wealthy originally because i was an employee at a tech company that made me 30 million dollars and that was like 15 years ago and then i invested in this and then i did this and then i did this and i'm going to answer a lot of the questions that i think a lot of people ask here and the mods have approved that i am who i am and i'm going to tell you all about work and purpose my time and routine why keep a low profile how relationships are are complicated what i spend on a monthly basis um what my investment in portfolio management is and it's incredibly fascinating i love this stuff where you get behind the scenes of people who you normally never have access to and so it's a great series it's a great thread uh it's awesome awesome i love it great find um okay let's do some more so uh what do i want to do okay let me do um um uh let me do you want me to do a quick one while you're thinking do a quick one okay and i can keep right on so you just let me know so all right this is a little black hat here but i'm gonna tell you so there's this company called i think it's made by the same company it's called web archive it's the greatest thing ever i love web archive and they have got this side project called archive today so archive dot today have you ever seen this yes i have seen this it is awesome so if you ever want to to read so there's a bunch of products out there on how to read articles that are paywalled or behind some type of like thing that you can't see them um so there's um outline.com which is kind of cool there's this other one that's called um 12 foot and it's called 12 foot ladder and so it basically says show me a 10 over the paywall yeah so listen to the tagline show me a 10 foot paywall i'll show you a 12 foot ladder brilliant right genius brilliant and it doesn't work all the time very well that's the problem with 12 foot yes but it's our line yeah archive today works i've never used it and it not work and so if you ever want to read something and you don't feel like paying the pay like you just want to read like a article and not all like pay for it archive today is the greatest thing i've ever seen yeah and the internet archive is just like a treasure right like it's a non-profit thing it's a great way to go look up what did the original version of the airbnb website look like you can go to the way back machine which is something they've created and you can type in airbnb.com you can go back and you can see oh wow it used to be called air bed and breakfast and it was like catered toward conferences because that's how they initially got their start and blah blah blah so you know the internet archive which is the the non-profit behind it is amazing they actually bought our friend's company they bought xavier's uh book company as well because they're going to like scan all the books and make them available for people and things like that so they just it's amazing you you know they're based in inner sunset right where my office was that's right that's right um okay let's do some more uh okay so i basically made a pretty big and i think at the at the risk of us sounding like kind of like overly obsessed with fitness which is like ironic because at least at least you're ripped so i think you can get away with being obsessed with fitness i'm not ripped yet so it's like a little bit it's a little bit weird when i talk too much about it but i made a big investment in this because and your and your improvement has been massive i basically when i was how much did you weigh when we first started filming do you know i have no idea but i basically gained like 40 or 50 pounds over the course of like my last startup and like never lost it so you think you weighed i used to be like 250. not 250. i think the most everywhere was 225 and i don't even weigh much less than that now but it's a different weight though it's yeah it's like muscle versus fat it's like converting right so um so yeah i basically you know ballooned up like you know i used to be whatever 175 or whatever and then all of a sudden 225 and felt really bad and you know it's not healthy it doesn't look good all this stuff i would when i would see a photo of myself i think that's a bad photo of myself and after three years i'm like hey how come all the photos are just bad photos of me oh wait maybe i'm like actually just like massively out of shape here so i invested in basically three or four things now that have paid off and i'll tell you one that i don't think paid off so um so i think fitness takes a couple things uh at least for me and that's uh time so i was like okay what are some things that i if if going to the gym is taking too much time what's a way that i can hack that so first of all i built a home gym so there's no going anywhere but even me you could put a a peloton right next to me that doesn't mean i'm gonna ride it you can put my foot in the straps it doesn't mean i'm gonna push like there was many reasons for many years that i didn't exercise regularly and so one was just bringing the gym home then i got a trainer because i said well if some dude shows up i'm not just gonna ignore him like i'm clearly gonna like do the workout i think that's the biggest thing that made a difference i like i i have a friend who is um who who is a wealthy guy and he was like hey can you tell me what to do and i'm like no man get a coach for like 250 bucks a month and they'll and they'll tell you what to do and you don't think you just do what they say and he was like that's really expensive i'm like dog you live in a four million dollar house like why do you like your your body's your house and you're not going to spend 300 or something to fix it yeah that's wild um but my dad does that my dad's like oh you spend on this personal trainer five days a week like that's crazy uh i have this trainer i found in india he just does it on zoom and he's only four dollars an hour i was like four dollars an hour he's like yeah he wanted six but i got him down to four he was so proud and i was like oh that's i mean that's amazing okay is it such an indian thing he's like yeah he's really good he's really fit no no i was like no he's good for you he's like oh well i you know i don't really do it like you know it's he's like it's only four bucks so i don't even mind if i skip it i was like exactly like you literally don't do it it's not working for you you're not exercising regularly you're not getting in better shape so how is it really that good uh so anyways i invested in a bunch of stuff and i took an approach which was like i wanted to leave myself no outs so i took a like burn the boat strategy so first i talked about it publicly and i talked about it publicly because if i talk about it publicly i'm going to be humiliated if uh you know i'd feel embarrassed if i talk about this and i don't do it i don't back it up same i i i vouch for that i made it super convenient so i did home gym and i brought i had a trainer come to my house i paid the extra to to make sure that that happened um okay so now i'm doing the workouts okay cool now how do i do it where i actually enjoy it well i invested in making the space nice so like i went to your gym and i was like wow this feels great i need to get a floor like this and i bought these rubber tiles and i did all this stuff to make the gym feel better and i like got like the sound system i did a bunch of things to make the environment one where i would not dread going there i would enjoy i would want to go there and a bunch of things like that so those were all great investments i felt like great finds for me was like these little rubber tiles and it took time and energy to research these and i didn't outsource this i was like no i need to find the best one because i want this to feel a certain way and i i crafted that kind of vision for myself same thing i just got a sauna set it up yesterday did the first sauna session in it and i'm like this is amazing um it's sick right already already this is one of my great purchases of the year and i just have had it for one day um i got this clear light sauna infrared sauna um and i know that some people are like don't do infrared and some people are like buy this other brand instead whatever no clear light's good it's a great brand uh you know but some people are like you should do the dry sauna not the infrared from what i could tell um it's totally fine and it's uh importantly it fit into my life whereas the other one would have required like a whole bunch of like waiting for like a bigger space and electrical and all these changes to be made in order to work as long as it can get hot enough it's good yeah exactly so those have been for me the best fine now here's the worst the worst buys the worst things i did i anything that i attach to my wrist has just failed so um i bought an apple watch um lost it all right got stolen slash lost i don't know what happened it was at the office and it was gone um second one uh bought a fitbit lost it whoop band have it batteries dead don't charge it regularly enough for it to be useful um so everything i've tried that's like a fitness tracker that is like a wearable device it doesn't work for me because i'm too disorganized and lose and don't keep things charged and ready for the morning and then charge it for sleep i had an uro ring i lost that too uh i have i have failed on like five wearables this year so i gotta same count myself out on that do you wear a wedding ring lost my wedding ring as well so that's you know for bonus points uh dude that's why i wear these like uh rubber ones yeah mine was only a 60 wedding ring anyways so i didn't feel i mean the sentimental loss yeah but uh you know i kind of knew that hey i don't know if i'm a ring guy i never wore a ring in my life yeah and sure enough just taking it on and off ended up i lost mine the first week so yeah i lost mine on my honeymoon the world's best husband all right okay let me give you a different one have here we're gonna shift to media uh great podcast articles youtube channels whatever that we really like i have a whole category called canceled comedians which is like there's a whole bunch of people that i love their content they're canceled by you know society but i love they're still they're just as funny as they were before everybody found out that they like you know like to have sex with 18 year old girls or whatever like um so there's this guy chris d'elea who got canceled i don't know a year ago i found him really funny before i find him really funny now and he also has these little like almost like inspirational moments in between the comedy that i love there's this video he has called life rips have you heard this video no but i love him all he's saying is like uh you know this was happening in my day or whatever and he's like he has this phrase life rips which is like he's saying like life is awesome and he's like just remember he's like life rips and then he he he tells the story it's just he's a great storyteller amazing storyteller he tells a story about life rips it's a feel-good moment it's a reminder that actually yeah you're right instead of focusing on my problems all day let me just focus on the fact that life actually really freaking rips and um and then he brings that in he brings that as a call back into a bunch of other podcasts that he does where he'll tell a little story he's like you know this is a life rips moment and um just that philosophy has like made me really happy he does this thing also where some he'll be recording the episode and you you'll relate to this he's he's kind of like um i think a lot of great entrepreneurs and artists are this way where they're like sort of like perfectionists in a way like they want things to go well they want well well made stuff and so let's say there's a technical problem where he's like um he's like let's pull up that clip and then like the computer crashes or like somebody walks by and unplugs his microphone like midway through or whatever like kicks out the power cord to the lamp and instead of in that moment getting mad he just has he just replaced it with this thing where he just goes yes the cord ripped out of the wall he'll just be like something he'll be like yes we can't find the file or he'll be like yes dude yes we absolutely can't show the thing i'm talking about yes nobody has any idea what i'm trying to say and he just like instead of being like oh no this sucks which is like such a pattern that we can fall into he just does this little yes thing and i kind of stole it in my daily life my wife hates it she thinks it's like very annoying that i do this like she doesn't understand what i'm doing she doesn't know the reference now she will but it oh she doesn't listen to the podcast either so she still probably won't but it's such a hack dude it's such a hack to just instead of just letting this little inconvenience this little thing that went wrong f up your mood just like rewire the response to something that's almost it's like sarcastic but it actually becomes real by the time you do it jocko who's this guy who goes on joe rogan he does the same thing he's just like it's crazy i don't know maybe seal type dude super hardcore and his whole thing is around like you know pain is good and so like he'll be like um you know oh you got shin splits good like this run i love that it gets me fired up he'll be like you know oh you know your uber ride didn't show up good time to have a hike it's like you know he replaces of uh that sucks yeah good time to time to get tough or good you know good gotta go earn more money lost all mine like you know whatever it's like almost comedic how like how extreme he is in it but not gonna lie this actually works and so that's my that's my content recommendation do you have um i've got a all right i've got a bunch but do you have a car any type of cardio machine at your house treadmill yeah um and all right yeah you do have a rower i have like a like you have like a rower that makes you feel like you're on the swiss canal or whatever i have like a rinky dink you know 120 costco rower all right i don't think you're gonna want to do this then but i was gonna say tomorrow so i've been doing i'll do it on my shitty rower i've been doing these things where like i'm like all right everyone this sunday 60 minute row poster results such a in plus a fitness influencer move motivating others do you well do you have a bike you don't have a bike do you have a bike i have a bicycle not like a not a spin bike i have like it might be easier if you're doing the bike so i'm going to get up early tomorrow like 7 30 or maybe 7 and i'll get this thing done and you just post your results and be like i just and so i tweet it out i go tomorrow it's a 90 minute day we gotta because and people are like isn't that boring and i'm like yes that is the point we should go through pain tomorrow before we get thankful right so if you want to do it with me uh do a 90 minute any type of 90 minute steady cardio um i don't think no one there to watch my kids well i don't think you could 90 minute bike ride with sam well that's why you got to get up really early to do it you got to like go through hard uh some hardship i don't think you're going to be able to run for 90 minutes but even like a brisk walk honestly for 90 could work but just like as long as your heart rate's like 140 ish um all right let me let me let me let me tell you uh five or four i'm going to go fast on some bits of media the first this happened earlier this year there's this amazing video of rose nami unis this uh awesome ufc fighter but the reason she's interesting is she's like really quiet and introspective and seems like a sweetheart not like a fighter and there's this amazing video of her about to fight this badass woman from china who just looks like the terminator and she's repeating to herself i'm the best i'm the best i'm the best i'm the best and when i first saw that i teared up it's the greatest it pumps me up it's amazing the second thing primitive technology by the way can i just give a recommendation there for people who don't follow the ufc they're going to watch this thing like whatever uh you know if even if they went and watched it it wouldn't have the same emotional resonance it resonated for you because you know how much of a terminator that other girls you know rose's backstory and as she struggles with anxiety she's not a bravado type of person so for her to say i'm the best it's not bravado and trash talk it's literally self-talk so she you know can perform believes her best and not let anxiety get the best of her so you know the backstory but i think everybody should have these go-to's these this stash of like inspiring moments that you were there for that you know the context you know the backstory and then you could just put them it's like that flooding thing i was talking about earlier you can just go back to it and you can instantly get that feeling um and you should just have a well of these which i like i i think that people should know that i mean like successful people i don't know if people consider me successful or not but i know that like way more successful people than i do this but i rely on like like i'll like read a book about someone who i admire and i'm like how would this person react to this situation totally like i i do that all the time or i'm like sometimes i'll even do it with like ufc fighters i'm like this guy just got punched in the face and he got up like i could do it um so i like that rose namayuna's thing the second thing is primitive technology have you heard of primitive technology no what's that click the link it's in there so this guy has 10 million subscribers on youtube in his videos of which there are how many are there maybe 50 you've talked about this guy he's like a caveman yes so there's there's maybe only 20 videos and his very first video has 31 million views it was six years ago and it's him not talking not saying a word he's in the woods and he's building a hut and eventually it works out to build like a proper house and he does it without saying a word and he does it with only using things that he finds in the woods no power tools no nothing he builds a kiln he builds a tiled roof hut okay so i'm on that video it starts as he's just pan the camera is just planning at this just this spot on the ground in the middle of the forest it's clear like there's nothing here i'm gonna build a little hut here now click now click click to the end click to the end he's at the end like a clay hut with the fireplace in there with a fireplace and a chimney yes and the whole video he doesn't say a single word all you do is he's literally his bare hands yes just building it and then he'll like make like a hammer out of like uh some he'll make rope and then he'll make a hammer out of rope and a stick or a a rock and a stick do you know this guy's backstory like this guy looks just like everybody i went to duke with like who is this guy and why does he do this it's in australia i believe and he owns this land and so if you go to his about page he just it just says where is this and he goes queensland australia do you live in the wild i don't live in the wild but i love going out into the land to do these projects yeah and so he doesn't talk much he doesn't do anything his channel has gotten one billion views and all he's doing is building like dude like there's another one i'm watching him make fire just with this he's just rubbing his hands together like this with a stick in between and he just made a fire while you were talking it's so relaxing it's so awesome i love it so do you i love it be honest do you actually want because i see this i'm like this is so cool and i'll like click through one and then i'll be like oh this is just something i'm gonna go tell other people about i don't i would never actually sit here and watch this for 30 minutes i've watched all of them because do you have apple do you have apple tv uh no i don't but i have my version of tv is youtube so first thing when i sit down the couch i go straight to youtube and i'll just watch like a 30 this 30 it's like this is like that tv show how stuff's built do you remember that yeah but you do it in the background or you actually just watch pay attention to him yeah maybe i'll like be talking to sarah or cooking yeah i'm like oh my god wait watch this look what he's doing yeah maybe it's in the back i mean do you i don't actually sit down really and watch tv unless it's a movie um or the challenge or the challenge okay so this is amazing okay primitive technology all right let me keep going let me keep going um i'm gonna roll okay the the third one how to be great just be good repeatedly this is an article by steph smith who works for me there's two reasons why i love this article the first that is one of the best headlines i've ever read yes it is a wonderful headline and she writes this article about how great things rarely uh are you like trying to be great it's more so just like being kind of good but doing it consistently and in my life i have found that with this podcast with a bunch of other stuff like i'm like i don't want to do this today it's like all right fine i'm gonna do it anyway even though i know today i'm not gonna do a good job of it i'm just gonna get it done and she does a really good job of articulating why that works so i love that article um all right i'm gonna keep going um the the next one there's this guy who's got a youtube channel called more plates more dates yeah i watch this guy he is amazing he looks at pro athletes and actors and he and he's a i guess he's a i think he's a doctor i don't know what his background is he sounds like he knows what he's talking about and he tells you what steroids he thinks different people are on i watch these and every time i do i regret so much i'm like what a waste of my life i just did um but i he comes up on my feed and i'm like oh i know that person yeah are they on steroids and then like 30 minutes later i'm like i cannot believe i've let this be in my brain for the last 30 minutes what a waste of my brain it's interesting though because he'll explain like the science behind it he's like you he's like a lot of people think that this athlete is doing epo you wouldn't do epo because the way that your body works is this this this and this and he like so it's kind of interesting he goes but you would do hgh because the way hgh works is it's proven to do so it's like a science it's interesting all right and then the gossip but yeah there's a little bit of science oh it's it's gossip from a person who i believe is reputable uh not in having first-hand knowledge of the people but first-hand knowledge and doping and the final thing i found this book it has two reviews on amazon um only two reviews on amazon it's amazing and so apparently they in the four or in the forward they say that's one of the most popular books in russia but i i didn't know that and they translated it into english so these two journalists from the ussr in 1933 made a deal with the us government that they would let them come in and spend three months doing a road trip and so they saved up a little bit of money they came here and they bought a camper van and they spent three months traveling america talking to people with nothing to do really just all they just wanted to learn about of america and from an outside perspective they show what makes america special and it's incredibly fascinating because we take a lot of things for granted and they criticize america and this is in the 1930s so this is this point is particularly particularly true they criticize like our race relations and things like that this is like this is crazy how people treat each other but there is a lot of good including they say there's something about americans that i've never seen ever before which is they always think that they are going to overcome any adversity and they always are optimistic about like some situation and also oddly they're friends with their bosses so like they work together to achieve things and they don't like like their friend like you could be friends with your boss and you cannot hate them or want to rob from them and people are and and and it's a wonderful book it's written in the 30s it's awesome so that's my book oh it's called uh little gold in america nice uh that's great you've read the whole thing i've yeah i'm finishing it up now and i actually posted a link on my twitter where it's free like a pdf uh okay cool i like that um okay i have a couple quick ones so a chrome extension that i'm liking a lot it's called every day and it's basically a habit tracker so um so if you go to the website i think it's called every day let me just find the everyday.app i think is the thing um and basically you just say what you want to do so you're like oh i want to like for me for example i have morning routine i have clean lunch clean dinner um i have workout i have my uh uh gratitude thing and then i have that's it and so and then basically what it does is it just lets you create a streak so you just say yes i did it this day i uh i intentionally skipped it i'm allowed to skip it or i missed and it just keeps track of your streaks and it creates this awesome green grid of like as you do your habits you get this really satisfying completion of like your grid being green it just shows i'm doing the things i said i wanted to do which for me is and most people is all of the challenge all of the challenge is not oh i just don't know what to do it's i'm not doing the i know i should do and um so this is just you know a great tool and i get i think it's great because it's chrome extension so it's in your face you don't have to remember to check it it's every time you open a new tab in your browser it's going to remind you oh yeah i could i dock that out right now you know yeah i could actually just do that right now and i could get it done um so it's uh i actually have my own chrome extension and i've replaced it with this one that's how good it is so um you know this is one of my one of my i'm downloading it now okay let me give you a couple other things that i think are really cool you showed me this camo it's an app for your iphone now we spent a lot of money and time you may not be able to tell right now because we're both not in our main studio or i'm not in my main studio you're you're in a different spot i look good i don't know you're traveling no i'm not traveling i don't know you've been traveling so we you know on different videos we have different level of quality or whatever but we did the you know we both tried on our own and then we hired people to like hey uh how do people get that fancy ass blur and like super hd videos so hard and they're like oh you gotta buy this uh canon uh which one 50d 40d 6d 7d which which d do i buy okay i'll get this one oh then i need like some kind of um cord or like a capture card how am i gonna do that it's so much tripod super pain about batteries oh but the battery's gonna die during the episode so you have to actually get a double battery or a dummy battery pain in the ass so and it's thousands of dollars the camera itself was like 1500 something like that so it's really expensive and you were like oh dude i'm just using this iphone app called camo that just you just download the app and then uh it just uses the native iphone like portrait mode to make your camera look good and you're like look i'm just using my phone i look just as good as you i was like yeah i'm using the two thousand dollar thing and it's really hard to set up you know it's sick it's only 30 bucks and look i'm traveling and i just bring this with me because it's my phone and i was like oh my god i think it's 40 or 50 bucks i don't know is it 30 maybe it's i don't remember i actually think in the new ios it's just this is just baked in actually i think they i don't think you even need this anymore um but for now and if you if i don't if i'm wrong about that ios you mean it's coming out soon like in the new ios there's just it's gonna be part of the native camera so you don't need an app to do this i think you mean but one coming out soon or one out now i don't know now soon something um something like that so but in the meantime this app camo is kind of amazing uh great business by whoever's doing this and amazing timing because the whole world went remote and everybody wants to look good so uh that's definitely one of the best products the analogy we made or someone made is having camo it's like in the 70s and 80s and 90s when it mattered that you wore a suit having a camo is like showing up in a meeting in a nice suit exactly exactly um so so i think that's a great uh product okay i'm gonna give you a youtube channel so you did more plates more dates um the binge i've been on is it's like kind of embarrassing almost it's these old school direct sales seminars so i'm like okay how do i um i don't know why i like this because i'm not even doing anything that has direct sales like there's not a product i sell that's direct sales i'm not a salesman i've never been one uh but i'm just like fascinated with the art of persuasion and sales which ones and so um so there's a couple that are really good last night like for example i fell asleep last night while listening to it if you just search tony robbins sales rare and it's like uh there's two there's one where he explains how he sold how he got his career started he doesn't talk about this much he got his career started selling audio cassettes like music music tapes to people um you know to people and he would do these like you know he'd go and he's like yeah like the way we would do it is a woman would reach out to the potential customer and they would say we'd love to have you uh we'd love to give you a free gift and um we'd love to tell you a little bit about our company and they'd be like free gift he'd say yeah it's a free gift it's usually worth about 100 um and we'd love to give it to you and you know feel if you'd meet with our person and then tony was that person and he would be like he would walk through the step-by-step thing and he'd be like i would say this and why am i saying that i'm saying that because blah blah here's the thing about how people buy he's like and he's got his whole philosophy and he even says in this thing he's like you know would i do this now no because i feel like it's a little too pushy and but i'm always the type where i want to know what's the real potent that works i want to know the borderline illegal version of sailing and persuasion and then it's up to me to decide am i gonna keep the knob on level 12 or do i want to turn it down to nine but i don't want to at this i don't want to be a level six because i was too afraid to ever find out what is what does maximum persuasion look like you know what is what's the channel called uh i just look at the individual videos there's not any channel so like i'll look up gary halpert rare or gary halpert 1980s or gary halpert original seminar tony robbins young tony robbins rare tony robbins original seminar tony robbins direct sales tony robbins infomercial and i'll go either i'll just find their material and i'll deconstruct it myself like what's working like we had craig clemens on and craig clemens comes on the podcast and he's a friend of ours and he's uh doesn't he's a great person on the pod but he doesn't go first he doesn't talk a lot about his company so he's got golden hippo they've sold like over you know i think he sold over a billion billion dollars worth of product in his lifetime uh and golden hippo will do you know over 100 million dollars in sales but it's like hey what golden hippo is a holding company what are the companies underneath and he doesn't really like go list out the 13 companies or whatever however many there are underneath it um and nobody really pushes him for that and he's kind of like at the made it stage now but his he got his start early on doing sales for a guy who's like a dating coach and it was like i bought that when you're dating and like how to how to basically it's all different titles that all mean how to get laid and if it was a wife it's like how to get the man of your dreams how to get a husband how to whatever and he and so i find these old interviews or old seminars he did with that guy eban pagan and i'll go watch those and i'll see oh interesting he's talking about this headline he wrote and why this headline is amazing and why he thinks it worked and this other one and why it totally didn't work and what he learned from that and i just find these to be like it's like puppy chow to me it's just i can't stop consuming it even though i really have no direct use for it uh i just love it so i'll tell you guys listening um gary halbert so the gary halberts this guy he died somewhat recently from just like a heart attack or something and he was an amazing copywriter and he might have died in prison or soon after he was in prison for a handful of years because he sold something ironically that's the guy i want to learn from yes and the world famous guy took it too far like wolf of wall street i'll go learn from him i'm not going to take it as far but i want to learn from that person i think he went to prison for mail fraud or something like that so basically people bought stuff and he just didn't fulfill it and so he was just like i i sold it and i just lied and that's obviously wrong but you can learn a lot from him and he's got these amazing things called um the letters from boron uh they're boron letters sorry and they're all free so if you google gary halbert boron letters you can find them for free it's a series of letters that he wrote his son bond from prison and he teaches him everything he knows about life and selling yes and so like you can go and read it he wrote them all by hand because i was just so and you're going to read it you're gonna be like what why would you why is this so good it's so good if you know why it's so good it's almost like that it's like it's no it's clearly good like you start you fall down like his slippery slope you're like why is this so interesting why do i want to keep reading this exactly you don't know it's not like like it's not a um it's what i'll call a door not a window so a window opportunity is one where you look right in and you can see what's in it for you and you're like oh okay like for example let's say you wanted to get better at copywriting the thing is not called how to get better at copywriting and then he doesn't say here's five copywriting techniques no he actually writes these as letters to his son and then he just shows you great copywriting and then he sprinkles in lessons as he goes but it it doesn't come to like letter five or whatever there's like it takes you you're just interested you're hooked and you don't know why and that's the technique and then you got to like figure out why is this so damn good what is it about this writing style that's so slippery that i just can't get it it's like a tick tock feed i can't get out of it you know and so i would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this you can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens yeah this is a winner um all right well i think i think we just like laid out a ton of interesting stuff uh ben you there and by the way we should put uh links to as much of these as we can in the show notes i'm also going to send out a newsletter of just like summarizing these um just on like whatever my own like my weekly newsletter whatever seanpere.com and because i think these are actually really good but most people listening to this it's probably really hard to be like what am i supposed to do write these down and go google all these different things these guys are talking about yeah you need the links what do you think ben yeah it's gonna be great at the bottom of the show notes we'll just put a long list of all the links so people can find everything but this was awesome we'll just spew in cool products that we consume by the way i there's i i have half of you told me about this two minutes or you told me before but i was busy i learned about this premise two minutes before the show and i actually still have like five things that i we didn't even get to and i know you have like 10 things we didn't even get to so we may want to do if people like this we may want to do one more of these i like and the point of this is it's supposed to be a thanksgiving special right so you guys are just you're fat with turkey you're sitting on your couch you you got some time on your hands you can just start clicking through all these links check out all this stuff buy some stuff watch some things have a good time i think it's mostly free stuff by the way that we mentioned yeah a lot of it is free or very cheap um ben i love
