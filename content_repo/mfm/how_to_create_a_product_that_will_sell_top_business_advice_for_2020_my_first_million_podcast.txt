at hustle con this year that guy eric ryan talked about the founder of method soap and ollie and welly all these great d2c brands or sort of not d2c actually just new consumer brands um that they sell through target and whatnot you know he he said a line that stuck with me that's the number one most important thing from hustle con this year in my opinion he goes you have to identify the culture shift first and um you know the culture shift happens first and then the products and services that um that meet those cultural values come second so let's say for method soap he was saying you know consumers now they turn their everything they buy they turn to the back and they read the ingredients and so they care about what they're putting in their body they care about what they're putting in their homes they care about what they're putting in their babies etc etc and so you see honest company take off because people care about what they're putting on their baby you see native deodorant take off because people care about putting natural ingredients and not uh aluminum and parabens you know in their armpits and method soap took off because they said hey you shouldn't have to clean your house with toxic chemicals but he identified the culture shift first now i don't know how much of this is just retro speak because entrepreneurs do do that where they just make up a story later about how they did it and the real reason was just some total numerical thing where they were like oh yeah i just saw a bunch of searches we know firsthand this was true with moise with native deodorant that he did this yeah and he actually tweeted today some more info which i thought was good he said uh he identified that natural deodorant was one of the top selling he's at number one i don't know if it's actually number one but it was one of the top selling products on etsy period yeah but uh everybody was buying it out of a jar and you had to like do this weird thing stick your hand on the jar then rub it in your armpit and he's like look people want people want natural deodorant but they want the convenience of the stick if i could figure out how to put natural deodorant in a stick i think i can make a business that works and uh you know 18 months later sells it for 100 million dollars so i think there's something to identifying the culture shift and if the culture shift is hey we gotta like hunker down a little bit or hey we gotta like support our local businesses like small businesses that's where something like a groupon or groupon 2.0 is very very interesting to me very hard to pull off extremely hard to pull off because local is super super hard it's slow to scale and you're dealing with a lot of mom and pop style businesses but groupon was not slow to scale groupon got to uh a billion dollars in sales i i think faster than any other company ever now that's true that's true it didn't it didn't operate well it was now there it didn't stick i i don't want to talk out my ass no i think it did stick i mean look up until recently groupon hey look up how much does groupon do in revenue they still well it didn't stick from a merchant perspective what happened was they onboarded all these merchants the merchants went on and they would get a bunch of empty traffic and then those empty sort of calories eventually they pulled off and they said why am i offering these deals people come they they take the sale they don't come back and that part didn't work so they lost on the merchant side for a while and then they got all these clones came out that were doing the exact same thing so customers sort of got inundated with daily deals products so that was a bit of the problem there but you're right actually they did scale very fast you
