Hello. How are you guys? Amazing.

It's good to be here. So we're super excited to be here with you guys and I thought we'd take some time to share just some fun stories about what we've learned from mushrooms, fish poop, breakfast cereal and what that's taught us about selling in a retail and retail distribution. Yeah and to take a quick step back tell you a very summary quick summary of our story we started out of my fraternity kitchen and actually before that we were sitting in a lecture of about 250 people here that you could grow mushrooms on coffee waste led us to then growing some buckets walk that bucket into Whole Foods got 5,000 bucks from our chancellor and ended up giving up investment banking and consulting to instead become full-time mushroom farmers along the way have now through an incredible journey alongside this amazing man maybe boy give me a hug and these amazing products which are ready to grow ready to eat products a mushroom farm a water garden a garden in a can and now organic breakfast cereal and breakfast toppers that are now sold in over 14,000 grocery stores around the country and Canada Australia and Russia as well so yeah I thought we could walk you guys through a handful of these products and a handful of the stores you've gotten into and just kind of the tangible stories of how it actually happened and to start off we want to start off with our main account the first account we ever had which was Whole Foods and I want to go back to those buckets Alex was talking about so here we are last semester in college we had just heard this random fact we had met up kind of fell in love with this idea of growing food off of waste and planted 10 like really ace hardware paint buckets of mushrooms in his fraternity kitchen and this is right before spring break and we come back from spring break and with moments we'll never forget and that nine of these buckets are just totally contaminated nasty mold going on them but one of them like literally that bucket right there was the only bucket that grew this beautiful crop of oyster mushrooms and by that time we had no background in food let alone you know mushrooms remember Alex was like hey Nicole you trying those like dude there's no way I'm trying these like you're trying there's no way I'm trying them either and so we were like looking at ourselves like what do we do and what's the best restaurant in town and well well Chez Panisse is pretty close by and you know they did at that point even know what that meant but we're like let's take it over there and we walk that paint bucket of mushrooms into Chez Panisse and Alice Waters happened to be there and I think we had our you know two Berkley shirts on she actually listened to us for a second and gets her head chef over literally says hey Cal you want to try these and he satays half of them up and it's like Alex is actually really good and it was kind of that moment we're like hey that's might might have something here I mean partly we were kind of upset at the fact that he had taken half of the mushrooms that we had grown I mean we're like shit that's literally the only thing that we have and but we took that that that bucket that five gallon ace hardware bucket with half as many mushrooms and we just walked it over to the Berkley Whole Foods it's actually about a mile and a half away and first produce guy we saw just went up to the guy and said hey we you know I think we've figured out how to grow mushrooms on coffee waste and that was actually the story that I was like that's all we've got and then he was like his eyes lit up though and he then calls over his team leader he grabs a few other people gets this bucket right puts it in the middle of the store and then he's like all right well shoot us an email well we took that same bucket we were like we don't know if that's actually going to turn into anything we took that same bucket walked it into every single grocery store in like a 50 mile radius from Andronico's every Andronico's in Berkeley and Oakland we went to Farmer Joe's we went to Berkeley Bowl at the time there was only one Berkeley but we walked walked to Rainbow Grocery walked to all these other grocery stores and craziest thing is the only retail that actually reached back out to us was Whole Foods we got this email as a one sentence email from Randy Decommon he was the regional coordinator of produce at the time and he just said this is pretty cool here's my cell phone and ended up giving him a call this is for my fraternity room and both just put it on speaker ended up talking to this guy for about 45 minutes and we like he's like Alex stop talking surprise like if you figure this out he's like I'm gonna blow you up in Whole Foods he's like this most innovative shit I've seen in produce taking coffee waste growing mushrooms like I love it just he's like wait what the hell were you guys doing before this we're like investment banking and consulting he's like yeah give that up give that up so we're like okay and he's like yeah I'll make sure this works out somehow and turn that that that buyer's belief into into getting a five thousand dollar grant from our chancellor at UC Berkeley and got some buckets got some you know a few more racks got a $800 van to be able to collect coffee waste and started collecting coffee grounds walked around different cafes and picked up every morning would then harvest the mushrooms sell them at farmers market sell them at the Berkeley Whole Foods stores and Oakland store and yeah and you know so the Whole Foods too so we started selling fresh mushrooms this is about six months after we graduated just spent six months trial and error trying to figure it out finally figured it out and started growing mushrooms like that and you know I was at this moment we kind of realized we're in about 30 Whole Foods just NorCal but saw an opportunity to kind of start taking some of our passions and trying to develop products whether retailers to and it's one step to go into a store another step to kind of trying to build that relationship and we had this idea we're like a lot of people are getting really excited about not just what we're growing but how they grow because there's mushrooms grow in just 10 days and so we had this idea for this little grow at a home mushroom kit and we decided to go and present it to Randy who was our NorCal produce buyer and the first thing presented him was that bag on the left and imagine that with a sticker we printed on from FedEx and this is honestly we were in there in a meeting talking about like fresh mushroom production and demand forecasting and had this thing in a bag underneath the table like waiting for the perfect moment to pull up you know pull it out and as if it was the next you know Apple iPhone we had just like so much energy around it so we finally end the meeting take this like Randy we got something to show you and pull out this bag unveil this beautiful mushroom kit and he literally falls out of his chair that's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen no one's putting a bag of fungus on their kitchen counter and I just you know it was this moment where we kind of realized a it was a really cool opportunity to have one of our retailers give us that kick in the butt and what's now become a pillar for us is design and we got that from our retail and started developing this weatherman went through this crazy journey of design of how to actually take this concert and make it look good and bring it into homes and turn that into what is today our first main product will go out how mushroom kits you pop it open and in 10 days you get about a pound fresh mushrooms right out of the box this one was unique we put this in in one Berkeley Whole Foods store within three months we're in Nash now nationwide with Whole Foods every single store in the country and at first very exciting you know two guys had never never sold a single thing in a retailer so we thought we had made it at some point we're like dude this is sick like we're in every store it's so easy and then we got displays a little bit like this around the country and and the same time especially this is about three and a half four years ago get a call again from from from Whole Foods around the country like guys you need to demo this this isn't selling we're like what do you mean but you already bought it he's like yeah we bought it but come and do some demos dude we're like okay like I guess that's what it takes so it was kind of realization that there's one thing about getting in the store but the other one was about getting it to the consumer and it was us two working we had an 800 square foot warehouse still that we somehow managed to get enough production nationwide but at the time right away we said all right cool we'll get a flight one way flight out to Washington DC Nick Hill took the west coast on LA and we just demoed as soon as a Whole Foods would open until it closed and we'd go from store to store to store we got this we rented this this car on the east coast is purple hideous car I was paying $17 a day this is most amazing and we went I went from DC down to the research triangle drove all the way across Atlanta then drove it all the way back up to Boston New York and then flew back out right after Christmas to be able to be able to barely make for the 25th dinner but I think the reality is I think it's taking so much real effort for us to actually start building a movement around people to be able to say like hey I can actually put this in my kitchen it was hand selling the crap out of these it was one consumer at a time and one growth grocery store at a time one produce department at a time and now it's been amazing to even see where I think about two years ago Walter Robert Co CEO of Whole Foods was like I think Alex and Nick have visited more Whole Foods than some of our team has and so it was very cool yeah and yeah as we spoke we started growing Whole Foods and this is kind of jumping our next retail partner and you know so this is a couple years ago we had just kind of built out this Whole Foods distribution and at that point still didn't have an office in 800 square foot warehouse in Emeryville and so we'd go there plant in the mornings and then go actually this is the Emeryville Home Depot and right next to it is a Starbucks so that was our office for like two years with the Starbucks you know open it up close it out and every morning we're working at that Starbucks and right across from us is this Home Depot with this beautiful lawn and garden center we're like why do these mushroom kits have to go in like how do we get these mushroom kits into that garden center and you know after enough thinking and trying to figure it out we're like let's just take that same approach we did with Whole Foods and decided to walk into that that Emeryville you know Home Depot with a couple mushroom kits and it was a funny we asked that that stores buyer to introduce us to his regional buyer and at that point he's like you guys are two crazy kids trying to grow mushrooms on coffee grounds like I can't do that but he did drop his buyers name and he wouldn't he wasn't willing to introduce us because he didn't want to put you know his name on the line for two people he didn't know but he gave us his name and we said that's all that's all it takes is only so many variations of that email address that can be so we tried first name that last name you know that every this first initial last initial literally I think I'm saying 20 things we sent over to him one of them actually came through just this incredible response and Tim was like you're interesting I'm down in San Diego do you want to meet and Alex jumps on the next flight down there and and meets up of course yeah the things are of course I'm in town easily and make that you know not trying to sound desperate at all but make that make that trip happen and but literally that that one email address those 20 attempts turned into a meeting with Tim and it's just crazy to see how one meeting one email can start cultivating a relationship and actually just this week we're excited announced that Home Depot expanded this nationally into 850 stores nationwide with displays across the country but that started off with a cold email to the buyer so aquaponics aquaponics that is the second product that we created we created a mini aquaponics kit and the way we developed actually was out of just mere curiosity we were doing farm tours we ended up doing a farm tour with Whole Foods in the Midwest we went up to Milwaukee and visited this farm that was taking and we had never seen anything like have any of you heard about aquaponics oh dang that's a lot it's so I'll say this is about two and a half years ago three years ago so I was even less people at the time I'd never heard of it but I went up to Milwaukee saw this and I was completely blown away it was the craziest thing you were in the middle of one of the toughest areas of Milwaukee and this farmer Will Allen was had turned this into this most amazing urban farm they were taking all this fish poop pumping it up using as a fertilizer organic fertilizer for the plants up top so they were growing from lettuce to basil to cilantro everything and the craziest part of it all is that that fish shit was actually the fertilizer for the plants and then the plants were indirectly cleaning the water bringing back down for the fish so it's this really cool ecosystem where the fish would feed the plants plants would clean the water and the system was using ten times less water less energy and Nick and I looked at this and we were like this is the coolest thing we've ever seen like how come we had never heard of it we're like can we create the smallest system ever and we got a picture from Will saying like there's already a kid out there and he sent us this picture of something it was like four feet by four feet 500 bucks and we were like that is not it's not an aquaponics kit and we spent a big leap of faith is because you know injection molded plastic product that we'd never even you know come close to creating the first one was mushroom farming a mushroom kit but we went out there leap of faith and we made a slight mistake and that we didn't present it to our buyer to begin with and here we just went at it went all in and went back to say show the prototype to Whole Foods and he said this time he's like guys I can't launch this like this is a fish tank go to a pet store and like well how do you do that you know so we we said instead decided to go with Kickstarter we said we had a community that was passionate evangelist consumer through our mushroom kit we had you know we had such and I think we've been building such relation by going every single store all those customers that bought the mushroom kits and put this up on Kickstarter we had a hundred thousand dollar goal ended up doing two hundred fifty thousand dollars in thirty days of pre-orders we took that momentum took it over to our website another quarter million dollars so this is half a million dollars of pre-orders without even creating the damn thing so we took that buzz and went back to Petco went back to Whole Foods went back to Nordstrom and for the first time ever those three retailers took this product on nationwide so we had a national launch with Whole Foods national launch with Petco national launch with Nordstrom and Petco actually put a little fish coupon inside because obviously Whole Foods is never gonna sell fish or Nordstrom's not gonna sell fish and we were able to use that coupon for anybody that bought it anywhere in the country they could go to Petco and but so here you are you know launching into into all these retailers and I think this is a lesson learned we though right away was just kind of still like getting caught up in that momentum and how to say no to buyers too and take the time you need to take it in this case we actually ended up rushing our launch into retailers with this packaging at the time we thought it looked gorgeous we're like it's symbolic it's artistic it hits the stores and we're like people have no clue what this is it's a big red fish on the you know in this like dark little looking tank and wasn't moving wasn't selling or like crap we just totally bombed this packaging we've been all this time developing a product now we can't communicate in stores and ended up actually having to do like an urgent rebranding of this packaging and all that goodwill we had built up with stores now we're here we are calling this produce buyers saying can you guys please take these off the off the store off the ground and actually putting these new ones in and it was just this crazy learning curve of like how to build momentum at the same time have enough kind of forward to to say no and take the time you need to take to launch it right and ended up redesigning it to what it is today a much more like bright vibrant colorful packaging that actually stands out and luckily learned that lesson with Kickstarter and Whole Foods who was really flexible with us and learned it in time to be able to do it right in Costco but that was um it's learning for us about this balance of retail of building momentum and yet taking your time to do it right because you can make one mistake it can it can put you out so yeah and as we grew distribution and group partnerships to you know we're in a few thousand retailers at the time but more importantly we were starting to build I think just genuine authentic relationships with our buyers directly and you know I think we started to have a voice and and and care about very particular things and we you know develop pillars to what we wanted back to the stand for on the out in the community out in the world and uh one of the most important things there is you know we really started taking big bets with our retailers and we approached Whole Foods and Costco and Amazon in particular and and Whole Foods from just the inspiration of how to grow food you know much more sustainable and just better way for the for society and had a had an opportunity to meet with the executive vice president of purchasing and sat down with them with the head of of produce head of grocery and the first thing he said is all right guys go and visit some more farms learn more about food because you guys don't really know that much yet we said okay so we took we took the opportunity to go with local foragers all around the country we ended up going to farms from Hawaii to Chicago to New York one of those was this top right that is actually believe it or not that is an avocado it over a thousand varieties of avocados in Hawaii and we're used to eating one variety mostly for the most part here a Haas avocado and through learning about heirloom varieties just became more and more curious more passionate about just how food used to be grown in the past how our grandparents used to eat how they used to cook and all that visited you know saw totally different kinds of bananas these little baby bananas that are huge in India huge in Latin America but you never see them in a grocery store here unless you go to an ethnic market and all that led us to a wheat farm and that wheat farm blew our minds honestly it was moments where you visit this farm and you see something you're eating every single day probably since the day you're born almost and we quickly realized like we had no clue how wheat actually grew or how it turned like all this food around us if it asked us like how stock of wheat turned into a cracker a bread a cookie we couldn't tell you we're like that's insane and then B we started learning all this crazy stuff what happens to wheat based on our industrial milling system all this stuff is taken out of wheat all the nutrients the brand the germ the endosperm is broken up and we started asking ourselves like how else did wheat used to grow and how else did it used to be milled and it led us down this this incredible exploration of the last year of visiting all these different like ancient milling practices and kind of started honing in this really cool practice with stone milling grains where you know 100 pounds of wheat goes into our mill and 100 pounds of flour comes out nothing's added or removed or fortified or broken apart it's just it's really pure you know grain and really pure flour and we're like how can we bring this back to more people today and bring it back to our generation something we were doing 100 years ago and we started looking at all these different categories around stores like where grains used today where is wheat used today and started really focusing in on this aisle and we're like here's this monstrosity of an aisle right 100 year old category 100 years old 10 billion dollar industry and there hasn't been any innovation from packaging to ingredients to branding it's either these really brown boring granola boxes or these bright pink you know desserts dressed up as a health food and we're like can we bring this innovation to it and ended up working really hard over the last few months to kind of undo this category like alex is saying taking it back to how it used to be done and developed for the first time the first US grown 100 percent stone ground breakfast cereal made with just three ingredients and packaging it in an entirely new form factor and putting that actually brand new organic stone ground flakes which we launched exactly one month ago now alongside a whole new kind of line of convenience customization to the entire category of these breakfast toppers and it's just been this incredible journey for us of how do we start co-developing these products alongside of our partners actually and it's led to some really interesting learning this is literally over the last five weeks yeah this is all happening as we speak so people still a lot of people still think we're nuts we're crazy for going from mushroom farming to fish poo farming to now wheat and cereal making and you know through that we've you know as I briefly mentioned we developed this alongside Whole Foods from the learning of how food grew to wheat farming but we worked with Costco at the same time and it was a GMM of Costco for we worked I mean this is a nine month in the process in the making we worked with Amazon because one of the problems is they're losing so much money delivering this to the home because a cereal box has 40 per 40 to 50 percent air so you're shipping half of the the cereal you're selling is being shipped with just air so we worked on having for the first time it's a hundred percent recyclable box but it's also 90 percent fill rate so you can use 25 percent less packaging as well but one of the challenges we had is two weeks before we're hitting stores the AGMM at Costco ends up retiring and we're like okay whatever we're gonna you know continue to this momentum it fortunately the momentum wasn't fully there they had no idea what was happening and we had two weeks to somehow get her excited about something we had worked on for almost you know nine ten almost a year with and what we did snoo and what we did know ahead of time is one of our strengths has been demoing we learned it firsthand and we said listen like has anybody demoed cereal in in Costco and they're like no we've been selling it for you know for 20 years here nobody's ever come in and demo like done like let us demo the crap out of that thing we'll go out there make sure we prove it it's exactly what's happening today and what we've done in the last five weeks we're the number one selling organic cereal in Costco nationwide we're selling right now in the Bay Area but thank you just had that humongous honor of meeting with the daughter of the founder of Costco in San Diego two weeks ago we're gonna be launching down in San Diego Colorado Arizona and Los Angeles regions of Costco and it all has been just off trying to find a key opportunity for us was being able to just demo the darn thing and I will say through that it's led us to Whole Foods also being a key partner Walter Rob actually putting it up on stage where there are hundreds of people there saying that this cereal could actually change the game with three Goliaths post Kellogg's GM running the show they own 90% of this 10 billion dollar industry and it's pretty amazing to see his support and you know I we talk about some successes I we can't leave this stage without talking about a lot of failures one of those is Safeway we've been trying in and out we had opportunities with the floral buyer was super excited launch was completely flopped we tried demoing didn't work and went back to our roots in a little bit you know in some way went back we had cold email the Home Depot buyer said hey how about it's cold email the president this time let's see what happens and got a chance and this is still in the making we still have not a real strong relationship with Safeway but at least that gave us one more opportunity and we're now working with the buyer for produce and looking to see if we can do it better we took that same we've done it with Kroger and and we're now just met with the Kroger buyer last week we're gonna be launching at 800 Kroger's in October we cold emailed the the CEO we said hey this is what we're doing we can't wait to be able to partner with you and wrote a really nice note back and ultimately it's just at the end of the day it's just turned into how do we create products that we're so passionate about and getting out to everybody try to find advocates in every corner and if you lose an advocate one way just keep on swinging and that's uh you know I guess maybe to wrap up on this this whole talk right now I kind of think if there's one thing leave you know I think that we've learned it's that number one of all this stuff reaching out finding advocates finding customers doesn't really matter if you don't stay true to what you believe in that took us a long time to kind of really find that and hone in on it and I think now we feel more clear than ever and for us that's developing products that are you know well designed with a kid focus and a real big focus on sustainability and you know people ask us how could you launch a mushroom kit a fish tank and now a breakfast cereal and I think for us it's because that underlying thing we've stayed true to it and that's the biggest lesson you've learned is staying true to yourself and for us it's connecting families back to their food and simplifying it undoing it through this really fun design lens and you know at the end of the day though there's there's this you know I think we step back and there's one thing I want to leave you guys with it's the retail and retail distribution isn't magic there's no secret sauce it's it's a lot of hard work it's it's like Alex said you got to keep on swinging and finding those advocates and it's a little bit of luck and at the end of the day it's I think we always challenge ourselves whether it's let's keep on swinging keep on outreaching find those partners but then once you find them latch on like hell and don't let go and keep on trying to co-develop with them and see what you can do together and I think we're learning firsthand right now that that by going deeper with this partnership so it can lead to some really incredible things and we're super excited for this next few years ahead being able to take this brand expand from what started off as an urban mushroom farm and really trying to ask yourself this question like what would craft foods look like if it was invented today by our age by Millennials and it was focused on sustainability transparency and it sounds like a really big question but we think as long as we find those partners and do it together we can hopefully do something pretty exciting and thank you guys for letting us share this story so appreciate it great thanks guys if you have any questions for them come on down hi guys thank you so much for the talk I really enjoyed it my question is kind of purposefully broad so please feel free to answer it however you like I'm curious how you look back on this journey that you've been on and obviously what strikes me most is that you have such a passion for this and that that passion has obviously grown right you found out about things that you never thought you would be finding out before like a fascination with flour for example right your investment baker selves of the past probably would have thought you were crazy I'm sure being like you're gonna be fascinated in five years about how flour is made but obviously at the same time you know growing these mushroom kits there was a fascination that you guys had with that and I'm just curious how you think about or how you see looking back what that like real fascination was and how you were able to cultivate it because I think it's something similar to what the Pandora founder was talking about before and like that magic that really can't be you know like bought or like gotten other than just by really feeling it I could just bring up one one one one thing which we we we talked about a little bit but it's just curiosity I would say is at the core to a lot of these things and curiosity and our you know curiosity and banking I love finance I I had a true genuine interest in it and I think you know nickel has had amazing experience himself building different things in college and you know basically valedictorian of our business school himself through just putting himself out there and asking the questions I think now as we continue to grow the big challenge and the big question we're always asking our team is continue to be curious and I think that leads to so many things and that's ultimately what's led to the yeah I think even our brand is quick build off of that is like we really try to focus our brand not on this idea especially the food were so personal of saying what's right or wrong about food because to be friendly we're not smart enough to know that I think it's such a complicated answer we're like how can we build a brand it's not around teaching what's right or wrong it's just about trying to get people curious to ask that question themselves like where does this come from and I think it started off with I think it started off because we knew so little about food we it's almost like we didn't know that going into but we knew so little about food starting all we could do is ask questions and now it's turned into is a big part of our brand it's just like we got to make sure we're just focused on education but on curiosity thank you so in the interest of time we'll take just these three hey guys I really like your story um this is kind of like a question and also like a recommendation um because again I really like your guys a story and like it really like I was able to connect with it so I wanted to ask are you guys interested in like potentially reaching out to Food Network and going on uh what's it called Food Fortunes it's like Shark Tank but for Food Network sure more publicity and to share your story have you guys considered that yeah that sounds awesome oh okay do you guys like how many plans that you'd like to share with the crowd like with like you know Food Fortunes wait what to like get on to Food Fortunes on Food Network are we auditioning now I mean that I think that'd be totally cool wouldn't it that sounds like an awesome it's a question and a recommendation I mean yeah and the question is do we want to yes absolutely like have you guys considered it and like are there any plans and if there are any plans I'd love to hear them oh to go on yeah to kind of like have like your I'd never heard of the show that sounds awesome yeah you can totally check it out Food Fortunes on Food Network Food Fortunes yeah it's like Shark Tank okay yeah yeah all right cool thank you that's Food Fortunes look at that um so it sounds like you've had a few products where you've just kind of gone out there and done it and you've launched with you know more and less successful designs but have you found any more lightweight ways to test whether it's design ideas or product ideas in the offline market rather than just kind of going out and seeing if it sells or not because offline markets meaning just online you can do a kind of test see if anyone's you know clicking or having general pick up interest very quickly versus offline you're just waiting for results to come in in terms of sales have you found so one way I mean we I could talk about me in terms of definitely it's very important to us and key I think the water garden is a really cool example of putting on a Kickstarter we had no idea we ourselves weren't even sure we could actually launch this thing if there was a demand for it there was a gut feeling put it out there and that was a really cool way in which we almost you know very much soft launch it where we had the pre-orders before even creating it even with it with a cereal you know we've gone through so many iterations on taste and flavor to get to where it is today so the cool thing is that even working with our partners we're able to go into demos and stores we're demoing on other products but have these like different variations of cereal and just for months in advance get like taste profiles get gut checks from customers like hey do you like this blind taste test so we've tried to find ways like leverage the community built with other products to now kind of get that gut check earlier because I think even now the larger swings we take that's the more risk too so like we launched a cereal first into Costco and with the water garden we launched on Kickstarter launching this thing first into Costco means we couldn't mess up we messed up we were out of business so we had to kind of feel really confident about it beforehand that answers your question hey so I was really interested in learning a little bit more about the manufacturing process I don't think you guys touched on that so yeah so yeah two quick as that's glad you asked something so so I think but we're so passionate about so we started off actually quick story in terms of one lesson she's of finding things you're really good at so we start this company everything ourselves we wake up at early in the morning collect coffee grounds come back plant the mushrooms harvest them sell them do repeat rinse and repeat for you know literally a year and a half and but through that way we kind of realized one thing which is that we sucked at growing mushrooms to be frank with you we're not very good at it and you know it's one summer we kind of I think overheated thousands of mushroom kits because we didn't know how to mess with the fluctuation in summer heat just like all these learning curves and along the way with this mushroom farm up in Sebastopol gourmet mushrooms first guys 30 years ago to grow gourmet mushrooms in North America and they were mentoring us for a while and finally we got to the scale they were like hey it might make sense for us to try to incubate these for you and at first we were really hesitant because that was our baby we were farmers we were producing stuff every single day ourselves were hands-on with it we knew what we knew what we were doing and finally we're convinced to let them try some out and try growing them and the first batch came back quality consistency was just like night and day from anything we were able to do and it was kind of like that lesson learned of like the spine partners who are better at things than we are and let them do it and after seeing the success of like finding a partner to go our mushrooms we've taken that not all our products and but the key there is like finding the right partners you really believe in because end of the day that's everything you have is a quality that product and so with the water garden this last story you know we had it's an acrylic injection molded item and we had try to source all these different manufacturers and 95% of manufacturers for that kind of stuff are overseas and spent a lot of time trying to find can we find one here locally and actually found a partner in Union City when the few injection molders called Jacko who's been just an incredible partner so that probably is actually like a hundred percent us made nor Cal made thing for an injection molded plastic piece which is pretty rare but it's become so cordless like let's find partners we can visit we know and we know who's making it for us thanks thanks guys thank you thank you guys thank you guys
