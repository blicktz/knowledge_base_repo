the premise of this there was a instagram influencer i think her name's amber lancaster and amber lancaster is a instagram mom she's got you know million followers or whatever and she had created this group and i think she kind of like created it but she's very hands-off with it it's not like a very calculated thing that she did and so the group is called better than google and the premise is inside this group is like 17 000 kind of like millennial moms like her audience people who you know because i was asking my wife i was like what is the group and she's like well it's just a bunch of moms who are like we're all kind of like in our 30s we all want to have a good life be a good mom be a good spouse watch good tv shows be healthy like we just have like a certain set of things we're just trying to have a certain quality of life and in doing so if you put a bunch of those people moms together then they can really help each other out it's better than google if you ask a question here you're going to get better than google type of answers here's an example question has anyone found an effective way to get rid of cellulite i'm pretty petite and i work out daily but my leg still has cellulite and it has 30 comments of people discussing how they did or didn't get rid of cellulite 100 it's like a media company it's got juicy content just like clickbait you know click worthy content but there's no editors no writers this is just people's real lives so a woman went on there and she was saying my husband was cheating on me i found out i confronted him about it he got really defensive and i want to file for divorce but then over the last few days i noticed he was he knew he like referenced things that were in my private messages like my messages to other people like how is he reading my i message and then the world's greatest tech support was in the thread where it was like all right you need to log out of your iCloud you need to do this you need to do this you might have a second ipad that's connected to your thing and that's how he's being able to read this and they really helped her out she's like oh thank you i figured it out there was this ipad and whatever that's how he was reading my messages and so now i can do whatever that's a better answer than you would get if you just googled the sort of same thing and it's more trusted and trust is the key word here so when i originally came on this drunk ideas thing i was just laughing better than google is just like a you know what a funny way to create a google competitor it's like what's better than google machine learning artificial intelligence it's like 10 000 moms who are bored and scrolling on their phone and it's it's kind of true though the wisdom of the crowds is actually uh you know a very strong force and the more i thought about it the more i realized this is actually a really good potential business idea here's why so i've long since had this theory that whenever one thing gets really popular it creates a craving for the opposite so we see this in many ways a classic example of this was facebook became the biggest social network in the world and facebook was basically uh photos but it was permanent and public right you would post your albums there everybody could see them and they stayed there forever well as facebook got more popular it created the need for something like snapchat where you would have photos that are impermanent and not public private right and so snapchat succeeded but it wouldn't have succeeded unless facebook had already shifted the way that culture was working and it almost created a craving in people for the opposite and i think you see that today where the more the world got woke and you know you can't say this and you can't say that and you have to use these pronouns do this do that and then it creates a craving for a character like an andrew tate or even a donald trump or somebody who's oh he's a straight shooter he's just going to call it like it is and those people become very popular because they're a counterpunch to the way that things are going or the the other strong opposition so similarly i started thinking about this i said man in an ai world a lot of shit's going to change and if you're going to just type into you know a box and it's just going to give you the answer and it's going to scrape the internet it's going to give you some generic answer that's going to be big for sure there's definitely a market for that but what's the opposite of that what craving does that create and what i realize is it's going to create the craving for almost like the the old village wisdom right how how you can get answers from a bunch of humans who you can see their name and face and they can tell you things that are their personal experience rather than generically the right answer and i think that if somebody made an app that was the same premise the better than google premise and it was a community of you know 10 000 20 000 moms who were going to answer questions that would be a really powerful app i think it would be really addictive because you would get the type of content like the botox question by the way one key thing is you can share anonymously in the groups you go anonymous and then you post about the infidelity in the marriage and that's that's part of why it works so i think you would need those features but think about how valuable that would be for a second like if i could pick any one customer segment to have like a rabid community of it would be moms like it would be people that control the household budget in america that would be the most valuable audience segment that you could have and i think this is the way to get it do you remember cha-cha cha was that like the old search engine that was kind of like this like yahoo answers type of thing yeah so i'm just pulling this up right now but basically i remember it when i was in high school and so that was about 2008 so it was launched in 2006 it went bankrupt in 2016 and so basically it was a service and i i didn't actually realize any of this but it raised six million dollars including from jeff bezos and they had 5 000 freelance guides meaning people who they hired and i would send a text message to cha-cha i remember this was during the world cup and i was like testing it out and i was like what's the tallest and what's the shortest player on this particular soccer team because i was just testing it out and i think i paid them two or three cents or something like that and they would message me back in like three minutes with an answer and at the time it was amazing and i'm just reading their page now it looks like they actually had raised up to 60 million dollars and the and they had something like 1.7 billion questions a month of people that people were asking and it was like magic back then because we didn't have google on our phone i didn't have a smartphone and i remember this being amazing and eventually it went out of business because google is just better but i just don't know if it could ever make any money i think i paid like two cents or something like that a text message well that's that's the beauty of it you don't need to actually pay for an expert answer so so like here's some different analogs to this so you have a quora which is a bunch of more i would call it tech nerd type of community and then you have glg which is highly paid intellectual information right and there's a different customer for that for the customer for that it's going to be a hedge fund or a some sort of investment banker or something something like that and then you have google which is the general search and you know google's market cap today is i think 2.3 trillion and if you think about like search on the internet so the big the general search on the internet google was 2.3 trillion and then you can like silo that into different things like searching for restaurants it's like yelp and i don't know what yelp's market cap is i mean it's billions but it just hasn't grown in years two billion right so you know the search for restaurants and handymen in your area became two billion out of the two trillion and then glass door which was like search for you know good places to work and and then you have search for jobs and then you have search for whatever and there's a thousand tiny search engines and these are all like single digit billions companies for the most part that got created and so i think and then we have duck duck go which is kind of like the uh for the you know tech savvy person who cares about privacy and likes to not be doing the mainstream thing here's duck duck go and we've talked about them before about how much insane amount of traffic that they have so i think that while search and this kind of question answer thing feels like a solved problem um and even the kind of community questions and answers like you would think well why not quora why not reddit dude my wife is not getting on quora and reddit reddit it's just like it repels women like dude isn't it funny how reddit works so reddit is i don't remember what they are now but two years ago they're like the sixth or seventh most popular website and yet if you asked people do they use reddit a very common answer was like what's reddit it's a very strange thing i love reddit by the way i use like it's made for dorks like us right yeah yeah guys with body odor right it's not made for the millennial mom who wants to go in a high trust place and not get trolled and not get spammed and not get like you know made fun of and not like she doesn't get all the weird memes and they kind of like it's just different it's a different culture and so i think that this kind of reddit for mom's uh angle which you you couldn't really if you had pitched me that generically i wouldn't believe it as soon as i saw better than google i thought man if somebody really created an app that's supposed to do this and they seeded it correctly the beauty of this was it was seeded with only followers of a certain type of instagram influencer which created a like-minded community of of members and it excluded the general trolls of the internet if you could find a way to do that again i think that thing would scale and i think that thing would be really really valuable the value per user would be really really high all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here
