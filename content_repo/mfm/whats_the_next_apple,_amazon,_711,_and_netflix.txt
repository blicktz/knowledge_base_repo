i want to give you some predictions um so i've been thinking about this i said okay what's apple becoming because i see apple apple shifting into like health in a pretty big way with these wearable devices and so let's just say apple which today the core benefit is they give you this ultra personal device your little personal supercomputer that's going to help you with life so i don't think the next apple is a phone company i think the next apple the next apple which is going to be a trillion dollar company that has uh that gives you kind of like a consumer device i think it's going to be a healthcare monitor i think it's going to be something that is going to be measuring what's going on inside your body and feeding that data back to you and so that's my that's my prediction the next what the next apple looks like not a phone company healthcare monitoring device next amazon this one's stolen from mark lori next amazon so amazon a place to shop it's not going to be a website where you uh where you type in a word and then you get 5 000 images as a result and then you got to sort through them the next amazon is conversational shopping in your house it's just saying what you need and having something go get it for you um so basically just saying hey uh we need more p pads for the dog and it says you want the same ones as last time i say yes and then it's boom it's ordered right i didn't have to type anything in didn't have to enter a credit card it's all on file and it's just a hands-free voice assistant that helps me shop for things and when i don't know what it is it could say i could say hey um i need a you know the best camera for my webcam and it could say something like do you want the ones that most of the youtubers use do you want the ones your friends bought the most or do you want the one that's the best value or the highest price and i'm like ah what do my friends have sam has this one would you like to ask him how it is yes it asks sam and then sam says it's amazing and then i buy the thing right conversational commerce something like that that's the future that's the next amazon next netflix okay net wait you skipped over 7-eleven oh i'm gonna do 7-eleven too okay 7-eleven the next 7-eleven what is 7-eleven it's a corner store that has like a little local convenience store this one's easy this one is um it's a cloud corner store so you don't need a real location it's just going to be 500 square feet that's within one mile of you it might be in this back alley place it doesn't need a good location and it's going to deliver to you with small lightweight drones so small little pass a small little carrier drone going to bring you something within 15 minutes of ordering no human being involved and the whole the whole 500 square foot place doesn't need good real estate and is going to be automated so that um you know when i push the button to order it there's no human being in the place it just pops out like a vending machine the drone takes it straight to me and it lands on a little landing pad that i have in my front lawn for uh drone deliveries and as soon as it's there i go outside i pick it up the next netflix net net next netflix i think is going to be um one of two things one is it's either in vr and it's more like it's a hybrid it feels like a game so you put the headset on you enter the world and then you walk around and you sort of experience a movie um so it's either vr or or because i think i'm not sure about that one um or it's machine generated movies which is basically something personalized to you so right now a movie is like a really specific story that gets filmed edited produced has actors blah blah i think you might be able to just sit down and be like i want something that's like breaking bad but with casinos and then it just generates it just machine generates a movie for you uh based off of basically it's like a mashup and you've seen this with music so google released this thing called composer or whatever it's like this ai that basically writes classical music that sounds like it's made by bach and mozart and um and it's basically just it's just taking all the stuff that exists out there it studies it and then it creates remixes and mashups of all those things in a way that's maybe it could be one time it's like i get this thing and it's like a one-time movie for me um that could be kind of crazy remember that band remember that band girl talk yeah mashups yeah yeah i used to love those things man i still work out to that that's my go-to for workouts same i love that too it was like feed the animal or something like that that's yeah that's a great track uh-huh i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back were companies online
