This is not a tech problem, it's a distribution problem. I think you said it really well. And people typically don't understand that.

They say, well, I've created this interesting thing, therefore everyone will buy it. They're actually, unfortunately, wrong. I think that what I always say is if you have amazing distribution in a shit product, you're going to win.

If you have amazing distribution in an amazing product, you're going to dominate. And so it's kind of like Kylie Car... Kylie Car Jenner.

Kylie Car Jenner. What's that girl say? Kylie Jenner.

Oh, Jenner, yeah. Dude, it doesn't matter what the fuck she sells. It's going to crush it.

Right. She has a huge distribution channel she owns. This is a relationship with millions and millions of people.

And by the way, that's what I think about my startup back in 2011. We fell into the trap, you just said a second ago, we built a really great product. They've spent so much time and effort on product.

And we had no idea how to distribute it to this long tail of schools and teachers are trying to sell to. Right? It's like the hardest people to sell to.

Oh, impossible because a person who buys is not the person who pays. You have this crazy cash crunch every month where it's like, oh, even though I have committed ARR of 100 grand, whatever it is, 100K, I in fact have real ARR of zero because it goes through provisioning. It goes through the accounting cycle in the district because you don't get the money for six months after they actually signed the contract.

They die in that six months. You're great. I'm so glad that we have time for issues with the big all the time and we love the business online, and this is going to be aходит todoaya web.

I're going to goこちら.
