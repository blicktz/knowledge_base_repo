i told you i'm in content mode baby i'm writing and i'm i got some gems uh i'll give you the headline of something i'm writing right now i haven't even released this any of this stuff yet um but but it's called congratulations you climbed mount stupid all right what's up fellas it's friday how you guys doing doing great good good uh we're reacting to the news we got some good ones this week uh let's start with uh let's start with jake paul versus tommy fury uh jake paul of course is famous influencer uh has since become a professional boxer for the first time he lost a fight uh losing to tommy fury a professional boxer and social media influencer and uh not just the fight is notable what's also notable is that sam you basically called exactly what would happen in the fight uh so do you want to take your victory lap right now sam no i didn't call exactly but i have been getting good at predicting fights i'm a huge combat sports fan um but i i didn't exactly get it but i loved it you know why i love it i love freak shows this was a freak show and i am always going to pay for that pay-per-view and watch freak shows i thought it was awesome second i think if you're listening to this whether you're a man or a woman you should go and train boxing just for like three months and actually spar not like rumble where you're just hitting the bag but i think you should spar and i'm not talking spar like where you kick someone's ass or you get beat up because sean you remember when we sparred it doesn't hurt right if you do it with someone who like it doesn't have to hurt but well you know what it does it scares you it's a very scary heart rate up it gets the heart rate up you you if you do it right with someone who's been there done that you're not going to get hurt i promise you're going to get hurt by running more than you will actually sparring if you do it with someone who knows what they're doing but that like fight or flight response we never get that and so i love that he did that i find it very courageous that he actually stood in front of all these people and fought so kudos to him but uh yeah i don't think he's gonna like be a great boxer i mean props to him uh first of all came on the show so gotta give him credit for that came on came on our show now he's doing other shows these are all you know just highlights of his life i'm sure it's just a correlation yeah exactly i'm not saying one caused the other but like probably we did do our show before you know a lot of this stuff happened we we did do our show before he did every other show and so uh i thought it was great you know uh i think the transition from like disney kid vine star youtuber kind of uh you know brand to he's legitimately good he is legitimately good he is not i would not call him a celebrity boxer he's like an amateur boxer actually like he's like he's a very good amateur amateur boxer and he's an entertainer and like he you know he's done an amazing job staying relevant but evolving the game with him i think that uh a lot of people hate on this guy or laugh at him or whatever else i think there's a lot of good lessons you can take about reinventing yourself and finding a way to merge maybe things you're interested in or passionate about with your skills in the world of business or entertainment and uh he's done it phenomenally well and thinking from first principles like him and his brother logan they didn't just ask what should i do next as a youtuber they were like what can i do next using this audience and this fame and they came up with different answers than 99.9 of other youtubers out there you're getting credit for that yeah and he's tough i don't think he's going to be a great boxer but he's super tough for doing that so that's awesome next next from one controversial social media star to another andrew tate and his brother tristan are being detained for a third 30-day sentence in romania of course they're charged with human trafficking they claim that there is no evidence and they still haven't had a trial uh what do you guys take and rotate human trafficker or wrongly imprisoned oof i don't know much about it do you no i mean who knows what he did but uh first of all romania guilty until proven innocent what's going on here why is he why is he in these like he says because he's tweeting out he says he's like in solitary confinement basically um while he hasn't had a trial that's a that's a little strange uh he also said uh dude he said i've been in this thing for 30 days now they don't let me out just imagine locking yourself in your bedroom for 24 hours just go ahead and do that now think about where i'm going through i i wanted to cry but then he said like but i realize i'm too tough for that uh but it's why does he have twitter access does everybody can somebody explain this to me because he tweeted out two hours ago my body is in jail but my mind is not in jail do you understand what i don't understand is how do you have twitter right now yeah i don't know either what kind of lax prison is this yeah and you said are you going to be putting free tape in your twitter bio no i'm not going to be putting that i i don't care are you gonna put dude i will pay you a hundred dollars to put free cobra tape in your twitter bio that would be so funny for 24 hours just do it that'd be amazing oh no not a chance i i'm not team andrew tate i'm i wouldn't say i'm not i don't like how he talks to people so i guess i would say i'm i'm kind of against him i have no idea about this story other than if he did do what he's accused of then yeah that sounds pretty fair but i have no idea what the truth is yeah he's kind of cringe to be honest with you but uh yeah let's go on all right let's move on to the lab leak theory so multiple government sources are now saying that they think the lab leak theory for the origins of coven 19 is true this includes the department of energy and the fbi so fellas are you surprised i am not surprised i am not surprised this ever since that one john stewart clip have you seen this this john stewart clip sam where he goes no but he was ringing the bell early on right yeah it was pretty early on this was like when it was still unpopular and in fact you would get like censored or your videos taken down or like a giant flag saying this person's a conspiracy theorist for saying it and he goes on the colbert show and he does this little bit where he goes um he says something about the lab leak and you know it's leaked from a lab and it's crazy and then colbert goes whoa whoa whoa we you know lab leak i mean you're saying that we we there we don't know that there's no evidence because evidence there's a coronavirus that originated in wuhan where there is the wuhan coronavirus lab because it's in the name and he just keeps going off he's like he's like there's a chocolate leak in hershey pennsylvania is this you know is this random or maybe it's the chocolate factory you know like it he brings us up and it was just like so obvious at that point um and it's like what how unlikely would it be that in all places the novel he's like the novel coronavirus originates in wuhan where there is the wuhan novel coronavirus research lab like you know you're telling me that that just happened to be the case like seems like the odds are that it came from that lab not that it just happened to be in that lab in that same area i remember my friend jack telling me about this like early on and my friend jack is not quite a he's not a conspiracy theorist at all but he is very open minded and like he believes like he doesn't believe lots of things but he'll like when people say that they originally were thinking well that's crazy and his response was like okay well let's see what the evidence is and and maybe we'll explore it and i remember him telling me that i'm like jack you're pretty crazy for thinking that and my big lesson over these last three years as it regards to this story it's not like did it or did it not come out of that but now it's looking like maybe it did or at least for sure it did somewhere between maybe and for sure not for sure it didn't and my takeaway is there's things that i would used to dismiss as just crazy and only crazy people would believe this but i've seen over the last five or ten years as i've like become more of an adult and like paid attention to these things i've seen that like man crazy things do happen and also a lot of huge life-changing things are just accidents they just happen like and and and now i have a little bit more of an open mind when people say like well this person is uh conspiring with this other person to make this happen or whatever and i'm like oh maybe they're let's let's have an open mind and explore the facts if we can right yeah there's a i remember back when this first started it was basically considered racist to say that the virus might have leaked from the lab in china and i never understood that i was like why would that be racist how is that racist i lived in china i don't find this racist in any way like what are you talking about and um it reminds me of one time i tweeted out my favorite books i've tweeted out five of my favorite books or something like that and then the comment goes a bunch of people start commenting they go there's not one woman on this list and i go these are my favorite books what are you talking what are you what are you talking about what i have to have 50 diversity in my favorite books and i i just replied i go all my favorite nba players are black and that just set people off that totally triggered everybody because i was like no i am not apologizing because i named five of my favorite books and they just so happen to be written by men like that is not at all what i'm talking about and you're trying to like you know i call these people meter maids they just run around the internet looking for little tickets at the cars that they could take it like where can i go be offended um you you didn't you were not inclusive enough for me ticket and i was like what are you talking about that's not even what this was about did you invent meter made yeah yeah i did that last night i told you i'm in content mode baby i'm writing and i'm i got some gems uh i'll give you the headline of something i'm writing right now i haven't even released this any of this stuff yet um but but it's called congratulations you climbed mount stupid and i'm just working backwards from that headline to be like what's the what is the content here uh but but i've just got a bunch of gems that i'm putting uh in my on my email list by the way go go subscribe to my email list i'll put in the show notes seanpuri.com and go go put your thing in there i'm writing 365 original pieces in the next uh in the next year so one a day will go out and one of them is going to be called congratulations you climbed mount stupid what are you doing like a daily email yeah but it's a sequence that would never work it'll work i know i'm joking because we both had oh okay bad joke our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better all right ben what do you got all right let's go uh rapid fire through a few of these uh i don't know if you guys saw this the felix dennis house so felix dennis very famous entrepreneur your boy i love him yeah uh publisher of oz and author of how to be rich so he built this house for five million pounds uh it just sold for four million pounds it's really cool but one of the weirdest houses you'll ever see it's mostly a pool uh in the middle and it's treasure island themed with like palm trees and like a bunch of pirate stuff and the whole house only has two bedrooms so the question is fellas does this make you guys into themed houses are you guys going to be building uh themed houses now well the takeaway here for me is f legacy because this guy built something that he wanted and oftentimes people will say things like um well what about the resale value of this thing um or how uh how is this going to impact your legacy and my reply to that lately has been like well i don't know like i'm i'm gonna be dead i don't care and so what i appreciate about this is that he spent his money the way he wanted to and he made something cool even if it didn't do uh make any financial sense so i think it's cool um and if you haven't read his book how to get rich we talked about a bunch here it changed my life whenever we talk about that book it like goes up to like number uh 10 top 10 in the business category so go read it it's it's awesome there's a picture in this article of him with a uh extremely um voluptuous person that says felix dennis spent a hundred million dollars on sex drugs and rock and roll in his lifetime yeah that's what he talks about so he basically says uh from your bucket list right sam yeah wasn't that your new company's mission statement core values close uh he uh basically from age like 35 to uh like 40 he was addicted to crack that was his drug was i swear to god crack cocaine he loved it and he died uh single he had a partner but they had an open relationship so the guy's been doing a lot of psychedelics and open relationships before it was cool um no he was a very weird and quirky guy and he like basically says he spent a north of 100 million dollars in his book he goes i spent 100 100 million on on hookers and crack so uh you know whatever dude yeah i don't believe that everyone's happy wilt chamberlain said he slept with 10 000 women in his lifetime and if you do the math dude the math on that is like horrible it's like it's crazy it's like dude you got to sleep with two women a day for you know many years yeah i think it's even more than that because he wasn't that old at the time um by the way you said something about themed houses i'm in on themed houses i think themed houses are great and more than the more than the theme actually is epic common area he said two bedrooms that i think bedrooms are a giant waste i think you only need a couple bedrooms and you should have epic common areas if you're gonna have a mansion i don't like the eight bedroom mansion you know like i got opinions on mansions and that's one of them you got to have epic common spaces and only a couple bedrooms three or four bedrooms max i don't want to see a fifth bedroom and you know what his um charity was that he left all of his money to was creating forests so he's like the johnny apple sea of england the guy he like has like thousands of acres of forests that he owns and i think this house it's known for having all types of trees so in columbia he's like the crack cocaine foundation i'm donating my wealth all right thanks all right uh i love this one the minnesota department of transportation ran a snowplow naming contest so they got a new snowplow they needed a name and they out they crowdsourced it to the public here's some of the top vote getters you're a blizzard harry blizzo clearopathra better call salt and han snolo so guys do you have a favorite from this list the last one i think i like clear clear path i think that was pretty good i did not see that one coming remember when they did a boating mcboat face when like uh i think it was like uh i think it was like either a fairy or a tugboat or something like that like a town let people vote on it and reddit got a hold of it and they made the number one voted thing boating mcboat face uh and so i love these viral stunts i think they're awesome sam i don't want to steal your thunder but you did want to announce your tattoo naming contest sam is willing to get a tattoo on his back that any anybody that is going to be a contest from the fans of my first million isn't that right sam that is totally wrong i was that is i think i did what i did say there's this you remember how we talked about mini katana yeah they're sending me a gold sword i guess katana i don't know the difference that has mfm on it so i'm i'm collecting all types of mfm stuff i don't know if you have to call a katana a sword by the way is it what the meter maids are running around they're excited about that one oof uh well i have a gold katana on my way that has my first million on it so i'll i'll accept all mfm stuff but i'm not gonna tattoo with with these degenerates how about at a million youtube subscribers will you get a crowdsource tattoo i will get a tattoo at a million for sure uh when i i went and did this podcast uh in la with like this uh guy cody co so he's really good he's kind of like a a comedy youtuber guy and um his studio looked awesome he was telling us about they have this uh they have like a network and they have some other show called trillionaire energy or something like that um and so he they put it up on the screen there's like a screen you can see while we're sitting there and it was the two hosts in slow motion with music just getting closer together and these two guys just made out and i go whoa what's the show about he goes no they had said if they get to whatever a hundred thousand subs that they would kiss did they really do that and i go oh yeah that's a good idea that's how like you comedy youtube or hollywood people think yeah that's a good idea we're not going to do that but but that's a great idea did they really do it like they did it's a hilarious video it's in slow-mo as they get closer and closer and they just make out and they tongued it's intense i'd rather be i'd rather be unsuccessful yeah exactly you know when people say like how bad do you want it i don't want it that bad there's a quote about success you got to find the price of success and then pay it too expensive for me yeah it's out of my budget yeah i'm out we have we have food at home you want to do one more yeah it's the last one all right last one so uh blue sky is a new twitter clone uh backed by jack dorsey and unlike twitter it is decentralized and so the question is fellas are you supporting our comrades over at blue sky or are you supporting the capitalist pigs over at twitter what's your move dude jack dorsey owns a bank how are you going to call him a comrade right he's moving away from capital he's seen the air of his way soon dude when i hear okay so here's some of the words they use open source social protocol uh and decentralized when i hear those words i just i just don't care i just don't care at all like they want me to care about it and that's wonderful and maybe sometimes i'll act like i do uh but i don't i don't care at all uh if you tell me uh probiotic antioxidant right yeah i don't care if you want to shove it in there and i'll drink it if it tastes good right but i don't but i don't need to know that's exactly right i'll drink it if it tastes good that's my take on this as well i'll use this this app if it's awesome if the content is great and the people on it are interesting and if it's something different than twitter if it's twitter but the database is different i'm out i don't care about that that's not that's not what draws people in i don't that doesn't mean it's not a good idea great do it do it differently under the hood but it has to result in something different that the person actually gets to use yeah and the same thing happened with web 3 where they like they give me this horrible pitch and then they end it with web 3 and i'm like well i don't care if it's web 3 just does this thing work is it awesome and i feel the same way about this so i don't care and also matt have you tried mastodon yeah dude it's stupid too it's stupid no like it's it's dumb so anyway i'm not on board with this all right all right it's
