okay we'll do one more we're almost out of time um so i'll do this company i don't know how you say it taiv it's taiv taiv um weird name don't know why they chose that name but whatever so um what these guys are doing is they you know how every bar or restaurant has tvs and they're playing sports usually or whatever it is so what they're saying is hey the commercial break that's a lost opportunity right um so what they do is they hijack the commercial break on that tv and they just upsell stuff from your menu so you know you're watching the game when the commercial happens it'll show the wings that they have on the menu and be like nine dollars for these wings right now you want it um it's a commercial just locally for your bar or restaurant i love this idea because i think there's a lot of restaurants out there who um who are in this scenario they have you know lots of bars lots of restaurants that have tvs so i think there's a decent market for it um i like the idea of helping them make money um it's a very simple solution but the thing is most of these restaurants and bars haven't done anything yet so like this is a there's a lot of low-hanging fruits still available this is one that i like it's like sort of an ad block for those tvs what i think might be challenging for them is selling into bars and restaurants i think that's going to be a slow and painful process for them all right i'll i i have a little background info information on this you know tribe tv no what's that okay so you know the tribe.com yep okay the tribe.com the founders leo um it's and i know leo and john uh leo is one of my investors and someone i look up to he started the chive and he uh now they have chive tv and the way it started was they would get like a lot of funny videos like america's funny some videos just like dad's getting hit in the nuts by their kids swinging a pinata baseball bat like just silly stuff and in all of texas what they did was they would give these bar owners these little dongles like these like fire sticks like an amazon fire stick and they uploaded all this programming and they just like constantly filling the pipes and so if you go to the bar you see just like america's funniest home videos in the background and chive would put their ads in the in in the mix and they made millions of dollars doing it and so much so that they eventually spun it off into a different company and they call it atmosphere tv and they've just raised 10 million dollars to launch it and leo was like this is going to be a multi-billion dollar business and uh interesting so i have now the verdict's still out if that's going to happen but chive tv was huge for the chive atmosphere he says it's going to be the greatest thing ever and he said that what they need to do is just go out and hire the same thing that i described earlier hire a ton of people how he goes yeah we're just going to hire a ton of sales people and we're going to do this and then another bit of background is you and i talked to the folks at firefly yeah i won't put words in your mouth but i have no problem in saying i thought that was a horribly dumb stupid idea and this idea is a little bit similar but i think way better right yeah more more defensible for sure um firefly is the company that puts a little ad little billboard thing on top of an uber um so an uber driver can make a little bit more money that's cool but um this is this is a little bit different this is more what i'll call um it's not dependent on the ad market which i like you're internally advertising stuff in the restaurant or the bar to get people to have a little higher check size yeah but that's not what they're saying that in in their deck they say at first they're doing what you're describing right uh and they go they said all of our one-year contracts are insanely profitable but our next phase is to sell ad time at 25 per cpm interesting okay all right so maybe maybe the in in in restaurant upsell is not as good as i thought and that's why they're like already planning to go out of that um and i think that's a good market but in their numbers what they're assuming they're saying they're going to have a 25 cpm that's going to make us way more money and create this new 32 billion dollar market and the math is that we have x amount of impressions and we're going to put 25 cpm ads on there now here's the problem which is their fill rate is not going to be 100 and it's not even going to be close to 100 yeah so that sounds a little ridiculous here's the other thing i don't like uh so they charge 4200 per location per year that's really expensive for a restaurant or bar um they also charge a one-time 1500 hardware installation and so i just think that they've added a lot of friction um to the adoption of this i think already it was going to be hard to get people to adopt that's a high price point and um a high one-time installation fee that they're asking people to do so i think that's that seems tough for me that said i think that this this could be a business that makes tens of 20 30 40 50 million dollars a year in sales this is a great company to own not a great company to invest um not a great company if they raise all this money that's my opinion yeah that makes sense i like this they just had someone smart once told me he said the only thing that you can't screw up in business is your cap table and so when i look at when i look at a lot of these companies i think that could be good so so long as they don't screw up their cap table right uh yeah that that is one way to uh die for the wrong reasons that's a great way to put it you you you you
