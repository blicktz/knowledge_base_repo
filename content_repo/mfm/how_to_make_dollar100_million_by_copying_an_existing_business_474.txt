we're like yeah we're just gonna do the same thing but a little bit cheaper and we're calling it the echelon it's pretty wild that they pulled this off i saw them originally at ces i was like oh cool a peloton booth and it was echelon it was it was the same thing it was the exact same thing uh what's going on uh yeah you know lots of things going on where do you want to start you drive what do you got all right i got a couple quick like random ideas for you okay so um so i'll call this um the big box strategy okay here's my big box strategy so i saw recently that kevin hart was like hey our thing our new thing is live at walmart and i was like new thing what is it this looks pretty much like athletic greens and sure enough it kind of is it's just athletic greens plus kevin hart going into walmart uh like lower price point basically how much is it athletic greens is like 80 bucks a month yeah athletic is expensive uh let me see greens let's see his thing vita hustle is his uh is the name of oh my god um and literally it's like a picture of him drinking his greens and electrolytes on uh on the on the camera or whatever so anyways i saw going to walmart and i had had this realization the other day when i was walking around at costco i was walking around costco and costco is amazing costco if you have a costco deal uh if you talk to anyone who has a costco deal they're like costco drives insane volume it will make us as a company it also might break us as a company because they cut like pretty ruthless deals and if you ever like lose costco or they like they don't go through with their purchase order like you might be screwed um but picasso could drive ton of volume and i was walking around and i basically saw in costco if you go look every electronic like piece of equipment that's there is is like a it's not a chinese knockoff it's like an american knockoff of an american product yeah it's like their light version there's this mattress nine sleep it's like what this is this is just like it's dude i have a 300 costco mattress in one of my rooms in my house and whenever guests stay there they go where'd you get this mattress they ask about it all the time i'm like 280 bucks at costco so basically they have a lot of these like um you know blenders uh you know like fitness trackers things like that right so they have like they need kind of like they need it at a certain price point so there's a strategy which is basically you take the highly desirable thing that's kind of at a a too high price point like athletic greens or another one or a ring um i don't know if you've ever looked into buying an uro ring but it tracks your sleep it's whatever it's cool ring that tracks your sleep and it's like it's like 700 or something like that for this ring um and maybe they've changed the pricing now but like i think when i bought it it was 700 um or okay it looks like it's like 500 let's say so about 500 bucks for like the the kind of like the generation three uro ring they they've sold like a billion dollars of uro ring so there's definitely demand for this product like in there the cumulative sales is is that high but you go to costco there's no uro ring and there's no replacement for uro ring i think you could create a company that just says i'm going to make a uro ring like thing for costco and that's the entire business plan is just to do that one thing and if you do that one thing you'll be more successful than 99 of e-commerce stores you got to think smarter and not working not like try to work so hard so like similarly i would go and i would hunt down what are the products that are not yet in walmart or costco places that drive insane volume targets another one um that there is proven kind of like high-end new york la lululemon drink a lululemon uh peloton type of customer that that that buys a product like that and you just bring it down market and like just make it a little worse like there are a gun and like you know they've done this with a bunch of them um and go figure out which one is not there like for example the mattress thing it's actually not there yet there is no eight sleep mattress there there is no uro ring there yet at least last time i walked around um and i think that's a just a simple strategy for e-commerce have you heard of echelon echelon no you should look up echelon so echelon is a fitness company they started oh it's peloton it looks exactly like peloton i don't know when exactly they started but they it's it's an american company i think too so if you go to echelon fitness it i think they maybe have changed their branding but before it was the same red dude as peloton same as it it it was a peloton but cheaper and they now they have yes and they do uh the guy who started i read this interview with him so basically they have the uh the mirror the fitness mirror that was really popular called mirror they have a smart rower which a few companies said and they did the peloton bike now they have a smart treadmill and they just did the same thing but cheaper and at first it was all the same branding but instead of peloton it said echelon they're on track to do 200 million dollars a year in revenue this year i think it's a boot trap company like i think they just said like whatever you do so it says uh peloton rival echelon fitness eyes uh 1 billion valuation so maybe they oh they they recently uh raised some money uh but they were like yeah we're just gonna do the same thing but a little bit cheaper and we're calling it an echelon it's pretty wild that they pulled this off i saw them originally at ces i was like oh cool peloton booth and it was echelon it was it was the same thing it was the exact same thing it was pretty funny and they do they have a ride with pitbull so like pitbull the rapper is like the guy uh that they chose they're in walmart costco target things like that whereas you know lululemon's company mirror and peloton was like walmart people not a chance like we we want skinny people to get skinnier you know like it was that was their whole shtick and they went the exact like peloton but the seat is wider for other sorts of people yeah that's what they that's what their motto is other sorts of people uh and anyway yeah we are your type yeah we're gonna make you look like the before picture instead of the way before picture uh and so anyway pretty cool that they've done exactly what you're talking about this kevin hart thing it's kind of stupid it's kind of cheap though right if if i'm if i'm kevin hart i don't know if i would be doing this 100 million dollars gonna be stupid because that's what he's gonna make off this thing i have a meaty topic about your old company the milk road and how i think that you guys have just made a huge mistake i'm gonna bring that up in a minute and i want to get your opinion on it but before i do i want to talk about something that's not business related at all but it kind of is and i'm gonna get to it uh i've been working on like different body stuff like i love like experimenting with body and this is like a little uh vein of me to bring this up but i posted these pictures in our doc and they're about two months apart and basically what i've been experimenting with body wise is like getting super lean and like somewhat skinny and then like gaining weight again but without getting fat you know they call it like a like a dirty bulk that's when you eat like a ton of food and you but you get muscle and you get fat i've been experimenting with that but look at the difference of the two pictures that i shared and if this is on youtube we'll put it on the screen i guess it seems a little weird but i guess we'll do it dude we're making this the thumbnail if you're going to bring this up we're getting the clicks so uh welcome all of our thumbnail viewers who clicked because you saw a before and after of sam well it's not the the pictures aren't that shocking but here's what i've been testing just a difference of two to three hundred calories a day for two months so you go down to like 1900 to 2000 or 1900 or 2100 ish that's my window when i'm getting skinny up to like 23 2400 that's the difference 300 calories a day 200 calories a day that's the difference that's like a twinkie or uh like a pack of m m's that's that's not a lot slices of cheese or something yeah it's not a significant amount in my case it's mostly protein so it's a little bit more protein is that crazy how big of a difference that can make it is crazy um i saw you post that on ig and i was i was i had a great joke or something i remember i had a great joke and then i was like you know i'm not gonna make this joke this this would be getting wiser i said i'm not gonna make this joke because some people get real sensitive about their body and they don't they don't want jokes uh like even a funny joke won't come across well so i said let me just let me just hit the like button and move on carry on here but i do have a question just say it just say it come on i don't even remember right now it was something about like you know what you know when a person's like super fit then you have to like pull them down when someone's like fat you have to like bring them up so i was i was gonna make funny in some way but you know i don't remember what it was at this point um i have a question for you the thing that stood out was you were basically saying this is a 200 calorie difference and i was like that's kind of stunning it's stunning and by the way that's not precise so i i i uh typically weigh stuff i've been traveling for the last six weeks so i don't weigh stuff but i track everything so a lot of it's eyeballing so i could be give or take what are you tracking everything in my fitness pal so i use my body tutor and i meet with them weekly and we go over like the plan and they give me like the plan to use and then i have a trainer called central athlete and they tell me what workouts to do and so i just track everything and they review it all right and so you um what's a typical day of eating for you right now so right now i prefer getting a lot of protein early in the day so i'll do um roughly 100 grams of protein first are you fasting are you just doing the like 30 you know 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes like which because i've heard both schools of thought intermittent fasting people like i don't fast and then tim ferris in the four-hour body was like no no protein right away right when you wake up i don't fast because it uh i'm hungry in the morning so i don't fast so i get up uh around 9 30 i'll have a cup of yogurt so that's like 15 grams of protein i think uh and then i'll maybe eat like a banana and then i'll go and get a really hard workout in and then afterwards i'll do i use a scent or momentous protein and i do four scoops with just water and i drink that and then i won't eat till dinner and then of course a lot right it's supposed to be like one per thing is that's like the one or serving one or two and so each scoop's like 20 grams 25 25 yeah so you just get 100 grams right there in that can the body even absorb that much protein powder at once that's what i always wonder so i don't know i i think that the preferred method is to get that protein from food and chicken but i just like doing it so i just like drinking it one and i feel really full and then at dinner time i eat chicken and vegetables and usually like a dessert oh wait so there's no lunch that's my lunch is like the the protein i i just feel good so you eat a banana a thing of yogurt you drink a shitload of protein powder and then you later for dinner like we're talking like 6 p.m now something like that right yeah yeah i'll eat like a 1300 calorie meal you have a huge dinner of chicken and veggies and chicken or fish and veggies and the veggies will be something green and also like a potato and then i'll usually do like a like a piece of candy or ice cream or something like a very small serving of that like uh last night i had chocolate covered almonds like 250 calories worth and that adds up to roughly 20 23 23 23 23 to 24 yeah that's crazy i mean that crazy like that's so different is what i should say because obviously it works so maybe i'm crazy for not doing that um but here's the thing like so little food it's not that much food sometimes if i have a really hard workout i'll do a banana and a bagel but i'll just do a plain bagel like 350 calories of carbs right before i go work out um i'm not like i don't know if this is the right thing to do i think i think probably the right thing to do is to get like proper food but i just don't i'm looking at this photo it looks like the right thing to do to me right like what else what are we measuring here i i yeah i don't know instagram likes that's how you measure your health and that is working right now so here's the thing though that i've learned and this has like changed my confidence in life and in business and everything learning how to manipulate your body because like that's what everyone wants to do is either get skinnier or gain weight like everyone like wants to do something with their body once you learn yeah how many people are happy just like yeah yeah like everyone wants to improve their body in some way what i want yes but the thing is is like what i've learned so i've been going hard at this i think like it was two years ago i texted you and i go i go i'm going to become an instagram fitness influencer it was a joke but not entirely a joke but i was like i want to figure this out and so i just went and learned how it worked and once i figured out that it's like a mathematical equation life became so much better and i just it was just like you do this you do this you do this and you do it for three six twelve months or whatever you likely are going to see results and then what it did was it gave me so much confidence that it's i realized wow this is just like business business is actually the same thing you do this you do this you do this and the likelihood of getting some type of result is high hopefully you'll get your desired result but you're going to be better than when you started uh but then it's like that became the truth for me it was as if i had bad eyesight and i put on glasses like that became the truth with so many other things you do this you do this you do this and you trust the process you hire a coach or you develop your own plan you follow the plan and you have to do it for three six twelve months whatever and it's really fun to start seeing results and then once particularly with the body i think emotions would be next but with the body it's like oh wow i can manipulate that and then also with money we do it with money i can manipulate money by doing x y and z then it becomes like i can do anything and so right like once i've conquered the body part it feels awesome it feels so good um that's exactly that's so on point um and by the way the opposite is true when you want something and you don't figure out how to bend reality to make it happen a little seed of doubt gets planted in the brain that's now there that says you're like man i i could do anything i put my mind to and there's a part of your head that says really or is it like that diet or is it like sleeping early or is it like you know making money whatever the thing that you wanted to do that you didn't you didn't actualize you didn't manifest into reality by by doing it i'll tell you a little story this is very much relates to a conversation i had yesterday with my trainer so talking to my trainer and i said uh i wrote a number on the on the mirror i just went in there i wrote 53 he's like 53 what like what do we do 53 of something 53 push-ups what is this i got 53 days left he goes what do you mean i go oh i had this realization i'm eight weeks away from having the body i want that's 56 56 days where did you start and where did you you at your peak you were like 280. no no no i'm basically the same weight i was at the start you look way different muscle and fat a little bit but no no i was like 220 and i'm currently like 229 through 230. so it's like i actually went up and weighed a little bit but the composition changed a bit sorry you just looked horrible when you started now you look awesome so well that's a great compliment actually uh no you can see you can see your biceps you look you look significantly different from when we first started so so i told him i said i'm i'm am i i'm eight weeks away from everything i want he's like oh that's that's great i said uh so i'm just i'm keeping track right now i'll just i'll just keep changing this number every day that i eat exactly the way i want this number goes down and uh if i don't we go back to the beginning and uh we start i don't know if we go all the way back or if i'm just gonna like add three every time i'm uh if i slip but i haven't slipped yet so i haven't had to think about it all right so anyways we're talking and we have this philosophy so being a trader we have this philosophy where we um we both are very into mindset and what's cool is what happened what i had experienced previously in my life was i'm really into mindset things i'm basically like you know in san francisco there's that angry jesus guy who walks around with a megaphone yeah being like jesus lives he's alive he's alone like this guy just walks around so much like in the heart of like where all the startups are there's one guy that just walks around like that he's famous everybody knows him i was kind of that with mindset stuff i'd be like life is what you respond not how you react right like there is no meaning except the meaning you're giving it your mood is your choice like you know i was just like walking around like and nobody really cared and in fact most people were generally somewhat annoyed with my uh my ongoing uh conviction in like the mind the power of the mind and how important it is to master the mind your wife's like yeah i get it sean if you think you can i think you can't you're probably right i get it just eat your noodles yeah i think you can take out the trash like i told you to you know that's kind of where she lands and i'm like but isn't the trash already taken out when we really think about it yeah yeah that annoying guy and so and so then um i'm sorry i met my i meet my trainer he's like like he's got his megaphone i got my microphone and they touched we were both into the same things i'm like you that's like i read that book i'm like in the morning do you sit down and think about these things he's like i don't you're like more annoying than like two improv kids or two vegans take it out exactly we're two improv vegans i get out exactly right yes and yes and you're just constantly like trying to one up each other we're just like yeah we each other talk so so normally that's the thing and we and to hype ourselves up we're like dude it's so nice to talk to another black belt it's like yeah there's a lot of white belts want to run around here and you try to help them out but they don't even really want to learn the technique it's so nice just talk to another black belt listen you know what's nice about it i don't even have to say the thing actually i'll say two words three words about the subject enough said you actually already know you've read the thing you've actually practiced that we already agree there's no defensiveness and so we just implement and i'm like what's your workout that day just back patting yeah just like today we're working on our triceps yeah so so while we're having this conversation he's been he even told me this thing he's like he's like bro i like he's like i like big weights and thin books and i was like what he's like i like big weights and thin books and so we'll crack each other up about that he likes to lift weights and he's like i like thin books meaning i like to just understand the premise of the book and move on and i appreciate books that are thin i said and so we've always talked about simplicity how do you simplify a concept so that you understand it so that others can understand things this is something i always try to do and we've talked about like what's simpler than a book a thin book what's simpler than a thin book you know um a blog post what's simpler than a blog post a tweet what's simpler than a tweet a little catchphrase what's simpler than a catchphrase a gesture and so we had been playing with this idea of you're doing too much just do less we were like there uh this phrase that i've been saying on the pod and and off the bottom the the season i'm in right now is this a season of intensity is the strategy so uh for me that applies very easily with the with a body and diet thing it's like i don't need a new strategy i don't need a different workout program i don't need a new coach i don't need a new uh diet i don't need a new anything i don't need to go get a new app to track it all i simply need to do is execute the very simple plan with much higher intensity and so i just had this little thing where i just just this just if you're on youtube you see this i'm just turning the knob up the dial and just turn the dial and now what i'm working on sometimes he'll just he'll just go hold on he'll just turn up the dial that just i know what that means i know exactly what i need to do i need to multiply the intensity i'm bringing to the current situation i'm doing the same thing whether it's on food or whatever just this is all i need to do everything i want is on the other side of this little gesture all right cool it looks like you're rubbing a nipple your neighbors are just like why is this guy doing like a that's what he told me he's like he's like be careful with that one and i said oh i only hear there's two possible good interpretations of this and so um so the reason of coming full circle he'll tell me full circle to the thing you said which is what i told him i said look i wanted he's like you know you got to know your why i said i know my why my why is because i know that if i can do this now there is an unstoppable feeling that comes from knowing that you put your mind to something and you did it i said i don't really care i'm already married i got two kids i don't need to walk on a beach and like be attractive that's not a thing for me what i do care about is i can't have there be an area of my life that i wanted something in and not have that reality to my will like i can't not have done that right and so once i have done that it's just yet another yet another area of my life that i was able to to do that just dial up the intensity and get the result and that creates the unstoppable confidence um it furthers the confidence to the point of being unstoppable because this is the only area of my life i haven't yet done that and so um i highly recommend for anybody the area where you have struggled that's the that's the place to put the emphasis that's the place to try to overcome not even for the thing but because you want to be the type of person who could do that thing that's at least what's worked for me so far and why i have a lot more momentum than i had in the past because in the past i was like i really care if i have abs like i'm not sure that that matters to me no you definitely care but it feels good i read this stupid article on vice and it was like gyms are built for skinny people and i can't go to the gym because i'm fat and people stare at me and i thought and this is for anyone listening who's fat right now or out of shape go to the gym you want to know why when i have never been to a gym and seen a fat person and i and thought that person's gross i've only thought dude that's sick they're they're getting after it they're trying in fact i get inspiration when i see someone overweight because i'm like damn the first step's the hardest they're actually in a harder spot than i am so if you're listening to this fucking go get fit it feels so good to like achieve a goal and to make progress it feels awesome and so i've learned a lot over these past few years like getting my stuff together and it feels amazing i i've i've enjoyed this tremendously so i wanted to bring that up really quick and what's cool is like once you like basically if you're like out of shape and fat you only need to do like like for example if sean you were like i just want to get strong i'd be like well just do this this and this it's really simple uh like do five reps five sets of this this and this it's it's quite simple and then eat this much food and then once you get like down to that like 80th or 90th percentile of fitness then it's like all right we're gonna do really small adjustments and you're gonna see like bigger changes so it's really fun to like see like all right i just need to like get to this point and that's easy and i'm gonna send do a general plan that works for everyone and then as you get fitter it's like oh you're just gonna dial this a little bit dial this a little bit and that's really cool to like see those little small changes 300 calories a day what that what does that mean or eating a bagel instead of a banana for your before your workout does that change anything so like these little small things it's been really fun to like see how that works and i think maybe just because i get older and my body doesn't respond the same so it's like these things actually matter but if you're listening to this that's what you have to look forward to if you're out of shape if you're already in shape it's really fun to test those small dials i have one topic sean so yeah last week or this week maybe milk road your old company so sean started a company called milk road it was a email newsletter that was a daily news newsletter for crypto enthusiasts it was awesome still is awesome you guys you sold it and so it's not you or i don't actually know what your involvement is but you launched this thing called milk road pro i believe so the launch for it was cool it happened um i actually don't see the date but i'm looking at like the newsletter when you launched it last week and it's like 300 a year or 20 a month or sorry 10 no it was 10 a month 10 a month and 150 a year whatever and what you get is you get um market insights and deep dives from milk roads research team weekly recaps on everything happening the space uh quarterly funding breakdowns cool awesome first before i give my criticism i think it's sick that you guys tried this second do you know if it's working um i know a little bit so i wasn't involved in the launch of this or the um the details like what it is the price all that stuff so i wasn't really involved in that i knew they were going to do it um and i was like cool cool idea to try let's do it and um that's all i know about that part i don't know the results of it just so far so if i've been in this situation so i had the hustle i launched a 300 a year thing the biggest mistake i made or a big mistake i made was instead of charging 300 a year i should have made something that i could have charged 30 000 a year yeah you dropped a zero you oh you dropped a zero over here you want to come get that yeah i dropped i i dropped two of them two zeros and the difference between those two price points is it it's a ton but i actually don't think that the work is as big as a difference in price points or at least the f the at least the effort that goes into that and can i give you a few examples of what i would have done instead if i was the milk road the first thing i and by the way i'm in the backseat here i don't know anything they probably i'm sure maybe they thought about this and there's reasons why and there's probably some strategy so this is totally a guy who doesn't know anything about the strategy the first thing i would have done or these are all different ideas of what could have worked i would have researched the first thing tell me what you think about this not a crypto job board that's that stinks been there done that i would have done a crypto job uh crypto salary benchmarking meaning as any user that signs up i would have asked them where they work what their job title is and how much money they made and then i would have took like what the benchmarks is what the benchmark is for different salaries and i would have packaged that and try to see if i can sell that to hr departments at crypto companies which i don't know if they're actually hiring a lot right now so i'd have to do more research but i think i would have done something like that there's a few companies that have done this there's salary.com and there's pay scale i think pay scale does something like two or three hundred million dollars a year in subscription revenue when they sell into this uh what's your what's your gut instinct on that one and you're saying instead of milk road pro or you're saying this is a part of it what is the idea here instead of these are these are things i would have done instead of what what i think that's a cool idea um i think you know the crypto the number of crypto companies that are mature enough to care about salary things i think is a little early for that i feel like something like that's gonna work in a few years not not well now's a good time to start then man right yeah fair enough um and then so when i'm thinking about these new ideas i would think most of my ideas for what you guys should have launched are data related the reason i like data is a i actually think that's within the core competency of a company creating newsletters i think creating a software platform would have been a horrible idea because that's not within your core competency i also would have looked at what data can i get from my users and what are they clicking on in order to like track different data and if possible i would have tried to make something that my advertisers would also want to buy but that's actually quite hard and that that last one i don't think i could have done the second thing i would have looked at is sentiment analysis again totally i'm a total outsider here so but i wonder if big banks or big buyers of crypto stuff if they would care what does the little guy think like the retail investor and what i would have done is and i think there's a few i think there's it's called santimet it uh they do like four or five billion dollars a year in revenue and what they do is they look at behavior analytics of like different crypto markets and how it works i think there's augmento there's a few more that like look at this but i would have like seen because the thing with crypto is it seems like a lot of stuff happens in discord and if anything happens in discord a gray-haired guy is not going to be able to figure that out right yes true and so i'm wondering definitely true could could milk road have figured out what the little guy is talking about before it kind of pops and gets sentiment analysis packaged in a more professional way than discord what do you think about that i think that's a good idea i think there's um so we've been doing this thing called the fear and greed index from the beginning which i love which is basically a uh it's a meter that just shows what's the market's mood it isn't kind of like based on the uh like from the stock market this has been the case for a long time which is um you know the market is very moody it gets extremely fearful it gets extremely greedy and you kind of want to be buying when it's fearful and you want to be selling when it's greedy if you wanted to time it or at least does not buy when the market is feeling super greedy um uh but like it's good to know where where the sentiment stands because you could sort of price is very very linked to that and at the beginning we didn't have any first party data so we used an existing fear and greed index and we just skinned it and designed it to fit our brand but i'm pretty sure now we have probably the biggest ability of anybody to pull for that exactly um i was i admit coinbase or others could do it but they're not they're not doing it but in terms of media like we're one of the biggest i think we are the biggest newsletter for crypto so i think and we get a lot of feedback like if we say hey tell us x they'll like we'll get tons of responses uh for every email and so i think that we could have basically built our own fear and greed index or built that out like maybe per coin or per project for nft like what is the sentiment around this what are the whales saying so like just create a cohort of whales and their sentiment that take that data and package it up for any of the financial like institutional money that's in this space um so i do think that that that has a possibility and that is a 30 000 product not a not a ten dollar month product and then what i would have done is like looked at that analysis and the data and then also had my researchers and writers give context around this and to explain their sources and why they think it means what it means and i think because the research they do in this pro thing is actually good and the problem is when it's gonna be super low priced i think that it's really hard to go that extra mile on any one topic and because you know the the reader may not even be that sophisticated or have that much skin in the game and then the writer has to turn out lots of content for a wider base but if you know hey this is a narrow group of people that really care a lot about these specific things you could go be the best in the world at delivering that type of intel and you host conferences and a handful of other things around that and that is a thirty thousand dollar a year product i think now packaging all of that is challenging and pulling it off is challenging but i don't think it's like significantly more challenging than the work that they already have to do it's just packaged differently and the last two things that was the sales work is different so in this the sales work is easy you put a link in the newsletter today and you say hey you want to hear read this section go check out pro sales work is easy content work is is about the same um but the value obviously of the sale is what matters so the other case you have to basically go and meet with the head of research at some some firm some blockchain investing firm or some traditional uh you know hedge fund or whatever and you have to basically do an enterprise sale to get them on board correct the difference is and this is an advantage is that milk road is small and your burn is small so you only a couple deals two sales yeah could make a meaningful difference and you just start you start small and you start slow and i think that i could pull off you're not a vc funded company that has to grow and support you know a million dollar a month team the last two things something that has always interest to me is organizational charts which sounds boring but with crypto well this is combined with two ideas but with crypto you don't always know who's behind stuff because you uh like a lot of it's just like someone's face that's a nft or something like that and you're not exactly sure who's behind it uh what i would do is i would have done org charts that explains here's who's behind each thing here's the team here's their contact information and here's the story behind it as well as our prediction of like is this like interesting or not interesting should you trust it because if you're if a bank or or or a buyer or a funder of some of these companies wants to know like what's the real deal behind them it's really challenging to get a surface level or even a a more than surface level view on it without doing lots of your own research so if you have data that can actually pinpoint uh this is actually legitimate it's worth diving deeper into and here's some more analysis on that or this one just is nonsense run like something like that and your customer being either a someone who wants to sell into those companies or someone who wants to fund invest or purchase something from them it kind of gives you a little bit more quantitative and qualitative information on are they worth the time do you know what i mean yeah yeah i know what you mean um that one's i i like that i like that one less than the other one so i think these are all good ideas i like the theme of these data driven uh like basically once you acquire this corpus of data it just simply becomes more valuable over time it has to be updated and refreshed but it's not like new it's not new content in the same way it's building a stack of content this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated whoa i can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better i was talking to or i was reading this post about zoom info do you know what zoom info is yeah it's basically just like here's everyone's email address is that the like dummy version of it yeah they're publicly traded though they do like a billion dollars in revenue i don't know what their market cap is they're big but it's what do they provide beyond that it's basically like it's for sales people right like hey salesperson here's how you do your prospecting i think the high level view is basically we have mapped out every employee at every company in america and we know like what they do we know their contact information and we know a little bit of background about the company um right and the way that they started it was the two founders they said we spent 75 of our time just calling the front desk of all these companies to confirm that their phone number was correct and that was how it started then we went and got a bunch of different data sources and we combined them to make it a little bit more readable so you could have more data on different companies and then finally they created a i don't know what you call it like a viral loop whatever it's called where people could access some of the data but they had to submit their own data and so in order to get a discounted price and that kind of created this loop where now they have so much information on different companies how they work if you google like a company and then revenue you might find zoom info that will show up but it will say like their contact information where their offices and things like that and so they started just by the two guys just phone calling and so these company data businesses can be cool because you can brute force your way to get like a nice little mvp so anyway that's my my spiel on milk road i i i think that i don't know the background of what the owners are doing so i could be totally off that's what i would have done instead though so here's a um tool that's pretty cool that's uh related have you ever heard of particle.com no i'm gonna go to it now though so particle just without the e so it's p-a-r-t-i-c-l dot com unlock the power of driven product development uh yeah what it should say is see how much any e-commerce store does in sales because that's what it does right that's like the layman's term like again zoom info is like hey you want to sell shit uh we'll tell you who to reach out to and here's their email address right like they have to sort of mask it can make it sound a little fancier that it is but it's very functional very useful and similarly particles pretty cool so what they did is um for pretty much uh all the major e-commerce stores um they what they did is they they have a way to go to any like kind of shopify store and estimate with fairly high confidence it's not perfect but it's directionally correct um what that store does in sales within that what each what which skew they uh they sell like uh you know what's the top selling sell top selling products bottom selling products that sort of thing and so you could do really great competitive research and market research to try to figure out where are their gaps in the market oh okay this company's doing really well but there's not a lot of competitors that also sell that product there may be an opportunity to go in there or hey um you know we're doing really well with these three products but our competitor they have this other product line that we don't have that's doing really well and so it's a cool thing that they built um using basically like seems like crawlers and scrapers to go on to an e-commerce store and sort of estimate the um the volume of uh of sales for product it's not perfect it's like you know because i i looked at it for like our brand and a couple other brands of people i know and so you know the sale the exact sales number like if it says 50 million they might do actually 70 million or 60 million right it's just directionally it's directional it's like it's not 500 that they do probably um but and it's not five it's more like 50 it's more like 50.

and uh but the product level stuff seems to be more accurate um where you know again relatively like product a is more popular than product b by by double right now okay interesting what what is that what can we learn from that how do we and they sell this thing for like i don't know 20 grand a year um to your point because if i'm a retailer and i can be smarter about my inventory purchases um i'll make back the 20 grand and you know one or two purchases just by just by by having this in intel if i didn't have it earlier so it kind of makes sense how these companies are able to charge so much is this company big particle yeah i think they're pretty big um i don't know too much you know you can't search them on the platform unfortunately but uh it seems like they're seems like they're doing pretty well who's the owner of milk road now what are their names again mike uh kendall and mike kendall and mike bravo launching a subscription clip they don't listen to podcasts they don't listen to any podcasts um and so uh like in fact when we first met him i was like yeah second's podcast blah blah and then uh he's like wasn't really that interested in the podcast and i was like do you listen to our pod any pod you listen to podcasts he's like no why would i i didn't really understand why would i do that like um and he was just like i just feel like i should just work instead of listen to other people talk about work okay oh well touche absolutely right that is what a successful person would say if you guys are listening that's what i would have done this is what i learned from launching my product on i mean we were trends was successful but i realized we could have had two zeros at the end of our revenue probably if we would have done things differently yeah good feedback i like it um what else you got um okay well that was amazing let's just first start with that great idea next um you know with a guy with great ideas you're getting those uh backpacking uh reps are nice yeah yeah can't stop won't stop never quit no days off i mean i'm gonna let it slide that you said backpacking that's what i'm gonna do because i'm a nice guy so with ideas like this i think i should be in the tech all-star game what's the tech all-star game you asked it's something i wish existed so i tweeted this out and um i think that i laid out my case for why the tech industry needs its version of the nba all-star game so tech is getting pretty big in fact somebody pointed to somebody who's not in the tech industry pointed this out to me they go yes weird i feel like tech is the new everyone in hollywood's like talking about he's like you know like the facebook movie was dope he's like and then they came out with silica valley hbo and they have like you know they have the we the we work movie they got the theranos movie they got the uber story they got the like it's making its way more into pop culture and what happens when something gets into movies is those heroes become heroes so the the protagonist in these in these things becomes like a new archetype that people want to follow and so he was pointing this out he's like i think tech has just crossed over into this thing where the cool tech people are now popular everywhere you see this with elon musk mark zuckerberg they're like how their household names now jeff bezos whereas you know i couldn't have told you who the ceo of ibm was growing up like i had no idea but it's that that's changed now it's okay you still can't name the ceo of ibm couldn't tell you what ibm like i used to not be able to name who the ceo of ibm was i still i still can't but i at least want to know i definitely used to not be able to so i think somebody should create this i think somebody should create um a weekend event that's produced like a like the nba all-star weekend and get the best talent in the tech industry to compete so here's how i think you're gonna have like a uh like a like the layup contest or like the base the base hit derby no no no it's gonna be a hackathon real simple so it's a hackathon that's the main that's the main attraction that's the that's the game is a hackathon and what we'll do is each so you get you only get invited if you're like a legit awesome tech company so you go from like the top like okay facebook you get to send a team or maybe a couple teams and but so does i don't know figma you guys have made it congratulations you get to participate in the thing and so the ceo of each company gets to recruit one engineer one designer and one marketer for their squad they get to come and they're going to compete in the weekend hackathon they got to build something awesome and they have to pitch it at the end and you get to kind of see these people actually like watch them cook a little bit like let me see you actually do work like are you creative are you interesting can you build something cool um can you sell can you pitch i want to see see that in action i think it would be a phenomenal recruiting event for companies i think it would be just a great like kind of brand builder i think it'd be fun for these people because i don't know most tech ceos jobs are actually like just dealing with problems and not even the fun types it's not even like product problems it's like people problems and lawsuit problems and and like that so i think it'd be a nice diversion for people who got into this because they like to build and that this is how they actually started their company and i think that you the way that elon and zucker sort of competing now i think it's going to open the door to more direct competition friendly competition amongst tech people and then i think you do the fun gimmick games right you have the whatever the the speed typing contest or you have who can do x while they're drunk whatever you come up with like some random ass games for other people to try as well you broadcast the whole thing and i think that like you could kind of if you had the right kind of like if i'm i was trying to think who has the incentive to do this so none of the companies have the incentive to do this only somebody just such like stupid like me has the incentive to do this where i'm like yeah this is what i'm going to spend my time on for the year and like i don't need money so i can just like do this and like i think the whole thing you it would be profitable because you could get sponsors for the whole thing and um i think either me or somebody like um eric tornberg i thought would be great at this because he's got a lot of great connections and he he comes from the sports world so he like appreciates that part of it and sees that it's missing here i also think that vc funds like sort of like andreason horowitz or whoever could use this as an excuse to create like a festival or a fair that's different than a traditional boring conference so nobody's going to do this but i think this would be a fun idea i wish this existed what's your reaction do you remember the silicon valley sports league no what is that it was awesome it was like a wreck sports league and um we did soccer one season another season it was flag football and it was awesome it was basically different companies would pay 10 grand per season and you could have 10 players play and it was like a really fun way to like hang out and uh you know get to know your team and like play sports and it would at the time i was at apartment list so it was like apartment list versus i forget whatever company was like nearby and you like it was awesome it was really yeah it was really fun and the guys who started it used the profits to bootstrap their company and it was sick and they said they made millions of dollars from it you've not heard of that no but i'm on their website right now i don't know if you've been there in a while no look at this banner image this might be the worst banner image i've ever seen it's two evil looking tech guys pretending to play football against each other the guys holding the football not like how you would hold a football when you run first of all tiny hands and can't hold a football and the other guy looks like an absolute hyena that's actually coming to take your data and sell it and not like play sports at all this is the artist who did this hates the tech industry they like lost their their two-bedroom loft in san francisco because they raised the rent so that like some tech bro could live there and now he's on the street doing art like this you just have to make it boxing though you got to get you got to get to the you got to get to the boxing i mean the youtubers are doing it now but people aren't going to do the boxing thing like even like best case scenario is this elon zuckerberg thing it's also not even going to happen it's not going to happen they have too much to lose and it's too hard to be good at boxing you've seen this with the youtuber thing jake paul actually like dropped out of life and has been like trains boxing for years to look okay and like imagine a tech interesting tech person is like in their 40s or 50s typically or they're like the scraughtiest 25 year old that like like spent their whole life building the thing and not working out like i just don't think it's going to look okay i think it's going to look really bad and sad when you watch it why don't you just do this what's holding you back i mean it seems fun yeah it seems fun but i think it's a you know it's a fun idea that if i knew that i could get the right people involved maybe but you need the ape you need the a players to do this i'm not interested in apartment list head of growth versus uh you know feet finders you know customer success guy like you know we're not doing that it needs to be zuck and his team elon and his team and then like you know like it needs to be like top people doing this like the airbnb founder like that's who people would want to tune in because you don't get to meet these people you definitely don't get to see them work you only see them giving rehearsed interviews about how they started something 10 years ago or like why they're not ruining the world right now like that's the only thing that's the only context we see these people in you don't really get to see them in a context that makes them likable favorable and like you know admirable are you on a roll right now should we just let you rattle these off i have three like alliterations there pretty much so well i thought that's pretty good feet finder was a gem too i'll just like that was on my list as an idea but i haven't researched it somebody just told me feet finder crushes it and i go what is feet finder and they go i think it's only finder for feet and i said bookmark that we'll look more at that later is that really a thing feed finder oh my god you're right it is yeah the safest place the safest largest easiest website to view buy and sell feed content great yeah oh my god dude this is wild page you're right they do kill oh wow yeah that's some home page they get four million uh yeah we'll save this for another time oh my god that is a home page uh don't go to feed if you're with your family uh all right let me give you another quick one so related to uh my only fans and now feed finder uh curiosity okay so ben sent me a uh uh link to something called onlypage.com and page as in like the girl's name page and i thought this is kind of interesting so i go to it and it's basically only fans so there's some model name page and she's like hey subscribe to me and you get my content you get all the same things as only fans but she's hosting it on her website it's that golfer the what i don't know what what's her full name i don't know is she a famous athlete i had no idea i think she started as like a mediocre athlete a mediocre golfie but she's a golfer but she's really good looking and so now she's in the news and stuff all the time for just being like this hot athlete her name is page s i forget her last name but something like that i mean the variety of content here you scroll down it's golf instruction and it says warming up and she's just bending over on a putting green it says the mental game and she's talking about that and then there's just bra tutorial i don't know how many guys are subscribing to watch a bra tutorial for that you know that the bra techniques but you know this is uh she knows what she's doing let me just put it this way i sent you her wikipedia it's page sparenak uh so i guess she was a former professional golf player she was a division one golfer and then she just got famous for being pretty good at golf and then people were like you're very attractive and she was like i guess i should i should lean into that one she's talking to her mentor she's like i'm i'm pretty good at golf but i'm amazing at boobs like where do you think i should go with this and they're like you know what you should you should focus on your strengths and and so anyways what i thought was interesting about this is this is basically a direct consumer version of only fans it's what shopify did so like you before shopify it's like you could list your your products on somebody else's marketplace amazon walmart whatever um so that's like one alternative you could be an amazon seller you put your product on amazon amazon is the storefront people go to amazon they find your product that's how only fans works people go to go to your only fans it's hosted on only fans only fans is the tech platform where you make your purchases through this is interesting somebody must have created for there must be some company behind this um or she built this herself which is a shot like a shopify version of only fans she has her own branded domain her own store and she's handling her own customer relationship with customers so when they like for example when you sign up to somebody's only fans you don't get their email address um if they turned you could never market back to them that way but with this theoretically she could and so i thought this kind of interesting i wonder like shopify turned out to be a very big deal in the like kind of like commerce landscape clearly only fans the niche is doing you know billions of dollars a year as a product like i don't know i don't know what you would call a category um can somebody create the shopify for that that's kind of interesting to me um so i don't know i don't know the company i've seen this the company behind uh her page it's called you screen so you screen dot tv the letter u and then screen dot tv and it's the all-in-one membership platform for creators delight your die-hard fans with exclusive exclusive video content and a vibrant community across your own mobile app and website and on their home page they list like some youtuber with two million subscribers they left they list a yoga company kids art is that what it is there's kids are there's yoga there's like some german guy there's like a pregnancy blog and now page is using it yeah she's like their big she's definitely best selling yeah so she's so it's a company that's doing it and it looks like she just found like a course creator company and was like or a membership platform yeah yeah yeah she's like yeah we're gonna do that we're gonna go ahead and just only pay three hundred dollars a month uh this is interesting their thing says 150 million earned by creators each year that's pretty interesting that's uh that's not like a small number they said they have nine million end users so like members on the other side of the the content yeah and so i never heard of this have you ever heard of this no i've never heard of it and it looks like they're killing it because they just made maybe some policy changes that would not allow like kajabi or something to like uh appeal to that type of creator but it's smart so if you click their leadership team they have a big team it's a it must be a big company they have got a huge team it looks like they have uh 50 to 150 employees so it must be working and if you look them up you can't find any funding information about them the company might be killing it and we just did i want to make a chrome extension that's just called the honesty filter and it just changes the website homepage to like say what it actually does like uh you know like it should just say monetize your body yeah with less fees than only fans yeah and like you know the the zoom info get people's email address and spam them like these are like what these companies actually do but if you go like if i go to zoom info what does it say so the guy who started it his name's pj it looks like he on his linkedin he says they're north of 20 million in an arr they're bootstrapped and it's based out of washington dc this is a legit company and before that he had a web hosting site uh anyway this guy this thing is bootstrapped is that what you said yeah that's what his linkedin says yeah they're probably doing they probably take like i want to say five to ten percent of this so maybe something like 10 to 15 million a year in uh in revenue for them yeah and he says that he's killing it it says in his linkedin it's over 20 million in arr it says fast growing and profitable bootstrap sas business revolutionizing the way that video-based entrepreneurs make men get off that's what it says so yeah pj oh you got to turn the chrome extension off oh yeah we got you there so kudos to pj my chrome extension's called true dat and you can find it in the chrome store that's a side hustle uh good job pj at unscreen i don't see page on their home screen i don't know why i wouldn't see that she's has four million followers on instagram you got a guy on here with in the front page with 1.8 on on youtube we got to put page on there but that's what she's using so her name's page sarah nick or something like well maybe with your new uh body i don't know maybe you screen i screen we all scream for sam screen you know what i'm saying yeah and uh page what's up uh that's a joke my wife who's listening that's a joke uh but i do see that page is recently divorced according to her wikipedia uh no i'm just joking she's like a nine i'm a four that won't ever work out unless we can figure out a way um yeah on screen or you screen whatever it is good job kudos to you guys they're taking the business of people who don't want to uh deal with these people i don't know why more people don't do this i guess you have to have a really big uh i mean you need a big audience pages four million uh instagram followers but does only fans even drive audience do they drive a significant amount no they don't they intentionally don't drive discovery so it's kind of like shopify anyways you promote yourself they're your storefront but the thing is it'd be like if every shopify store was on it was called shopify.com store name and if you couldn't collect your you know the the emails or phone numbers of your customers so you couldn't like you know sell more products to them or whatever it's all done through their through their platform yeah and you screen advertises that they have like a community platform i don't think i want to be part of that community but just the paywall part might be worth it so if you're a creator i'd be like yeah i'll accept their money but i don't want to like you know i don't want to like talk to them on a regular basis that'd be weird um yeah that's a good find what are we going to hear i think that's it i think we wrap it up all right well that's the episode by the way uh really quick um that's the pod that's the episode i know i i wanted to tell you something really quick um i just got a text while we were recording from jason yanowitz at blockworks he goes today i got asked to leave the bank because i was laughing so hard at the at sean's taco bell story they were like sir could you please leave your call outside because i had headphones in and was laughing so loud so so loud uh i said yeah yeah no you need to listen to this podcast and they were like sir what are you talking about the the taco bell story it was just taken off his airpods and played it out loud for the entire bank to hear it's like oh you got to hear the story that sean tells about making eye contact with the guy who's farting at a taco bell uh and can i please deposit 500 uh no apparently that was a hit a lot of people like that taco bell story congratulations you should uh do more uncomfortable things i um i went and replied to a bunch of the comments on youtube um if it comes from the the channel name that's me um so so i replied to a bunch of them because i had said like we were we read and reply to every comment yeah i know people got mad at you we read all the comments now there's a lot like it there's 700 comments per episode which i is a lot to reply to i did it for one and i was like okay i can't go do that for the next one so i think it's going to be kind of like i reply to i read all of them and reply to i don't know 100 each time uh because it's now getting i read all of them i read all of them and a lot of them they got mad at us for uh being they called us all a bunch of cucks for liking zuck they said you're zucks cucks yeah cuck army what's up we have tattoos on the inside of our wrist dude isn't it crazy that whenever whatever whatever zucks working out that zuck is now on the liberal side of this stuff somehow we're like you know left of center because we like zuckerberg that's so funny that he's fallen like on that side of this argument uh yeah but yeah they got i don't get it they got mad at us but anyway that's the pod we'll read all the comments that's the pod you
