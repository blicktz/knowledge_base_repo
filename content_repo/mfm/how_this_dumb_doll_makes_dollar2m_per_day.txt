stock has grown in the last year from a seven billion dollar company to now a 44 billion dollar company 44 billion okay you know what i mean that's that's what elon bought x for it's people this guy selling laboos it's insane it's crazy all right dude sam do you know what one of these are oh my gosh ramon will not quit talking to me about these things okay so those all right so for the listener sean's showing what am i holding up they look like uh dolls basically in the same vein as a troll but i have gotten texts from my friend our friend ramon who says have you heard of this thing it's worth and he says the number and i'm like oh yeah it must have been a typo so what's the deal with these things do you know what they're called i don't super something no this this is a labooboo all right get yourself educated this is a little boo boo doll okay does it have a prada sign on it yeah that's part of the part of the shtick here okay so what's the what's the story with these things this is basically the most viral toy in the world it's one of the biggest crazes since you know eb babies and things like that and so the story behind this thing is pretty crazy i just wanted to tell you some of the things that i know about it of course my wife put me onto this months ago and i just ignored it as the uh the stock of this company is up like 7x in a year because this thing is going crazy chinese company right chinese company yeah so this is made by this these dolls are produced by a chinese company called pop mark and the maker for this guy wang ning he is now the 10th richest man in china and like he's adding like a billion dollars to his net worth in the last you know but he's like 30 right or or like he's he's he's really young like dude look at this picture of him yeah but chinese guys always look really young until they don't until they don't yeah haven't you ever heard like all of my asian friends they're like we always look young and then we fall off a cliff all right can you see this guy yeah yeah i mean he could be 12 or 50 i don't know yeah so this guy is behind this company pop mart uh but it's kind of fascinating what's going on with this craze right like it's it's really taken over so somebody gave these to my kids as like a gift and i didn't really understand the significance of it i was like oh cool thanks i didn't realize that we were just gifted like a really important thing this is like one of the more valuable items in my house right now like these things sell for thousands of dollars the top ones can sell for six figures that's how crazy the uh the craziest for this okay so tell me the story because this is this sounds like a good good stock to short because that's typically how these like collectibles kind of will get to that yes i i agree with you we'll get to that all right so the story of the labubu dolls is there's a guy who's an artist around 2015 he's he's in the netherlands he gets inspired for to create like a kind of like a a toy world so like a a character world uh based on where he's at in the netherlands and he designs these dolls these kind of like like look at their teeth like the little like gremlin looking doll and there's hope for us okay because the experts are describing this um as ugly cute and it's succeeded because it's ugly cute and i just thought like our podcast i just feel like that just gave us like some wind in our sails for what we could do as well on youtube it's worse for us because we're not particularly ugly but we're not particularly good looking is there like a cute what the kids call mid yeah all right so he creates these in 2015 not a lot happens from there but in 2019 so four years later he partners with this company pop mart and pop mart was started about a decade ago because this guy wang ning had this insight which is he thought that this kidult trend we talked about this before because you're into legos so he's like this kidult trend this like kids toys for adults like it's gonna be a thing yeah and so he creates this store and the store uh really takes advantage of this like style this business mechanic called blind boxes which i don't know if you've seen uh lol dolls or mini brands where you buy the box but you don't know what's inside similar to like pokemon card packs you buy the pack you don't know what cards are inside and so this mechanic which i think they call it like the gotcha mechanic creates a lot more spending right people will keep buying because it's a little bit like a treasure hunt and you want to see what you can find what you can get will you get this used to be a scam like i remember logan paul or jake paul was sponsored or did business with a company called mystery box and that was like a rage like a very trendy thing for like three months do you remember that like 10 years ago like these loot boxes are in games and people know that okay this is kind of not it's not a scam per se but it's basically manipulative right it gets people to buy a lot more people get addicted to this thing and especially when you're targeting kids which is why logan paul and those guys got in trouble was hey this is targeting kids the beauty of this is it's not targeting kids so the way these blew up is through celebrities wait can i ask a question about the company pop mark so he had a pop mart he had just a it was a toy company for a long time or what was the the origin so the story is 2010 he opens up a small designer store in beijing and he's trying to build it off this kiddo collectibles brand he starts selling blind boxes this labubu is not in play at this point there's other blind boxes that he's trying to sell and in 10 years they grow from one store to you know 300 plus stores 2 000 vending machines where you could just like it's just you know you just buy one of these boxes right right out of a machine it ends up going public in 2020 stock doubles on the first day the stock has grown in the last year from a seven billion dollar company to now a 44 billion dollar company 44 billion that's what elon bought x for so that's so insane uh so the before it became when it was just a four or seven i think you said billion dollar company they just sold like dolls that people liked and it's so which which a seven billion dollar toy company is is that's already a mega success so they sold other people's stuff that was over four years but yeah yeah they're they're they're selling collectibles of different brands different ip and this is one of the ip uh that they have and this doll alone like these these labubus uh did like 700 million last year so they're like now like almost it's it's getting close to about half of the revenue of the company overall because the trend has exploded and then they connect with this with this artist and so that brings us to where we are now yeah so the question is how did this explode where does a the thing that fascinated me is like where does a trend like this even come from how does this happen because it's totally irrational right like why this doll why not another doll who is it the teeth is it the outfit is it what what is it behind it so there's some i guess learnings to have from this about like the psychology of a winning product so i just want to tell you a little story about how this happens so check this out uh exhibit a 2023 okay so this is a photo that you clearly can tell it's just rihanna like getting coffee or leaving a hotel she's going to an airport and she just looks like she's it's not sponsored she's just being a lady and she has one of the toy bebops or boo-boos or whatever they're called hanging off of her book bag book bag is that what it is it's a purse it's a little bit of a purse okay it looks like i'm looking from far away it looks like a book bag okay so she's spotted with it hmm interesting at the same time another trend is happening in thailand in thailand people are starting to see these lububus for whatever reason as possible good luck charms and in thailand people are quite religious and they started to view these as like almost like a spiritual like a little guardian that they could have with them and so that's that rumor starts to spread and then what happens is uh do you know the bl the band blackpink do you ever heard of this band no it's like a korean pop band faces like one of the most popular pop bands in the world in the world so it's a girl band like spice girls oh i know it yeah i like i like those guys i see their music videos they're very eye-catching yeah i know what you're talking about uh well it's just like uh it's a sensation you'll go on youtube and you're like what is this thing with a billion views on youtube it's sort of like the sensation of like the bts thing yeah yeah exactly okay so uh okay so this is right here this is now we're talking about blackpink so lisa from blackpink goes to thailand to visit her friend her friend says hey what do you want to do today they decide let's go shopping she thinks okay we're gonna go shopping clothes bags what are we gonna go buy but no she wants to go to pop mart and she says what i don't know what pop mart is but they go to a pop mart store at the pop mart store the friend really wants a labubu and lisa says honestly not into it don't i don't get it don't don't care about it blah blah but the friend gets super disappointed because they're all sold out and the lady at the store is like listen it's impossible you're not gonna get one and that little mimetic monster inside lisa starts to roar the one in her stomach and she's like you know what if i can't have it i must have it and she decides actually i think i do like labubus and i think i do want to go get labubus and she starts to collect these now she starts getting obsessed with pop mart she goes she buys my boxes and she starts collecting these this becomes her de-stress type of thing she does from the the stressful life of being a world famous pop star yeah now she gets caught having a labubu why because she posts it on her instagram so now we're fast forward 2024 this is the photo that created the craze it went from just like you know how a hurricane starts and there's like some some sweeping winds maybe a casual storm a casual rainstorm and then then comes the hurricane and this this instagram story started the hurricane and it's her hugging her labubu can i say something i kind of get it that looks pretty cool it looks pretty good for youtube this photo yeah it's uh it's like an old white guy in overalls it's kind of what it looks like it looks like a farmer yeah this does look like a midwest farmer actually this i kind of like i i and it's big it's about two feet tall i kind of think that's neat i understand this is a big one yeah so they come in different sizes the the one that sold for over 100 000 that was like a human-sized one okay okay so this is the stock since that photo was taken and you can see the stock is up 7x since then oh my god crushing and so the labubu craze starts and what you know what's interesting about this is why okay so celebrities started posting about it that's it okay i get that but what else so here's some of the other things that i found kind of interesting from a i don't know behavioral psychology point of view the first is the lipstick effect have you ever heard of the lipstick effect i don't think so so there's an economic theory that basically says that whenever people are under financial pressure so uh maybe the economy is a little bit choppy maybe there's um uh you know you know there's inflation there's what there's wage pressure whatever it is people will opt people think that you'll stop spending but what actually happens is you shift the spending and so instead of buying a new bag you'll just buy some lipstick they'll buy a new lipstick and so lipstick sales sales will explode at the time during economic pressure because you take away from bigger luxury purchases and they go into smaller luxury purchases so instead of a 200 outfit or a bag you're going to buy a 20 item instead and so people think that this is part of what's behind labubu which is that this thing uh you know initially started where these are like you know a 20 25 box that you buy and you get a labubu but the thing with these the smart thing of these is i showed you the doll this is the most important part this little ring because most stuffed animals you just keep them at home so there's no virality to it right you just have it at the comfort of your own home nobody sees it uh you don't get to show it off it's not a status symbol by just having the bag clip attached to these things they suddenly became like luxury accessories and so that's why rihanna had it attached to her bag and this blackpink lady had hit hers and then david beckham is posting that and kim kardashian posts that she has 10 of them and she starts clipping them to her bags and it becomes this add-on to your luxury bag this cute little add-on that you could put on your bag and then each one of these has an outfit so i can take this off and i can buy new clothes for this and i can upgrade my labubu so now you have all can you spell labubu l-a-b-u-b-u oh okay i see by the way labubu is actually only one of the characters but that's just what it became called the the character structure called the monsters but uh nobody that didn't stick oh my gosh i'm on their website i i think it's kind of cool yeah i mean and so and so what what i think is interesting here is that you have this kind of what charlie monger calls the lalapalooza effect so maybe you have the lipstick effect causing people to look for little luxuries then you have the kidult effect where you have adults looking for uh you know maybe comfort and pleasure uh because when there that's another economic theory here which is that when adults face stress uh from work and global events like wars and whatnot they find emotional relief and con collecting toys and things that connect with their childhood so you have that effect of kicking you have the lipstick effect kicking in you have the status symbol effect of this where you can attach this to your bag you have the ugly cute effect which we are just we're just crushing with right now and so all these come together to create the phenomenon that is labubu great great great job uh good find i uh i've been hearing about this but i didn't exactly dive deep so that's cool that you did this this is not sustainable and this is definitely going to go away in the next five years but let's get it while the getting's good all right so i've built a few companies that have made a few million dollars a year and i've built two companies that have made tens of millions of dollars a year and so i have a little bit of experience launching building creating new things and i actually don't come up with a lot of original ideas instead what i'm really really good at what my skill set is is researching different ideas different gaps in the market in reverse engineering companies and i didn't invent this by the way we had this guy brad jacobs we talked about on the podcast he started like four or five different publicly traded companies with tens of billions of dollars each he actually is the one who i learned how to do this from and so with the team at hubspot we put together all of my research tactics frameworks techniques on spotting different opportunities in the market reverse engineering companies and figuring out exactly where opportunities are versus just coming up with a random silly idea and throwing it against the wall and hoping that it sticks and so if you want to see my framework you can check it out the link is below in the youtube description so i started thinking how do i make money on this all right so the first way i should have made money on this was when my wife started telling me about this which was i don't know six to eight months ago i should have either brought the stock i should have looked i didn't even think it was going to be a stock i just thought it was like a stuffed animal i didn't think it was a public company should have bought the stock or you know you could have could have tried to collect and flip okay that's too much effort so what's the play here so i went and looked up i asked ai i said tell me the last five crazy toy crazes as crazy as labubu over the last 50 years and compare them what were some of the other ones so it would have been cabbage cabbage patch was the first one that it came up baby beanie babies beanie babies was the second i think trolls were popular for a minute but i don't know if they were a craze then it gave me pokemon pokemon cards which had two two bumps there was the one when we were kids where buying and collecting packs reached about about the same revenue about two billion dollars a year and then it died down for about 20 years and then recently with like kind of logan paul started collecting them again yeah they had another peak and it had 1.6 billion in its sales um on the cards uh recently so pokemon and then the last one i gave me which was i thought kind of interesting as ai but actually is a good point because i was thinking maybe furbies or tamagotchis i didn't know what it was going to give me um those were smaller it gave me stanley cups which actually makes total sense because it's the same thing it's the exact same thing and so it gave me those and the funny thing about these is on a scale on the scale labubu is actually still small so this doll did about 700 million uh those all at their peak were kind of like 1.6 to 2 billion dollars in sales so i actually expect that over the next year this thing goes even the star kind of goes viral nova it burns out and it hits a 2 billion or 3 billion in revenue um and then it's going to crash because the funny thing with all of these is they all had about a two to three year peak tops and so i think the actual play if you want to make money on this thing is to short pop mart stock starting around uh you know end of 2026 and you know maybe maybe through 2027. uh now shorting is dangerous because you can lose your shirt uh because shorting has sort of asymmetric downside uh but if you i think if you were a betting man the odds are that you know by 2027 this thing is not a 44 billion dollar company anymore what was the name okay so you had a friend uh michael michael smith michael acton smith he had a the guy who created calm.com before he created calm.com the the meditation app he actually had a toy a stuffed animal toy company called like minnow monsters or something yeah that's right um what was the name of this and so his company was called mind candy and it was moshi monsters was the most mini mini monsters was a mobile game and if i remember correctly this is all 15 years ago so it's hard to remember everything but he raised lots of money as a technology company almost or at least from tech vcs and he was like i'm gonna build a massive toy business and i remember reading at the time this is insane you're stupid but now that i think about it there's been many examples of where that is not stupid and this is yet another one of them where you could actually build a really cool ip toy company and he was sounds like he was on the right track it didn't work out it was big in the uk so in the uk it was like i don't know one out of every three kids is playing moshi monsters it was like insane it was like 90 million users globally and i remember meeting him i think it was still during the kind of like it was kind of like the tail end of the peak so it was big but it was it had stopped exploding and he was like that's okay we're gonna like try to turn this into a thing and he was telling me they're making moshi shampoo and body wash and you know it's going into every category but unfortunately that one didn't work out we have to get michael on by the way i was gonna say that we have to get michael in the pod because have you met him he is one of the coolest guys uh i've met he's such a nice guy first of all like total genuine good dude super creative really creative genius and then also like a rock star kind of like when you meet him you're like oh i'm talking to russell brand's like you know cooler but cooler brother you should everyone should google him his name is michael acton smith and i remember back in 14 or 13 or 12 where i mean i'm still interested in this but i was like i want to be like i was like looking for a person i wanted to be like and it was like him he would be because yeah there was like photos of him like holding hands with like paris hilton or like he was like if you google like michael acton smith like but they're not even dating that's the best part just hold their hands he was like he had like paparazzi photos of him because he would have this like tech angle even though he wasn't exactly in tech but he if you guys google him and see what he looks like you'll understand he looks like the daily telegraph described him as a rock star version of willy wonka that's his wikipedia page it's great this guy was so cool and now he has since started calm which i have no idea how big it is but it's hundreds or hundreds of millions or billions a multi-billion dollar company he's the man this guy's absolutely the man and he's been the man for 20 years he has he has he is he's amazing okay i'm gonna call him after this and be like i will fly to you let's do it episode because where's he even live now i think he was in the uk uh he was kind of back and forth between like you know us and uk i think he's in the uk now he's just like a rich guy now he just like does what he wants well i don't know i think he always did what he wants that's why he was uh that's why he was our hero that's the difference between that i don't think i need to do with being rich that's the difference between guys like me and guys like him i guess like he yeah exactly money and money chased him yeah he didn't run very fast uh this guy's the man yeah no that's hilarious okay i have another one for you can i give you another one so we did kids toys i have another one you might know the story of this one have you ever had one of these okay what's this oh i'm holding up no it looks like what is that bubblegum a box of tony's chocalone hell yeah brother i love tony's chocalone do they have some that have pop rocks in them by the way i've been saying it wrong for a long time it's not tony's chocalone it's tony's chuck a lonely do you know that i just call it tony's i love tony's i learned i have always bought them and then when we hung out with uh uh mr beast i kind of he told us the backstory i didn't realize how amazing they were i love tony's yeah yeah they're and their backstory is even better than i thought because when we were hanging out with jimmy he was like oh yeah i um you know he for for feastables really wanted to get feastables to have a supply chain that had no child labor he's like you know most of the cocoa farms in africa have child labor all the big chocolate brands you know hershey's etc they all buy from them when i learned that that was effed up i went over there and we try and we've basically been spending you know a couple years now trying to fix the supply chain so that that doesn't have to be the case he was like every company i don't like this this or that thing about them but there's one company that i really admire that seems to be doing something well and i think that's how he like phrased it and he said tony's is the one they do things right is basically exactly and he actually called the founders of this and learned from them of like okay what do i need to do which is cool because they were the ones who were who initially made the push but do you know the the backstory of why they made the push into doing this wasn't it started by an actor or a famous person in holland or something like that like a journalist a journalist okay it was like a non-business person who started it and they started it with it's one of these cool stories where they didn't so much care about chocolate they cared about like helping the earth or human rights or something and we're just so happened to be doing it via chocolate like it was something like a story like that wasn't it so the story is um these i think there was two uh dust journalists but these two just journalists they're covering the chocolate industry on their tv show and um they hear about you know that the chocolate companies are all the chocolate all the cocoa comes from west africa and that there's a lot of child yeah slavery and child labor so two separate things right slavery and then child labor happen happening on the farms there so they want to go and uh investigate so they go down there they investigate they find that it's true and um they put you know they put out a story to try to help and um i think the store the exact story is that at one point all the big chocolate companies signed like a treaty they signed like a pact to say we're gonna stop this and i guess like years later they had gone back and they had gone to investigate and it was like the exact same situation they saw that it kind of nothing had really changed and so these guys were pretty disheartened by it so they decide like this is where the story gets crazy because a normal person even a normal a great journalist would just report the story maybe use some some some choice language when they when they talk about it and then they would shake their finger at them and move on but these journalists went and did like you know took the exit off of high agency avenue and were like no no watch this and so the guys they come back and they do they decide to do a publicity stunt so he eats the chocolate and he calls the police and the police come and they're like what are you doing and he goes i'm eating chocolate that was made with slave labor and child labor and they're like that's what that's not a you're eating chocolate that's not a crime he goes no no actually according to statute blah blah blah knowingly consuming this product knowing what i know that this is the product of child labor and slave labor that's actually illegal arrest me boys and so they lock them up they take them to jail and that becomes this viral sort of news stunt that brings even more attention to this now prosecutors end up dismissing the case because they're like we're not going to prosecute this but they decide to go in and create their own ethically made chocolate brand and they decide to call it tony's chocolate lonely because they're like the guy's the guy's name is tune and but in the that's his dutch name but the like americanized westernized version of of tone i guess is his name would be tony so they go tony's and instead of and he said it's going to be very lonely to build a chocolate company that's actually trying to be like ethically sourced so he called it tony's chocolate lonely okay great and that's how they felt in their fight against uh the cocoa you know industry and it becomes a hit pretty much right away they sell 20 000 bars in two days because of the public like resonance with their story and um it becomes the best-selling chocolate brand in their market which is the netherlands they get like 20 share in in the netherlands uh it passes up mars and nestle and other other competitors there and then they start expanding and they keep expanding and then they start finding like-minded brands so they're you know i don't know if you know about ben and jerry's but ben and jerry's is also one of these like very uh sort of like strong ethical yeah opinion driven they they stick to what they want to do good people corporations i actually saw ben or jerry i forgot which one talk at an event i was at like 15 years ago and i remember being pretty blown away by the like how genuine it was for them and how the extent that they had gone right so for example i don't know if you know it's like they have this one flavor that's like their brownie flavor i forgot it like you know i'm so fit now i can't even remember the name dude it's insane let's talk the fudge brown something something fat people eat so so that's so my past i just can't even remember you're like i i barely remember how that felt last week by the way meanwhile i'm holding up this tony's jacket lonely three bars are missing from this pack blame it on the kids my wife gets pissed off at me because whenever we bring like a treat to like a friend's house we bring dessert they cook dinner and like it's like already open and she's like what the hell you can't like give like a pack of ice cream when there's like one i'm like why not we're gonna open it anyway like half an hour why can't i open it now that's sort of that's sort of what happened she's like she's like i'm a she always compares me to like a bear looking in the cabinets for honey and i get my brother my brother-in-law aaron he's he's one of these people that like you know doesn't it doesn't eat a ton in general like food's not a big he's not a big foodie yeah but if you leave like a snack he's like a bear like if you leave a treat in their house it's gone by the morning and you're like did you wake up and and so like he'll eat the whole bag right of anything and so my sister calls it like with oreos like uh like we got a pack of oreos right and she's like oh my god aaron's doing a line right now and doing a line to her meant you eat the entire row of oreos like he did a whole line and i just thought that was so funny aaron likes to party exactly uh we gotta have him back on brother aaron the ogs the real ogs now he had two guest cameo experiences like way back in the first 30 episodes it's hilarious anyways chocolate company so tony's chocolate only what did they do um or ben and jerry's to finish the ben and jerry's thing they opened up a factory i think somewhere like in upstate new york or something like this and they they it was after they met um what's it called when you get out of jail and like you're in the program but you like don't want to go recidivism like they wanted to reduce recidivism like people go back end up back in jail which is traditionally incredibly high it's really high and one of the big drivers of why do people who after a long sentence get out and go back it's not because they're like kind of morally corrupt at their core it's like they couldn't get a job and then they didn't have any money in the social life previous friends were losers or they left prison without knowing anyone but only had 50 dollars exactly and so a big uh one way to decrease recidivism is if people can get a job but nobody wants to give them jobs so they created a whole factory their brownie factory is all brownies made by ex-cons basically the the ben and jerry's flavor they like wanted to they they met some guys who had a good good recipe and they like built a factory around them essentially so they're they're do-gooders um so tony's chocolate only to break into the u.s starts partnering with ben and jerry's um and the revenue has just grown and grown and grown and so like last year i think they did 200 million in revenue and they made this like a legit chocolate company that started with two journalists just basically trying to make a stand against the man how cool is that this is awesome this is so cool i uh are do they run the company now no so they're out now um there's like a ceo they like you know it's just kind of run by like you know normal suits basically at this point and they get some flack because like um their supply chain is still not perfect and but they're very transparent about it so the crazy thing is like they'll report that they had like you know 11 issues this year of like child labor discovered in their supply chain and people are like see you're not totally free and they're like what we're trying to like we're trying to be transparent and say you know we we're way less than anybody else we're and we're also honest about this and we're reporting it so that we can keep improving this but they get some flack as like you know i guess like skeptics say that maybe they're just green washing at this point now since the founders left and even i think the founder has sort of alluded to like it's not the same since we left i don't know the exact story it's like i'm trying to read these like dutch translations of articles and decided that like i'd rather just eat the chocolate and chill um so i'm not sure the exact story but i think there's maybe a little controversy around that yeah i i've known about this brand for a while and this and i didn't know the i only knew what jimmy had said which wasn't in this depth but that makes me like them way more the product's awesome i mean i love the brand they also and i eat the out of them i mean it's it messes me up but that's cool maybe you could be the influencer that blows them up even more sam far i eat the out of them it's just like you most of my like guilty evenings start with a bar of tony's uh like and the problem with the end jar of honey let's not even how much time we got uh the the issue is they would sell their candy like it used to come in like the extra huge size it was a huge bar they only sell in bulk by the way did i ever tell you about the time we were talking about recidivism this is not entirely related to business but i think you'll get a kick out of this did i tell you about the time do you know that i've been to like i think we've talked about this i've been to san quentin a few times in indiana state prison uh you've mentioned that you did but i don't know the exact story what's what's the story the background of this so i've gone to uh i have a friend who i'm gonna this is the story it's gonna be about him but i've been to indiana state prison a couple times or once i went to san quentin a few times one time i went to indiana state prison uh so we we go because my friend has this charity called the last mile and the idea is like when you commit a crime particularly murder you're not always sentenced to life you're inevitably going to get out and it's better for that person if if they get out and have a job it's better for society if they get out and get a job and it's better for the taxpayer if they get out and get a job because you don't want them to go back to prison because that's that's bad for everyone and so it's we are all incentivized it's totally bipartisan to get this person to be trained and to get a job and so this company the last mile started by my friend chris they uh help you learn i think when i went i think they were learning uh wordpress i don't know what they learn now but this was a while ago they were learning wordpress or they were learning like some uh front-end development so you can get a job at like an ebay or like a huge vibe coding now yeah i don't know what they do now yeah they have like some like weird like uh like uh hot or not they're just minting nfts yeah i don't know what these guys are doing but my friend chris started it and he uh was a prominent venture capitalist he helped uh he was the first investor in wish he was an early investor in snap he did uh boom he did all these other like cool startups and for some reason one day he went and volunteered at san quentin at a prison and he was like i think this is my life's mission to like help reduce recidivism meaning when you get out of prison and uh you don't go back and so he created this thing called the last mile they now have hundreds of employees they've had thousands of people who have gone through their program and uh i up until recently i i he told me this stat a couple years ago so i don't want to like jinx someone i don't know the update but of the thousand or two thousand people who graduated not one had ever been back to prison and that's like a huge thing and uh and so it's really interesting that this tech person has uh like he quit so he doesn't invest anymore this is all he does and i talked to another guy mike novogratz uh he was on the pod uh two weeks ago and that's his thing now too is uh reducing recidivism so reducing the rate that you go back to prison but i know a bunch of people who have given up their careers to go pursue this i'm on their website right now pretty crazy stats so it says since the 70s the prison population the u.s has increased by 700 percent which is not what you would expect uh you know that's not just like oh that makes sense it should grow every year it's like no no no the prison population should not necessarily grow at that rate it says that every prison every person in prison has an annual cost to the american taxpayer of seventy thousand dollars which means we pay about 50 billion dollars a year is spent on state and federal prisons um isn't that crazy that's it's it's it's amazing right the last miles participants in the last mile who go through their i guess it's like an education program as they get out have a 75 employment rate when they come out which is yeah i wonder what the non i wonder what the baseline is it's got to be half that well so basically what happens and i and i talked to some of these guys when they were in there they were like look when i got out i had been in for 10 or 15 years i was a thug like i didn't want to associate with my old people and like my family had either died or wasn't around and they basically gave me a bus ticket and 50 bucks and i was like sir where do i go i'm not sure where i go to right now what do i do and so they're like that's why i came back here is i just started going back to how i used to behave by the way why does he have a um this guy chris looks awesome chris redlets why does he have a serious radio show what does that get broadcasted into in the prisons in some way or like is that just an external thing both so he ha so chris is interesting so we had michael harris on the pod michael my uh harry oh is his nickname harry oh is the founder of death row records chris is kind of he i joke he's an og he's a he's an original gangster so he knows all of these guys so he's friends with dr dre snoop the founders of death row all these cool guys and they all have this like blend of like hip-hop but also like crime like interests and so he decided to have a show with serious where he would get some get some of these cool guys on the radio show and they would talk about what his issue is but also it was like wrapped up in like kind of cool stories because it's kind of like like hip-hop and like celebrity and so he had a show for serious where he would talk about it this guy's living the dream got rich decided to do good in the world has a great podcast the triple threat i love he's cool and so he actually so i became really close with him he invested in my company when i was a a 25 year old or 26 year old in san francisco very coincidentally we both moved to this small town in westport uh connecticut together and we hang out all the time and his wife her name is beverly she's a 95 pound woman and i've been to san quentin and we we were walking on the yard with these guys doing like bench press and sit-ups and whatever and i walked with this little lady through the yard and the red sea parted and she just walked through and she's like tyrone how are you and she would go miss bev nice to see you it was the craziest thing that i've ever seen it was like i'm telling you she like ran this prison yard she was the only woman there and it was the craziest thing i've ever seen and they have a joke that says if it glow you may go when you walk in to san quentin they stamp your hand and so when you leave you have to show them your stamp underneath underneath a black light in order to get out and they would do jokes where she would wink at the guy when i'm walking in and he didn't actually stamp me he just pretended and i would go to scan my hand to leave and my hand didn't glow and they're like sir you cannot leave we have to get this figured out and i was like i'm not staying here so like they would pull like tricks on you like when you go and see this place it was wild but uh chris and bev uh are two people when i think of how to live life it's them that it's the way to go that's dope can i tell you a related story so my buddy trevor was writing a book and he did this great very smart move which i'd never really heard anybody else do but i thought it was a good idea he goes hey man uh check your email i check my email and there's like a plane ticket and it's a plane ticket to go see him and he's like um i'm gonna do i want to write this book and i want it to be great and i could sit here and brainstorm this on my own but i really want to do something that i'm calling a book storm and he basically decided to fly out the five kind of smartest most interesting people he knew to hang out with him for a day and just help him flesh out and brainstorm the book together and he's like i will owe you one for life but i just really respect you trust you and i really want your help with this because i'm trying to make this great i go and in the room is basically my buddy trevor his brother and then there's the um head of like the women's volleyball the u.s women's volleyball team uh which is like way outperformed in the olympics and won like a bunch of gold and there was one other person and then there was this guy larry i'm like oh i'm a professional brainstormer this is literally what i do i'm like just ready to rock and roll but i'm just blown away by this guy larry every time this guy larry opens his mouth he says something that's super wise super smart on the nose just a few words but he's always on point and so after about an hour the brainstorm around the book i was like dude i gotta ask larry i missed the intro what's your story dude because you're incredible and larry tells the story where larry's like you know i um my name's larry blah blah and he goes i was incarcerated for the past 22 years and i think he had just gotten out i don't know how long it had been maybe a year or two something like that and he goes yeah from the age 18 he's now 40 he's like at age 18 i was arrested and i was i was in for you know whatever 22 plus years and i was like larry no offense but you just got out a couple years ago how are you so smart how do you know all this stuff because he would read all that he would have these amazing polls or whatever we're talking about he would reference this thing in this book and this quote he could just recite by memory so larry i'm like larry how do you know all this and he goes i was incarcerated at age 18 they lock you up and throw away the key right like you're basically like the lowest man on the totem pole for society they don't nobody invests in you at that point you're you're a sunk cost and so he's like i was you know getting in trouble and it was a rough place and it was not a good time and he's like i made a decision i'm no longer in prison i'm in university he's like so every day i just studied i just decided to go to university for the past 20 years he's like i decided to read all the books and learn and write and better myself and he's like i would literally change what i saw i would walk in the prison yard and i wouldn't see the barbed wire he's like i saw roses he's like i literally just re brainwashed myself that i am not in prison i am in university and i carried myself like that and i acted like that he made the most of what was you know otherwise a very bad situation i just remember being so blown away and inspired by this guy larry when i heard that they heard that story because i was like you know if larry can do that at a life sentence in prison this sounds stupid but like then i can be born in a line at starbucks for it out or you know whatever like i you can change where you are you don't have to be in the situation that it looks like you're in like you can literally just decide no no i'm in university right now no no i'm in a spa right now no i'm in i'm in the brainstorming session right now yeah i mean i am where i want to be about that that's so cool yeah it's really challenging because on one hand for some reason you start you feel like sad for someone like because you meet someone like a lot of the guys i met they i think they kind of had a tone for their sins a little bit where like they've changed but you're like oh i feel so bad for you like that sucks you deserve this and then you like learn about what they did and you're like ah actually no uh like consequences exist for a reason like that sounds fair to me uh and it creates like a you get whenever i've done these things with these guys i get so many mixed emotions it's a very challenging thing it's a very hard thing to be part of too uh but it is a no-brainer right you want someone to like yeah not go back did i tell you my embarrassing prison story no but that sounds so awesome it's very embarrassing this could go so many ways so i go i go with this were you making dad jokes your first day in so um so i moved to silicon valley and i'm working with this guy michael birch and michael birch is this wonderful guy michael's built a successful career in silicon valley he's basically like a billionaire so one day he messages me like pack it like pack a bag with enough clothes for a day i got two days and uh meet me like at like whatever like meet me at like 8 a.m at this spot you're not going to work today i'm like all right i don't know what's gonna happen so i go and we started driving no idea where you're going i think he tells me on the drive that we're going to he's a part of this group called the inside circle and inside circle was where they take guys from the outside to go meet guys on the inside and it was at the prison a fulsome was it called fulsome prison yeah fulsome and so we go drive there it's a maximum security prison and i'm basically just a huge wuss right so i don't know what i don't know what i'm getting into i don't know what i didn't actually sign up for this michael's just kind of like trust me you'll like this is good you should do this i still don't really understand what we're doing i think it's like a you know like dare where they like scare you they like take you in they're like scared straight like you're like yeah i thought it was scared are you going to just observe from like behind this like really thick glass i'm like oh cool we're gonna be like watch and i'm gonna be like wow i learned so much today from observing tapping on the glass and then they open the door and they're like all right guys come on in i'm like what and so we go in and they're like all right uh you know pick a buddy pick up pick a partner and so i'm like uh and i like pick this guy and and the the program starts it basically it's like a men's group so you sit in a circle you talk about your feelings oh and by the way when i walk in immediately my eyes are drawn to one person because it was so obvious to me like this was the hardest guy in the prison somehow this guy had sunglasses and i don't know why he was allowed to have sunglasses he had a walking he had a cane which i thought like you're not allowed to have like a like something that could be like a weapon uh he's but he's got a king and he's got sunglasses but he's not blind by the way what he has the sunglasses like up on his head sometimes black guy black guy and he had like an entourage like he had like two guys with him who were really big and like but they deferred to him and he was kind of older and i was just like i don't know who this guy is but i've seen enough was he a somebody to know that this guy is somebody here uh and maybe somebody on the outside i don't know but he's somebody in here anyway so he's in my group and his two like entourage guys so we get in the circle and i'm like okay i don't know what i'm supposed to do am i giving advice is this a mentorship test what is this and it's like no no you're here to talk about you know it's a this is a safe space unpack your feelings i'm like oh god and so first guy starts and he starts talking about how he's feeling pissed off he's feeling pissed off because like i mean crazy story but like he's locked up in here and his sister outside is having issues being abused by her boyfriend he just wants to kill this guy but he's on the inside he can't get to this guy he feels powerless and he's sharing this heavy emotional real life problem yeah like a grade a real life problem and i'm i of course because i'm horrible i stopped listening i'm just like panicked thinking of what am i going to say you know when you're like supposed to be listening but you just actually just planning what you're supposed to say i start doing that because i'm like everybody gonna like retell a fake movie so you sound hard like yeah so i'm like my startup doesn't have product where it fit it's just really grinding my gear what the hell am i gonna say i don't have real world problems right like my life's pretty good and the cert we're going around the circle and it's just one crazy like real problem after another and then um and then it's getting to me and i'm just like what am i gonna say and so i'm like all right i guess i go deep in the bag i'm like all right i do have you know there is something that's like pretty heavy i don't really talk about this normally but like i guess thank god i have this because this is the time and place to unpack this story and so i start unpacking this story and in my mind and also i'm like i'm talking kind of slower and dramatically because i'm like let me really ham this up a little bit like let me not let me not be me and laugh during this let me uh you know try to be serious here and i think i'm doing a great job and the guy with the glasses just midway through is like man i don't believe none of that i'm like i'm like no and i immediately i'm like no it's true he goes i know it's true and i'm like so what just to clarify you said still are we cool what's going on and he was like and he was like man that ain't your truth though and so he's like it's true but that ain't your truth and i'm like what is this puzzle what is this riddle i don't know what this means and then um creates this like really intense moment where i had to stand up and he's like they're like all right it's time to do the work i'm like what and stand up like i'm going to get beat up and so he's like right right he's like what's your truth and i'm like what i just feel uh and i'm like i'm like i'm like no but that is a real situation that has happened to me and they were like no what's your truth and i was like all right the truth is i'm just trying to say what i think you guys want me to say because i just want you to like me and i put the guy i'm like i just want you to not hate me and he looks at me just stares at me he stands up he gets in my face he goes that's your truth and then we sat down and then for the next hour i was like i don't know what the hell just happened but i think i'm in a prison gang and this is awesome i think i'm accepted this felt amazing that's called a breakthrough yeah i had a breakthrough so that's pretty awesome prison story that's great did you uh how did it end did you guys like exchange information what do you do dude have you ever taken ecstasy i haven't but i assumed that's what it felt like because for the rest of the time i was just like the weight of the world was off my shoulders and i just enjoyed myself and i and i realized like oh i could just be my insecure neurotic self and that's fine here okay cool i don't have to pretend great and then they were like cool he ain't pretending anymore we like this guy uh whatever you whatever you say now we don't really care but we just know that you're not pandering to us what value do these guys get what a lesson learned what value do these guys get well i think you know they live outside company hard life no i think just in general they live a pretty hard life and they go to this meeting every week so they have this kind of like two hours a week where they get to go and kind of like as they would say like take the mask off put the armor down in fact like it would be a mix of like the hispanic guys the white guys and the black guys in this session but then they would like openly say like yeah but like he his friend like shanked my friend and so it's on but here it's not on but as soon as we get out it's on again and i was like this is like a pretty bizarre dynamic but they all agreed like all right when we're here it's whatever but when we're out there it is what it is that's this the way that's just the way it's on i remember being like that's insane um but you know understandable in a way so they have this as a space where they can like deload kind of emotionally mentally which is important and feel like a human being and be able to like express themselves i think it's a pretty dehumanizing feeling right when you're again locked up throw away the key and you know anybody who comes in they just see you as your label right but like in that environment for those three hours that we were there you know nobody was there was no status nobody was better than anybody else or like yeah there was us but i was worse than everybody else i guess it's probably the more accurate way of saying it but like there was no they got to like be treated well and be helped and be just talked to one man to another man um at least again these are my my this is like my interpretation of it i'm sure that people who do this more have like a more sophisticated way and a better way of saying it by the way now that we're talking about this and we can wrap up but jack smith i forgot this is his big philanthropic cause as well so jack smith if you ask him what he's doing on a regular basis for a long time i would say what are you doing he's like oh i'm i'm pen pals uh with like people who are locked up and they i have a system where they can order any book and i'll get it for them isn't he giving books isn't it a book program yeah where he created a website i forget how he did it but uh where they can order a book and he'll buy them any single book that they want dude most generic name jack smith you can't find anything when you google for jack smith like yeah okay well maybe we do this so there's the last mile which you could donate to so go to last mile the last mile.org you can donate there there's inside circle foundation where you could donate there um so maybe do a little good so if there's anybody who's listening to this inspired either to start your own uh thing or to attend one of these or to donate uh go do it man because it's a seen it firsthand does a lot of good and um i think doesn't get the type of attention that it would ever want by the way the inside circle guys they also made like a movie uh a documentary about the program and uh chris redlitz is the guy who um who i who's kind of my mentor and someone i look up to and you can find him on twitter he's um he's super low-key but he's been the seed investor of like probably five to ten different unicorns hugely successful and now he has dedicated his life to this so just dm him if you're want to do whatever he's pretty open do you think you're going to do something like this by the way yeah i haven't found my cause for a long do you have like a career arc in mind where you're like cool i achieve i climb success mountain and then i you know parachute over to like you know save the world i told sarah that at the age of 40 i'm going to stop the getting of money so i said by by 40 i will no longer pursue any money and we will have a cause and that's what we will dedicate ourselves to that's what i that's that's you've also told me that you're gonna disappear off the internet i think this is badass and you should talk more about this i said at the age of 40 yeah i want to get off the internet and i want to not pursue any money making things ever again i don't want it to like ruin my perspective and just be a shallow capitalist and only care about that and just delete the internet and just focus on like doing something good that's that's what that's the current that's the current plan how old are you now i turned 36 a month ago so uh i'm uh 36 four years away dude do you think that's a crazy plan of course it's a crazy plan but it's a pretty cool plan i think it sounds pretty cool i said i said by 40 are you i mean what's your level of seriousness about this is this like that's what's happening or like i'm just testing this out seeing how these words sound in my mouth no i i just think that i think that um i think if you only pursue making money i think that you become a very shallow person i think that there's more to life i think that there's been so many times where i've seen something inspiring and beautiful and in my head i think oh then we could do this and turn it into this and then like optimize by doing this as opposed to saying this is beautiful this is wonderful i want to experience let's keep it small uh and so i want to like force myself to appreciate that one of my heroes is this guy named felix dennis he wrote the book how to get rich felix dennis was a publisher in england where he founded a bunch of companies a bunch of publishing companies eventually was worth six or seven hundred million dollars and he wrote that he was diagnosed with cancer something like at the age of 60 and then at the age of like 61 while he was like learning about his cancer or something he got into poetry and he was like i'm obsessed with writing poetry why on earth did i not discover this sooner and he quit business partially because he was dying and because he fell in love with poetry and he wrote in his book that if i could do it all over again i would have quit at the age of 40 because i had enough and i would have pursued poetry because that was my calling and i always found that to be amazing because i think that oftentimes when we're doing what we're doing every single day we get caught into the make more do more optimize more when it's like kind of i want to be in the present and i want to enjoy the things that i want to enjoy regardless if they make money because how many hobbies have you had where you're like well i would only do it if i could like make like oh i want to like buy these toys and like maybe i could buy like 10 of them turn into a money making thing now what you're doing is actually pretty cool you but you still have a capitalistic mindset to it you are playing the piano and you are live streaming it which i think is amazing but in my head i'm like i want to do that too it's like well i only want to do that because i want people to see me learning a hobby do you know what i mean and i like that's like tainting well i only live streamed it once no i'm not criticizing you i'm criticizing i i was inspired to do it because i want glory do you know what i mean yeah yeah and well i um i learned pretty quickly when i started playing the piano that um nobody gives a if you could play the piano by the way it's not like a thing like uh if somebody plays the piano well it's like oh cool you can play the piano well they don't want to listen to even one song nobody wants to listen to somebody play a five-minute song on the piano that's a very like clear thing to me since learning to play piano but it doesn't matter because playing the playing a five-minute song is incredibly fun in fact i was i sent ben a text so i'm gonna read you this text message because i think it's very relevant to what we're talking about so pomp did a a spac recently did you see this yeah i i i saw it but i don't entirely know what that means but yeah so our friend uh pomp anthony they spacked a company and the company's goal was to do the kind of michael saylor playbook which is it's a bitcoin acquisition and finance company and so what they're doing is they they raise i think 750 million dollars they spacked it um it's now public you know it's going to be a public company and they basically bought 750 million dollars worth of bitcoin then they're going to raise debt and buy more bitcoin they're going to because companies can companies or pension funds can own pomp stock but they can't own bitcoin so this is how they get exposure to it is that right um that's one one aspect to it there's others which is like it's levered so like you know you can for every dollar you put in let's say you buy bitcoin directly you could buy one dollar of bitcoin but like their thing might they're going to borrow and buy more than a dollar of bitcoin for every dollar of equity you know for example um they also want to eventually turn it into like a full financial services thing so essentially like a bitcoin backed bank uh i think that's like part of the vision anyways i don't know exactly what they're doing there's you know they're only allowed to say certain things but point is uh it's like pomp this guy who's very much like us i think he's the same age similarly i hang out with anthony all the time creator on the internet good dude and he's you know he's not like some uber uber uber genius that's like you know but he's like relatable that's what i'm saying so he's like he's like one of us and it's clear that like you know this didn't just happen he's been working on this for you know some period of time maybe six months maybe a year maybe two years you don't know so he he it's like oh wow pomp raised 750 million dollars has this public company now i think he owns eight percent of it i saw from the filing so like you know theoretically pomp has like 80 million dollars of value from this right some creators make courses pumps gonna make like you know probably hundreds of millions of dollars from this thing if it goes well okay and uh that's clearly what he put a lot of energy and focus on and did a great job fundraising for and i was texting ben i was like wow wow that's incredible i was like meanwhile i've logged 120 hours on the piano in the last six months and i go honestly no regrets though i fucking love the piano dude so listen you tweeted out you said i used to think jealousy was a bad thing like a sin and i try to avoid avoid it but jealousy is a wedding crasher it shows up uninvited and recently i started using jealousy to my advantage advantage jealousy is an incredible signal it tells me at a very primal no logic level what my subconscious wants it's a heat signal for taste i don't obey the signal but i do observe it and it helps me now and so this sounds very strange but when i saw what pop was doing i was like that's so badass congrats to him but then very weirdly when i saw you streaming you play the piano for some reason i thought that was oddly one of the cooler things you've done in the last year or two and i felt stronger and i'm like well why do i feel that why do i think that that is cooler i don't know why exactly but it relates to that tweet where i'm like what's the signal there that that's sending so anyway i thought that was really cool i thought that was significantly cooler and i said this as well when you were contemplating making a play or starting a business or something like that it's like i don't know for some reason the play is so much cooler so i think i would pursue those like artistic things over the money thing and this sounds like very trite you know uh like not everyone has the privilege to be able to do that but i do think that like it's better for your soul that way yeah exactly i mean you could already you know hear the comments oh it must be nice for you you don't have to work another version of it is tech bros discover hobbies there's more to life than money but also by the way both true yeah both both very valid points of view i don't think it's the important point of view but i do think they're valid points of view i think the important point of view is like try to figure out what you actually want to do and then pursue it like in a relentless sort of un um unashamed way and i think it's very cool when you said that thing i think you told me like in five seven years i plan to delete my social media disappear from the internet and and now you're talking about like you know and you know stop the stop pursuing the getting of money yeah i really hope you stick to that i don't know if you will because i think it's a very hard thing to do it's like hey can you turn down like it's like being like i no longer eat sugar right it's like those people who like are like i'm gonna stop i'm gonna diet right it's hard to stick to a diet but if you actually did that you would like shoot up in the rankings of like most badass people i know you know what i mean you're already top 10 but you would shoot up i've got four years to go i better get all i better get all of it while i can but i do think that that it's also give me a percentage how certain are you you're going to do that at the age of 40 i just need to know i'm gonna hold you to this 60 to 70 percent i mean look i feel this a lot of it has to do with family too like i feel uh like when my little kids start like talking and having personalities i think i would fall in love with them even more and i just want to like be a good example that there's more to life than than just the getting of money yeah yeah i'm totally washed kids are so cute i'm just washed up now i can't do i can't do anything dude i'm just yeah like the all the more personality she shows the more where i'm like oh nothing really matters except our health and being around each other right right i don't know is that does that stay linear like or does it like uh like does it keep getting hired the more they talk to you yeah it is but i i think at least for me like there's a uh there is a cap it's not one of these unbounded things it's not like i want to spend every waking moment with you i'm like you got like you're too annoying i'm too tired this is too much but it does i do i do have like a uh it became my favorite thing for like three hours a day like for three hours a day my kids are my favorite thing in the world that's three hours a day that my favorite thing used to be working it used to be you know reading there's other things that were in that spot of like that three hours a day of like voluntary time i could shoot i could direct towards anything and now my kids are that right like we just like jumping in the pool with them and doing stuff or playing a game or whatever that's like it is super super fun but it is capped at like a three to four hours a day beyond that i'm like like how dare my wife make me raise my own children this is too much i need to be helped and saved who's who's here who saved me this is the softest episode we've ever had all right we should get off before uh we start crying all right that's it that's the pod21 i you ibert imon in m
