is that what they do that's what they do all right we're back um before we get it so you know how i said leave reviews yeah um i think we got two or three or 100 reviews off of that yeah it's crazy um and we promised about people cool shit we gotta like fulfill because people are like here's my receipt uh i i left you guys a great review i got about a hundred messages of people with the reviews i replied to all of them last night i was sitting on my couch so i'm just the asshole who didn't well i cc'd you on a few i replied to all of them with the special gift i just let i yeah call them basically that's a video voicemail you know uh at yc they have this thing which is like you'd rather have a thousand people love you than a million people just kind of like you yeah and i think that's the one thing that that is now abundantly clear about this podcast is like we have these goals of like we're gonna grow this thing big but we already did the hard part which is you get a small number of people to love you where they're like this is my routine this is my favorite podcast and i've been listening to the podcast for five years yeah and so uh that's very i don't know feels good feels great yeah i had uh i got i was shown adam last night i got i don't know i mean at least a couple hundred like dms on my twitter people with the review exactly and i said them all video so review us and leave a video or review us and let me know because sean hasn't been doing it but at least if you let me know you'll get something back all right you know what's my fear in all this though uh so i have a fear that's crept up now the fear is um i never want to be the smart person in the room and so there's part of me i'm sitting in this red fucking throne and uh throwing out ideas that i'm admittedly saying are half-baked you know probably bad ideas but they're interesting to me um i want to make sure that we're learning doing this like i want to be learning stuff and sharing it i don't want to just be sitting here saying hey i got answers let me give them to you and so my commitment to myself really more than anybody else but i want to say it out loud because that commits me is uh you know as we do this it's not about oh i have great ideas let me say them or or we're brainstorming great ideas it's we're going to learn interesting stuff by talking interesting people and doing research on things and then we're going to share what we like we're going to share what's fun what's interesting to us so that's my fear is you never want to be the guru you want to be the student um and so that's kind of my my little mini rant i agree i'm not trying to be a guru and i'm certainly not because some of the dms we get people are like help me yeah help me you know i'm like no no i don't know anything and me attaching my name to your thing does nothing like we got to do the work yeah and like you know i'll help you but i'm not the answer i don't know yeah i'm not the answer uh and we could preface this by saying most of the ideas we get i just steal from other people yeah for sure of course so um all right you want to uh get in what do we want to talk about you want to talk about can i talk about something that's happening recently yeah brandless so is that what you want to talk about i want to talk about brandless and i want to talk about um these new credit cards that are popping up yep all right pick one let's do it you go ahead brandless uh all right so brandless people don't know uh they went out of business what they were trying to do was uh they were like look don't pay for the name brand you should just have high quality products and they should just be brandless and because we take away the name brand we can lower the price that was like the initial promise or the premise of the business awesome idea awesome idea i'm glad you said that because a lot of people are shitting on them now because they like failed but i still think fucking awesome idea and actually of course ironically brandless is a good brand um and so i think that that was really cool they raised a shit ton of money from softbank like 200 million dollars before they really achieved any product market fit and that sort of like was the death note for the company because it was just the expectations when you raise 200 million is you're going to be you know a billion dollar plus company and if you do that too early and you haven't actually proven out your model you haven't figured it all out what expectations crush the business i actually so i didn't prepare because i just thought about this but what do you what's the biggest grocery store chain in america you think albertons maybe safeway i don't know okay let's do safeway can you look up try and find this just just a headline trying to tell me what the revenue or how many sales like uh generic brands for grocery stores or like the kirkland brand or whatever look up how much revenue the kirkland brand does well i mean i bet you it's astronomical and so actually i mean if you think about what brandless could become it is the generic the the generic brand a trusted kirkland brand yeah i think and i think it's a great idea yeah the problem was that they raised all that money right off the bat i have i have a problem there was some incompetence with leadership i don't actually know this yeah kirkland brand sells 39 billion dollars of products fuck henry quick with the trigger i like that what's that source uh what's the source you think he's lying you think he's making this up wow 38 billion dollars in one year so so one thing i loved is i and that's just kirkland kirkland crazy so i i listened to her on a podcast tina sharky i think is her name and she's like an internet og she's been around with a bunch of companies um all of which i think have not done super great but she went on this podcast she said this thing that i liked which was she was like think back to when you were a child and like let's walk from room to room you're in the laundry room what brand are you going to see you're going to see whatever yeah tide you're going to see whatever go to the pantry what are you going to see you're going to see fruit roll up and uh pop tarts and all this stuff and then open up your fridge what are you going to see and you see these brands and actually it's kind of like you've seen these stats where the s&p 500 turns over like i don't know 20 of the s&p 500 turns over every every decade uh basically the same thing happens with these like household brands these brands that seem like staples of your home right um a lot of them are like like minute made it's like fuck minute made you're out like you know now you know tang yeah tang you know like these brands just like like they are not they can come and go generationally they don't just all make it from one mom to the next mom and i actually believe that premise and she was like look the moms of this generation they don't want to pay for this like the consumer package good brand in the same way they want to know it's high quality ingredients sourced you know ethically and you know they don't want to overpay they want to be you know value conscious so i liked a lot of the premise i'm sad it didn't work but somebody i believe i believe you should just go out today and pitch i'm brandless without soft bank and i think i would i would invest in a credible entrepreneur i agree with you i think i had three people reach out to me that said hey can you ask can you introduce me to the people who are selling brandless i mean i don't know them but i just tweeted it and i got an intro and i introduced three different people who are wanting to buy the assets and what are the what are the assets what are you getting you get the name maybe a little some inventory probably okay the name and uh email list and then unfortunately probably a bunch of an incompetent team i mean right no disrespect but look if they couldn't pull it off there by definition well you'll you'll need to restart for sure right you'll need a clean slate and you need to lower the burn yeah um i think it's cool i would probably charge a membership they did a subscription because they started off with everything was three bucks i forgot to mention that that was like a key selling point like dude i think everything's three bucks like three dollar store and people say the cac was too high that it cost too much to acquire customers that's probably true but like wish is doing it yeah you know i don't know the economics but this brings up an interesting half-baked idea um we got a dm from your friend about like businesses that are in the spot brandless is in where they're doing essentially a closed down slash fire sale and you want to share the idea that uh which one narenda oh share this good idea this morning yeah that was a great idea okay so we actually should bring this guy in i have an investor and a good friend of mine i cold emailed him and we became friends he invested he started a company called web shots and i i think he sold it for 80 million dollars and then he bought it back um yeah if those guys come in you can bring him in he bought it back for pennies and then sold it again for 20 or 30 million dollars and then now has bought it back again and he was like you guys uh or you know what something would be interesting is if you could be like a graveyard or an unwinding service undertaker an undertaker where you can just buy these dying things and that exists i mean that's it's a service to basically wind down your company you take a fee and you do the sort of fire sale and i'm sure there's services out there like this but somebody could specialize in tech companies wind down both you have talent you have hardware you have uh you know assets that you're trying to fire sale off and then you have all the normal business closing stuff you got to do so you don't get like taxes next year um because you have to actually shut down your company officially and nobody wants to do that it's not fun and investors want to make sure that that process is done with no like funny business so that they like maximize the value and this kind of reminds me of something that i want to bring up which is i think that now that private companies are staying private for long and not going public as much what i think needs to happen is i think the venture capitalists a lot of vc firms need to start buying companies and just need to own them for the cash flow versus wanting something to go public or get bought and so what i think is going to happen is i think a lot of these vc firms are almost going to turn into hedge funds or private equity funds we're going to start they're going to buy and operate a lot more than they are now and that's related to that um so i don't think vcs will do it but the sort of new age vcs that are going to be hybrids so like uh andreason horowitz shifted their model where they're not a vc they're now uh i forgot what it's called but like they wanted to be able to just own cryptocurrency just buy it and hold it and do other things so they needed to reclassify and then uh this guy chamath he basically has a fund called social capital it started off as a traditional vc fund and then like he had to restart it for all kinds of reasons um but one of the things he does now is he has this thing called a spack which is his special purpose vehicle for taking companies public so you're a company you don't want to go public he's already public and he just acquires a state you know a stake in your company i believe is that is how the mechanics work so they just did this with virgin galactic and so it's like a fast track to being public and getting that liquidity without having to go and be you know your own independent listing yeah i'm into that i know andrew wilkinson's probably listening he owns tiny uh capital and they do they've been doing this uh the companies that they own collectively i think do about 100 million in revenue and he i think takes dividends and buys companies with the cash flow right and uh it's an awesome model but a lot of these companies like brandless there's no cash flow right it's going to be a cash sink it's one of these go big or go to zero and in this in this case it went to zero yeah but it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be but um it's also that is also valid right like to do the do what like jet tried to do which is like you know they never made their core business work sold for three billion dollars uh because they they went for the plow money in today try to get the scale and then be the first to have scale doing what we do you know it's a it's a model no i'm into it what's the other one you want to talk about credit cards um we can mention it just for a second but uh ramp ramp capital right ramp uh let's let's ramp something it's based out of new york's but from new york yeah i'm into it it launched today okay so i went my company we do let's say eight figures a year in revenue we have uh not uh seven figures in cash um i have been using one big bank for a long time and to get us to raise our credit card limit from 30 000 to 80 000 was a nightmare oh my god a nightmare yeah i had to go meet them in person two or three times i had to show them my personal sam pars tax returns it was stupid i signed up to brecks and i got three or four hundred some hundreds of thousands of dollars in like 12 hours yeah awesome and i told these guys and like yeah we can't compete with that they basically admitted it and i go okay well this conversation is over thank you uh so i really like this new business credit card space and i i'll explain how i think they're making money but ramp just launched and what they're gonna do what they said they're gonna do is they're gonna analyze all your credit card spending and they'll tell you where repetitive purchases are coming through and i actually mentioned this on the podcast um three months ago i was like i'm telling you that businesses are wasting so much money by buying multiple subscriptions of things and i think something amazing can be built by helping you save a little bit of money right that's what this is um that's like a side feature they have that's not the main feature is the same like bricks right like it's like here's a business credit card well that's how they're um differentiating brecks's advertising says uh we will get you better rewards right and this is we'll save you money yeah yeah and i think it's cool and i'm really bullish on those things um and i think the way they work is whenever a whenever a customer when i have my credit card and i go and buy something the merchant pays a four percent fee um and what brecks does is they go to mastercard and they go hey you guys are getting four percent fee for all this stuff give us a cut of that and we'll create more credit card users right and uh i i think that's how they're making money i'd imagine i think so i don't know i don't know for certain but um fintech companies are very interesting we should i know a couple guys are deep in fintech we'll bring them on a lot of people are not deep into that and a lot of people like wellfront and betterment a lot of people hate those like buyers uh right i don't know how they're ever going to get bought i don't know who would buy them uh we'll see all right what else we got up here um let's see i feel like sean when we come for the last few times i've been the one doing all the research and i have a feeling that you're the one who's done all the research i did some research this time uh so first follow up on uh last time i was talking about corporate universities um i'm gonna keep talking about anything education because i just love it i had a lot of people reach out to me about that really okay so i i went back to my notes i already had these notes uh but i just wanted to mention a couple of them so hamburger u that's the mcdonald's one 19 full-time professors i thought that was interesting um there's uh i don't know how you say this crotonville that's from general electric so kaiser just opened up their own med school which i find really interesting because it's what that's exactly what i was talking about where you want your own pipeline of doctors so you create your own med school um then some companies do it more like training apple university deloitte university i think those are more like just a training program so you could be a better employee that's that's different bigger um another one that i thought was interesting so we talked about zoho so zoho has their own university and the graduates of that make up 15 of their workforce oh shit uh which is pretty insane so 100 they have about a thousand maybe they have more than a thousand people i'm not sure exactly how many total that is um the google it support certificate has 75 000 graduated students uh which is pretty crazy um so i think this is going to be a big trend so where's the opportunity to be a company that can create these education so i think what you can do is so there's these companies that are called what the hell are they called i know one is called to you or something like that that's the name of one of their companies so there's a set of companies that what they're doing is they say hey university hey berkeley you should have an online degree and for years universities were not so interested in this and then they saw how much money gets made by online degrees and so they're like okay we'll take that money and so they don't want to you know berkeley doesn't want to have to sit there and build out an online degree portal that has like the technology the service acquire students like berkeley doesn't know how to do any of that right so these there's a couple there's three big companies that basically go to these universities and they say hey do you want to offer an online degree we think it brings this much incremental revenue to your university and um we will run the whole thing for you so you don't have to lift a finger and uh here's the but we want you know 30 of the of the tuition revenue and uh right so what happened is all the universities said yes so there's a billion dollar company that's doing this uh that basically offers this to all the universities so there's if you go look all these you know traditional universities now have a online degree or certificate like certificate program that they offer and it's run by these other companies i forgot the name of what these companies are called there's like some generic term but i think you could be that for corporations and so um i think you could go to a corporation and say hey would you like to basically have your own you know developer boot camp or um university for you know essentially we're going to pop out people who are like management consultant types and it's good for your brand to to get students early and anytime you hire one of them we take essentially a recruiter fee and we'll run the whole thing for you and so i think that's one way you could take advantage of this trend so vayner media does this thing called three d's or i don't know what it's called something like that and um it's 10 grand and you go to their office for a day and you learn how their business operates so if you're an agency owner you get to hang out with gary vanderthook for an hour but then they also have like the head of each department for an hour and they come in and they explain how their companies run and uh you have book in a box uh you have book in a box here can you answer this actually no special guest special guest just go out can you just go out here and answer it he's just outside uh we'll we'll show who's coming in in a second but anyway um um what was i saying you were about to say book in a box oh book in a box so tucker who's on here he is thinking about doing the same thing as well where users can pay a fee and they can come in and um see how the company operates so book in a box itself is a little bit different book in a box is you want to write a book there's a book in a box we're going to help you write it promote it do the cover work all that stuff and they do this for like high profile business type of people who want to have their own book right and that business does good it's a good business yeah he bootstrapped it they have a he he was telling me he was like amazon's gonna buy us for so much money that's what like the joke that he has said so who knows and what they want to do which is different which is talking about what our idea is give you exposure inside these companies to the like leadership of these companies that it yeah like take you on corporate tours yeah because book in a box what they're famous for is uh their culture is really good like their own company culture yeah interesting and so that's and we thought about doing it as well i mean we're not big enough that we have something to offer but it's kind of a cool idea is where like i would do it for other companies i would pay money to see like if barstool did a thing where you could see how their how they operate their business i would pay money and go right and vayner media what if you guys want to research this if you want to like if you think that your company is special and um people would pay money to do it to see how big vayners is they put all their events on eventbrite and you could see which how many tickets they're selling per event and so you can actually reverse engineer this and see how much revenue it's bringing in i like it um okay i have two ideas that are um i've talked about this before i'm in a big company right now and it's my first time ever in a big 2 000 person company and so i'm seeing all this stuff that i'm like either are problems that need to be solved of a big company that i never saw before or homegrown solutions that i'm like dude that could be a standalone company this little homegrown thing we built and so i want to share uh one of each um with you on the podcast today so without further ado the first one i'll do is something that i wish i wish we had now this is a i'll call it this is kind of a far-fetched idea but personally i think this is valuable so i'm sitting in a meeting and the way meetings work at any amazon company i believe is um you have this like heavy written culture so you write a doc you write a memo before you come in and if basically says you know here's the here's what we're here to discuss here's the context here's the potential solutions here's what we believe is the recommended solution type of thing right you you write a memo that basically does a lot of the pre-work of what you would normally discuss in the meeting and the first 20 minutes of the meeting are everybody reading this thing so it's silent there's like 15 people on a long boardroom amazon and you read the memo and nobody talks and then after 15 20 minutes somebody basically says like hey is everyone done anybody need more time time and you're like no we're good to go and then probably somebody needs more time but they don't say anything and then um and then you start the discussion and the discussion the problem with meetings is you have guys like me who are like want to say stuff all the freaking time and so they just talk way more than anybody else oh wait hold on we have a guy hey how's it going we have a special guest we're recording right here dude how about it how are you say hi on the camera how's it going so we have a special guest we're recording right here so if you're listening to this you don't have video um lance armstrong just walked in as he does uh you know at certain times um and lance lance you want to pull up that chair for a minute where you want to go just come sit here for a minute all right here you can take this we're swing this around you want me to go in the middle no no go right here go right here it'll be it'll be easier actually you know what take the take the red chair i'm gonna sit on this drop the keys we did not plan this so i know neil dimpsy suckered me he said not sorry he just said you don't have to sit in here by the way either oh this is what i do so lance we were uh so we have this podcast here yep every day three days a week at this point it feels like every day right well our goal is to get to a hundred thousand daily listeners yep per episode push a button and get into that hundred thousand ear bowls right right and we're doing a good job yeah we're getting close good i bet you are you have a big big following i'm sure we have a big following and so the back story behind this podcast is and and now we're doing videos and we're chopping it up like you do with uh uh forward the forward uh the forward the forward and the move so that moves the second one you know yeah the tour one's called the move and so what what we've been doing is you may as well do video you get that'll get you that'll get you to a hundred thousand quicker it's helping a lot and so what we've been doing so sean had a company that he just sold to twitch and i've got companies and all we've been doing is scheming out loud and for some reason people love listening to it we started off with interviews it was like all right you know like a classic podcast like oh here's my guest here's what we do yeah and people like those but then me and sam just started shooting the shit and people like that way more jamming we're just like yeah we're just spitting out ideas that are pretty bad obviously usually and how long are they uh maybe an hour they've been 40 minutes hour it's been working um and we have like everyone's messaging us saying they're starting little things that we've been riffing on good and we just listen to any podcasts or you make the content don't listen uh i'd listen to a few i you know what i kind of get i do get i'll occasionally listen to rogan if it's if it's a guest that i'm interested in the whole thing or the clip no it's he goes long man three hours three hours i'm like when i did it he was like i was like so how long do you think i'll be here he's like three hours i was like what i've never talked to anybody for three hours like no i'm not talking for three hours i'm i'm not that interesting but uh yeah no so i'll get into these crime ones me too me too like i got sucked into this uh root of evil yeah that was just super up i've been listening to that one one you have the 12 hours afterwards we have to google and like follow up and be like okay i need to know even more no yeah you're trying not to and then what was the other one that was um oh it was just i do serial killers you know that one no but they're all about serial killers right no there's one called serial killers yeah and it's awesome we crashed about we work kind of crime i listen to all those ones as well wow the wondery and park has yeah um and they just one of them one of those companies just sold to uh spotify spotify yeah a couple hundred million bucks so did the ringer the ringer bill simmons just keeps making money yeah apparently i think he owned i bet you he owned the majority of that company wow so he probably walked away with a couple hundred million bucks for him um we got to get you off the lacroix have you seen the austin brand mine i just leave them here have you seen the new brand at austin waterloo what's water it's it's like a sparkling water but it's better so this is what the podcast i'm an investor full disclosure okay well this is what the podcast is no but they're crushing it they're absolutely so what is it it's a it's look what is it it's sparkling water but it's it's yeah i'm sure they do i mean it's all the rate well from the austin office it's on their their hqs on is on is on east caesar chavez as well so from from where the hustle is or at least where it's always not moved we moved into a bike shop yeah we're uh we're on east seven now okay so you guys used to be on on caesar chavez you moved up but so they're still on caesar chavez which is where our studio is but no they're just they're cool guys they're killing it you know how much did they raise they just did a new round it's like 30 they raised i want to say i'm probably getting that wrong but they did 50 million sales last year they're gonna do 100 this year holy shit no they're they're knocking yeah it's it's it's it's lighter cleaner the can has they have all these different yeah they're the ones with the cool looking cans like it's like past or uh it's like a white well they have a lot of flavors now it's probably up to 10 or 12 but it's like a retro looking can yeah it's real sort of groovy looking uh they brought in the guy that ran smart pop and sold that off and so he's the ceo so they got real austin has a lot ventures is the big who kavu ventures out of austin that's the guy from the vodka company is that the t so he clayton was was from deep eddie he did sweet leaf tea deep eddie um and then went and started kavu with two other guys he's now since left but um anyways he's still on the board at waterloo and high brew coffee which is a big advertiser of ours do you like investing it's kind of boring no i love what do you know what's wrong with it it's boring what's wrong with you what's wrong with this guy he doesn't like making money you know there's probably there's probably some charity right down the street where you could go give them all your dough from twitch and give them all your time you know investing sounds fun and the initial pitch is fun yeah but once you give them a check it gets very boring to me because uh you're so hands-off and i like it i like being a part of creating stuff dude it's like being an uncle you get all the fun stuff and not only about hard work i see we that's actually a good analogy yeah i mean we we launched a fund and we almost you know probably 90 of the companies were super involved with in what way well either through the board or being on the board or or just um they just need help i mean you know this i mean young entrepreneurs they might have a great idea and and be smart people but they're going to come across things they just need help navigating and and and or uh connecting them i mean in our i remember once i went to a pitch an investor um founders fund uh and uh founders funds like a top fund or whatever and he offered us a term sheet and i asked him i said you know uh we have this other capital source right now like self-funded by like my business partner we could just keep self-funding or we could take this i said you tell me like yeah how much value add do you guys really bring i'm ready to hear like the sales pitch and he goes honestly um the worst companies need the most help and i can't save them the best companies never need my help and so and then there's everybody else in between yeah and here if i'm giving you this term sheet i hope you're the one of those that are the good companies that i really don't have any influence in i just get to take credit in the end and i was like i dig that honesty that is true to me the best companies truly like like i've only made a couple of investments but lambda school is probably the best one it's done pretty well and you know that one i'm like a needy girlfriend you know they're like one of the hot silicon valley companies doing super well and you know i'll text the founder to be like hey what's up you want to jam on ideas you want me to help you with this problem and he's like dude i'm just busy with all this growth i hate i hate when investors ask what what i need anything and i'm like oh this is what it feels like when you're winning uh when you're really really winning and you're just too busy for any of this yeah we won't tell neil when he gets here well i what i do is i send monthly updates and they're very clear and succinct and i'm very transparent and they're like how can i help i'm like you can't unless you have ideas and you're gonna tell me how you can help do it but i don't i i can't think of anything yeah like it's like i don't know how can you help you know what i mean it's like what are you gonna come in here and write emails for me and do work for me i mean like i i don't know they're like do you need interest anyone i'm like who do you know i don't know well that's i mean i think the intro part is big in our world and so you know in health and wellness fitness nutrition i mean it's it's you know it i've been doing this for 30 years just as an athlete so i've gotten to know everybody i mean if if we make an investment these are just examples but if we make an investment in a company like amp human and they need and it'd be very obvious that they'd be connected to strava and vice versa it would take them a month to get a call i think you're different though yeah that's well thank you sam well that's your value is that's our value yeah everyone knows that you know everyone i mean you're a celebrity like you could get in touch with everyone but like if you know i'm an investor you're an investor it's like they don't know who i know yeah and i probably don't know that many people who they can't just cold email yeah do you know what i mean yeah you need it to be unique is that what your angle is going to be is that you have there's that and we call i mean we we refer to it as the flywheel just because you know now the one show the second show the move is about 15 million downloads a year and so you know once that started to really take off then i i was getting all this interesting deal flow i thought to myself we should start a fund and invest in some of these companies and and then what happens when we reintegrate or occasionally integrate some of our companies back into that audience right that core sticky group of 15 million people and so that's that's what here's neil that's what we bring to it don't get it yeah so um yeah i mean there is the connections there is the flywheel there's the audience and then we got a pretty kick-ass advisory board that we pull into whether it's you know researching deal flow or or or sitting on boards um so and we won't take up too much time this was impromptu so he said we're going to get a sandwich we already ordered you food oh yeah i already talked to neil look at that well neil texted me this morning and he's like hey can i use your guys office i go yeah we got a conference room we'll take care of food so we already have everything for you dope um can i just say like all these parking garages around here with the sign on that says open i went into like three of them the dude's like we're full i was like well why don't you turn off the sign then like you've got 10 cars in here that now all have to back up because the sign says open which garage you parking well i ended up parking right around the corner right here i hope that's the parking thing was yellow it's a rental car yep what uh type of car did you rent well hang on let's first figure out if i'm going to get a ticket so the thing was yellow i put my card in bought an hour well i'll hook it up we'll we'll make it happen no i know i i got a great garage on the street that i park in okay well it's too late now i gotta go to the airport soon but i know you really want to know what kind of car i run it yeah i they gave me a um it's like a suburban kind of thing big ass you drive a suburban anyway right i drive that at home so i i didn't mind i like i know where everything is i'm back and i can you know it's like my cockpit so let me let me run one thing by you then is neil here not yet but food's ready um so you were doing a thing so we've talked about hotels out here or i've been riffing on hotels i'm really interested in hotels yep because they're growing like the biggest hotels the top 10 they're growing at a really high clip right now because young people are are doing experiences more um you george hencappy has this thing called the domestique and uh you were doing a ride there where someone could pay a fee and hang out with you for two days well we call it a camp yeah it's probably four days of riding right and uh something that's been interesting us me and i've been bringing up is hotels that offer more experiences yeah um and so it could be as small as being filled with peloton bikes yeah which i have found myself going to more hotels just because they have a high quality gym um are you did did you see that his hotel or the domestique did it get increased bookings because of that because of that the camp that we sold yeah and well here's the yeah i mean it's an inch his hotels it's only i think 12 or 13 rooms so it's pretty easy to fill up so if we announce and he and i are doing the same thing in my orca in september but at a separate hotel but obviously um but when we announce that camp it just kind of fills up you know it would it'd be a different jam if it was a 200 room hotel um and that's his problem right he can either sell he either has one room full or two rooms or he could sell 200 rooms right 13 is a tough number i would love for that to happen and that's what i told you um i think my phone's ringing by the way i think it might be neil you can answer that he wants to come up um that's what i told you um i wrote an email to you one time i was like you need you need to become the jimmy buffett of weekend warriors right and you need to have a hotel where people could come and dude jimmy buffett i mean he's hey neil i guess i couldn't answer your call i got roped into a podcast neil you're you're being filmed right now just say hi right there the camera we'll wrap up here in a second yeah but i mean jimmy's he's branded everything whether it's blenders he's doing nursing homes now jimmy buffett is yes so i mean he's got i mean when when i talk about jimmy buffett i mean if you think about a jimmy buffett fan like a parrot head right so if it's the day of the show in dallas texas which i say that because that's my mom and stepdad go every time from the minute they wake up he's owning them right they're listening to sirius xm they're listening to his station right probably at some point pre-game they're drinking his beer the land shark beer then they then he they buy the ticket which is again his um they get to the show they're buying his swag they go back they pre-game they they like pre-game or tailgate out there they're using his margarita blender he's got everything yeah and he has a then he has the hotel he's got the and then his clothes clothes right i mean why why is lance armstrong not the jimmy buffett of weekend warriors well hotel jimmy jimmy i don't know if you paid attention the last seven right you know we're we're getting back there but oh it could happen i'm telling you yeah i like what the world that i want to live in is like i can like these ufc cannabis he's all into cannabis yeah the uh the coral reefer that's what it's called that's what it's called the coral reefer these ufc guys are kind of doing it where you could pay money and go and work out with them and live at their gym yeah layered ham layer hamilton's doing it you know i did for a sec and i did now the answer's no i just i don't know that's how you can think of it or this is not worth the sort of i just i just didn't i don't know it didn't feel right i think that's the thing right like do you want to like how much of yourself and your time do you want to spend yeah how much do you think jimmy buffett spends on that it's easy it's on your phone i wouldn't do cameo that's how you could tell which celebrities broke by how much they're how much they're so that's probably the reason i stopped you're like oh this is sam said it dude wow guys charge it right like gilbert gilbert godfroy is charging 50 dollars for two minutes left this guy's broke by the way that nice uh nice people i talked to them you know when i they were great but no but you doing well but yeah but like it is more reality tv youtubers it's like uncle joey from full house is really hurting he's only charging 50 bucks for a three-minute spot like he's he's broke i feel this is horrible whereas snoop is charging two grand he's the one who's doing good snoop charges two grand on cameo no something like that yeah i got tj lavin from was the max yeah or whatever he's the max i got tj lavin to say hi to my wife for like a hundred dollars it's a great gift i don't even know who that is he's like on the real world it's stupid but that's how you could tell who's broke is by what they charge on cameo the more they charge the more broke they are or less if they charge a little bit of money then they're really yeah and i set mine high and i it was just you know it was people aren't why would anybody pay that anyways i would pay can i i thought neil and i were gonna go have lunch oh yeah well are you eating lunch with us or you're gonna keep podcasting i'm gonna wrap up here in a few minutes yeah let's go we got food here so why don't you guys i don't want to take the seat the whole time thanks for having me we were just kidding lance i i didn't expect to do this so we were just killing time yeah well we're making no that's mine oh wait let me get up in this all right and then jack is going to be here in a few minutes too okay thank you we'll talk to you yeah and that conference room over there is all yours that was a good surprise yeah that was fun um i don't know what's going to happen with this yeah this podcast is going to be interesting it's going to either be great or not great like one or the other it's not going to be okay not going to be in between so uh okay so are you going to wrap up because if you want to wrap up we can we can either do two minutes of more stuff we can do two minutes i don't know what can you pull up the the sheet again because it's got like email on this was a crazy for those listening sean and i had this thing planned out and we were going to do a normal episode no this is great this is life happens you you take life we had lance armstrong just show up and come in come into the if lance armstrong walks into your podcast you do exactly what just happened you get the fuck up you let lance offrocks the data and you talk to lance armstrong for 10 minutes and you don't worry about anything else so if it matters i mean this is what our office is like we do get a lot of cool people coming by yeah um the guy that lance was with the gentleman you maybe just saw on camera his name is neil dempsey he won't ever tell me this i'm pretty sure neil's a billionaire and neil's one of my investors and um neil we'll have felt like a billionaire i felt that billy energy we'll have him we'll have him on the podcast sometime but basically he was in his he was trying companies and kept failing and up into his late 30s early 40s he was failing failing failing he's uh got a job at a vc and um met this guy starting a coffee shop brought to the vc everyone laughed at him they said no we're not investing this stupid so neil invested his own personal money into it and that company ended up being star starbucks and so howard schultz the ceo of starbucks says that neil's one of the people he looks up to and he's one of my investors they named um the stadium one of the stadiums at washington in washington is it washington university or university of washington they named it it's called dempsey stadium because he donated and uh so he's a big deal that's cool this is that's legit our office that's a great story um wow how to follow that okay i i i think that um we should probably kind of wrap it up and hope that there is some value in here for people yeah okay uh okay let me let me toss out uh one idea because we owe people ideas and let me toss out one good idea um which one okay i'm gonna do the i'm gonna do the one i started so i started off talking about okay these meetings are are meetings or meetings basically are like the the bread and butter of big companies and so i calculated we have on on every floor we have like i don't know 20 meeting rooms say and nine floors so let's call it 10 floors there's 200 meeting rooms and uh every hour let's assume i don't know 80 of it is occupied so i basically did the math and saw how many hours and then you think oh every meeting has on average five people in it and so you start to realize how many people hours are spent in meetings and then when you look at a meeting while it's happening there's basically no technology so the only technology in a meeting is like video conferencing typically um and i think that's kind of crazy and so i actually believe um that there's someone out there who could build a meeting a meeting kit of some kind that makes meetings more um more effective more efficient and i'm not talking about like transcribing although that's one possibility what i'm thinking about more is like the ability to give um so i'm imagining like a physical device and um you push it when you want to say something so this doesn't reward interrupters and loud voices because you sort of buzz in when you're ready to talk so it just has a little light next to your thing that says sean it sounds like you have something i would end it at the memo thing that alone is worth it well the memo doesn't require any like there's no business there right like companies just adopt that principle of the process wrong and here's why i think you're wrong is axios is coming out with this and there's another a new product called recess that just launched and all it is is a software sass it's a service you pay money and you get this internal emailing tool that helps you write internal emails better to your company and it tells you who read it and who didn't so it's more concise or what does it help yeah because axios is super concise as is yeah i think basically i think that there's a meeting tech um that will sound really boring but if you just think about how much of business happens in meetings how many hours how much salary is spent every hour in these meetings if you could make a 10 lift and how good the communication was or how well that meeting ran uh that's a big big lift and i don't think anybody's really uh doing much interesting stuff there i think people only really worry about like how do you schedule the meeting and how do you conference into the meeting there's a lot of money built running the meeting meetings and those are successful uh but i think the meeting itself could use uh some improvement anyway so uh trying to throw in an idea here but this will be known as the lance armstrong podcast yeah we'll actually get him in here in real time this i hope that people will get value from this i think we should publish this but we'll apologize that it's only i maybe yeah um and we have a ton of ideas to go through for tomorrow uh you you have a few on here that i'm like what you're curious about yeah yeah so we'll get to tomorrow tomorrow um peace out
