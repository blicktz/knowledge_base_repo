so there's this cool story that's not a yc startup although it maybe should have been um cool story where basically in portland you know right now with coronavirus everybody's getting deliveries right and so i have a friend who runs a company called farmstead and they do grocery delivery they've been doing this for you know two years now and they've all they all farmstead does is they deliver you know your staple foods milk eggs bread stuff you need repeatedly and you don't need to you know going to the grocery store every time you run out of milk kind of sucks so they just deliver to your door and so they're like a a version of instacart that's just focused on the staples okay now uh and also you know quite a key difference instacart goes to the grocery store and buys stuff and marks it up these guys are the grocery store so they just have a they buy wholesale and they sell retail so they don't mark it up they actually get good prices okay so good startup they are exploding 20x 30x oversubscribed on uh demand right now because everybody is ordering food in because of coronavirus right so everyone's getting uh to try this like delivery thing they're sort of forced to do delivery for the first time and what's it called again those guys are called farmstead oh not farm theory okay farmstead okay farmstead yeah this is my buddy's company uh he listens to the podcast sometimes so shout out if he's listening so um cool name love the name yeah great name great brand uh it looks good and the product is good so i actually i like it a lot now one problem that they're having and that every delivery company is having right now is that uh they're short on drivers they're short on delivery people they have too much demand and not enough ability to fulfill so this company in portland started hiring out of work people from the coronavirus now what what industry has been affected by this strip clubs nobody's going to strip clubs right now during coronavirus so they hired the strippers to do delivery and so they got a bunch of pr from this what's it called uh i gotta i gotta find out which company it was i don't know if it was doordash or whatever i don't even know if the company really did this or the strippers just started signing up for this that's like oh we got to make money so what are we gonna do i guess we should become you know delivery people right now for for the interim i see it i see it which what do you know which company it is that they're delivering for does it say he jokingly calls it boober eats uh so it all started as a joke with lucky devil lounge one of his clubs and no one was coming in and they go we need to do like uber for weed delivery or luber for sex lube delivery and i was like let's do boober which is topless girl picks you up and takes you to do a strip club and so anyway that's the joke is that it's uh i don't think it's real but it did get pr yeah it did get pr i i think i think i did read that they were uh like the gig workers are basically shifting from one to another right if you can't if if the demand has gone down in this area it's gone up in delivery then more people are becoming delivery drivers and uh say it was i thought that was interesting there's another one it's called meals for four inch heels meals or meals and six inch heels well i don't know if it's smart to create your own delivery company but i think uh if you're a stripper and you're out of work right now you know girls gotta eat gotta do something
