boom we're here coronavirus and all yeah the streets of san francisco are empty you could have walked down in the middle of the street and uh it would have been fine yeah and um we're in this studio and sam's just coughing up a storm which has got me concerned so allergies this may be my last podcast you don't know allergies the type of allergies that you can catch and kill you allergies so uh this is for all the students of stanford harvard syracuse that have been shut down they're at home certainly just listening to the podcast in quarantine this is for you this one goes out to you uh yeah good luck all right what do you want to talk about we got a bunch of words on the screen they all look interesting where do you want to start pick one can we talk about uh i want to do two things before we jump in yeah um are we doing a plug of jordan harbinger's podcast uh yeah but i think we want to talk to him about it right like we want him to be talking to us as the plug okay so we're going to be promoting his podcast and he will be doing it to us yeah scratch our back we scratch his back right so if you hear a plug from him go and listen to his podcast he's actually helping us a ton and the second thing is i read every review for the podcast um we have 600 reviews maybe 794 just check this morning seven so 800 let's say 800 um i they're all five stars except for like five yeah and that's cool i like reading the positive reviews and those five were from early on when you weren't even on the pod so really i take those i take those l's no there were two not five star reviews and i like listening to negative feedback and i don't like following all of it but some of it i follow the first was that the sound for the guests were bad agreed fair uh we will listen to that and the second one and i hate this i don't hate it in that it bothers me but i i just don't like i don't think it's bad feedback which is we were called bros right and i don't really care about that because what's that mean how is that supposed to be like people use that as an insult i don't understand why that's an insult yeah it's an insult uh for sure to be clear it used to not be an insult but being called a bro is an insult and um yeah i don't know is it the way we talk is it what we talk about is it are we using the wrong words i'm not not exactly sure yeah i don't take offense to that even though people mean it to be offensive um so i don't care if people say that yeah i'm not a bro i'm a lover not a fighter you know i i got multiple angles i got gears what does a bro mean uh i don't know henry what's a bro we need the get get you gotta go into the mic come on bro um definitely not a good thing especially if you're like maybe we have to replace henry with a female and then we'll get more credit for not being just a bro down no i don't care about being called a bro so then it's a compliment yeah kind of i don't know whatever i'm not trying to be liked i'm just trying to be me no well here's what i'm trying to do i'm trying to be me and i'm trying to create stuff that people want and if it's predominantly people think it's broy but they love it i'm okay with that yeah like for example i listen to the joe rogan podcast joe rogan talks about his carnival all all meat diet you know uh working out ufc fighting cage fighting uh hunting you know these are cars like these are his topics because that's what he's genuinely interested in i like talks about he talks about other things too everything else um and i like when people i like listening to stuff where people are interesting and they're interested in certain stuff and so for me the test with this podcast is would i want to listen to this and so at the end of the episode i just sort of think would i be interested in listening to that podcast and if it's appealing to me then i'm sure it's appealing to other people it's not going to be appealing to everybody for sure and then the last bit of negative feedback we got which is we focus too much on the san francisco silicon valley scene um and i'm from missouri by way of tennessee you're from everywhere including colorado i love san francisco and i hate it at the same time i'll be the first to make fun of it but also i love all types of cool shit going on throughout the country so yeah that's probably fair if it's interesting let's talk about it in fact i actually think personally i think we skew a little too far in the kind of like low-tech ideas and i think there's a lot of interesting high-tech ideas that don't require a high-tech entrepreneur for example i don't know how to code but i've started tech startups in silicon valley taking venture capital money and worked with an engineering team where i'm the only guy in the room who doesn't know anything about engineering you can do that so i actually think that there's plenty of cool stuff that we're not talking about that i'm going to be bringing more of so if you don't like the silicon valley stuff i'm sorry i'm going to try to bring more uh interesting technology uh to the table because there's a lot of it out there and i feel like we haven't been talking about it as much the way that i describe san francisco and silicon valley is to me it's kind of like hollywood but it's only only if you're trying to make like a like a big blockbuster hit right um i believe that you can make those anywhere it might be a little bit more helpful if you are physically in hollywood because you'll not because the chances are necessarily higher but because you'll be around other people who have similar wants and dreams and your baseline becomes a certain thing for sure but you can certainly make it from anywhere absolutely it's been proven um okay let's talk about some of these things um let's start with let's start with the sequoia memo okay did you read this no i avoided it on purpose nice denial the best the best approach yeah i uh we haven't raised venture capital so it's a little bit different not as applicable okay so you explain let's explain what it is so sequoia is one of the biggest venture capital firms here in silica valley they are famous for back in 2008 i want to say they released this presentation called rip good times and they basically they called an emergency meeting of all their portfolio companies they invited them to this dinner locked them in a room put this presentation up on the screen that was basically like hey the good times we've all been experiencing are about to end here's why most of you entrepreneurs you have not been a part of these cycles we've been investors through the dot-com boom and the bust and then this new boom and this was right before the sort of financial crisis of 2008 and they told them look money is about to become hard to come by um we are going to have um a giant financial crisis that will have ripple down effects to you guys to your customers to your clients to your investors and so you need to start tightening up anything you're wasting money on you need to stop wasting it anything uh if you haven't raised money if you don't have 12 months in the bank you need to go raise money right now to sort of uh be able to endure a downturn and they just released another one which is the new sequoia memo so that was 2008 now they've released a new one and they basically were like look this coronavirus stuff is a this is a once in a hundred year virus and there's this it's happened in china which is like when you shock china you shock the global supply chain and also now that travel is going to stop a whole bunch of business is going to come to a halt but stock market's going to go into a panic because we've been in a 10-year bull run and that's about to sort of end anyways so they told them the same thing change your spending habits you need to tighten up uh raise money if you if you have an offer out there take it uh don't worry about valuation just take it and get the money in the bank and um and you know you need to go into sort of survival mode you need to change gears and that's what just came out which i think is very interesting have you made any adjustments to your business not yet but i live like this anyway i'm kind of a cockroach in the first place and and i actually think that me living this way has kind of been a consequence it has been is hurt me more than it's helped me actually i think it it made it so i wouldn't spend enough money which if you have a machine that turns a dollar into more than one dollar dump the dump the truck your money truck like what ad spend or what do you mean yeah i mean look if you have a funnel where you or a product where if you just spend more on marketing or spend more on engineers or spend more on content creators and it turns that new customer into more than what you acquired them for right then if anyone had a little machine that turned one dollar into one dollar one penny the name of the game is throw as much money on into that machine as you possibly can as fast as you can and i've had those machines and i didn't capitalize on it and so i've lived this way all the time and i think it's actually hurt me a lot but in times like these bring it on yeah you don't need to adjust we haven't changed how we've done things just because we're always tight yeah and your company's in a good position like just now before this we were looking at a company's um p&l and it was like cash in the bank 220 grand or something like that it's like dude you're a couple months away from insolvency you know if that was the case um whereas you guys are in a much better position yes um i do i am i do have a little fear i don't know how i feel about this corona thing when it means what it means for business i do think that i am on the side of um i think it's bad but i don't think it will be as bad as i think or as i originally thought right i guess i just have faith i have a lot of uh blind faith that it will work out which so i've been on the other side of the so so when we were doing our idea lab uh i worked with this guy michael birch michael birch was is known as if you just google he's like one of the top growth guys in the world he sort of was doing and invented viral marketing before viral marketing was a word uh he did it because he didn't have money back in the day so he built one of the first address book importers where uh for this company called birthday alarm he had he was like and i think he did it before that at um rick marini's company i forget what that was called birthday was before that so so birthday was the first one where he was like hey i want people to send this to their friends what if i just imported all the addresses from their hotmail and then i made it easy push this button to send it and he's like he literally told me at his house he was like i thought that 10 days later like i thought there's no way they let this go for more than 10 days and he's like it's now been 15 years and this thing still works and he's like um so he was working on viral marketing because he just didn't have a budget so he's like i gotta use my customers to get me more customers and to explain that you didn't explain it totally clear but someone signs up for your thing it says do you want to invite your friends here's your gmail contacts click select all and send an email to all of them and so in this case for birthday alarm it was i make a calendar where i'm and i'll invite you i'll say hey sam can you add your birthday to my calendar i don't want to forget your birthday this is before facebook existed by the way and so you would add your birthday to my calendar and they would say hey sam don't you want to remember sean's birthday that'd be nice like reciprocate and you'd be like yeah sure and then it would say hey sam you got one birthday on the calendar but you surely got more friends than one so why don't you invite some other friends here let me make it easy for you would you like to import all your friends from hotmail and you're like yes and then and he added one thing at a time to make it more viral so he he would add um a pre-filled message because he's like oh there people are stopping because they can't think of what to say right so here's a pre-filled message i know works and then i'll just say send and so then uh he got this thing super viral so you know birthday alarm grew to 50 million members with zero paid marketing 50 million and um and then he's done this again and again since then with his social network bebo and others so when i worked with them the name of the game was viral growth and so we did a charity campaign they're trying to raise money for charity water well we made a story a website that was just telling a story of this boy jean bosco with no water and then we said can we get this to go viral and so we did the same thing import import emails get people to send the story to their friends and raise money for the cause and we got it to go viral so i've literally been it where like nothing nothing nothing you'd come into work nothing no growth no growth no growth and you would just tweak the right thing and then all of a sudden that you know between overnight something would have doubled and the next morning it doubled again next morning doubled again and i remember it just going from zero to five million people uh signing up for this charity thing within like you know two weeks it was insane and so i've seen viral growth and how counterintuitive it is like you don't think you know well yesterday we had four thousand people so today we're gonna have i don't know five thousand six thousand it's like no you're gonna have sixteen thousand then you have thirty two thousand and it's gonna you know it's gonna go up to the millions within a few days and so i've seen viral growth when you're talking about it in the good sense from a product perspective now it's viral growth of an actual fucking virus and so uh and you could see actually in the u.s somebody did a great graph where they mapped italy where everything's on lockdown because italy has started spreading like crazy and they showed italy day one u.s day one italy day two u.s day two number of cases and the bar graphs are like identical and the thing is we're just in like whatever day six and you can see by day 21 where this thing gets to if you don't like lock everything down right away so i am very fearful because i've seen viral growth i've seen viral spread and i know that it doesn't work the way it breaks our brains our brains think things go linearly but this goes exponentially and it's really hard to just comprehend an exponential spread and to take the story a different way than coronavirus which is that stuff that you're describing that michael birch thing you can actually still get all these cool plugins that auto uh automatically like allow people to share a pre-populated message to all their gmail contacts we used it and people still share yeah and the the math works out where you know um because you would think i would never do that i wouldn't email all my contacts we had a lot of people doing it but people do it and what happens is you know one percent or less will do it but you look at the math one percent of people do it on an average they have 326 contacts so for every hundred people that come in you get 326 people blasted out it doesn't work as good as that time because the email open rates are much higher than yeah but now people are like oh i don't know i never talked to sam so if he's sending me this this is junk this is spam uh now people filter it but in certain countries it works like we were growing like we could do this like clockwork in india in india people still open it like they did in the u.s 10 years ago and they forward even higher rates they don't care they'll forward everything to everybody and so india turkey all these little countries where we would see this crazy growth that you couldn't get in the u.s and or uk anymore they kind of suck because the monetary value ends up you know the value per user is lower there but it does still feel good to get like and it definitely works and people are shocked by that yeah we did one through sms i remember and over the weekend it went viral and like you know during the week monday through friday everything looks fine is growing but like not at a crazy pace we didn't realize the viral coefficient was two and so over the weekend it took off um and started compounding on a big number and we racked up 120 000 and sms 120 000 bill in sms's holy crap going through um uh kazakhstan i was like we didn't even know we're growing we're gonna grow in kazakhstan and it went crazy and turns out texting in kazakhstan super expensive and so 120 000 in two days we had to pay out that's crazy it sucked well i need it we need the texting stuff um which we haven't uh you want to talk about zumper okay you want to scroll up four or down or whatever you want to okay okay zumper i think it's zumper.com um what did they just raised uh was it 40 million dollars today at a 400 million dollar valuation total they've raised 150 million dollars in valuation uh it's a cool it's a cool service if you're a consumer how does it work yeah so go on ever use zumper if you're trying to find an apartment you'll probably run into zumper because you're like it's a search engine to find apartments to rent yeah and typically for these new guys san francisco isn't the major market it's typically uh more middle of them more places where they have high-rise buildings which we don't have a lot here but basically if you google chicago apartments or moving to chicago or something like that zumper or apartmentless mile the place where i used to work or a bunch of other things like that will come up and it'll be like here's 843 apartments available in chicago click here to get information and submit your information okay great here's how they work which a lot of people have no idea how they work henry i'm going to explain to you how they work and you tell me if you've ever heard this okay so they're lead gen companies you know what a lead gen company is okay the way it works is uh and a lot of people are shocked by this and it's actually way easier to start than most people would realize so the way it works is there's i don't know how many there are who do this but i know that there are for sure four or five that do this that are big names and so just in the apartment space just in the apartment space so there's apartments.com i believe there's rent.com and there's maybe two others that are quite large and then there's dozens that you don't even realize exist you'd have to google them and find them but what they do is they work with all the big apartment buildings so uh there's gray star which has probably millions of apartments then there's um co-star which has a bunch and then there's um every apartment building that you have world star world what are the other ones gray star and then there's um avalon avalon bay i think they're called there's a bunch of them and they have millions of units and what they do is they go to red.com and they go uh or apartments.com and they go for every person who signs a lease with us or who calls our our phone we're going to give you a hundred bucks and so what zumper can do or probably how they started out or what anyone can do is they go hey apartments.com you guys are getting a hundred dollars per call will you give us ten dollars per email we give you of people who are qualified leads so what zumper uh did i imagine they did this when they launched and i'll explain why i say when they launched is what they did was they go to these places and they go all right give us a cut of the revenue per email and so the math works out that if we send you five emails basically people who said here's my email address here's my phone number i'm interested in a two bedroom at this particular building uh apartments will will be like all right we'll give you ten dollars for that because we're pretty confident that for every five of these we collect one of them will become a lead and so now we make 50 bucks in profit and so what zumper does is they create a different funnel where uh they learn how to rank really high on moving to chicago find an apartment or they are able to have really good facebook ads and they get all these leads and that's what their margin is and so the margins for these businesses i know this firsthand could be 60 to 70 gross margin which means um let's see what's the map behind that million bucks comes through the door you paid you know 250k on search engine marketing yeah but you know the rest is because there's no cogs there's no there's no physical product you're selling so you have a very high margin product 67 margin plus whatever content staff you have internally that's your other cost so it's just a lead gen company yeah and the interesting thing i've known a lot of people who have these lead gen companies i knew a guy who had a lead gen company for swimming pools so if you wanted to buy a swing swimming pool you'd google by um swimming pool repairman or uh indoor ground pool indoor uh in ground pool set up california right or something like that he's number one and he would he would be number one you submit your information and he would sell it to these people who go and service who actually do the thing who actually do the work you're a middleman when you're now there's pros and cons to this business the first pro is you could set these up really cheaply and you could start making cash flow very quick like if you were able to spend one month just building this site and creating the relationship with this person you could next day go out and start making cash so long as you were profitably acquire a customer right so that's great the second great thing is you could do this for most anything the best way i think to figure out how to do this is you figure out what has the largest total market size with also the largest possible cost per lead um with also the least amount of competition and you do like a a grid yeah like a grid and so for example i've been bullish on truck drivers um the reason why is i think that there's a whole lot of truck drivers in america the average truck driver makes a good salary let's say fifty thousand dollars a year therefore recruiters would be willing to pay like a hundred bucks per lead so i was like can i send leads there or you could do it for uh local services so i need a uh landscaper or i need irrigation work done at my home right my home and someone will buy those leads for i don't know 50 bucks so you can do this for anything right you just have to optimize for what so my father-in-law is in the senior living business he owns a couple of facilities and the biggest thing for them like his business looks great when he has high occupancy rates and it looks terrible if he gets high vacancy so low occupancy and um so there's companies out there that do this for seniors if you start googling like you know you know um memory care and alameda california there's a company that will pop up right in the top of search and say hey we've reviewed the top 15 um you know facilities here and come read about them or hey are you looking for this talk to our consultant just put in your email address here and we'll help you get land in a spot and so then they'll pay these lead gen services a high amount because you know somebody who goes into a senior senior facility they're paying eight thousand dollars per month and they're usually there till end of life and so you get you know that very high lifetime value of that customer so you're willing to pay a thousand dollars per qualified lead who's looking in your area i don't know if it's that exact number but high price and i have firsthand knowledge i know someone personally and i know the financials of a senior home living or senior living lead gen business it made hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in revenue and a very good profit i know someone who did it for rent to own properties i know people who have done it for like i said swimming pools i know people who have done it for apartments i know a guy who did it for local home services and did about 60 to 70 million dollars a year in sales right and so that's the name of the game i also know people who have done it for jobs jobs is another good one now like rig up has done this they've raised money at two or three billion dollar valuation and they've done it for oil workers and the way the math works is there's actually way more oil workers in america than you think hundreds of thousands or can be hundreds of thousands um and those oil workers uh the barrier to entry is relatively low you don't have to have uh like a master's degree in something so anyone can do it or a lot of people can do it and the salary is quite high 100 grand a year in some cases so they're willing to spend a lot of money and so it's a really interesting company or a business rather and a lot of people don't know that's how it works now here's the downside the downside is lead gen companies can be very transactional which means as a business you only capture value and make money the more leads you're coming in through there and often that means you only make money when you're spending money a lot of times you uh they suck at building brands so like i said you could spend something up really fast that means it can likely go away just as fast because let's say that um like if you create a url that's like home uh senior home living california.com that is not like maybe maybe someone's just going to google that and they're going to see it one time they don't think of you yeah and then they're going to get there and they're done they're never going to think about you ever again and you have to pay for them again and so if you want more customers you got to pay again right and so that's quite hard so if you can build a brand around it then that's where it's really interesting and the second thing is that you are dependent on the person buying the lead so in my case i worked for a person who was doing lead gen and they go all right there's a cap on this like we can only make a certain amount of money giving leads the way that we become a huge business is we get we make a relationship directly with the apartment buildings and um go straight there go straight to them now the reason why that sucked is because the person buying the leads was like oh you're our competition now right you're out and they cut it off and their revenue goes away immediately right and so what thumbtack did i like thumbtack what they've done is they've built a direct relationship with the people so if you google san francisco wedding photographer and you see a wedding um photographer on thumbtack they've built that relationship with them and thumb and that wedding photographer will pay thumbtack directly for a lead that's great because there's no middleman to cut out now the downside with that is it costs a ton of money to do this is like a really big problem to build a marketplace um and so you likely have to raise money or figure out some scrappy way to get it done right but uh that's my rant on zumpr and the big version of these if you take it to its absolute max is like expedia or booking.com yeah right so what they're doing is they're saying okay cool you want to book a flight i will become the best at ranking for how to search for flights find a good flight here's some recommended trips and then we just the airlines pay us a commission an affiliate fee for every lead we're sending them and that is a notoriously difficult niche yeah they've done well but they're hyper competitive and they're you know um it's always contentious um and then uh hotels is another one that's quite challenging if i wanted to make money really fast i would find a relatively boring one like trucking jobs which i find interesting but most people do not so they will not enter that but flights and travel is a lot sexier and so it can be a lot harder i'll give you another niche one um i have a friend who created this business called apply board and what he was doing was uh international students people you know i went to high school in china and when i when i was graduating in china everybody wanted to come to the u.s to study everyone wants to come to u.s colleges so internationally india china indonesia malaysia the best students all want to come to the u.s if they can so they want to come to the u.s but they don't know where the hell to start they don't know what the schools are they don't know how to apply they don't know how to translate their their scoring on all these like you know aptitude test in malaysia to like what the u.s schools want etc so there's a barrier there and the u.s schools love foreign students because they pay more like i think a foreign student who international student who's going to school at berkeley will pay double the tuition as a local student not just an in-state student like a u.s out-of-state student versus international the international student pays double and uh alan that was you uh you paid double no i paid more than double so i went to school in Australia i think the average uh for a semester like five to six thousand for like a local student i paid like 45 okay so all right great so so you paid like nine times as much um going to go to school that's insane so basically what he was doing so he went to colleges and and you have all these small colleges that just need applicants because they don't have a brand name so yeah a lot of stanford and harvard they don't really care because they're getting so many applicants anyways doesn't matter but like san jose state you know they were like hey we will pay you a thousand dollars per admitted student three thousand dollars per admitted student so he was getting three grand per admission uh in contract with all these different schools and then he just had to do lead gen on the other side for students who want to go to school in america which was actually a big market of people who were searching for what happened to it uh he's still going i don't know i haven't checked in with them lately but hope you're doing good martin i hope you're doing all right i used to work at university and i remember getting an email one time that they're describing strategy for the year and how they're trying to pivot away from attacking so many international students and that was they couldn't do it because that was just making a strategy and they were making so much money for international students they couldn't stay as well as they didn't fund it so if you go to campus right now it's literally just like international students yeah i went to university of sydney as well for a little while it was it was crazy we should we should actually talk about that uh on another time because that's an there's an interesting thing there but to uh get back to the lead thing to wrap this up there's actually a lot and this is way bigger than people think and one of the biggest ones is credit cards credit karma i don't know what they do in revenue but they just sold for eight billion dollars i bet they did one i bet they did a billion in sales and what their hook was we're going to get you to sign up for a report a credit a free credit report and we're going to recommend credit cards for you use and they'll make a hundred dollars per credit card affiliate we get you they get now think about credit cards huge market huge referral fees very competitive nerd wallet does the same thing uh they're they bootstrapped i think i don't know multi-hundred million yeah i mean but i think they bootstrapped to like 50 or 60 million in sales then raised money so it's quite good now here's another company and here's one more interesting thing you know the penny hoarder no i don't actually i don't know why you guys heard of the penny hoarder the penny hoarder.com kyle spoke at hustlecon he's a cool guy he he was a great success story still is but he uh started the penny hoarder and what it did was he would write about when he was poor he didn't have any money he would say i didn't have any money i was i was trying to pay my bills and so i would do things like drive uber or i would uh do coupon clipping and he would blog about it and anytime someone saw an article that he wrote about driving for uber he would make two grand per uber driver and so he was like oh this is cool i should i'm gonna blog about all the ways in which i can save money or make extra money and so he did that like through uh like there's websites where you can fill out surveys and make dollars and make a few bucks and he would blog about it and mostly middle america moms would see and be like that's great i'll make money on the side and i'll sign up and he would get an affiliate fee and he scaled this thing from zero to 60 million in sales completely bootstrapped in like six years i love this and but here's the problem there's this other company called fluent media fluent i think it's called fluent fluent is a publicly traded company and they are performance marketers which means they do what i'm describing but across tons of niches so someone will say like direct tv will come to them and be like hey uh we'll give you 80 for every customer you send us and they go great and they spin up these landing pages and fluent media does this with trucking as well they do a bunch of stuff it's a big business publicly traded they saw kyle's website and how much he was killing it because he talked about it a lot for pr which i mean it's good and bad good and bad and they just and they they ripped them off completely they created like the dollar saver or like something like very similar like the penny hoarder they just copied the website copied the articles and then they threw it on facebook and they drove traffic to an article that said here are the 100 best ways to save money and they did the math so they could get a click for a penny or they could get a click for a dime and each person who came they would make 20 cents because that's the conversion rate of which people would sign up and so kyle at penny holder this is all public you can google it sued them and what they found out was fluent media according to the lawsuit hired one of the penny holders employees and they said yeah here's how we did it and so they just spun this up and it made a ton of money right off the bat yeah and so these are the pros did he win the suit uh i think it's ongoing it's ongoing but uh for kyle but this is why this is interesting um because i and the penny holder amongst its crew amongst its audience i think has a great brand and um yeah and nerd wall actually at this point has a great brand at first nerd wall was simply a you're just going to google our master you're just going to google best credit card and we're going to show up one and you're not never going to remember us but at this point they're doing all this advertising and commercials and people like turn to the nerds like it's working that's a commercial so really interesting business model i like lead gen um but a lot of people didn't realize how that worked henry was that interesting did you learn how it worked that was great yeah uh all right i got another one for you um manzil so this is cool this is one of my favorite reasons to do the podcast is that interesting people just reach out and tell me about their business so uh manzil is uh this so this guy sam reached out he listens to the podcast what's his last name sam malaco something like that tweeting at me too and um so he was like hey i got this business you know would love some help with it um or just would love to chat and so i said okay let's let's chat so i get on the phone and i end up blown away by what these guys are doing so they teach me about something i've never heard of and is now very finance very very uh fascinating to me so what they do is manzil does islamic financing oh we talked about what's that mean we talked about not on the podcast but we talked about it offline because i was pretty interested in it so um henry do you know what islamic financing is if you didn't know legion i don't think you'll know this one so are you are you muslim i'm not i'm hindu well i'm neither but like my my family is hindu um so i didn't know about this but basically in the muslim faith there's um actually uh sort of the advice is against um traditional loans so uh interest which is known as like riba i think in the in in their faith is uh frowned upon in these so a traditional mortgage where you go to the bank you have your down payment you take out a loan and you're paying interest is actually not compliant with um with their with their faith and their law and which is actually common in a lot of other different religions is that true yeah so i'm catholic christian and uh i was raised that way and there's definitely rules regarding handling money and interest and things like that yeah and i think the the fundamental basis i'm going to kind of butcher this so i apologize but i'll i'm just trying to explain as best as i understand it uh so so apparently uh you know money uh sort of fiat currency which is just not uh pegged in anything it's just a made-up concept uh the the belief system is that money has no value inherent value in itself and so you should not be charged interest for borrowing money which is this sort of abstract concept so they have loans or they have uh sort of agreements which can work as long as both sides are taking shared risk and um getting sort of shared shared upside shared return in some way um so there's their sam islamic i believe so yeah and his partner muhammad is also and so they were explaining to me that hey there's this big thing called islamic financing and there's these islamic challenger banks and so if you ever heard the word challenger bank uh check this out it's pretty pretty cool we know that banking's been around forever these big bank brands that are you know in every country there's there's big banks that are worth billions of dollars and recently over the last let's say five to seven years there's these things called challenger banks or neo banks they're called and so in brazil there's a bank called new bank and you bank and new bank is worth 10 billion dollars it's one of the most valuable startups in brazil in uh the uk there's challenger banks oh my god i'm gonna forget the name but challenger just means a new one it's a startup bank yeah and they're they offer different things so what these guys did was better digital access so mobile apps uh quicker ability to get sort of credit cards and debit cards spun up um and so there's you know there's a couple of them that are huge now um a few different multi-billion dollar startups done this what these guys have done is they've done this for a faith-based uh bank which is basically saying there's a set of customers out there in this case muslims who are not being served well by the generic banks and we can make a bank that serves them better and the way we're going to do it is you want to take a mortgage out you can either take a sort of a mortgage out a traditional mortgage which is not compliant or you can take one out that's compliant with your faith we've come up with a mechanism that is blessed by sort of the the village elders you know the sort of leaders in the in the community uh that says yes this is you know i think sharnia law is what it's called it's compliant with sharnia law and then on the other side this is um this will this works as a mortgage you can actually buy your home and so these guys have this have this concept and in other countries this is apparently really big so in africa indonesia places where the muslim population is the dominant population they've already solved this problem but in places like u.s canada where it's just a minority of the population is is muslim they don't have these banks yet so i love this startup idea because how are they doing so how they're doing so they've they spent a lot of time making sure that they can actually get it to be compliant and actually get the financial mechanism to work that took them a while over a year maybe two years now they've gotten that to work and they have uh basically they have two sides of a marketplace on one side they have people who are investors because you know if you're going to issue mortgages their average mortgage is like five hundred thousand dollars so it takes a lot of capital to start this business they don't want to be the one they don't want to go raise a billion dollars and then start issuing these loans they want on one side to have investors who uh will put in the capital to fund these loans and on the other side they want to have the borroweres who are trying to buy a home who can pull from this pool of you know sort of halal financing you know this uh this financing that's compliant and so they have 10 million dollars committed on the on the investor side 1.2 million in their bank 10 million total and then um and they're just every week they're trying to close more of those checks i think which is a small amount but this is like just inbound interest this is not like they haven't really done anything yet but 10 million will let you let you do if you just do half a million dollar loans that means they can do whatever 20 mortgages um right now and every mortgage has a certain value so it's about worth about i don't know 20k a year to them is that mortgage just in their fee that they get on top of it um and so and on the other side they have all these applicants i think you know about a thousand applicants and these are what they call super prime applicants because these are people who are doctors lawyers they have good jobs they they have the money they have the means to to afford their homes they're just looking for a solution that doesn't force them to compromise their faith so i really like this business there's a working model in the uk there's a working model in um in africa there's working model in indisia there's nothing in canada where these guys are and there's nothing really in the us uh where how many muslims do you think there are in america i think there's look this up i think there's like a couple million only two two million i want to say roughly um that's pretty interesting i like that i think that there's a bunch of a weird rules around banking i mean they're not weird they should be there but um and so starting a starting a bank i think is it's almost nearly impossible it's very difficult so what all the neobanks do all the charter banks do not real banks they're not real banks they sit on top of bbva or they sit on top of these other banks and they're just the applicant they're the consumer facing layer but the banking happens with their underlying partner and it's sort of like the lead gen model that you're talking about they go to these banks say hey i can get you a whole bunch more customers i'm going to spend all the money doing the marketing they'll be banking with you but we own this sort of relationship yeah and that's actually pretty common i use this thing my debit card is simple here right i've heard of it yeah um this is my debit card it's pretty cool i like it because the customer service i can just text and they're like easy these like young guys in portland and they they're easy to chat with and they answer 24 hours a day they were acquired for 100 million dollars and i was like this is like a freaking bank that's it yeah and i did not a bank yeah and it was what's it called bbva yeah that's who they use bbva compass i think it's exactly they're under there and there's a few that are underneath all these now the very first there's now one of the challenger banks got their very first banking charter banking license which is very rare i forgot their name but they just announced a couple weeks ago last two weeks that so the so now it's very interesting now once that seal broke because it was so hard to apply for this yeah i think and they all want it robin hood wants their license brex wants their license it's just very hard for them to get this i think you need five percent or what's the number i think you need 10 in reserve yeah you need a certain amount of reserve that's not even the problem it's just that there's no incentive for the government to give these out they're like ah you you kind of highfalutin you know tech startups do i really want to give this to you you've only been around for so long i don't know if i have the trust in you so now the seal is broken the first one got it we'll see what what that means um but what i like about these guys is they're not a bank they're not taking your deposits they're just doing loan issuance so on one side they have the reserve cap the investment fund but they're using other people's money opm on one side yeah other people's money to make the loans and they're the broker and they take one to two percent of the transaction fee and people are willing to pay a premium to have halal financing just like people willing to pay a premium for halal meat or for vegan or kosher meat you know whatever like right people are willing to pay a premium for things that are compliant with their faith i think this could be big and you know what's interesting i think that they've had a hard time raising money from traditional vcs because this is they didn't understand hard to understand yeah you have to like you know most vcs are old white guys and you know it's uh the sort of cliche and you know i know they do look into it but i think that there's not there's the natural challenges of any high aspiration startup they have those they have the problems that any any startup that's really ambitious but then they also have the problem of like first they need to educate you about this problem like you saw how i stumbled through this explanation and i talked to these guys for an hour you know and that's where i am after an hour of really trying to understand it but you and you read this by fur con your your best so i ran yeah i ran it by him i introduced them yesterday i said hey furcon understands this he's muslim he's an investor he's a technologist and he's an entrepreneur if he doesn't like this i don't like this and what did he say and so he so he's like i've looked into this he's like a lot of my friends really wanted this i tried to look at what options are available in the us they suck they're really super high premiums is he practicing um yeah like you know to an extent like what i want to know is do really like like he doesn't pray five times a day but he doesn't eat pork right so he's like culturally he drinks but like his dad runs the mosque in san jose and you know like it's it's so even people who are like culture who aren't incredibly devout are into this if he had the option he would prefer halal financing over not if it was convenient and he's like the problem with all the existing options they're not convenient they're not easy to use and they're very high premiums he's like if these guys did it conveniently i think this could be baked so he's going to talk to them we'll see like i'm i'm not a practicing cat anymore are you are you guys catholic you're catholic for sure right do you eat meat on friday on lent me too i went to an all boys catholic high school i don't practice anymore but that's another thing i don't eat meat during lent on friday so i try not to so it's kind of it sounds like that's what it's kind of like where it's like people it's a spectrum it's a you prefer it but not yeah you prefer it especially if it's convenient for you you you you know the way henry just said that a lot of guilt there like yeah i should but i don't so there's you know if you can make it where people do what they want to do without lifting a finger then they'll do it you know it's great that's pretty cool i like that i like that thing or i like that angle of finding because i don't know anything about muslim culture i don't know anything about hindu culture which is you where you're from you i don't know you probably don't know too much about catholic yeah it's kind of an interesting way to like look at how other religions do things um right another thing that we should talk about not today because i don't think we know what we're talking about we definitely don't yet is building things on top of banks i think that's super interesting what do you mean by that so like what simple did and like what what's the name of this company manzel man spell it m-a-n-z-i-l manzel okay kind of like what manslow did a building a building a front end on top of someone else's back end right which is the bank um i think that that's really interesting simple.com is my uh card i didn't know they did this at first this is kind of what drop shipping is so where you build the layer that says i'm going to get the customer to a landing page and they buy yep but it's just going to place an order with this other manufacturer and they'll ship it directly to them super effective i like that with banks because um like simple they did this it's all i mean it's it's a little different the card is all white and it's a branding like looking yeah um and their app is really good and so it's kind of interesting i i think this is kind of what brex is doing right totally what credit card they're layered on top of mastercard um i i love these things i i really like that um let's talk about uh how how many minutes are we in uh we're we're about an hour in okay you want to we can um answer some questions or what do you want to do uh let's do one of these fun ones so let's do the rebranding words so this was in the hustle hustle trends the trends hustle facebook group which is like a source for for entertainment and gold which go to trends.co and sign up and if you use the phrase million million you'll get 50 trends.co slash million i believe that's it is it is it slash million or it's a promo code both both will work that's echo slash million or trends.co and you guys have this thing where you can sign up for a dollar which is pretty dope yeah and it's working great i love it i love it um okay so so so somebody in the group uh can you scroll up i don't remember if i have their name i i should have their name to uh your other up yeah there you go okay we don't have the name uh we should we should find alan will you find the name of the guy who wrote this because i want to give him credit um so somebody was just talking about like hey isn't it funny how people just rebrand stuff and like give it a whole new meaning so he's talking about uh msg he's like oh msg which was like got this really bad reputation for being this food additive whatever and just rebranded as umami and now it's this like foodie word that like is good and somebody came into the the comments with like a bunch of really funny ones you want to know another food one aioli aioli mayonnaise it only is mayonnaise it has a little garlic flavoring look it up look it up aioli is flavored mayonnaise look up aioli versus google is aioli mayonnaise i'm telling you aioli is mayonnaise but there's like way more you have to do it in a separate tab yeah you can't you can't do this because we have to over here right there what's the answer say it says it right there what's the top result what's it say is aioli any different than mayonnaise am i off all right henry wins okay it's not it's not exactly mayo but i like the intent all right so let's go back to the doc yeah that's awesome yeah i love it so so this guy had a bunch of them for business which i like so or nerds um you know when you skip you know i i don't know i'm like this i skipped breakfast for years because i'm just lazy it didn't wake up early enough um and now it's intermittent fasting it's like this health trend it's like oh i'm fasting till noon it's like yeah you skip breakfast okay marlin uh marlin was the original post and then who posted all these comments in it so logan jeffrey logan had a bunch of them that were fire that i like that's the reason i put it on here okay so uh when you just quit your job because you want to travel now that's called dispersed retirement which i like um when you're a grossly underemployed writer or marketer now you're a digital nomad because you have to go live in some low-cost area or a coach um when you just like to eat beef and cheese because it's delicious and now that's called the carnivore diet or keto i used to call the salami and cheese uh redneck charcuterie um sleeping around online dating i don't agree with all these i'm just i'm i'm relaying logan's good ones um when you quit your shitty business idea that was bad all along and everyone told you it was bad it's called pivoting i like that um failing fast when you have a fear of commitment and therefore do not own anything and do not settle down you're now practicing minimalism i love that uh so these are great and uh in general you know funny shit aside um i think there's a lot of power to this i think as a leader you often have to rebrand stuff so that it's more palatable to your team um and or to your customers packaging yeah you have to frame things package them up in a certain way we did this with our sushi restaurant where we realized that if we just described things better or differently with with with better words um people would buy more and we could charge more because people wanted to have sushi that was more sophisticated so when we called it you know whatever um you know atlantic salmon with a blah blah rather than just saying salmon that was better or if we would create a whole new word all together and put a little trademark next to it that was even better than uh using common words every once in a while i like there's certain things that they use the positive phrase and just generally accept it i like to use like a word that means the same thing but it's generally regarded as negative just to with people so for example instead of saying like well we're gonna um get the customer to do this like we're gonna get them to buy by doing this or we're gonna influence them by doing this i like to use the word manipulate so like yeah let's manipulate them and get them to do this like like where's that by definition work right just uh just to kind of throw what happens if we call it what it is yeah let's just say so we're gonna manipulate them like i'm gonna manipulate this person to liking me they're like well how are you gonna do that well i'm just gonna be nice and charming and be listen to what they say but if you use that word manipulate instead of influence it fucks with them and i love using that just to screw with people like yeah or like um when political people say like well they have an agenda i'd be like yeah well so look guys i'm here to talk to you about my agenda which is to do like right of course i have an agenda i'm trying to get you to do stuff uh i'm like yeah you're you're targeting like someone has a political agenda duh they should right yeah they should have a political agenda i love using those words so henry if you scroll up for a second so all right that's the end of this
