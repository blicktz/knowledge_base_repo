Silk Road and it sold two billion dollars worth of merchandise in only two years. Okay so in 2014 my years maybe off in 2014 I think or 13 or 12 I went to a party and I met this guy there named Ross and he was pretty good looking and tall so he definitely kind of stood out because it was all nerds and we just started talking and I was flirting with this girl and he swoops in and takes her home and I was like Ross I started talking to him and friend him online and whatever and what I do when you win well I wasn't angry at him because I was like damn he was pretty charming whatever became friends with him he turns out he lived he lived on the street from me well a few months later I walk home and I walk by the library that I live next door to and there's all this police there and I go home and find out what happened and I had heard of this thing called the Silk Road I'd heard about this I knew about this for a couple about a year or two and I go home and I look up what happened they go Ross got it Ross Albright was arrested and for being the founder of Silk Road and I was like explain Silk Road if you don't know what it is so Silk Road it's a it was like eBay but for drugs and murder and you could buy anything online and use Silk Road and it sold two billion dollars worth of merchandise in only two years and Ross was the sole owner and now if we look at Bitcoin price he had roughly 10 billion dollars in Bitcoin that he had made and it got seized or he has it he's in jail what happened so what happened was he was at his library or at the library next door to my house the Glen Park library and he was upstairs on the computer doing deals or whatever run the business and the feds had been tracking him and he tried to kill like he hired he did a couple hired hits where he tried to get someone killed and but the person on the other end was an FBI agent so they went and staged the murders and he did that multiple times so he thought he had killed three or four guys right and uh when I got home I looked it up I was like holy shit that's Ross I know Ross he was this guy the whole time and so you had hung out with him before yeah and what was your cool guy did he say what did you ask what do you do just like just like just a guy just a charming like did you know he ran I looked him up on LinkedIn he said he was a equities trader or like a bank like some technically true yeah and um like I had friends on Facebook and he was like uh hey everyone I'm selling my truck for two thousand dollars I mean when he had tens of millions of dollars of Bitcoin and uh I go to my office the next day I go I talk to this guy named Billy I go Billy did you hear about this Ross guy this Silk Road thing and Billy his father was uh Tim Draper right and I go Billy this thing your dad has talked about this Bitcoin thing and he goes yeah I saw that that guy get arrested he's buying a lot of it and I was like should I and he goes yeah and I was like well I don't know anything about this Bitcoin thing so I but if your your dad says to do it sounds good to me so I went and bought a little bit of it and then for each family member that year in 2000 I think it's 2013 I bought like 200 of Bitcoin for each family member as their present and they all laughed at me and then a few years ago when I got the twenty thousand dollars that each made like five grand right and uh that was how I heard about Bitcoin that's amazing and so so Tim Draper ended up buying all the seized Bitcoin I think it was like 20 million dollars worth of Bitcoin I think it was more than that dude I think it was like in the hundreds I think it was like 200 million dollars of Bitcoin or something I don't remember I think I think his initial purchase at the time was 20 million and it ballooned to billions I see okay and he bought it from the government and he bought it like at a discount essentially to the market right I think he paid 20 million but this is all public um and is how I found out about Bitcoin
