selling ugly produce to restaurants in india yes is that a yc thing it's a yc company yes okay and that's a company in america and what's it called no no it's it's in india so it's farm theory oh there is also one here yeah yeah uh there's a there's like a farm to table box i think that's the ugly produce thing in america i forgot what it's called me too i just googled it foods yeah imperfect food so i'll give you the stats on these guys so um so they're doing 22 000 a month uh of mr they um say 40 profit margins they say they're growing 65 week on week which doesn't mean anything because it's yc but they're on track to get to a million dollars arr in the coming months what they're doing is interesting they're taking um farming is huge in india so they're saying okay there's tons of farming there's tons of produce produced there's tons that's not going to get sold because it looks ugly it's not good for consumer retail but we could buy that stuff for cheap because it's just waste otherwise we can sell it to restaurants who don't care about the aesthetic look of the you know they're not picking like a consumer does in the grocery store where they pick a you know the best looking one out of a barrel uh the restaurants don't care they're chopping it up processing it turning into food if they can get lower food costs fantastic and so they're looking at um you know right now it's 720 a month just for the restaurants in bangalore which is a part of india and uh they're they believe it's a big market they claim a 500 million market just in bangalore uh just to the restaurants that are there sounds a little high to me but um the the value prop makes sense the restaurant saves about 30 by buying ugly produce the farm gets some revenue out of something that would otherwise be no revenue and they take their cut in the middle i like it what do you think i i like it now but let me i'm always being like the negative guy i like it but let me tell you okay i'm a subscriber to imperfect produce um first of all it's not imperfect like this is a shtick of the of uh farm theory of them selling like things that are ugly so what are you saying they look normal you're saying yeah it looks normal i mean it doesn't look like it's a it's a wonderful marketing scheme but it's it's it's so like it's just normal shit right right uh because i'm guessing you would not sign up for something that just says here's vegetable delivery correct yes it's like saying there's a famous copywriter named joe sugarman he wrote this great ad for a new cast is it called casio a casio watch and he's like we use space age aluminum with quartz movement and fucking every watch has that same aluminum and quartz movement is used in nearly every single watch he just he just explained it in a great way and so this is this is the same thing with these guys and it's a shtick that works it's a real it's like it's like guinness guinness putting a ping pong ball in their beer um i don't know about that what is that what guinness beer if you buy it in the can it there's a ping pong ball in it because apparently that ping pong ball has a little bit of uh night is it nitric oxide some type of like uh gas in there that keeps it super fizzy i see okay and when they released that ball it like went up big time i love it yeah so this is great marketing i'm into it i don't know anything about india so it's hard for me to say that but i do know that i just googled it uh imperfect produce they have 200 000 subscribers and what do you pay per month roughly it's a weekly bill um i think i was paying 200 a month wow so incredible yeah big market so yeah i i think it would depend on how talented these entrepreneurs are but uh you definitely can build something significantly significant here right you
