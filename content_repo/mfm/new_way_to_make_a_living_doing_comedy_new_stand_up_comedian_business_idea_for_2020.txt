so i don't think this would work so let me start with that but there's something interesting here where so netflix recently you know netflix in the last few years started going heavy into comedy so comedy used to be like hbo kind of owned the space uh where they would do you know hbo specials um and then that kind of dried up and comics are like cockroaches they'll always survive it's like okay we'll go play in the dingiest room we'll go on stage we'll get a netflix special we'll get an hbo special okay we're back to the dark room again like they won't quit because they're like degenerates and now podcasting has been a huge boom for them um so chris d'alea who also just had a netflix special come out um these guys make tons of money right so netflix started cutting like 10 20 million dollar checks i believe to these comedians because they know that comedians have these like rabid followings and uh the content is good it's unique sort of proprietary content but i think that there's a product out there sort of like a crunchy what crunchy roll did for anime i think somebody could do for the mid-tier comedians i think you could make a sort of five dollar a month seven dollar a month subscription to uh the the head the comedians that are not going to get netflix specials right so not chris rock and not seinfeld and chapelle and and all those guys but like the next tier down like uh even you know one level below like the whitney cummings of the world right because they're still getting netflix specials and i think you could add them up and it doesn't have to be the hour-long special it could be like a 10 minute set uh set or a 20 minute set or something like that and i think you could get i think each of them have a few thousand fans that would pay to be able to access that exclusive comedy content and um and so you would if you just aggregate all the comedians then it's a sort of all you can eat pass where uh as a viewer i can discover other comedians too so anyways i think that there's a business potentially for a mid-level netflix for comedians where you aggregate them what do you think great i'm looking up information so i can i i my brain's rolling and i'm gonna let me let me tell you what i think so uh first of all quibi i imagine is trying to do something like that so quibi um is that even fucking how you say it yeah that is it's pretty stupid uh i mean look i think with quibi um it actually can be great because the people who are running it are like super smart but it it does not look like a good bet now but it still might be um anyway they're trying to do something like that second i think that that is a great idea and i think the way that i would find out how to do it is i would look up quello q e l l o have you heard of quello i've never heard of it okay quello's cool so what quello is is it's a it it's i think it was started way before its time it's an app on apple tv and all they have is live concerts and so it was started in 2010 and um it's available on it's like a it's a app for your phone but i think it's best on apple tv and you could download it and you pay 10 000 or um is it maybe 10 a month 10 sometimes 10 thousand dollars a month i think it's 10 a month and you just get access to a library of live concerts have you ever wanted to do that or is that just me uh i kind of do this on youtube but youtube like has enough free like i listen to a bunch of like red rocks concerts right because there's a concert venue called red rocks which is awesome and like anytime a musician goes there they film it in like epic with epic cameras and sound and they're just like available on youtube for free but this is cool i like this it's awesome and the it's it's it's better than youtube but youtube is great and the reason it's better is because like if you buy like a concert dvd the camera works a little bit better and the sound is a lot better and i love live music and so i am a big fan of this and they have 70 000 paying subscribers they were recently acquired by stingray communications which is a publicly traded company in canada it's a cable company so if i were you sean and i wanted to launch this or if i was a listener and wanted to launch this i would look up stingray communication and i would go and read the the filing for that company and i would figure out exactly what quello does that's what i would do um and i would learn about how they did it because it's a relatively niche thing they only have 70 000 um subscribers it's not huge and they've been at it for 10 years so it's not a big number and i think it is incredibly viable business um and i think it's great another thing another thing that i would do is i would look up discovery channel and then national geographic are you familiar you're familiar with national geographic obviously right okay national geographic is still a huge company and it uh uh disney recently bought into it at a billion dollar valuation and they still make they still make hundreds of thousands or um hundreds of millions of dollars a year from their magazine subscription is that crazy that's insane and so i would but they but here national geographic was a non-profit and uh and so the good thing about non-profits is you can go and see all their numbers and so what i would go and look at i would look at discovery and i would look at national geographic and i would look at coelo and i would see what they are doing because those are relatively niche um subscription companies that crush so long story short great idea you you you you you you you you you
