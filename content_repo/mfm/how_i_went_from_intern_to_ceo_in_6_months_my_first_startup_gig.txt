and just to give you a sense of this right i'm 24 years old i'm the youngest person in the company i'm the newest hire in the company and six months later i got named ceo prodigy that's pretty good pretty good right and the way to do that is you actually welcome to a new segment that we're calling it's like a q a but we're not calling it a q a we're calling it questionable advice does that mean that someone shouldn't follow the advice or that we're just answering questions and giving advice it means whatever people need it to mean it's people asking questions us giving advice advice the advice is a little bit questionable as well right because we're not telling you what necessarily you should do we're saying what we what we've done that works for us it may or may not work for you it may it may not be the best way it's just the only way we know and so today the question we want to answer is actually different than usual normally we're always talking about starting companies starting businesses being a ceo being an owner being an investor but today it's about what happens if you're not there yet what happens if you're inside of a big company so how do you stand out inside of a big co how do you become a superstar employee how do you become an employee that is just god tier and that opens up a whole bunch of doors for you inside of a company how many employees have you had like that every company there's always one or two there's always one or two that are just like so clear and what i did was i basically plucked what are the things that they do like what are the things i remember that they did that stood out to me as well as a couple things i did after we got acquired and we went to twitch what are some things that i tried that actually i felt worked um because you know i had to spend two years inside of a bigger company for the first time in my life and i experimented i tried a whole bunch of things i'm not going to talk about the ones that failed because those were embarrassing or not useful but i will share the ones that that worked dude what's crazy is let me add two things backstories to our our perspective on this one you had someone who worked at uh monkey inferno and all the other companies that monkey inferno started well you actually had a few interesting people the first interesting person was steve bartlett who's famous for his agency and his uh podcast diary of a ceo i think the second person who's even more interesting is farcon a guy who started a company that's worth tens of billions of dollars i was shocked that that guy would be would would consider you a co-worker that was a that was an amazing get the second point i want to add to this person and you probably you actually had a few other people that were uh you know jason hitchcock you had a few other people that are wildly successful um the second thing to add to this one of the best compliments i've received from you in the last probably 60 days is you texted me and you said how on earth did you get step tron and i forget who else you named how on earth did you brainwash them into working for you for as long as they did and that so we've had we we've each had a handful of superstars who i don't ever use the word work for me because oftentimes it doesn't i hate that it's just it's not that it's we work together on something and i'm only going to be able to have them for a little a short amount of time that's principle number one you work with you don't work for and it's actually a pretty big mentality shift which is working with somebody is a partnership it's an agreement it's a mutually beneficial thing versus i work for you is a you know um you know there's a dominant person and there's a person who just basically takes orders and does whatever you know whatever they have to do you know based on the the task list and you never want to be the work for the work for is you know a servant essentially whereas working with is a partnership but it's okay to have to be that for for a little while actually for someone who's interesting like if if like sean purry doesn't have a specific need to get done and some kid is like dude i will i'm competent i would do exactly what you say for a little while it's okay to do that for a little while but i agree in general you don't want to be that person but but yeah working with is is how i consider it to be done correctly i hired a chief of sap just now uh this kid basically had a job at i think like jp morgan and he was like hey uh he just emailed me emailed me emailed me saying he wants to do stuff um he's like i can help you with this i can help you this is there a reason you're not doing this and uh then i'd be like no not really i should do it he's like how about i come do it for you i was like i don't know about you yeah whatever he's like here's an example here i'm doing it blah blah and finally he did it and i was like cool you're gonna quit your job he's like i guess i can go quit right now like if you say i'm in i'll go quit and i said okay bet and then he went and talked to his boss and he quit his job banking and now he's my chief of staff and even for him on day one i told him this i said we work with each other and not you don't work for me because i actually want somebody who's going to treat themselves that way because they're going to get they're actually going to get way more done they're going to be more productive they're gonna be a higher caliber person if they think that way it's a mindset shift did you actually say bet dude he's 22 i gotta speak the language all right everyone a quick break to tell you about hubspot and this one's easy because i'm going to show you an example of how i'm doing this at my company when i say i i mean not my team i mean i'm the one who actually made it so i've got this company called hampton you can check it out joinhampton.com it's a community for founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and i went and made a landing page so you can check it out at joinhampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that i made and the hard part with this is with hampton we are appealing to a sort of a higher-end customer sort of like like a louis vuitton or ferrari so i needed the landing page to look a very particular way hubspot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their landing page builder and it's super simple i'm not technical and i'm the one who actually made it and once it's made i then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and i can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that i did this is where the revenue came from so it came from twitter it came from linkedin whatever it came from i can actually go and look at it and i can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this i highly suggest it look i'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of youtube and get started all right now back to mfm the first sub category or the first category i think we should have we both have things that involve communication and writing do you want to like name a few that you have under that category yeah okay so i'll do i'll do one simple one so write an internal newsletter people know us as the newsletter guys because you created the hustle read by millions of people i created milk road which became the biggest crypto newsletter the the newsletter thing isn't just for external um so you know you could have a hundred thousand subscribers in a newsletter but i if you're inside of a company what you really want is 20 subscribers but they're the 20 most interesting people in the company and so what i did when i got to twitch was there was a um a team like bezos has something called the s team i don't know if you're this amazon's like he's like 15 to 20 top lieutenants and twitch being owned by amazon had its version of this called t team and so i got put on t team and so you know t team is like whatever 15 of the top people in the company and i go to the first meeting and you know it's it's a busy meeting they're not you know they're like oh hey welcome sean we we just acquired that by sean want to say hi i'm like i say hi for two seconds but really i don't know any of these people and so what i did was i created a newsletter and i created it for all of the t team and then i would slowly anytime i'd meet somebody interesting anywhere in the company i'd be like oh by the way i write this thing every week and it only goes out to you know a select number of people um it's it's fun you'll like it i'm gonna add you i'm gonna add you to the list and so they're like okay cool i'll be added whatever um and what i would do is i copied um james clear's newsletter format james clear does something called one two three um guess what i wrote the three two one newsletter internally which was basically like you know um it was through uh or no sorry he does three two one i did one two three so i did one photo from my camera roll so here's a photo i did two thoughts which is just like two like kind of tweet length things that i'm thinking about inside the company and three links which is just random that i've seen what type of photos uh it would be usually something like um you know not work-related so for example culture building thing like i saw john brought in this funny mug not not work with it at all it would just be something about my life that's like an interesting thing for my life and i'm not a big instagram guy but i kind of get the idea which is a photo can say a lot about you and what you're interested in and all it can kind of brag a little bit like okay like my kid learned how to ride a bike this weekend yeah exactly i'm such a good dad you know like here's what i'm doing and so you know like for example i did one photo that was this list that my um my niece had made she's seven and she she wrote her like routine she's like ellie's day and then it was um eat play sleep eat play play sleep and i was like somehow the seven-year-olds got it figured out what are the rest of us doing and right like that's the life you gotta live and so people loved it they're like oh yeah that's so true blah blah blah and so i would just one photo two thoughts three links i would send that on every sunday and i wrote i said hey the way i framed it i go you know when i was a startup founder i used to send this to my uh our investors and board of advisors every sunday i'd write like an update i kind of wear my heads at well you know old old habits die hard even though i'm not a startup founder anymore i'm working at twitch um i still have this hour every sunday i'd like to that you guys are now my new my new board of advisors you guys are my new you know mentors at this company so i wanted to include you on this if you're on this list because i think you're one of the more interesting people in the company that i hope to to learn from and get to know over time and so that was how i started it and i wrote that thing dude i can't tell you how much juice i got on this right because it took me about 45 minutes to write this every sunday but now i'm getting sort of like you know every single person's attention in a very and they they know about me they learn about me they have an opinion about me not everybody loved it i'm sure i'm sure some people were like whatever i don't care about this but it didn't matter it got like forwarded up there was a guy who was like the vp at amazon prime would email me and be like dude i love these sunday things man he's like i wish we got to work together because he wasn't even in the company he got forwarded to him and he was like these are awesome you want to like just meet this you sound great you sound awesome and that's the whole goal you want to build a brand internally and one easy hack to do this is the internal newsletter and there's actually uh i think even more implications of this so one of the greatest people i worked with was steph smith she's been on the pod many times she's already doing great things and is going to want to do even bigger things she uh there's this thing with history i read a lot of history where oftentimes the person who writes the most popular history book or writes history books they actually control that they control what we think of history even if it's fake she did that of course in a good way where it was very tactical she actually couldn't she was the best google sheets maker and a really good google slides maker and so she would dictate how the google sheet for the projects that she ran and then eventually other projects how they looked and that actually dictated what we tracked which dictated what we did that we do yeah and but she would make these i don't know did i ever tell you the sheet that we had for trends did i ever show you that no i'll just show it to you sometime but she made this beautiful sheet it autofilled and like i was like oh thanks for doing this this is amazing you should do this for all these other things but she basically controlled the information flow and so if anyone had a question if anyone didn't want to know anything they had to go to her and she wasn't doing this for bad reasons but b she was basically a very powerful person because of that reason and so you need to get really good at presenting your work and you need to be really really loud about it but you have to be great at presenting your work making presentations writing stuff controlling the google sheets and making them look presentable and making them work well that is incredibly important and not enough people think about that 100 100 the winners write history right and and uh and also the other thing is you want to be a maker not a taker so most people in companies are just takers of plans so somebody else writes the plan somebody else makes the doc somebody else creates the dashboard and you just sit on the receiving end of it what i would do it you know when i was at these companies is i would always write my own versions of the plans and this is partly for practice because i wanted to if i want to be the ceo well then i should get reps doing the things that the ceo is doing he's writing an annual plan cool i'm going to write one too what would i say and you write it and then you compare to what they wrote and you see things that they did better and you see there's some things that maybe they missed out on and so being a plan writer being a proposal writer being a update writer is going to be the thing that actually sharpens your skills so that you if you want to be a leader what most people think is i'll wait till i'm promoted then i'll start doing leader things well that's not really how it works right you start doing leader things and then you get recognized and promoted and so if you want to one day be the leader you got to be the plan maker not the plan taker and you want to write your own version of all the things that all the key key stuff the annual plan the quarterly update the uh the launch guide whatever whatever it is for a given project the next thing i would say is and this is actually challenging for a lot of people i have a feeling it wasn't challenging for you because you're a very competent person but it's important to be a to to be loud and when i say loud i don't mean that you have to talk a lot but i just mean you have to make sure everyone knows the cool shit that you're doing and there's a fine line between being selfish and stealing other people's stuff and taking too much credit and then also being loud but it's important to be loud to let everyone know these are all the amazing things that are happening and you have to present that in a really wonderful way where it shows progress and it shows even if you screwed stuff up here's the swings we took i think i always had this problem i i noticed it particularly amongst the women who worked for me i would always have to encourage them i'd be like dude you got to speak up you got to be louder about this this is really awesome you are not inserting yourself into the conversations nearly enough that you should this is really really talented amazing work so i think being loud is incredibly important to sticking out within a company yeah exactly you want to work in public so you want to you know present the things that you're doing and like you said it's not all bragging so for example you know people would would would report in a format that's sort of like here's the here's what went well here's what didn't do well here's the screw-ups that we had this week and some of the things we learned from that are what we're going to do to fix it so like it doesn't have to just be everything i did was great and i'm the best and i did everything you know it was all me me me me it's not that however you're totally right that you're really only rewarded for what people know about if you're if what you're doing can't be measured or isn't seen it might as well have not existed inside of a big company and for a lot of people that's very uncomfortable to do they wish the world worked differently where it was just purely purely merit-based and everything was equally visible it's just not true like if a tree falls in the forest and there's no one there right like you know you need to be able to to highlight what you're up to and uh you know carve out 10 of your time to doing that let me tell you one more thing that's a bit unrelated but a very controversial and it took me a hard it took me a long time and i had to go through a lot of tough challenges to learn this titles matter did you i imagine when you started your early companies and maybe you still do this now you're like dude i don't care about titles you can call yourself anything you want it means nothing to me this is a flat organization but titles actually matter for an employee and they matter because of the job that you have there but also the job that you can get elsewhere so give me an example because i would disagree with this i don't think they matter that much what's what's the example you're thinking of where it mattered okay so if you want to be called the head of something that's actually really important for the employee it's actually scary for the employer because you want to set you if you give someone the head of marketing you can't hire someone above them or if you do there's going to cause tension however for the employee if they go and work at a new company they're going to now say look i was already head of marketing at this company i need to be cmo or i need to have something of equal seniority additionally within the business if you if it's i'm the head of blank i'm the head of marketing everything that happens within that i need to have my say or i need to have my finger on the pulse with that um titles i actually think are a really important thing they seem not important to an entrepreneur because you say these things like oh it doesn't matter we're all working together but i actually think that i i they matter for the employee so i would say in my opinion the logos matter so there's a funny thing that happens where it's like you i bet you're guilty of this too let's say you're uh you're building um hampton now it's like a community or membership based product if you see oh this person ran community or memberships at yeah whatever ypo ypo soho house whatever no known known thing versus unknown brand for some reason we just sort of attribute all of the success of that company to like this person must be a winner because that company is a winner even if they had very little to do with the winning of that company that the secondary step at the hustle i had a guy who worked at facebook and he wanted to join us and i was like oh you're in and we hired him and he was it was horrible but i totally fell victim to that i've done that all i do that all the time this happens to me with live streaming people are like oh you worked at twitch oh we we need somebody we're doing live streaming so it'd be amazing to have you on board because of your experience at twitch they don't know my experience at twitch they don't know what the hell i was doing there i learned way more about live streaming at my startup that they don't know about that was actually building live streaming that was working in that space but if all i had was that unknown startup name i would have gotten zero credit for being like no live streaming expert guy and so i think logos matter a lot and just getting a better a winner logo unfortunately that stamp that stamp is is cool um the thing different than having harvard or an ivy league and ivy oh if you're good enough to pass that bar you're good enough and one is enough one is enough that's the key i think one problem people can do is think of local collecting one is enough if you if you got harvard awesome you don't need to also go get you know another mba from some other place or if you have facebook you don't have to make the next one google you can make the next one a little higher variant variants because the facebook will carry the other thing i'd say is managers matter so when we got acquired by twitch we were getting interviewed by people and we got interviewed by several people when we were joining and they were like they were supposed to be diligent seeing the acquisition but i was also diligent seeing them because i was like dude i know that managers matter people don't quit jobs they quit managers and also if you're stuck under a manager who doesn't have a lot of respect in the org you're not even going to get to see a lot of the interesting that goes on or even if you do stuff it's going to be buried under however much clout that manager has and so they first tried to put me under somebody and i was like no no no i'm not working for that guy and they're like what what's what's the problem i was like nice guy i'm not working for him and they're like i was like is there anybody else because uh you know maybe these two people i liked them they see because they clearly like you know were buds with the ceo and had more more like they were doing all the interesting projects and this guy's over here working on trust and safety or maintenance of something or like you know plumbing under the under the bridge like i'm not trying to work on all those boring those boring projects or with that guy that guy has no respect in the in the org and i think managers matter pick somebody you're going to learn a lot from but also somebody who got who has some surface area that you can get you done and switch if you if you if you don't like where you're at try this actively switch um all right i have a different one wait hold on dude when i sold to the when i sold the hustle to hubspot it was uh the the the plan early on was i'm out of the picture and i'm just gonna do the pod but they were like all right how about like vp of marketing and report to this guy and i was like yeah can we give me like a lower title and you can make brad who's my vp make him the vp and i'll report to him it was just like way better but i was like yeah let's let's bring it down a notch i'm not going to be a vp all right now there's something i call the five percent rule i learned this from furcon so when we got acquired by twitch we're sitting there and we're supposed to work on x right we we were at that time a taker we got acquired to do this let's do this and uh i forgot wasn't very motivated and i was like dude come on let's try to do a good job here right like we don't have to totally sandbag this i get it it's not like the same as when it was our company and this might become the next big thing but like you seem totally checked out and he was like no no i'm not i'm not checked out with the company he's like but look at this he pulled up the overall company dashboard he goes best case scenario this thing that we're building best case scenario which of these metrics changes and i'm looking at the key the number one dashboard for the company the key kpis overall ones i was like no none of these go to page three there's subdivision subdivision and then this one and he's like cool so let's say all right let's say we change that one how much do you think that changes the overall picture like he's like don't you think that we should at least like if we do a great job what we should do should make at least a five percent impact in the company and i was like my ego gets involved i'm like yeah of course five percent that sounds low actually he's like yeah he's like i just think we're capable of doing something that's going to at least move the needle five percent he's like he's like i feel like if i did something and it didn't even whatever we did if we did a good job if we succeeded but it couldn't even move the needle five percent he's like i kind of feel like that was like a waste of time and that's when i learned this five percent rule and when we we immediately switched to something that would do that and it was such a good decision i wouldn't have done this but in the same way that naval says you want to place a absurd hourly rate on your time so that you value your time and you put a price tag on your time this actually is also inside of a company you need to put a price tag on your projects that you simply will not work on projects that can't move the needle for the action for the company because if not why am i here what is the point and if you carry yourself with somebody who can actually move the needle for the company it's sort of self-fulfilling you will become that person who actually can do that simply like you just raised your standard and now that's what you do dude you're you you're lucky to have furcon of course furcon i don't know if he was he the co-founder or was he one of the first hires at apple oven so apple oven's a uh ad tech company 15 billion dollar market cap at 1.30 billion market cap amazing guy so he joined the company before he was even apple oven he was not one of the co-founders he was just like a random engineer that they hired they had like eight people he was like person nine within a couple months they were like all right this guy's the guy right he stood out like a superstar does this guy's the guy let uh and they went to him they're like hey i think we kind of built this team wrong now that we see you and we look at the other eight people we hired before you that are above you like we realized we did this backwards can you like fire all these people and rehire a new team of people like you he's like okay so he did that he ends up getting like a you know co-founder equity stake in the thing and you know it becomes it goes it ends up going public it's like a 20 billion dollar company you know years later same thing happens i hire him at monkey inferno as a android engineer only right so there's like you know above him there's a director of engineering above him is the cto above him is me within a couple months i was like oh this guy is a superstar like i you know android engineer is simply the wrong title that i told him i said look uh you're gonna end up in a different role just give me a month to figure this out and within a month we had switched it up where he ended up becoming cto and we basically rebuilt the whole team around him he sort of has like a master sensei like a like a that type of wisdom to him where for some reason whenever he says something i believe him and i and i think he is actually right a lot more importantly all the engineers you'll ever hire will believe him right this guy's a leader of engineers which is like extremely valuable um let me give you another another principle all right here's a simple one fix your zoom setup just don't look like dog shit on every call in fact you should look incredible on every call it doesn't cost that much to do it like you could do it with an iphone app there's an iphone app called camo you can download that's what i'm recording on right now by the way and you could be dslr quality from your from your iphone if that's all you have if you want to get one better just get a light right like a light off amazon that's 50 bucks and that app will set you in the top one percent of people at work in terms of how you look when you show up do that and have also buy a podcasting mic uh your mic can be uh you know a yeti a blue yeti microphone if you need it even better would be these like shure microphones you just just look good and sound good because like no matter how good your ideas are if it's wrapped up in a crap sandwich it's gonna just come across poorly and um it's the you know is the digital equivalent of dressing good and uh i think people really underestimate this i think you made this like a rule at your company right i mean i try to make it a rule and i'll give it i'll get really tactical i'm using a sure and i'm traveling right now and this is my travel kit assure mv7 usb mic that's 200 an iphone with a 50 camo subscription and 150 elgato key light that's that's my setup when i travel so if you think this looks good enough that's what it is yeah it's gonna be better than most people's like up the nose shot with the crappy audio and like you know sitting in a closet somewhere so so try try on that well fircon actually is a great example of this and a few other people uh really did a good job at this i think that when you get into a group whether it's work or any other type of group oftentimes the most confident person is not usually the smartest person but the most confident person wins and i think confidence is displayed in a way of saying things like this is uh this is the path we're going to go down this is what we're going to do i have a 60 chance certainty that this is actually going to work my logic is this this and this but this is this is the answer at least this is the answer for us to try and i think that at a company when you work with a small company like any company i've run you work with the ceo or the owner um at a larger company you know it'll it'll go up to the owner somehow or the ceo but it still matters with managers and vps and shit like that but the confident person that says this is the way and they dictate the way and they explain their reasoning and they're confident about it and you start believing in them you still have to be right more than you're wrong but the most confident people i think typically succeed the most i agree i'll give you two things one the thing you just described is like i think it's called the mckenzie pyramid principle you aware of this no so basically most people get communication wrong inside of a company because they bury the lead so what they'll normally do is they'll say beginning middle end like a story and in the end is the conclusion the end is the takeaway what we should do it's what's what what we decided whatever but busy people inside companies which are most of the leaders inside companies they don't like that format they want the opposite they what they want is to say my recommendation is we should do this for these three reasons number one number two and number three and i believe those three reasons because we have evidence underneath this this we do not have evidence for but we will but it's a reversible decision and this third thing blah blah blah right you stack the the main conclusion first and then you you add like a pyramid underneath you support it with your supporting arguments and that's just a simple communication thing to flip another communication thing to flip that i learned was um there's if you want to become a more clear communicator use the what why so what framework emmet from twitch taught me this so basically it's what happened or what's going to happen so you know if it's past looking what happened if it's forward looking what we're going to do why it happened why we're why we're going to do it and the last one is so what so you know let's just give an example um what happened is the the metrics let's say uh you know revenue is down 10 this month why because last month we did this extra promotion so we kind of knew it would artificially inflate last month's revenue this month is actually normal if you look at the overall trend line um nothing to worry about here so what um so we're going to continue doing this and actually we're going to consider doing those extra promotions every other month because they seem to provide to provide a boost or whatever right like you just you get the idea what why so what just is a generically useful template or outline but like you can write that on your paper before you figure out what are you going to say in this email or how are you going to write this document just write what why so what and you should be able to bullet point under that and then that's 80 to 90 of the material is already done at that point and i find what helps is if you put a confidence level in there because a lot of times people think well if you're confident you're saying that there's a 99 or 100 chance that whatever is going to your say is going to happen is going to happen you shouldn't do that you should say i'm actually you should be really conservative and say like you know 65 70 like i'm fairly certain or sometimes you're like i'm actually i actually think there's a 30 chance that this works but if it does work the outside returns are quite huge and if it doesn't work it's reversible in these ways and so i think you need like a little bit of a uh uh i don't know how you would say it like a an easy landing if you fail superstars do three things number one they think in probabilities not certainties that's what you just described the second thing is that they manage expectations which is the second thing you just said which is you don't need to over promise and under deliver in fact you know under promise and over deliver is a better mindset and uh i remember one time going into a meeting and uh this is something i learned from my dad we were going to a big partnership pitch meeting and we thought we thought they have this thing and with our technology they're going to get this huge yield this huge result and the result is like a hundred times better than their current thing so i was like oh slam dunk put that on the slide baby 100 times better and we go into the meeting and i my dad puts up the slide and i noticed that he's changed it and it only says three times better and i'm like dude you messed up like what happened why'd you do that and he's like he's like did you see their faces about three times better they were over the moon that other stuff is now my dry powder like i can beat if i could beat the three times even better if i said a hundred times and we came in at 80 times better it would be seen as we did not deliver on what we promised he's like and so you know what whatever you know forget the exact you know numbers here the principle holds true which is only sell to the amount you need to sell that like gets them to agree to green light the thing or take action but don't over promise beyond that even if you think it's capable because you'd always rather beat your numbers uh beating your numbers is like you know how you exceed expectations and it makes you trust them more and so here's an example so and i'm looking at the deck now so google uh whoever's listening you guys can google uber uh seed deck so in 2008 uber was just getting started they're raising only two hundred thousand dollars and on slide 20 they have a deck or a slide that says potential outcomes and they say best case scenario becomes a market leader with over a billion dollars in annual revenue realistic scenario gets five percent of the top cities and we make around 20 or 30 million dollars a year in profit worst case we stay a 10 car 100 client services business and just save some time for san francisco based executives versus when you see a slide deck from a pitch and it like everything is like up to the right you're like right dude i don't trust you now because you are saying something outlandish like this and you're saying it with a huge high degree of certainty right so uh yeah anyway i'm big on the confidence thing on the confidence thing is people think confidence comes from answers no confidence comes through asking intelligent questions um any leader knows that you can tell a person's quality of thinking by the quality of their questions and it always stands out if somebody asks you a question that's on point or breaks the frame of how you're thinking about things um that person always stands out in a meeting even though they didn't deliver some like you know very boastful confident conclusion and so you know an example of this would be you're in a meeting and it's kind of a messy it looks like you know options a and b both suck um instead of just saying no we need to do a or no we need to do b somebody who asks a different question that's like you know um what would an easy solution look like here right hey what's the simple thing we're missing right i'm just going to ask this out loud let's see if there's see if there's an answer because if there is that might be quite valuable to us right now or um you know we've been saying this thing uh just want to say this out loud is that true do we have the data to support that like somebody who's questioning assumptions or breaking frames with their questions or that says you know we're trying to solve this problem it feels like we're solving it from scratch we're not the only ones who have this problem how do other people solve this or how have we solved this in the past what's worked for us and anybody who's asking questions like that that are going to cut to the answer faster you stand out that's a that's a different way of showing confidence versus just saying me me i i have the answer dude i the one question that i love that all my employees hate is they'll give this like 12 month plan or something i'm like yeah how do we do this in like four weeks right that question i know some favorite question some of the best people they they frame that question nicely they say this this guy florian i used to work with he would always say this he'd be like i'm gonna say something you can beat me up if you think this is a terrible idea uh you know if you feel free to beat me up but i just want to say it and then he'll say the thing and it's such a disarming way of bringing up an idea that might be counter to the way the flow is going or whatever because you're always like oh florian wreck him you know don't worry we're not gonna beat you up about this idea but he would say that right or um you know this other guy dan he would he would do this thing he's now the ceo of twitch he would do this thing in meetings where he'd say you know he'd slow everybody down he'd be like you know it's one thing we could say is a b and c he'd like lay out an argument real quick he's like there's one thing to say this it's another thing if we were gonna say you know d e f and he would just like frame it so slowly for everybody because usually it's the person who can kind of like synthesize the arguments like what i'm hearing you're saying is a b and c i just want to make sure that it's is it a b and c and not actually d e and f and the person who would bring that clarity to the meeting was always like the essential person right they're the person who everybody thanks that they're on the way out because they actually help you you know figure out the solution where it felt like everybody was just talking in circles what uh you want to do one or two or three more uh yeah okay here's an easy one let's say you're inside of a company today but you want to go start a company someday you need to start creating your own version of the minus list which is who are the five most interesting people inside this company the people that you would want to recruit later on what i did was i i just i said at the beginning i said while i'm here at this job here's what i want out of this by the time i leave these doors i want to have the following i said and i wrote down a list one of them was like i want to learn one or two things about leaving a company that i don't know today because these people have managed bigger teams and do it better than i i'm sure that i do it so i want to at least have one or two key things that i can take away as a manager number two i want to have the respect of the ceo i want him to be able to say dude if you leave here and you tell me you're going to go start a company i want him to uh want to write the first check i think that would just be a a signal that i did well when i was here would emmett do that for you uh yeah he actually slacked me one time he was like hey i was out of the blue he basically slacked me that exact same thing he was like uh i wish we were gonna i wish we'd be able to keep you forever i don't think that's gonna happen uh you know if you ever do decide to do something i'd love to you know you know i'd love to back you in that and i was like oh man what a compliment thank you that's actually i showed him actually i was like that was on my list of things i said i wanted out of this experience so that's a cool full circle moment um the third one is you i said i want to walk out of here with five people five more people in my talent rolodex that i could reach out to if i ever needed to hire and um and that's what i did i was like oh this girl in data science massively underrated like she's the real one who delivers the work she's kind of junior here but man she would be somebody i would poach right away or this guy over here on the sales team god that guy was smooth uh if i ever have a thing for sales i know who to who to contact and actually right now with one of our new companies um i'm trying to fill a role and those are the people i went to first to be like hey i have no idea if you're available but i made this list before who are the five people i would love to work with someday and you were on it and hey that day is here uh you know what are you up to now and let's let's chat and so that's i think another good thing if you ever want to start a company like just pay attention to who are the hitters here because your talent rolodex is what kind of becomes a limiting factor as you try to build new companies right like i'm sure you have people that you know you'd love to speed dial and bring on board to a new thing and i think you did this with hampton right like i noticed there's some people there that were at the hustle because that's the experience you had yeah i think that you actually asked what was it you who said something like a really good question ask yourself is if you're starting your like let's say your thing's only going okay if you were if you were starting it again which you would you'd have to ask yourself would i hire the same people and do it the same way and for many cases you say no i would change this this and this and then your advice to them was like well just fucking do that right now yeah yeah but the but the other answer is okay well when you do it again now you have your list i think uh you know in the mafia they use the phrase and then succession kind of stole the phrase where they say like oh he's a serious person and a serious person means you call them hitters but in the mafia and the mob like i read all these books on it and they say uh oh he's serious he's serious yeah that guy's serious and so they'll say he's not a serious person you don't want to mess with that person so you want to find serious people i have two other little ones uh real fast ones one is find a paper cut problem so i've noticed that a lot of people who do well in companies they do this in the first two weeks when they join they find something that's just been an annoyance that nobody's ever fixed or nobody's got to um because it's not that important it's never the most important thing and they just go clean that up voluntarily i call this the paper cut problem like what's the thing that's just been giving us paper cuts it's kind of annoying but you're not bleeding out you're not dying you don't have to go to the hospital and if somebody fixed it you'd be like dude thank you for doing that like you know it would actually stand out a lot um i know several people that did this they they go to a company and they immediately identify like oh here's some annoyance that two people have referenced i bet this annoys everybody and actually i think if i just spent one saturday working on this i could fix it and they did that and they just like boost their stock so much when i was in seventh grade i had a job at a bakery and i would like clean the floors and wash dishes and there was a corner or there was a shelf where we'd have to like put these dry dishes and the shelf was broken and we hired another janitor to work with me and i remember like i worked there for like eight months and this shelf was always broken it was a pain in the ass and like within the first week this guy fixed that shelf and i immediately thought that's the way to do things you did it right exactly right and by the way you get rewarded for doing the things you didn't have to do right like if you just do your job that's called your job you do not get like extra recognition or reward or or any kind of bonus points for doing your job so you by definition you have to find something that is beyond your job or doing your job beyond what was asked uh if you really want to get this to stand out it's a very simple obvious principle but take that and make it actionable by like go look for it right as soon as you start looking for it you'll see it right it's it's a thing that the guy who's been there for eight months has been ignoring he's become he's just accepted it it's become a blind spot for them but for a new person if you're noticing you'll see it right away and you just go fix that thing you get so much yeah this guy's head janitor now i mean it worked out but honestly if you're gonna be a janitor be the head janitor like be the best be the best goddamn janitor anybody's ever seen i got one practical one and then one fun one the practical one is the other problem you want to find is the a plus problem at any given time in any company there is the a plus problem it is the thing that the people that's keeping you know the exec team up at night they're worried about it what i did was i just found the a plus problem and i would only work on that i would just work on that you know i would do my my main job kind of like you know 70 is good or 50 is good or sometimes zero percent is good i would just put it on pause because honestly it didn't even matter relative to the a plus problem and uh you know i took a little more risk than most people because i didn't care if i ever got fired like it was you know thank you please fire me invest my shares that would be a dream but by the way we had a friend who uh is at a company and he goes there was layoffs this week at our company and sadly i was not impacted exactly um so finally it was probably work on it i remember um i think i've told this story before um i was at a company and basically a competitor was like attacking them and like it was you know stealing their top customer basically and i figured well that's probably the a plus problem probably the thing everybody's thinking about and so i just did some analysis did it wrote up a two-page doc and i sent it to the ceo i was like hey you know i have no idea who's working on this but you know i was curious so i would dug in and here's what i found it immediately got like text introed into a group chat it's like hey sean's in on this now and i think that that's that's really what you want right is you want to be working on the interesting thing because that's what the highest caliber people are doing it's where the highest impact is you might as well you have so many hours in the day might as well work on the higher impact stuff with the most interesting high caliber people that's how you get better um what's your last fun one the last one is you got to create a brand for yourself so like you have a little story right there's all these moments inside companies where it's like you do introductions or uh you're at some team off site and uh you know you have two choices you're either going to blend in or you're going to stand out the best way to stand out is to be yourself but the the way to be yourself is to just remove the filter and what was your brand so i think there's been a couple yeah like when i was at monkey inferno and just give you a sense of this right i'm 24 years old i'm the youngest person in the company i'm the newest hire in the company and six months later i got named ceo prodigy that's pretty good pretty good right and the way to do that is you actually you know you make an impact but you also got to build some sort of brand for yourself and so mine was i was going to be sort of like um the action like basically just like take massive action on everything so whatever the thing was i would be like all right cool i'm going to take action on a immediately b i'm going to do the that nobody else wants to do like i'm going to go further oh we got to do this or we don't know if people will like this who cool give me the prototype i'm going to go talk to some people i would go to the mall and i would talk to people and i get feedback and i come back with like written feedback it was just the that nobody else really wanted to do and it just built this thing like i'm going to consistently take action i'm gonna have a higher bias for action than anybody else and i would talk about that i'd be like yeah i don't really know uh you know i remember this one guy did this intro and he said this thing this guy stood up and he goes i don't know anything about art or politics i don't know he goes i don't know anything about art i don't know anything about politics hell i don't even know where the remote is in my house the remote for the tv is in my house but the one thing i know is how to structure deals and today i'm going to tell you about how to structure deals and i was like wow what an intro what a what a fantastic intro it like always stood out to me and i thought you know what as much as your brand is going to be that you're good at x y and z you can say how bad you are or how little you know about you know these other three things and just be honest about it and almost poke fun at yourself so i would tell people like look i have the least experience of anybody in this room that's obvious i have never worked on any of this stuff before i don't know how to code i don't know how to design but i'm going to make myself useful the way the way i'm going to do that is it seems like what you guys need is help actually getting your product into people's hands and getting feedback quickly and actually iterating from there so i'm going to go crazy on that all right what you guys are going to get the next six weeks is me going crazy on that sound good and they're like they're like great it's like warren buffett says look for partners who have a high iq who are ethical and have a lot of energy and i i did the same thing where i was like well i actually don't know if i'm high iq two out of three ain't bad yeah yeah i don't know i definitely am ethical and i and i have a ton of energy so my wheels are spinning fast if you guys just want to put me in the right direction i'll go ahead and the car will run and it'll run quickly and i'll get you what you need i have the exact same brand as you and when we got acquired i just was like hey i'm a startup guy inside this big company i'm the i'm a startup guy i've only ever worked in startups i don't know anything about a big company honestly i'm going to probably make some mistakes that are things that are obvious that you should do at a big company but the thing i hope hope to bring to the table is i'm just going to keep working the way i know how as an entrepreneur i'm just going to just do that here and uh you guys tell me what parts of that are working for you guys or what or not right that's part of the brand but the other part is like stand out a little bit i remember sitting in an off site it's like oh um how about everybody just share you know how things are going and it was like person one said this like boring thing about like they just immediately went into like work mode right like you know they were like you know here's what i'm doing here's the problem i'm having here's what i'm doing here's the problem i'm having here i have this employee who's doing this and everybody's just kind of bitching and moaning and telling a very bland story and i just decided when it's going to come my term i don't know what's going to come out of my mouth but it's not going to be that and so i just told a story that was more funny it was poking fun at myself about something that i had done recently and a mistake that i had made so instead of blaming my team or my whatever i just told i was like you know here's where my head's at because all you they weren't saying like give us a team update they were just saying like you know let's all be present just share what's on our mind how you're feeling right now and so i did that and that stood out at the break everybody was like dude i love that story um and you know the lesson there is really like take a bit of a risk and don't take yourself too seriously inside companies because i think there's a tendency to try to button up and blend in and uh i would say that's not what the best people do i don't think that's what i don't think that's how the best people act we have this guy at hampton named doug and doug is a very stereotypical engineer so he's very black and white and because of that he's done a very good job of just being honest constantly and so if someone's trying to bullshit me i'll just be like uh what's doug think doug what do you think and he'll just be like that's stupid or he won't say that way he'll be like i don't think that's the right way i think this is the right way and for these reasons or he'll be like uh i don't like i don't exactly understand like branding but i think that a lot of people like this this this and this and they like it for these reasons therefore that way is or is not the right way and it's just what it's doug i just always want to know what's doug think about this he's very analytical and he's very honest and he doesn't because he's you know like a normal engineer he doesn't exactly understand what's hurting my feelings or what isn't hurting my feelings and i love that about him i love that i always want doug's in my life people who just don't bullshit me and they'll say something like that's stupid that's not stupid and i i appreciate that that's his brand so those are our tips how to become i don't know a superstar inside of a company how
