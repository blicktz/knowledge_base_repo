consistency, I think is the number one thing that people forget. I have not missed tweeting a day in three years. If you do, you lose your spot in the relevancy engine with Twitter.

So Twitter every day, there's like 90% of consumers and 10% of us creators. Well, the creators create content for the board consumers, the consumer session and the product, and Twitter needs to figure out how to hook them immediately. And so Twitter goes to all their previous engaged content and they go, well, who do they engage with every day?

And if they've built up an habit of engaging with myself, then they're like, well, let's give them a Dan Held tweet. But if I don't tweet that day, then there may be like, oh, let's give them a Chris tweet or someone else's tweet because they need to go hook them immediately. And then if that engagement loop gets built with them over time, then I'll slowly start to lose relevancy with them.

So consistency is absolutely the most important thing on Twitter and most of these channels. I feel like I can rule the world. I know I could be what I want to.

I put my all in it like no days off on the road. Let's travel. Never looking back.
