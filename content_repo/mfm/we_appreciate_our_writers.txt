This isn't like a national thing is it? No. Weekly.

I have to look at this. Happy Writers Appreciation Day. Yay!

So we thought what would be more important than showing our appreciation was to have our readers show their appreciation. So we hit them up and they helped put us together a little video for you guys. What?

I recommend it to my clients, my friends. I like the tone, I like the voice. Excellent.

Yay! Thank you guys. And here is one last part.

Here's a gift. Lindsey, we have a gift card for you to go skydiving. What?

What? What? Your gift card will be delivered in 24 hours.

Yours will be delivered in 24 dollars. It's a steak dinner to Roy's. It's Adam's favorite place.

Awesome. And Kendall's yours is easy to print. Sick.

Where are your tickets? Oh my! Nice!

Nice! You're welcome. Nice!

Nice! Nice!
