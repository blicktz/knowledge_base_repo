there's five ways to um like make money in a system in any system there's like five roles and you can decide which one you're going to be in so like uh one is the logistics and labor so like let's take a house uh you're building a house the guy who's actually literally laying the bricks and out there sweating in the heat and building the actual home sort of gets like paid the least but does the worst does the most work right does the hardest work and does the most work in the process right he's the logistics and labor he's actually moving the bricks around and you could choose to do that you could choose to be kind of a worker bee who's moving the bricks but you're going to work the hardest you're going to capture the least and life feels kind of unfair it's unfair that you know the real estate developer sitting in his second vacation home is going to make more off that house than the guy sweating outside every day but that's the reality that's how it goes yeah so there's logistics and labor that's the lowest level of the pyramid next level optimization happy thanksgiving everybody we got an episode for you you know a little break from the family never hurts uh this is a dope episode i really like this one we talked about a bunch of things so we talked about the uh the lurking giant of an industry that is fan fiction that's right fan fiction uh we talked about vice businesses and a billion dollar company that's serving marijuana businesses and um a arbitrage around the new kia car logo which is pretty funny and then sam what else you got we talked about a very uh famous billionaire who recently said that 50 million dollars is about the cutoff to where any more money won't make you happy we talk about our opinions of that and then we also reference a few other people who said their opinion on what their number is we talked about a billionaire who's only 39 years old who you've probably not heard of he's built a payments company which is kind of interesting but even more interesting he's built the world's largest uh training company to train pilots incredibly fascinating guy it's good episode i think you're going to dig it check it out let's jump in we have some topics uh sam you have a topic and then i got a i got a bunch i've got a bunch too if you score down you'll see the rest okay but first a lighthearted topic i tweeted this thing out the other day chamath uh was on lex friedman's podcast and there was one three minute topic that didn't really get enough justice that was very interesting lex goes hey so you're this billionaire now can you explain how life has changed being rich and he said basically there's if it's zero to a hundred of different levels i've tried it all i've gone from zero to a hundred and back i've done all the stuff and money doesn't change stuff after a certain point and i think that point is 50 million dollars and i thought that that was uh and he referenced the study he i actually can't find the study that he referenced but he said like you know i read this ivy league thing i don't know if it's true but they said that after 50 million nothing changes because that's plenty of uh plenty of money to have homes all your loved ones are handled you don't have to work you could think about what's really important and i actually thought that that was a really interesting answer because without having any evidence other than just friends and family i think that number is about right uh but no one ever discusses this they always say that stupid 70 thousand dollar a year study which is just absolutely nonsense i don't believe that to be true at all uh but i thought it was a really interesting thing and i tweeted it that like you know that's what he said and jason calcanus who's chamat's buddy and also uh i imagine quite wealthy he says uh i don't think he's totally off but i think a couple million in america in 2022 and you're good 10 million that's fu 25 plus you're dangerous anything above that who cares and so i want to know what do you think do you have levels like that my biggest takeaway is that i should just be referencing studies that don't exist all the time dude like the thing you just said that is you know there was a harvard study can't remember what year but totally backs up the point i want to make so i'm gonna make this up now good i could not find a study and none of my twitter followers could i tweet this out to almost 200 000 people not one person said they could find it that's why he's a black belt in and i'm trying to get my black belt at bullshitting and now i i learned a move that i didn't didn't have in my bag uh the the fake fake study reference um you know there's these two scientists out of pen who um it's really interesting what they did so okay that was my first takeaway my second takeaway is um i don't know if the number's 50 i think it's like complete like um it's completely context dependent somebody said this uh somebody tweeted this out in the crypto world they go would you rather have just uh had a hundred thousand dollars and still have a hundred thousand dollars or have gotten really lucky during the crypto bull run turned a hundred thousand into a hundred million and now it's all come crashing back down with ftx and all this other stuff and you're back at a hundred thousand would you rather like have the emotional stability of of the of one year of just staying where you're at or would you rather have tasted the highest highs and now crash back down to earth of course not the second one no that that second one was horrible but you know lost aversion i i care more about losing than i do gaining that's crazy so you would rather just stay at the 100k well so like objectively you're at the same level so you would rather have never never flown so high and then crashed i think it would it would i would i would have a life of regret that's insane ben what about you what do you what do you think um i i think there's some street cred that comes with having been rich that makes it easier to make the money back so i would rather have been rich and and now not be so i did this in poker i used to play online poker pretty uh like aggressively back in the day and generally yeah pretty degenerately like you know it's like why pay for college when you can go lose money in online poker instead of going to class like those those seem to be my strategy and so but i did have some runs and sometimes i would go from the 10 cent 25 cent table which is like you know the very low blinds up to dollar two dollar up to two four up to three six five ten ten twenty and if you're at the 10 20 basically like on any given hand you know 20 30 000 could be swinging you know left and right so you were going on these massive swings for like a 19 year old at the time um but then inevitably because i would not manage my bankroll properly i would go crashing right back down and i'd be like well i can't afford those tables anymore i have to go back and play the you know 10 25 cent or the you know two four cent or whatever like the lowest stakes that were offered on full tilt at the time were poker stars and um and it was the worst feeling when you had to go back it was because it wasn't the worst feeling like it wasn't the regret like the regret is obviously a part of it but the worst feeling is that it's just really hard to get excited about winning 20 bucks when that same thing could have been 20 000 and you've tasted 20 000 at that point and so just rewiring your brain to like go back to be humble to be humble enough to play low stakes again was really really tough but really important and um but i did learn one thing which is that once you taste higher stakes it does like break your frame and so the only reason i would say i would rather have gone up and down even though emotionally and mentally it's harder is the value in having your frame broken and thinking bigger thinking differently and not limiting yourself in some way that you previously thought was a some limit for you is actually incredibly valuable so even though yes you're back at a hundred thousand you have one new valuable asset which is you think of yourself differently and you think of the world differently and you think of what's possible differently than you did had that never happened i don't know man i think that that is just such a roller coaster that's pretty convincing i i i think that i think the argument of like you frame breaking is good i well what you're saying is that there's a lesson to be learned and that you're going to be left off better than you than you arrived it's not just the money yeah you'll learn i think that that is that that is almost a fair argument but i would say that you're going to be broken from the journey down more than you're happy baby we got therapy on one side and then we got the experience i'll repeat the same thing i've said all the time which is i don't think that your opinion is relevant here because you are this rare thing called being emotionally healthy for most individuals i do not think that this would help them i think it would hurt them more than it would help them maybe maybe i don't know um maybe so so but you did ask a question about the number so you said 50 and i think 50 probably sounds appealing to you sounds appealing to anybody who's got less than 50. um but then there's a whole bunch of people who are there and they you know they continue on and i don't know what they would say you know i'm not at 50 million and and like kind of net worth so i don't know uh if that's the right number or not what my experience tells me is that it's about triple what you got whatever you got triple what you got feels like the number where i could finally it'll finally be good and then when you get there it's always double actually you know this is actually two and three x this actually is a real thing i don't know if the study is legitimate but i did read like a thing where they sampled like 10 000 people and consistently the number was actually double people said i want double what i have uh you know if you're worth a million they're like you know if i had like two i would feel better it was almost always double so i'm so you're on to something i'm thinking about what project i'm going to do next year so 2023 i'm i'm plotting i'm scheming it's like pinky in the brain but i'm both pinky and the brain and every night i think to myself what am i going to do next year and that's i actually don't say the same thing we do every year try to take over the world that's not actually what i'm trying to do this year has a different frame and it comes from a quote i heard i think uh i think maybe naval had said it somewhere and he said um he goes you are retired when you stop sacrificing today for some future tomorrow um basically when the day in and of itself is complete at that point you have retired and it's not about to me it's not about retirement but that's also like just replace the word retirement with winning uh like the ultimate form of winning to me is when the thing you do in and of itself is the reward you're not doing it for some maybe future speculative hopefully reward that will come right like what most people do is they take some they do something that's a sacrifice in order to have the thing they want later and they think the sacrifice leads to the thing i want and what are the but what are like the pillars for you you know i i are the columns you know if you're in excel like you like content creation you may be like investing like where what are your what are your columns labeled well i'll get i'll i'll i first when i heard this quote i was like was that even possible or is everything just feel like you know hard work and sacrifice until it pays off i was like no actually the podcast is the only thing in my life that feels this way the podcast is the only you know it's not even business but i guess it is technically a business now but it's the only project i've ever worked on where the act of doing it is the reward like i am you know like um when it's a normal startup i'm like what are the growth numbers what are the what are we trending week over week what's the revenue how can we grow this grow this grow this growth all i would think about with a normal business and with this i don't and it's not because i don't want this to grow no of course i want it to grow it's because um like the reward for me isn't if this grows then a good thing will happen the reward is i love sitting down here shooting the with you having a bunch of topics and then like you know the the sort of reaction to the pod that comes like immediately after it gets dropped and other people get to listen to it and so like doing the pod is the reward not if the pod gets big then there's all these rewards to be had and that's why when i look back i say man it's always been really hard for me to stick with projects you know this you've told me this like a thousand times like stop pivoting do whatever you know like the average lifespan of my projects is like one year or less um or i have to hire somebody to take my role and i basically check out the podcast is i've been doing this what three years now and like i feel like we just got started i could do this another 30 years i feel zero fatigue in this whereas anything else three years in i'd be looking for the uh the exit path and so that to me was a really strong signal that hey projects like that do exist and then it's a frame breaker right oh if that exists then i want that out of my next project now to answer your question about the pillars i think the most important one for me is i like uh high creativity things not i like create i like creativity not optimization meaning i'm not a good operator who likes to optimize the the engine every day come tweak it make it one percent better every single day i love when people do that i personally don't get a lot of joy doing that i love creativity um like basically making stuff whether it's content or it's a product or it's a business idea whatever it is so i'm like how do i make it where it's creativity based um and i kind of had this like big epiphany during that process uh that like i haven't really fleshed out but i'm gonna i'll share it with you i want to hear what you think about this so i realized there's like there's five ways to um like make money in a system in any system there's like five roles and you can decide which one you're going to be in so like uh one is the logistics and labor so like let's take a house uh you're building a house the guy who's actually literally laying the bricks and out there sweating in the heat and building the actual home sort of gets like paid the least but does the worst does the most work right does the hardest work and does the most work in the process right he's the logistics and labor he's actually moving the bricks around and you could choose to do that you could choose to be kind of a worker bee who's moving the bricks but you're going to work the hardest you're going to capture the least and life feels kind of unfair it's unfair that you know the real estate developer sitting in his second vacation home is going to make more off that house than the guy sweating outside every day but that's the reality that's how it goes yeah so there's logistics and labor that's the lowest level of the pyramid next level optimization that's the person that goes into any business and is trying to make it incrementally better increase sales increase decrease costs this is usually a manager of some kind and so optimization make things more efficient make things grow a little more you can choose to be a great manager you'll capture more value than labor but not by much um then comes performance that's kind of what this podcast is we get on we push record and we perform and we get paid more than you know whoever does our podcast editing gets paid because we have to perform and it's like the the result of our performance is going to be it'll be a complete flop or a complete hit based on how well we perform you are a performer okay so that's like the third level then there's creativity that's coming up with the concept you know creating original things creating whether it's content whether it's code whether it's the original idea um creativity is like that next layer and then the highest layer is like one who makes the most and does the least amount of like you know laborious work is warren buffett who sits in a room plays bridge for you know four hours a day reads and it will go sometimes years without making an investment but when he does make an investment he's getting paid paid only on his judgment and so he doesn't get paid on creativity performance optimization or labor and logistics he gets paid purely on judgment did he make the right call or not and that that person you know captures the most value in any value chain and so i think that's the way that that like kind of like any enterprise works or any ecosystem works for money and i'm trying to decide which layer i want to play at do i want to try to play a judgment because i think logistic is the best but it's not the most fun to me i think creativity is the one that's the most fun for me or performance one of those two do you think that you'll build a company or do you think that you'll build like uh you'll just get more famous and make money off that somehow probably not either of them uh right now neither feel appealing so i don't think i'll create a company because i've done that like for the last i don't know feels like almost 15 years and um and i'm like okay what if my brainstorm was limited right a brainstorm is pretty helpful when you have a creative constraint so my creative constraint is what if i can't operate a company so i gotta do something and i want it to be awesome but i'm not going to be an operator of a company so that could mean for example you could buy a business and place an operator you could be an investor you could do other things but i'm not going to create a company that can operate that's that's where you like investing what's that do you like investing i do like investing yeah i don't know if i love investing but i do like investing and um so so that's one and then the second one you said which is getting more famous that also feels really lame to me even though i kind of know it's a good thing like it's clearly worked it's clearly paid off for me like getting big on twitter or getting big on the podcast or whatever like this has clearly helped my life in a bunch of different ways but it feels kind of lame now and i was kind of saying this during the side hill thing i was i was saying to him but i was really kind of just projecting i guess which is like it's like is that it i'm just going to be a guy who tweets and a guy who like goes on youtube is like here's three hacks that you got to know if you want to get big in 2022 it's like oh man i can't bring myself to do that so i'm like maybe i just also say no to that path because feels like a lot of people play that game and it's not one i would have a ton of self-respect for if i won so then that would be a big loss if i achieved it and didn't even feel great about it we should do an entire episode uh next week or the week after and like the decisions that you're going to make yeah yeah i'm starting the process now we'll see how it goes um in do you uh no i'm in no rush do you all right let you do one of your topics and then i'll do another one after that all right so check this out um have you ever read fan fiction like do you read any fan fiction like with with like is that like a thing you do what what is that okay that answers my question well i i i maybe maybe i do it but i don't know what it is fan fiction is basically like um imagine okay you read like it for me i read harry potter harry potter is great i'm done with the books but i want more harry potter i love that world i love the characters all that stuff so then there's people who are super fans who will just go write their own as if they're jk rowling they'll go write it they'll post it on our website and then you can go i i i don't i play sports yeah exactly my tendons and ligaments work so now i don't do that um ben i'm curious just quick yes or no do you uh do you know anything about this world or not a very very little amount okay so that's kind of what i expected and i would in my mind i'm like well that's the case for everybody like you know it seems like a really really niche thing but sam i know you know about this business wattpad and yeah um i just want to tell you some things about fan fiction it's insane so so there's probably all women though right what's that it's probably almost all women i would imagine it's 80 women i don't know it's it's majority i don't know if it's 80 it might be 70 or 60 something like that but it's somewhere in that range i think 70 80 is is about right on the writer's side for sure i don't know on the reader's side but i think it's also there so okay let me just tell you some interesting things two of the biggest books in the last like 25 years started as fan fiction so uh twilight started as fan fiction and then the whole vampire series and then 50 shades of gray started as a fan fiction of twilight and 50 shades of gray became that right so like these were best-selling books became billion dollar box office movies on top of that for the twilight series and um that's insane okay so then now you go to wattpad and you you look up the traffic for wattpad and you're going to see that wattpad gets almost 200 million visitors a month has almost 100 million registered users you should explain what wattpad is wattpad is basically a website where you can go and you can write fan fiction and upload it or you can read it right so it's the same way like youtube you can go and upload a video or you can watch videos wattpad is that for people writing kind of like fiction basically um and they sold uh about a year ago for about 600 million dollars in cash yeah they sold to a korean company called naver for for 600 million and you i remember you told me something about them way back in the day i think you knew the founders or our friends i remember you and our buddy uh so we were talking you guys both had met these founders you had something interesting to say i don't know if you feel free to say whatever your impressions were then no i don't know what you're talking about okay maybe it was you maybe it was our friend um but they were like yeah i met the founders and like this business is actually crazy it gets a crazy amount of traffic it's super like under monetized right now and um yeah just like i met them and they're super cool like they love their community but like they're never gonna make it like in terms of like building it into a business like it could be a juggernaut giving them out of traffic it has and i found this to be true for for them and as i was looking up the traffic i saw they were ranked number two in the books and literature categories i was like what's number one what could be bigger 200 million visits a month that's more than like wall street journal new york times like this was more than like sure huge websites and so um i'm like what's number one and it's this website called archive of our own you ever even heard of this no keep going i love it i'm looking all this up as you talk 300 to 400 million visitors a month archive of our own and it looks like like a craigslist type of website it's like basically like a wiki um like it's like a website with no images you know what i mean it's like a fucking if a library was like a website it would look like this and that was the intention so basically i was like this is really big and it got me thinking about fan fiction it's got me thinking about this whole the all these genres right like um and i started connecting all these dots it's like i remember when i moved to san francisco there's a street in san francisco that they call billionaires row and on billionaires row you got you know a bunch of tech tycoons who you know are billionaires the biggest and baddest house of them all belongs to danielle steel danielle steel and then i was like wrote like hundreds and hundreds of basically is it like erotic or just like romance related romance novels yeah one of the best-selling authors of all time out you know has a bigger house than you know founders of of you know what's his name sacks david sacks yeah like all these huge companies and so then you and i'm like daniel steel that sounds really i remember when i was growing up my mom probably read like 50 of these books my mom loved danielle steel she used to read all these books i'm like maybe this genre maybe this little niche is like bigger than i thought so i was thinking a little more about it so there's some crazy stuff so so one of the the backstory of this archive of our own because where the hell did this come from and basically what happened was there was this in 2007 there's a website that gets started called fan limb and they're like we're gonna fan fiction is a great niche we're gonna build like an awesome website make a bunch of money it's gonna be great and it's a bunch of dudes building this company and all the users were women and they were like at some point the women were like it's kind of annoying the way this business is running and that all these men are like trying to like monetize our work our hard work of like our attention on the reader side and our writing on the writer side so in 2009 one of the writers called naomi woman named naomi she writes a blog post and says we need an archive of of one's own and that was playing off this thing a room of one's own by virginia wolf and it's basically this idea that writers need space time resources to create and she's like we just need our own not this fan lib thing and so a bunch of volunteers create archive of our own and that's this thing that now does 300 to 400 million visits a month it's a non-profit and they run entirely off donations like wikipedia so they raise basically 350 000 in donations there's 700 volunteers that run this thing and it cause and it just covers the burn rate of the actual like bandwidth to run the site basically and yeah you can you can look up the non-profits called organization of transformative works and they're you can look up all non-profit sales it's only like eight hundred thousand dollars a year and what's interesting is this their logo says archive of our own launched in 2007 but it says archive of our own beta it's still in the beta and so and so this uh and like the top fandoms okay so what what what is it what do you do so it's like you're a fandom of some world or characters or whatever and then people write their own remix of that story they'll take the liberty to like write their own and so you have the top ones are marvel sherlock harry potter supernatural those are the top ones and um it's it's just kind of crazy and so um like for example the original lord of the rings is like the trilogy plus the next two books was like a total of 750 000 words 750k a fan has written uh like a fan fiction version of lord of the rings like the extension and it's over five million words it's like seven times longer that somebody's just written for free right this is like extreme passion and you know better than anyone like these are like red hot signals for where you're like oh my god like you can make so much money where if you're a greedy pig like us you're like oh there's a bunch of energy and passion and enthusiasm but probably some broken tools or like under invested in infrastructure can i go in and build something right that's like a general question and um i just got fascinated by the space and it's pretty cool what they're doing so like wattpad basically after twilight 50 shades of gray became big hits they um two things started happening one the publisher started scouting wattpad like crazy so like you know anna todd was on wattpad she's like a scout for for simon and schuster or whatever and offered like a six-figure deal to uh you know a writer on there to basically like option their their like blog posts basically into a book and a potential movie and they created their own studios division um and they're making millions of dollars adapting these fan fiction works into into you know uh actual actual movies from here and they say oh we got this data like the the guy from neighbor he's like we have this data like not only can we see what's popular let's turn that into a movie but we can say we know exactly where they're reading and where they're skipping where they're dropping off we could say chapter one and two are great chapter three after paragraph two they you know people are falling off and five six and seven you know are good but you know need to trim them and um you know they have like hundreds of thousands of comments and they could basically take all that data and try to do a good job with it that's the that's the pitch at least i found this fascinating what do you think i'll give you two data points that i i think show you're you're you're on to something the first one which i brought up is the website lit lit erotica have i told you about that uh this was your home page right what is what is this yeah right uh lit how do you spell it it's uh it's like literature and erotic yeah so lit erotica.com okay i'm there okay so it's the same thing it's this like ugly looking website that looks like it's you know uh built in in the the 90s basically uh what's the traffic for a similar website that it has so this tells me 60 million visits a month to this crazy right text you know website it's a plain text website so it's another example of just these like uh basically lit erotica i think that's how you say it literotica.com it's not like gen z is oh this is some lit erotica man yeah it's it's similar but it's basically like user submitted stories most of them sex based it gets crazy amounts of traffic and i think it's only run by one or two people but now that's another example of one of these like low-key websites that crushes it which is like a nice proof of concept but the second uh proof of concept that actually is a wonderful company is have you heard of fandom yeah fandoms like uh like a wikipedia basically for all the different stories right yes uh so basically any tv show that you care about particularly if it's like animated or a cartoon or something but even if it's not like you go there and it will like give you a list of episodes a list of characters and things like that and i think they have a fan fiction section but what i didn't realize was uh it was started by jimmy wales the founder of wikipedia right and he's actually i think uh as of recently was still the president of the company he sold it the the company was sold and it now does over 200 million dollars a year in revenue and is incredibly profitable it's owned by uh the churning group i believe uh is that tpg no no tpg so this is a different one um so that's just a pe firm yeah one of the biggest yeah so it's owned by like like one of the biggest pe firms in the world and they kill it so i believe that you are absolutely like on onto something spotting like an interesting trend yeah and so i don't know where the opportunity is yet i haven't like sort of done the kind of full exercise of like okay what what's the play here are you um taking it to mobile are you doing some sort of subscription thing and we've talked to in the past about the idea you had prototyped i don't know if you want to should we tell that again or or you think that's covered enough wait i'll i'll i'll we can say it in in 30 seconds which is basically uh my friend and i uh had this idea where we could create like an audible but for erotic stories and we created this really simple website what was it called it was called short but romantic and we drove like uh 500 with the facebook traffic to it we got someone to write a story on fiverr we got someone to narrate it on fiverr and we got like 500 in subscription revenue overnight or over a weekend and i don't think what happened did we we we told we talked about in the pod and then a person went and started a newsletter that was this but only specifically for black women and he ended up selling that business i think after six or seven months for like six figures right yeah i think that's what he said uh i don't know we don't know too much about it so i can't say if it's if it was for real or not but yeah definitely uh definitely a super interesting niche that's like underserved i think not most i think it's underserved most entrepreneurs and most kind of like programmers are not really thinking about this stuff uh but there's a lot of attention i mean fandom gets 700 million visits a month like is it kind of insane right like it's insane these are kind of mind-boggling numbers so um yeah i think that's kind of crazy can i tell you another um slightly like kind of niche almost like um like vice type business have you ever heard of a company called dutchy no so if you just google dutchies try dutchy.com does that is that like a weed thing yeah it's a weed thing so they're basically what they did was they created a like a point of sale system for um for uh dispensaries and and so what dutchy does they they basically they took like the same model of like square or um you know stripe in a way but mostly i think square because they have like sort of the in-person like card reader type thing and they're like look these guys like dispensaries are underserved it's getting legalized in more places and the big companies are never really going to go here because it's like too much you know hair on the on it for them they have too much to lose and so wow these guys are huge though they're huge they they're basically a multi-billion dollar company i think they were valued at one or two billion dollars i think three three billion dollars and they they say they have like 30 or 40 market share which is like kind of inside like a crazy saturation i've seen some things like 800 or 600 million dollars yeah so really really impressive uh in a fairly short amount of time i don't know when it was launched exactly but it is uh it's not like you know yeah 2017. so like you know five years and uh three billion dollars later and um and we talked about this before like you know we one of the early ideas i got a lot of traction on the pod was stripe for vice which is basically like taking payments is a pain in the ass if you're doing anything that is that gets blocked by banks by visa by you know mastercard whatever and um the companies that end up serving you know marijuana porn uh these different industries those companies uh you know end up picking up a lot of adoption very very quickly and can become very very valuable in a very short amount of time dude this is yeah this is fascinating i hadn't heard of this company they're quite big i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better here i'll tell you about another one that is kind of niche but incredibly fascinating and then i actually have a payment story for you as well so google uh group black have you heard of group black no all right so their url is groupblack.co and this company what these guys are doing is incredibly fascinating in how they've inserted themselves so i believe they call themselves a media collective and accelerator but here's the opportunity so in 2020 and 2021 i feel like you hate these sorts of things like media accelerator and collective i feel like if i just told you hey hey man i got a media collective and accelerate i want to tell you about you'd be like oh god yeah i i don't like the language because it does sound fluffy but what these guys are doing is way more fascinating than that so basically 2020 2021 black live matters becomes a thing and a lot of companies advertising companies they publicly state basically it happened with byron allen is one of the guys he's one of the most powerful men in hollywood he's a black guy who owns a a really successful uh production company and he's like look it's just crazy that uh we we black owned media companies aren't getting ad dollars we think it's wrong that mcdonald's isn't advertising with black owned companies and so uh that plus the blm thing a lot of the largest ad agencies in the world like wpp and all these other companies they collectively said all right look we now commit and i actually don't know the exact percentage that uh wpp said but they basically said we're going to give around four or five six percent of our budget to black owned media companies but there's a huge problem with that which is there's actually not a lot of black owned media companies or at least there's not a lot of black owned media companies at scale and when i say like you know they they actually group and one of the world's largest ad firms they call them their clients that they said we're going to spend at least two percent of our ad budgets on diverse owned media and you're like two percent what's that you know who cares two percent that's nothing well it comes out to be like across all the other media companies something like 600 million dollars a year and then mcdonald's is like hey we're going to increase our ad spend from two percent to black owned media companies to five percent it's like well you know who cares that's just a few points that's again another like 75 million dollars a year it's like quite substantial but again there's this problem of there's not a lot of group uh a lot of black owned media companies so this company called group black they went and talked to procter and gamble wpp interpublic all these huge media companies and they go hey commit to spending money with us and we're going to help you deploy it and they say uh yeah okay you know that's like a crazy conversation i don't know how they got that conversation now they have 500 million dollars a year in ad commitments from these companies but they have a problem they don't own any media assets and so at this point they're out there trying to buy bustle you know bustle though it's a it's a women's focused media company that i think does like 200 million dollars a year in sales it's like one of the bigger like new age digital companies out there i think they um you know they're the size of vice refining 29 things like that group m is now making a bid to buy bustle and and then they're also like i've heard rumors that they're in talks to buy vice and so these guys have just totally pulled off this like amazing it's basically a caper if you ask me but like these these like they're like well we spot an opportunity a caper like you know like a like a like it's just like such a bold plan to be like oh you see this opportunity you know of course like i'm making it sound like they're just like these evil scheming guys i don't think that's actually the truth but like it is like an interest it's basically like a coup it feels like where it's like oh we see this opportunity we're going super big and we're going to pounce on it and so now they're out trying to buy media companies that could support them spending 500 million dollars of ad budget a year which is huge that's substantial i don't know how much money buzzfeed makes but i bet you it's in it's probably in that ballpark and so let me understand what you're saying what you're saying is they saw the demand to advertise on black owned media companies there's like there's not enough inventory there's not enough supply so let's just go buy media companies and then turn them black by buying them well right i don't know i don't know now right that's what you're like oh now yeah they're they're black owned now and so it's like well that's what i mean that's what's fascinating about it you know and there's like there's nuance to this and i don't entirely understand everything they're doing obviously but that's exactly what it sounds like they did and so they're saying well let's go get some black owned companies but before we do let's go talk to wpp and all these other companies and make sure that they're really in and so oh hey look uh and so they go to blackstone or some other private equity firm they go hey look we have 500 million dollars of commitments partner with us to go and buy these five media companies and it's like a guarantee that we're going to have increased revenue from it okay now i understand why you love this so much how fascinating is that if they could pull this off so they're in deep talks this is according to axios they're in deep talks to buy bustle which was going to go public they're in talks to buy a few other media companies and it's just like crazy my first million is up for grabs yeah fellas i'm already brown i'm halfway there how fascinating is this like is this this is this is a caper that's why now you understand why i i called it that they're they're they're seeing opportunity and and i applaud i i they're pouncing on it i think it's incredibly fascinating i don't know a whole lot about this but i have heard that there's a a version of this which is like um a certain percentage of like government contracts and consulting gigs have to go to minority owned businesses and so there's a whole industry of basically like uh middlemen so they go and they win the bid and then they just subcontracted out to a company there's no they themselves don't have like the um company that goes and does the thing they just go win the bids and they're like yep because they fit like a demographic yeah they're like oh like yeah and i think magic johnson does this the basketball player i think i think i had heard that this is like part of like kind of one of his like business uh strategies or like you know something that's helped his business do well which is that like he wins all these bids because they're one of the few you know minority uh led businesses and then he doesn't actually it's like wow i didn't know he has a construction company he's like no he doesn't he just then farms out the construction to a subcontractor who does the construction and they keep their their vague and i was like oh that's also really you know smart but you know a cynical person would would look at it differently dude it's fascinating and i read about this and a friend who had talked to them told me about it and i was like oh that sounds pretty skeezy and then i started thinking about it and i'm like no that's not skeezy at all like they're just trying to get theirs and they are playing by the rules of the game and like if you do believe there's injustices they're out there making it right you know they're getting theirs so i i applaud them uh and so i think it's really interesting it's just if they're able to pull this off it will be very fascinating to me all right i gave you a dutchy now let me give you a quickie so here's the here here's a quick one have you seen the kia car rebrand hello yeah dude the the it's it's looks like kw it's supposed to be kn but it looks like kw or something like that it's really supposed to be kia kia but it looks like kn uh oh it's it's supposed it's not supposed to be kn no that's the problem it looks like kn and it's supposed to just be kia but the i and the a are like joined and kind of like slanted whatever yeah it's horrible put the picture on screen so uh uh this guy um ashwin we've talked about him before schwinnebago his his his his handle on twitter he tweeted this out he goes the kia logo is so unreadable that at least 30 000 people a month are now searching for kn car ever since it debuted and you could go see it like search volume go from like flat for kn car to like pretty significant now and um and so i have a friend who uh i met recently that is a i'm gonna get him on the podcast we're gonna do an episode with him but he is a master of these like internet arbitrages and he previously had done one like this and somebody we were slacking about it and he goes oh my god this is exactly the type of arbitrage you would do he goes that's right up my alley and he and i go so what would you actually do with this information because most people are just going to make fun of oh the logo sucks haha move on and he's like so he's done this before so he uh when i when i was talking i was like oh you're super successful now how did you get like wealthy for the first time in the first place it was the first successful thing you did he goes it's kind of embarrassing but like you know back in the day i tried a bunch of stuff that wasn't working and then i just like i went to um paradisepoker.com i wanted to play poker and i misspelled paradise i didn't know how it was supposed to be a pair of dice is it paradise with a s like what is it he's like i realized that i went to the wrong one i just went to like a dead page and he's like that's crazy i probably bet a lot of people misspelled this so he's like i just bought paradise poker instead of paradise poker and he's like yeah that's all i did and he's like so then i had this website i was getting a bunch of free traffic from google uh this is how much traffic google would before google would autocorrect and um he's like so i got a bunch of and so i was like i became one of the number one affiliates for paradise poker uh because and so he's like so that's how i made my first start i was like a kid and i was making you know like tens of thousands of dollars a month just off this like typo basically and then he's did this many many times i'm gonna have him come on and tell the full story but he did one where tesla was doing a um uh referral program where like if like five people bought a tesla you from your code you would get a free tesla roadster which is like their hundred thousand hundred twenty thousand dollar car and he's like challenge accepted and he like built a site that would immediately became like the top ranking like tesla like whatever like blog or i don't even know what he did i think what he did yeah i think he did one with like that he ended up getting he's like i got a tesla roadster then i you know every day i would like earn a new tesla roadster it's like hey dad you want a tesla roadster okay you get the next one i got my brother one and i got another one then my friend got one he's like tesla shut down the whole program they had to stop the entire marketing program that they had been pushing because like within a month i had like pillaged it and it was like winning too many free tesla roadsters he goes no way uh he's like i was like what else give me more he just has like this endless supply he's like yeah i've like haven't paid for uber and like years i was like what and he goes yeah like back when uber had their like you know referral program i um i just built a website that was like comparing lyft versus uber like like fare estimator he's like i built a fair estimator that would estimate what does it cost to take an uber versus lyft right now and um from your destination he's like so then and then i would just get lyft credits or uber credits he's like so you know i have like millions in uber credits from this site we have to get this guy on just to talk about all these stories he's amazing um so so then i asked him i go what would you like what would you actually do with this kn thing because i i don't really understand how these work and like i only understand the high level and he's uh he goes well i would go to someone in fleet sales at kia at a kia dealership and i would make them a deal that if i send them leads i want to cut of the sales he's like then i would just then i would start ranking for all their newest cars like kn tell your ride like instead of kia tell your ride kn tell your ride 2023 kn this kn that and i just rank for each of the cars individually and um and then i would basically be capturing their intent that you know they this person wants is interested in buying a car and i would sell that lead uh to one of the the fleet sales people he goes the only problem is that google's autocorrect now is um is much better and so you would need to find the like terms where it's not being autocorrected which like you know whittles down the opportunity here but i was like awesome there's people whose brains are wired like this and uh it's kind of incredible to me it's not a skill set i've ever had am i friends with this guy no damn yeah we gotta have him on i'm interested to hear all these things all these schemes yeah it's one of those things though that i'm like uh you know we've had these situations where we have a dinner with somebody and the conversation is amazing you're like god i wish i could have just pushed record this would have been a top five podcast episode ever where'd you meet him and then we invite them on and uh and then they're like they like forget all their stories they're like they like you know very very bland and you're like dude come on like say the good things that you told me before and like that's my only fear is it was so good that i want the pod to be equal to that i don't want any slippage from that conversation how'd you how'd you meet him uh well that's part of the story that i'll tell when he comes on i can't tell that part right now um so that's part of the story um all right i have one yeah i've got one for you have you heard of this guy named uh jared isaacman does that ring a bell never all right that's my billi of the week million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars all right so he's 39 years old have you heard of shift for payments no all right so shift for for payments it's basically like square but less known uh so this guy he started it when he was 16 he dropped out of high school and he worked at a payment processor processing company and it took like a month for somebody to get a new credit card he said getting a new credit card back then was like getting a mortgage you had to apply through all this paperwork and he's like that's kind of nonsense so at 16 years old he convinced his grandpa to give him ten thousand dollars and he goes and he starts a credit card processing to get the reader or to get a card uh sorry if you uh if you own a restaurant right or if you own uh a sandwich shop and you say oh i want to be able to like collect credit card payments it was like getting a mortgage it was it was it was very challenging and they didn't really help you set it up and it just was cumbersome but he said oh i can make this way better so at 16 he got a ten thousand dollar loan and he starts building this business where he gives people their credit card processing with just one or two pages of an application and one or two days wait and then he gives you the the hardware for free and so it's just he just takes a small cut of all the dollars that go through it and he builds this company doing that bootstraps it up to like the point where he they're creating uh they're processing like a billion dollars plus of revenue uh and so he builds this big thing it's called shift for payments originally it was called united bank card he started it in pennsylvania he was pretty low-key but he bootstrapped it for 15 years and sold 53 of the company where he was able to make like 250 million dollars at a very young age and uh eventually he takes the company public it's public now and now he's worth uh like 1.5 billion dollars at the age of 39.

very few people talk about him so that in itself is amazing but here's where things get really interesting when he was around 26 the company's like 10 years old he's making some money he's trying to blow off steam so he gets really into taking flying lessons and so he takes flying lessons for like two years and after two years he gets so into it that he says i want to try and set the world record for the fastest around the world flight in a light jet so basically from new jersey to alaska in 61 hours he does it and that's like a really big deal and he raises a hundred thousand dollars in charity for it and it's like this really big amazing thing and so clearly this guy isaac he's got this like personality of like i go all in on stuff so he gets into a hobby and he like makes it into like a real thing but at the age of 28 he starts uh or sorry at the age of 26 he steps it up a notch and so he actually forms a crew of people who start doing um uh like shows so you know like uh fourth of july you see like an aircraft or like a like a like a flying i don't know what they call it what do they call those things yeah like an air show like an air show like he forms a group of people that are doing like uh acrobatic stuff for like the indie 500 at nfl games and he does things like that and he turns it into like a small company and he calls it the black diamond jet team and it has a few other retired pilots and so he starts getting embedded in this world and so at the age of 28 he starts this thing called wait where what's it called it's called um draken so it's called draken international he's only 28 years old great and he starts so strong yeah draken international is the name and basically the premise is he starts hanging out with these retired pilots who are part of his like a little flight show side business and he realized that the air uh the military at you know post 2008 they're like hurting for money there's a financial crash and they are basically have the way that they would train pilots is they would get people who should be out in the field like doing whatever the air force does they would pull them out to go and train other pilots and that's incredibly inefficient and they lose money on it and they say this isn't sustainable and he goes i see an opportunity and so he starts draken international which is a flight instructor school for the air force and so the air force goes to draken and they go hey help us train our pilots and he goes out and he hires tons of retired pilots uh retired air force people gives them a job and they now are getting contracts but it takes like four or five years to get their first contract but they get their first ever contract and it's 280 million dollars a year or i don't know if it's actually a year it's a 280 million dollar contract sorry over five years and that's the air force paying draken in order to go and train all these uh pilots and at this point this guy he owns this company called draken isaac does and they have the world's largest privately jared isaacman sorry jared whatever tomato tomato jared you're awesome regardless of your name at this point now they own the world's largest privately owned military uh tactical jet aircraft so they have the largest collection in the world and this guy he's only 39 years old people never talk about him and now he's doing all this other crazy like going to space and stuff like this just one of these guys who goes all in on things on totally separate industries totally unknown incredibly fascinating guy wow uh that is amazing how did you find out about this guy uh well michael the guy who does uh our tick tock told me about him and i thought it was crazy fascinating and i just read a forbes article about him and i thought he was crazy interesting i think he's based out of like pa like and so shift four they basically do like the credit card processing i think for like little caesars and like arby's so it's not like right they're not like the sexiest thing but they kind of kill it it was bootstrapped and he's just incredibly fascinating guy so when i read about this person i was like how is this how is this guy not more well known yeah that's amazing there's a lot of people that are like this like for every elon there's like you know we had brian johnson on that episode i think will have come out by the time this comes out brian johnson is very elon musky very very a lot of musk in him right like that guy that guy's got a lot of musk in him and and you you find this where like the number one person is like you know super well known but then there are like 10 other people that are very very similar that are completely under the radar and my favorite move is i go buddy up to those guys because i'm like oh wow you're amazing but also you're not inundated with people trying to get your time and attention and um and i find you fascinating so you know i want to i want to hang with you oh and and it's way easier to network with that person than continuing to just email mark cuban you know on loop or email you on musk or whoever trying to get their attention and tweet at them and you know be like they notice me you know notice me please dude and i've met a few of these people there's this other guy uh greg mercer who i'm friends with in in austin he started a jungle scout there's a few of these guys that i've met and they have this energy that is another one is um brett adcock who started archer it's like the flying car company before that he started uh vetery which is like a job board basically that he sold for 100 million dollars his next company they're making robots and i've met some of these people and there's a few commonalities that they have one they're incredibly logical but two they're very emotional in the sense of like why are you doing this and they'll say because it's awesome because this is so cool like they just like although they're logical of like well i'm just going to call this person they're going to tell me x y and z then i'm going to go and like deploy this much money and like maybe by year four i think we'll figure it out but if it doesn't work that's okay because then we'll do this this and this so like they're pretty logical but they also balance this incredible amount of contagious enthusiasm whenever i'm around them i just feel like good about myself i'm like oh you just make this sound so easy and they're like well it's it is pretty straightforward you just do this this this and i just i'm going to take a lot of risk but these people like are incredibly you leave them feeling hyped and uh i don't think if i hung out with elon i don't think i would feel hyped when i left him but there's these other guys that are arguably as smart maybe slightly less successful but still uber successful but i leave them and i feel like oh you're you're quite relatable and i've like caught your content your your enthusiasm and so i love these types of people yeah that's a i think that's a good good description of it you know like that um they call it the midwit meme uh what's that it's that meme where there's a curve and there's like the it's hard to describe a a meme that's like visual but like okay it's like a bell curve and on one side is like the ogre and on the other side is like the jedi genius and in the middle is the stressed out anxious guy with like a vein bursting through his forehead oh yeah and basically it's like you know there's a few you know and then it's always like what's what is the thought process and so like you know for in this case it would be like the idiots like rockets are cool or like you know jets are awesome and the other guy the jedi is like jets are awesome and then the middle guy is like you know but given getting government contracts is really hard and this is like you know like a thousand word spiel about why it's a good idea and a bad idea and it's like all the pros and cons jumbled up together it's over analysis right and i've actually come to believe i was going to make this kind of a bigger video but i'll say it here and i'll flesh it out later i think most like most of life comes down to that midwit meme that midwit me might be the most insightful meme i've ever seen in my life uh so much you know that's like for example let's say let's just break it down into something non-business let's sit let's pretend you're in a fight with your wife you're in a fight with your wife um you could you know the the middle guy the stressor vein busting out the forehead type of dude is basically like you know but she said this and she always does this and then yeah i i did say that but what i really meant was right it's like this whole thing trying to be right about a situation and then the jedi and the idiot would both just be like yeah but you know i love her it's okay right like and they move on and they don't they don't fuss with any of the bs that the guy in the mid the midwit in the middle does and um and i think that all everything is like that everywhere i walk in life i'm just seeing the midwit meme i'm like you know you know i just see it in business i see it in relationships i see it in like parenting i see it in my kids like my kids are like this i'm like oh yeah they figured it out like dogs and kids have it figured out they understand they're like more like the jedi and and they or the ogre in either case like yeah they don't have it fully formed but they understand like this is fun i'm gonna do this and have i'm gonna be playful and smile and laugh and it's not that serious right like and that's how i think most adults end up converging on that middle of the bell the bell curve where they're over analyzing everything and thinking through all this and you really just want to be the jedi you just want to be the jedi who's like this is awesome or um you know we need to like we need to do this right or um you know like i'll figure it out right like there are certain like three word kill shots you have when you're when you're operating like the jedi and um and that's what that's more how you want to be do you remember boosted skateboards did i ever tell you about when i hung out with him no so years ago do you remember boosted skateboard it's like a skateboard that was motorized it was like before all the scooters and stuff so it was like a pretty big deal and uh i remember i met the guy who founded it one time so boosted skateboard it's a skateboard that goes like 30 miles an hour and i met the guy who started it and i was asking about his background and i believe he like worked in nasa and like these like really big hard problems and he was like telling me all about his background then he was telling me all about the boosted skateboards and like the science behind it and the mechanics behind it and how it's so uh interesting and it's actually way more technical and then i remember saying like yeah but like do you skateboard he goes no i didn't until i got into this and i was like so you know like why'd you leave like nasa to do this and he's like because a fast skateboard is awesome like he just said like because it's because it's badass or something like that i was like yeah yeah you got a good point yeah yeah you're correct it is it is in fact awesome and i remember he said that to me and i was like that is just the best answer that is the best answer of like having a guy like telling me all the technical aspects of something and and like how it actually means this this and this and but then just his reason for why he's even started on the first place wasn't passion it wasn't anything else or was it to make money it was just because it's dope and i remember thinking you're my hero yeah if you look at what like the stuff that elon does i think it's very similar right it's like um you know whether it's like the need based one where it's like yeah we're gonna need another planet right like yeah we'll use this one this one will be done and we're gonna need another one right that's like the this for like you know a spacex type of company or it's like um you know because it'd be awesome to like go to mars so i'm gonna like i'm gonna try to do that period it's just the best end of end of reasoning end of justification end of analysis right like you could just start with that or it's like same thing with electric cars it's like um yeah like because your cars cars should be electric it's better for the environment period not like oh do you know no no car company's been started in 100 years and manufacturing is totally different than software it's a completely different ball game and you know financing is gonna be tough and then you know the batteries it's like yeah you could analyze everything but like at the end of the day and same thing with like you know as much as i find elon obnoxious i think he truly does do the midwit meme where he's like um you know twitter it's like twitter should be awesome and it's not like that's basically his thing he's like twitter's awesome in spite of everything being bad about it right like they're doing dumb things but like twitter's kind of awesome even still twitter should be really awesome dude the best example of this is like when he was talking about like uh i don't remember exactly but it was like the his spacex and like the rockets and like wait a minute so you're telling me that it's not gonna like fall from a parachute it's literally gonna go up and just right back down he's like you know someone's like why he's like oh it's cheaper yeah uh yeah we need to be able to reuse them yeah he's like we you know we can't just like have this land in the ocean like we gotta like go and reuse it so we're just gonna have it go up and then just come right back down to where it is and we'll we'll figure out how to do that and then it's like it can be done right okay if it can be done then then we'll do it yeah like i remember he says that like if it's not against the laws of physics then we go for it if it's against the laws of physics we don't do it i thought that was great but uh anyway uh this guy uh the booster guy was interesting but yeah this what's his name jared isaacson we call him isaac i'm here the isaac my boy isaac this guy's awesome i love jared isaac man not isaac son dude jared if this gets to you i hope it does i'm sorry i i you know a rose by any other name is that like the phrase it doesn't matter what i'll call you sir whatever you want to be called you're great in my book uh we have we got to get this guy in the pod right he's awesome but ben's back ben can you say why you were gone i had twin or i did not my wife had twins we are pregnant you um you you i remember the day after we finished recording you're like you could just see it on your face like what happened it's like we just had the ultrasound found out it's twins like the implications of it being two not one i mean that is that's a pretty big uh uh fun but also crazy blindside and uh i remember you were wearing it on your face that day how does it feel now good yeah i felt like i'd just seen a ghost uh that day um but it had and you know it's funny i was at a conference that sam was also at and uh steph smith comes up to me and it's like hey i just heard you're having twins i just met this other guy who at this conference who's having twins and you should go talk to him so i went and talked to him and i was like yeah man so what's it like having twins and when i had my first kid anytime you'd ask someone what's it like you know having a kid they'd be like oh it's a lot of work but it's great so steph introduces me to this guy and i'm like hey man what's it like having twins and he goes it's horrible like you're you're gonna die it's so much work like i don't know how you're gonna make it through i was like oh this guy's kind of crazy i found it's a theme i've talked to multiple people and they've all been like buckle up it's not good uh you you should dread it it's gonna be awful and uh my review after uh like a week and a half of having twins is uh not that bad all right for anyone out there who's got a twins there you go at least the first few weeks not that bad sam what does your thing say only money what does that say oh it's only money all right what's that tell me the story i nothing i bought it you know that's just i think that's a good life's motto when you lose a bunch of money it's only money and also when we think about it all the time it's not that important but let me ask you guys a quick question would you ever consider not naming your child right away like getting to know the baby over six or 12 months and then naming them you know it's like if um if i was the california government and then somebody commits a crime here but then they leave and they go to you know um china it's like would you consider going and getting them it's like it's not my jurisdiction that's what's like with with important kids decisions it's not my jurisdiction if i went to my wife and i was like yo we're gonna do something crazy she's like uh no thank you uh next you know you noted uh we will be moving on now dude i had a friend who didn't name his he named his child legally baby and on the child's one year birthday they named her and i at first i was like man i think that's crazy just be normal you know just say how how did they how did they eventually name her so they basically had three envelopes with names that they liked and they laid them out and they let her crawl to one and that's what they named her the one that she crawled to and i was like that's when they explained to me what they're going to do i was like that's just crazy why would you ever do that uh and after a while i realized that's actually fantastic that's that's the way to go uh you know it's kind of weird to name something and i've met another parent that renamed their child after six months and they're like he just didn't feel like a george we're gonna call him bill or something like that and i actually think that's 100 the right way to do things yeah i think it's pretty common i think my mom was named something else and then changed it uh after like really whatever they changed after a little bit of time my wife's sister same thing after six months they changed her name she was like having dreams and being like her name's not that that's not what it's supposed to be she went and changed her name yeah it's kind of crazy i think it's cool my naming philosophy i have come around to a new naming philosophy which is this it's it's a hack uh for my we we had a boy and a girl for the girl we gave her my mom's middle name and when we told my mom within like five minutes her reaction was well i'm flying out next week like if you need me to stay up past midnight multiple days i'm willing to do it like you could tell there's like a little extra investment of course she's already invested in her grandkids right but like when it was named after her there's like a little extra investment that like clicked on in her brain and when you name them things that are not your parents or grandparents names you're just like leaving money on the table so that's it it's just hilarious name them after parents and grandparents and get that extra help that's like i think that's that's what happens when you read how to win friends and influence people while you're uh you know you're at the hospital baller all right that's the episode see ya you
