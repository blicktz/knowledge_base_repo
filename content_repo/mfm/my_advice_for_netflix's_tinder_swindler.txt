did you watch the tinder swindler no but i saw your picture with it so what's the what's the like the the okay so you guys don't okay so here's here's what happened it's kind of an amazing thing um there's a guy so the document it's a documentary about this guy who goes on tinder and his tinder profile looks like uh you know he's kind of like a normal-ish looking guy but he's like clearly living a cool lifestyle like lots of travel in different climates kind of it wearing very nice clothes that's his profile all right so girls swipe right on him and they start chatting with him and he basically what he ended up doing was he ended up conning women out of money and it was like a ponzi scheme so what he would do is he would meet a woman on tinder take her out on a date kind of wine and diner make it look like he's this baller of a guy and he you know was just like like a prince out of a fairy tale he just loves her the average looking girl who's average job just from an average city and then all of a sudden he's like come on my private jet and come do this with me and they go together and there she's like oh my god it's all happening i am that princess that he picked and he cares for and so he he starts talking to him and his backstory is that he um his dad owns a diamond company and he's the son of a billionaire and if you google you see that this guy's a son of a billionaire so he kind of like had created this profile around that and um and then you know sure enough a month in he's like um hey you know like he's he's like oh you know he sends a picture of his body he's always with the bodyguard he's like my bodyguard got attacked oh my god and she's like oh my god is he okay he's like yeah but you know they're telling me i can't use my credit cards anymore because they're tracking my location you know like these are enemies for our company the diamond business is a ruthless business and he's like uh can i borrow your credit card for the time being while i uh you know because i can't use mine yet and she's like uh okay and he's like cool just make sure you get your limits raised because like i have business meetings and all this stuff so these women end up going like 150 200 000 in debt as he racks up credit card debt then he's like hey go get a quick loan and send me the money i need it because you know my enemies are after me and he's like my enemies are after me and so you the documentaries the first half the documentaries these women talk about how they fell in love and the second half is like how they got conned basically and he's like a ponzi scheme so he's well he'd fall in love with one woman or he'd get them to fall in love with him get them to start giving him money and credit cards he'd be using that to whine and dine the next woman and then he would be doing this with multiple women at once telling them all the same things and then he was living this like extravagant lifestyle on all these women's dime and um and then you know so that's that okay that's the core of the movie quick reaction to that then i'm gonna tell you some other stuff well what happened to him so how does this end it ends with he gets exposed so the women are like oh my god you know they they go to the credit card company they're like look i have to be honest like my kind of boyfriend you know or i don't know what's going on this is the guy he's tricking me and like they he's there can we see a picture of the guy and he she shows a picture on her phone and the two like agents from like amex or whatever just look at each other like it's him and then she's like what it's like we've been after this guy for years uh he does this with tons of women they're like there's other women he's doing this too and so it's like they feel cheated on plus conned and um and so he but technically what happens is is he breaking the law he's not breaking the law they are giving him money they're sending him money willingly and they are um you know they're giving him their credit card and they're calling the credit card company and saying no no it's me can you please raise my limits yes i'm traveling i'm in i'm in the i'm in abiza right now and so they're like uh you know you're in a kind of a sticky spot you can't really say he stole it you clearly gave it to him uh in fact you kind of committed fraud but like well whatever we'll leave that aside but like yeah you do owe this money like this is not um this is not you know a stolen credit card and so anyways how much did he get he ends up getting a 15 month sentence for not even for this it's for like something else that he did like associated with this um he serves five months he gets off free he's out there living he's got a new model girlfriend he lives somewhere else um the girls kind of like exposed him in the press because they were like okay look law enforcement's not doing anything or it's going to take too long he's going to keep doing this in the meantime they go to the norwegian press where they're from and they they kind of like expose it then netflix turns it into a documentary and uh and so the guy's still out there and one of the things in the movie is he goes to a plastic surgeon and he's like i want my eyes cheekbones chin mouth all restructured and this guy's like i'm not gonna do this only a criminal would want this surgery and so he's like trying to change his face so he could keep it going but he can't change his face and now he's like you know kind of like public enemy number one but a lot of people who watch this are like dude these girls are stupid you yeah you were just with him for the money and then he conned you for the money you got what you deserve so the girls are getting a ton of flack for it which is really crazy that's that's that's dumb but i was just thinking what a waste of talent by this guy yeah that's pretty amazing it's like it's like a it's like a you know what's funny is like leonardo dicaprio played the same character in catch me if you can and it was awesome yeah he's became like a hero when i see this guy i want to punch him in the face yeah exactly that was the problem it was a documentary instead of a movie about the con man itself where you sort of fall in love with this smooth guy uh yeah if a different if if like a lovable if like if like matt damon played him i would be all about it yeah you gotta watch the thing it's super punchable face this guy yeah um and the memes are just amazing uh around well i saw the meme with you with your face on it yeah yeah i had somebody i was like hey photoshop my head onto onto this photo where it looks like i'm with the guy and i just tweeted out like oh i'm with my sister's new boyfriend like is he american no this guy is israeli dude screw this guy man i i uh i'm happy they made a documentary about him how did he get all the uh so he's in a private jet and a bunch of these pictures how did he get that because he's using the previous woman's money to fund his his lifestyle so he would fly private yeah yeah so he's actually flying private i don't know all the time but at least some of the time and uh it was just really wild in fact a lot of the numbers don't make sense like he must have been running this on like tons of women at once to fund this lifestyle because these like the jets and the stuff that he was doing like okay he called this woman out of 80 grand but 80 grand it funds like one month of this lifestyle you know like that's not very long so he must have had a lot of people at the same time or the documentary is a little inaccurate i don't know but how much money did he get they said that he had conned women out of millions of dollars uh over over time um they didn't say exactly how much they don't know you know how much of it what was there but but i just feel like he did this all wrong like if you're gonna do all this effort you gotta be more intelligent right like okay what could he have done um could have just married rich could have just seemed rich married rich divorced took half right like that would have worked uh way way you know put more wood behind fewer arrows here and he could have just gone one very wealthy person if he really wanted to do this that's my first critique of him uh my second critique of him is bro all this money to just party partying is exhausting like he just wanted to fly private and go to these clubs and do table service like you know you couldn't pay me to do that i don't even want to travel you gotta diversify your assets dog yeah you should have he should have owned some crypto like buy something buy a home do do something with this money you just blew all the money on overpriced you know like bottle service at the club like wow all right that's critique number two um number three go b2b bro corporate swindling would have worked way better so you know he could have been like you heard about the guy who just started sending invoices to microsoft and apple and stuff and just got paid like millions of dollars just sending bogus he was just sending an invoice to accounts payable or whatever and uh and then they would just pay some of the invoices did what did he just do like like ap at microsoft.com yeah he was like he's like hey you know this is for the uh blah blah blah and like and then they went back and they're like what the hell is this who is this vendor that we paid 1.1 million dollars to this year like nobody knows who this is i don't think that's illegal either uh i think it is because he was like you know uh well whatever they were going back after him you know these companies a lot of money so that's the downside of going b2b i feel like there could have been a b2b way of doing this should have actually just started a diamond company could have made a lot more money if you're this good at getting women's emotions tied up in your your lifestyle just actually sell the diamonds it would have worked use their money to fund a diamond company that actually could have worked this guy needs to be needs to be in the facebook ad manager instead of tinder that's my that's my critique of this guy i'm looking at him now the all those these women who he scammed like a lot of them look like models like he was killing it also like you forgot the other option which is like just marry one of these ladies if they're rich enough to like if they're these beautiful women who could wire them 200k like i don't know man bro maybe got a keeper well in this case he's like he was telling him like go take like a kind of like a collateralized loan or a payday loan and like super high interest don't worry he's like i'm gonna wire your money back in four days and then he would like not wire them back and then they'd be like hey did you wire the money he's like oh sorry they are like the bank was closed okay and then he would like show them a statement he'd be like i sent it should arrive in a couple days she's like hey it hasn't arrived yet what's going on like their interest is building up on this like flash loan you had me take he's like oh my god let me call the bank another two days go by he's like called the bank they said this thing got frozen i gotta i gotta deal with this i'm so sorry here uh you know i'm gonna send you one of my watches in the meantime you could just sell it this watch is worth a hundred thousand dollars send them a fake watch and you just buy time doing that it's like these women didn't have the money but like i think he could he could have totally gone for a richer woman and then been like you know what baby like i love you i'm not gonna make you sign a prenup you know me i'm a billionaire uh i come from this lineage but i'm not my dad says sign a prenup i'm not gonna do it and then she would feel a little bit of pressure would be like okay i guess i can't really ask him for a prenup anyways this guy's richer than me all right i guess i also won't that would have been a more effective con if this guy were in jail do you think he'd be popular or hated i think popular sadly you think popular i think i think popular i could see this going either way man i could see this i could see this going either way i think like the swindler in prison would he like all right so bernie made off i heard in prison was like a god which i get i get that you know like he could teach people how to like corner like the chocolate chip or the chocolate uh hot chocolate market like in prison like he could like you know or he could like you know dominate the commissary and he could like teach you about markets i get that and also there it wasn't a violent crime so no children or women would hurt like this guy is he i would see this guy being unpopped uh i don't know that's a good question he's got kind of like a douchebag aura to him so that's the problem that's that's where he's gonna get in trouble but uh but the swindler the swindler would do well in prison this is a good documentary i guess i'll watch it how many episodes he's not in prison he's out and about he's he's living a nice life right now oh screw this guy man and he sold a couple million dollars yeah i think i think about i think this documentary is good punishment though that's fair i'm okay you're not serving time and you have this documentary about you our buddy jack butcher pointed something out that i was like oh wait a minute that's true he's like yo netflix is gonna make a lot of money off this documentary pay off these women's debts they have like a gofundme going it's like yo netflix you need to pay off this woman's two hundred thousand dollar debt that's true you did well on this documentary so that's the uh that's the real call out here netflix cancel netflix if they don't pay off these women's debts that's a no-brainer you don't think they're going to well nobody said anything these women are doing interviews everywhere there's a gofundme out there i feel like i feel like they could have said or they're just you know swindling people one good thing that you know we didn't make a lot of money off this but netflix actually generously did agree to pay off the debt you know uh blah blah blah that i feel like that story should have come out if they did it if they didn't then fire your either fire your pr person netflix or pay off this pay these debts you you
