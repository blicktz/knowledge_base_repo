this is like nothing i've ever experienced um i know there are some analogies like you said 9-11 i saw this great tweet from this guy his name is yishan wong i don't know if you know who he is he's he was the former ceo of reddit he was like an ex-facebook guy yeah ceo of reddit for a while really smart guy i love following him on twitter he doesn't have that many followers but he says a lot of smart shit um that i just basically steal and then save myself later um and he was saying he was like you know this coronavirus thing is so different from like the last thing that felt like this was 9-11 and he goes this is so much harder for americans he's like because when it was 9-11 um the response was all bravery patriotism action revenge uh it was it was all action things and there was a clear visible enemy it was like okay you know sort of the terrorist bin laden you got this picture in your brain that you could sort of point it to he's like with this we have an invisible enemy you can't see the virus you don't know who has it you don't know who doesn't so we all just have to hide and um the best course of action is inaction and that's very strange for people and uh it reminds me of this quote by uh pascal which is it's like all of man's problems come down to i'm butchering the quote but it's like all of man's problems come down to the fact that um he cannot sit alone in a room uh for 30 minutes it's basically like being able to just sit in your house and chill and it's so difficult for people you know it's funny there's i was talking to a co-worker i'm like there's two things that a lot of people want and then they get it and it freaks them out and this is a little taste of that which is uh people talk about retiring they want enough money that they could retire and a lot of people want to work from home and i've gotten a lot of shit from the work from home crowd because i'm because i keep saying i hate this i hate it i love coming into the office and feeling energy and uh i retired what not retired i took i've taken eight months off at a time and it gets boring fast and what we're seeing now is that some people are you can kind of taste it a little bit and i personally hate it and so um okay i got i got the quote because i butchered it uh all of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone okay that's the quote i had to correct it because it's such a good quote you
