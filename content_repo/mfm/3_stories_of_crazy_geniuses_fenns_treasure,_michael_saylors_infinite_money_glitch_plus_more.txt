so i think the theme of this episode is rich guys crazy or genius we've got the bitcoin guy who's doing the treasure hunt and he's either crazy or he's a genius right is he crazy or is he awesome ralph loren crazy or genius looks like he came down on the side of genius i have another one for you dude have you heard about this guy who's doing the two million dollar treasure hunt no i have no idea what you're talking about okay well can i interest you in a treasure hunt story yeah two million dollars that sounds good to me there's this guy named john collins black and there's not a lot of info about this guy but he has basically hidden somewhere between two and three million dollars across america right now and different treasure chests so he's got five treasure chests out there each with a bunch of treasure inside and this specifically it's not just like cash it's things that are valuable so he spent the last five years buying valuable kind of artifacts so one of them has you know rare pokemon cards a 2002 holographic charizard card he's got one with george washington's jelly glass that he bought out of an auction there's things from it from old shipwrecks and in total the stuff is worth two to three million dollars he split it between five treasure chests and he's hidden it in physical locations across america and then he released a book that was that's called there's a trust it's called there's a treasure or something like that i buried it there's a treasure inside yeah and it's basically just clues to find his treasure and so there's maps and clues and you can buy this book right now and go find this treasure dude wait hold on it's a this is it's even funnier it's on amazon it's a book on amazon called there's a treasure inside and the book is 35 so he's going to recoup a little bit of it a little bit of it a little bit of it but probably not as much so he's got like you know a hidden a colombian green emerald and all kinds of stuff inside and i find this kind of fascinating so this guy's story is interesting he was like a musician in la that didn't really work out and then he was like okay he started creating uh websites for helping people find jobs and that started going good he used that to buy bitcoin earlier early-ish on a i guess the story is he's a bitcoin multi-millionaire who was also fascinated by adventure and so there's this thing called the fen treasure have you ever heard of this okay yeah fen treasure it's a cache of gold and jewels uh that forest fen an art dealer uh hid in the rocky mountains yes i actually do think i've heard of this i believe zach crockett zachary crockett who used to work for me at the hustle wrote a big article where he spent a week trying to find this treasure how did he do i don't think anyone has found it so so five people died trying to find this treasure because he it was like is it up in the mountains whatever so they're climbing so five confirmed deaths chasing the treasure then he announces somebody found it i think this was in 2020-ish 2022 he says that um somebody found it and then he dies months later it was revealed that former journalist and medical student jack stoof found it and then he auctioned it off for what uh for a total of 1.3 million dollars of what he found and so this guy john or whatever collins black was searching for that in 2020 and so he was like during covet he had he had searched for the treasure he thought this was really cool and when he when we were all in lockdown he decided i'm going to do one of two things he either was like going to create a children's book publisher or create a treasure hunt he did both and so he created this he started accumulating assets for this uh treasure hunt i have a friend named chip forsyth chip forsyth is a crazy person i've been friends with him for 10 years his brother is aj forsyth who started icracked if you remember icracked yeah and chip will go out he's friends with these guys who raise funding to go find shipwrecks that they think have well i guess some of them are valuable just because they're shipwrecks but some of them are valuable because they were like ships that had gold or other like valuable stuff in the in the ship and they raise money to go out and find these shipwrecks and he tells me all about it and it's like the type of story where the people who are into this it's the only drug that fills that need do you know what i mean like it's it's like it is an intoxicating thing to find this like it's romantic there's a romantic idea about a treasure hunt right yeah like it's awesome and so like i understand why it's not my obsession but i understand why it is other people's obsession the other thing i think is interesting is choosing to release a book for this i feel like there's a missed opportunity i feel like he should have done something with tick tock or social media where i feel like there was a more viral way to release the clues or to let people unlock the clues or search for this thing together like a weekly or monthly announcement yeah you know i don't know if you've seen there's these things that go really really viral on tick tock it'll be like some woman say telling this 39 part story of how her husband cheated on her and these things just it's like a true crime they amass like tens of millions of followers that are trying to just follow them they wait for that next piece of the story to drop and i do think that there was probably a way to do this that somebody could do which would be to let do a bit of a treasure hunt but use use social media use tick tock as a way to uncover the clues as they go and then people go in the real world using those clues rather than a book steve bartlett who's the podcast host of uh what's called diary of a ceo before that he had a like an ad agency or whatever before that he worked for me back back when he was maybe 19 20 years old 21 years old something like that he was just like a young guy that we had that's like a growth marketer and his job was to come up with great growth ideas one of the things that he did at the time that i remember was he grew his twitter and instagram accounts like crazy by doing a very simple thing he was doing these like cash drops where he'd put just 200 bucks in an envelope and he would say at a college town i think it was he'd be like we've dropped it here he would post a video of him hiding it and then there would be videos of people going and trying to search for it and they'd be basically they would tweet where they hid it um in some way and then they would tweet people going and finding them but i don't remember if it was him that did this or somebody else that was doing this dude i'm gonna start doing that active strategy that's a great idea it was a great idea and it was like 200 bucks it wasn't even that much money that they were doing and they were doing these mystery cash drops as a way to just generate hype but the genius of it was the content that they created kind of before the drop and then after the drop of people searching it made it feel like a big deal and then they would do the next one and the next one i think it was just an account called like mystery cash drop that was doing this that was working that's getting really big this was like 10 years ago so i'm trying to remember the guy who ran that account messaged me he listens to the pod like it's you never heard of this guy mystery cash drop uh he messaged before we even started the podcast a long time ago no but he still does it like oh yeah it was at hidden cash i think that was cash one of these guys one of these guys just messaged us you don't remember this and uh yeah what for some reason it came into our world where i forget what happened someone tagged us on his twitter thing and he was like i love those guys and then he dm'd me and just said hey something like that so maybe i got this wrong maybe steve wasn't the guy doing it maybe steve showed me this and we were gonna like copy this strategy i don't remember the link steve definitely put me on to this because it was happening both in the in san francisco and also in the uk the account now is suspended for hidden cash which i remember happened back then they got suspended i'm not 100 sure but why but let me just read this article this was back in 2014 so this is literally 10 years ago it says an anonymous benefactor has been leaving cash hidden across san francisco inviting strangers to find it via a series of clues they left money under chairs in public parks and stairways or in public bathrooms and they basically post a picture of them holding the cash and then like a zoomed in thing of where they put it like it's like under a toilet but you don't know which toilet and then they their quote was i've made millions of dollars the last few years more than i could ever imagine and yet many friends of mine cannot afford to buy a home in the bay area this caused me quite a bit of reflection and i'm determined to give away some of the money i make to charity and and to do fun creative things like this and that uh he or she will leave it once or twice a week did somebody should just do this again this is this sounds awesome it would work today i think this is awesome uh i think i'm gonna start doing this the the other day the other day like a hobby it's like uh running we just were jogging we're talking about like i think i'll i think i'll pick up this hobby it's like i want to play real life willie wonka like i just want to like start control i just want to like start controlling people's lives 100 at a time and just seeing like if i can like make all the monkeys dance that's kind of like what this is it's like you're just like want to be a puppeteer a hundred dollars at a time a little bit but it is like kind of fun hey guys so a huge part of the growth of this podcast is thanks to our presence on youtube and without youtube i don't think we'd be as big as we are now and it's all because of you guys for watching we see you in the comments even the negative ones it definitely bothers me but i read all of them and we see how powerful this platform is for growing an audience well if you're planning for the next year and you're thinking about investing in a youtube strategy for your business then you have to check out this new guide from hubspot it covers everything you need so building a content strategy it covers understanding the youtube algorithm and how to leverage seo tactics and then it also talks about the different content types and examples to create engaging content so don't miss out grab the guide and set yourself up for success next year now let's get back to the episode i think one of the problems is like you get that initial hit of like excitement and attention and everyone loves it and then it's going to fade away and then you're going to keep hiding the cash but you're not going to get that same hit so you're going to have to it's like an addict you have to do more in order to get so then you're like hmm you know it'd be a shame if somebody got hurt finding it but that would make for a whole nother news cycle around this and then you sort of ex you just keep escalating the prizes and it becomes weird after a while it's like hey willie wonka why do you have a chocolate river and invite children over all the time like this is just dangerous do you know like at some point it's really hey could you get can we go and touch a dinner and you not like hide twitter dollars while walking into the restaurant the funny thing is we're so old that like everybody who's listening to this that's like under the age of 25 is like yeah you know this is how every youtuber you know tries to get famous is doing this exact same thing yeah they're like what are you gonna do next go give like a homeless guy a hundred dollars and film yourself like giving him a haircut like that exactly exactly i think maybe the takeaway is uh you know what's old is new uh for some of these things like the what the hidden cash is the guy was doing it's not really all that different than what mr beast does and uh has done to great effect all right can i tell you a story about a different way to look at adventure about someone who's like i'm obsessed over a little bit and i think you know this person you know of them and i think i'll tell you a few facts that kind of like shock you but also i think you're going to be into this person more than before so the story is about a guy named ralph lifshitz he was a jewish kid from new york city grew up i believe in the 30s and the story is basically that he wanted to be an actor he grew up poor but he loved like seeing all these movie stars on tv and he was like you know i love that you can dress up and pretend to be another person and if you pretend hard enough people kind of start treating you seriously and start treating you like that person and i love that i love that and i also love the idea that you can write a story and make it a movie and i can live my life through that lens that that the lens of that movie and it gives me hope so he was like intoxicated by this but he sucks at acting and so he's like i can't go to hollywood i can't become an actor however what i can do is i can shape these movies and direct these movies not with a camera but with clothing and so we get super into clothing what kind of leap of faith was that i can shape these movies not through writing or acting but through clothing yeah so pretty ridiculous statement no it's not i'll give you an example so he was like he's got this quote where he was like i love how like these actors like i like you could dress up as like a military person and you kind of feel a little bit tougher sometimes or i could dress up like a farmer and like i actually want to go outside and like get dirty a little bit i could dress up like a cowboy and i want to go and like do cowboy shit like if you dress up with a suit people kind of take you seriously and i think that's cool that you can like pretend but it kind of like what's the difference between pretending in reality if you do it long enough like it kind of becomes like the same thing and so he was like i can't really act but like i can dress up like these characters and i kind of a little bit start actually feeling like these characters and eventually ralph lip shits he got made fun of a lot because his name even like the jewish kids were like dude your name has the word shit in it like that's like like you dork and so he changed his name to ralph lauren and so he starts um that is ralph lauren the the clothing company he starts selling clothes for brooks brothers like in their store and then eventually at the age of 28 he starts uh his own business and he's like my first thing that i'm going to sell is ties he likes ties and he goes and he pitches something like um bloomingdales and he's like hey can you guys sell my ties and the guy's like these are great ties i would love to sell them but it has this name ralph lauren on the back of the tie like no one wants that shit dude like no one knows who you are i don't give a shit about ralph lauren you got to take that off there and he had it's kind of a sylvester stallone moment where he was like look i'm a nobody but i need my name to be on these ties like this is just a deal breaker and bloomingdales was like all right well no we're not going to do this deal and so eventually he keeps on hustling and he gets his ties into like macy's or something like that in the first year of business he does like half a million dollars in revenue which is a home run uh he did this in the 60s that's the equivalent of like three and a half million dollars today home run after year three or four he starts coming up with different ideas and he comes up with this idea of polo so the polo brand the college shirt that you see everywhere and he parlays by the way what's what's the backstory of that what was his inspo do you know for the shirt like the inspo was basically like i said he grew up as this poor jewish kid in new york but what he loved was this idea of like class and old money uh this idea of like wasp even though he's not a wasp he like loved the idea of like sophistication and to him the sport of polo that like screamed like both utility because it's a sport but also like sophistication because it's like supposed to be like a rich people who play it and the collar that polo players wear they would always wear a collar and in particular they would button down the collar so an oxford button down cloth shirt that's comes from the the sport of polo and so do like certain style boots certain style pants and so there was a little bit where it was like already considered like a fashionable sport and so he says like i'm gonna name my brand polo and so he builds polo and this shit over like the course of a handful of years it takes off so now ralph loren he's worth something like 10 billion dollars he still owns i think 80 of the company and he's a great businessman but that's not what i actually am impressed by him what i'm impressed by him is two things the first he has this idea of like you are the director of your own life and your life is basically a movie and he has this idea where he was like i would wear clothes that would i almost i think tony robbins said this or you told me that tony robbins said this where he was like if i want to act tough or confident i make my body tough or confident so what do you call that thing where you like like flexing power posing where you like flex your chest when you're not feeling comfortable and you put your body into like a confident position and your brain kind of follows your body he sort of is saying the same thing but with clothing where he was like you know if i wanted to feel a little bit more sophisticated than i actually felt at the moment i would dress a certain way and like my brain would follow and i find that to be like a really cool idea and the second thing that he did that was really interesting is i don't know if you remember this because we were kids but do you remember ralph loren advertisements do you remember any of those like the photos and magazines no what was it what was interesting is that what he would do is he would yeah he used a lot of the same models and the models oftentimes were not professional models but what he would do is if he wanted to like he would set the stage so basically he would act like he's filming an entire movie and so they would rent a home in the hamptons let's say it's like a uh the ad is for some type of summer summer wear for the beach he would rent a hamptons house and he would be like well if i'm a like a wealthy family in the hamptons who has this like beautiful home like how what would you guys be doing right now like maybe you'd be playing football maybe you'd all be sitting on uh in the parents bed in the morning as if like the kids just like woke you up but he would create these like elaborate sets where he would like make you live like you're in a movie on set and so he's like we're gonna all like pretend that this is like real and they would do this whole elaborate thing just for a handful of photos but if you look at a lot of the ads they're really like in depth and it made me start thinking a lot about like with startups and what you and i do we sometimes are just reactive to like to like whatever like customers are saying not more so like how do we set the stage for what what do we want the world to be and i think amazon used to do this small thing where they're like before we launch any product i want you to write the press release like tell me what do you want a customer to feel about this or how do you want this to be described what it's all said and done right and because the internet has such a low barrier entry and it's really easy to adapt and change things rarely do we sort of think ahead and like this is like my vision for the world and at least everyone in my small world how i want them to feel how i want my customers to think how i want them to uh appreciate us i do think there's something cool that i'm looking up vintage ralph loren ads and i see what you're saying which is like a really heavy lean into like yeah like true lifestyle shoots rather than studio or sort of framed um you know just like let's go here let's get the single shot you in front of the water boom yeah let's turn and burn it's like well this is somebody's house in the hamptons wearing these clothes doing what they do with all of the little you know family photos in the background and whatnot like it's it looks a lot more authentic and this is one of those things that's interesting because as a business person it never pencils out on a spreadsheet to do this right like up up front there is no way to sit here and justify this but then there's things in your gut and there's the the people who do who actually do make the bet and do pull it off and then in retrospect it sounds obvious you know i'll give you an example there is a brand um e-commerce brand and they were talking about influencers it was like well what's the what's they're talking about an influencer campaign they're going to spend a million dollars on an influencer campaign with these instagram moms and i said what's the return on ad spend of that you put a million dollars in how much you're going to get back directly and they're like uh it might be you know 50 meaning we might put a dollar we might get 50 cents back uh that's not the way to do it well what's your face what's your facebook ads return on ad spend and they're like that's like you know a dollar 40 put a dollar and get a dollar 40 out like why are you spending a million dollars on these influencers and uh are you able to measure the halo effect i'm like using all this jargon and he goes uh hey does your wife like does she follow like any of these people and i show my wife and she's like yeah all these people he goes ask them like a couple of questions about these people like hey do you know like how many kids they have what's their names what products do they use what's the last product you bought that you heard them mention and like my wife could just rattle these from memory and my wife's memory is like i could you know we watch all of game of thrones i've had if i asked her today what's a lannister she'd have no idea she thinks it's part of a staircase and so i'm like she's knows exactly what's going on with these influencers and he goes that's why why we're spending a million dollars with influencers and um i was like okay you know there's these things that if the result is not easy to measure but it is true right it's got to be both it's got to be actually actually work and not be easy to measure those things are usually pretty uh mispriced meaning that not as many people are willing to do them because most of us want the safety and comfort of things that are proven measurable and i can spreadsheet my way to conviction well it's basically all rooted in can i justify this if i'm about to get fired yeah or just even my own self doubt right even like my companies i'm not always thinking i'm gonna get fired who's gonna fire me i own the company but i don't want to be an idiot and i don't want to lose it i don't want to fail and i don't want to lose money and it takes courage to make bets and courage is easier when you can put when you win the logic when you can logic your way there when you can spreadsheet your way there do you do any of these courageous bets that are non-spreadsheet because i think you i i think part of the reason you idolize these is that you didn't typically do that i didn't typically do that and i and i still struggle with it but i have to like when i watch some of these things like uh we talked about martha stewart recently now we're talking about ralph loren like when you talk like and when you talk about some of these like culture changing brands or companies or people are us internet or startup people there's like we think we are above the fold where we're like logical and we are like well it's easy you put this much money in you get this much money out like why would anyone do anything otherwise but then there's one step above that which is it's the right thing because it's the right thing like right you know what i mean like it's like it's um like uh you know i can't measure this thing but like i know it's awesome right do it because it's awesome yeah and so there's like we try to act like we are some like savanti internet nerds where it's like the math says x y and z but there's always there's one above that which is yeah but it's it just makes sense and so and peter teal who's like the savantiest of savants has said like there's this fifth tentpole of this equation which is called brand and he goes i don't understand brand though uh but like i don't exist but i don't understand it and that's what we're talking about here which is like it just feels right yeah yeah exactly so so long story short i don't do this but i i respect it and i know that's necessary and i want to do more of it are you doing any of it with hampton like is there one you can think of that you do yeah like we have we own this podcast called money wise and like it like the only way that we think that it returns in roi is if someone joins and they said they heard about it through us but that's that's like the low end of the totem pole of like is it easily trackable right um but then no like i don't do enough but i do need to do certain things like this the the the problem with this is you get caught in the day to day and you also get caught in the bills and there's also a lot of stories of ralph loren where like he almost lost the company many many many times where he like just didn't pay attention and in one hand you need a visionary who doesn't pay attention to the profit because sometimes the that makes the most profit doesn't make sense right off the bat right so i think the theme of this episode is rich guys crazy or genius we've got the bitcoin guy who's doing the treasure hunt and he's either crazy or he's a genius right is he crazy or is he awesome ralph loren crazy or genius looks like he came down on the side of genius i have another one for you all right and it's michael saylor have you seen what michael saylor is currently doing with the market and bitcoin and his stock i don't understand it exactly but i understand that he's always up to something uh like like i i always i know that he's like the barry bonds of business where like there's always an asterisk next to everything he does yeah that's a good explanation um okay so can i explain what's going on microstrategy is a software company they sell um software you know at the time they're selling software products and the software business might make like 75 million a year of profit it was like a small cap stock it had been doing great for like ever like it was a great like he'd been rich for a long time right yeah the business had been he i think he's the longest tenured ceo of a public company meaning he's been the ceo of this company for like 24 plus years or something like that and um but the stock had been flat if you look go if you just zoom out on the chart it looks like a very flat line and when he came on the podcast it was because at the time he was doing something very interesting he had taken his company's cash reserves like their treasury which normally you either keep in cash maybe treasury bills or you use it to buy back the stock and instead he used it to buy bitcoin so basically microstrategy was a software company the software company had hundreds of millions of dollars in their bank account which they're supposed to just hold in case they need it and his plan was i'm going to invest that money in bitcoin yeah we're going to switch our treasury strategy to being bitcoin so september 14th 2020 bitcoin's priced at ten thousand dollars a coin and he buys 175 million dollars worth of it and then a month later or so he buys another 250 million dollars of it which looking back at it that sounds great yeah at ten thousand dollars eleven thousand dollars a coin and he has since been buying uh more and more bitcoin he now holds 37 billion dollars of bitcoin micro strategy microstrategy does he himself also i think personally owns like hundreds of billions if not a billion dollars of bitcoin wow they are up 15 billion dollars on their bitcoin position in four years so he's generated for 15 billion dollars of value doing this strategy so it starts out by saying i'm going to convert my you know step one convert our company's idle cash into bitcoin okay did that but now the company doesn't generate and the idea was every year when we generate more free cash flow we're going to do the same we're going to you know we make 75 million bucks we're going to buy more but over time he starts doing more aggressive bets so what he starts doing is he starts issuing these convertible bonds and now so he goes to the market he says hey our here's a corporate bond you can buy the bond we're going to take the proceeds from the bond sale and we're going to go buy bitcoin and he does that over and over and over again and on top of that if you look at microstrategy stock today so when he was last on the podcast well let's just actually say this in march of 20 the stock was ten dollars in march of 21 the stock was 78 and today it's 410 correct and it is so it's up in the last five years by 2600 okay so it's shot up it's uh if you compare it to even nvidia stock this year it's outperformed nvidia which is pretty insane and so what is going on here um this you know his company is now worth 80 billion dollars as of you know as of today and how much revenue and profit does the actual business the actual software business is declining 10 a year and is something like a couple hundred million in revenue and under 100 million of net income so it is a rounding error it is not it is no longer relevant to the stock price and does he have employees who like work there yeah they still have employees that just keep running that software business but the stated strategy is her job is to uh acquire bitcoin in the most effective ways possible and hold forever that's what he wants to that's a influence uh that's a that's a like an inspiring um talk every friday at your all heads right like that's it bitcoin price is up great job everybody we did our job and uh you know to his credit he's been buying throughout all the dips so like you know bitcoin price went up to 60 000 then it goes down to 16 000 and even during that process you know bitcoin in december 2022 bitcoin price is 17 000 he buys another 50 million he buys another 14 million he buys another 150 million he has continued to buy throughout the whole process and bitcoin's at an all-time high and uh as of today he just bought another 5.4 billion dollars of bitcoin at the uh you know sort of all-time high price how did he have the money to do that again he's raising money in these bonds and so there's okay so what's interesting about this here's what i want to talk about is genius or crazy i guess i hesitated to even bring this up because a this is outside of my zone of competence meaning like i don't know corporate bond strategies i don't know why um i don't know how options traders look at this i don't know what the bond market is like that is not something that i've spent 20 years of my career in i'm a startup guy okay so on one hand unqualified to talk about this on the other hand i've been a crypto holder and believer since far before michael saylor and have seen throughout each cycle how new players come in with new strategies and build you know massive profiles and success on the upswing and i've seen things go very very badly um you know last cycle there was sam bankman freed with ftx there was do quan there was three arrows capital there were several people that for a moment in time looked like absolute geniuses they were hailed by everybody they were on the cover of magazines you know sequoias investing in in ftx and everything looks incredible and then it all comes crashing down either due to bad acting or bad risk management i don't know anything about crypto and i can give you an example of a red flag that was on air on our podcast so i don't remember exactly i think it was 30 or 45 minutes in i asked him a question i go so michael you're buying all this bitcoin with your company's money cool what are the downsides um because like it appears as though like one of the downsides could potentially be you're losing focus on your main money making software um but and i think you think that's worth it but what are some other downsides and his answer was there are no downsides and i was like well i mean like every decision has a downside like the downside of being healthy is that you have to go to bed early when you want to go and hang out your friends like but it's worth it like there there are downsides and he kept insisting there are no downsides and in my head i thought if you can't be honest to me about this like pretty straightforward thing is there anything else that you're being dishonest about yeah there are no downsides said every charlatan ever right that is a uh it is could be a red flag that doesn't mean it's damning no let me know it does not mean it's damning but it's a red flag let me give you the generous interpretation of this so i actually agree with michael sailor in one weird way when he said there's no downsides which is that for him personally there were really no downsides at the time at that time if you go back and you listen carefully to michael sailor's interviews most of the interviews he just talks about how he had the epiphany and he realized that bitcoin is the way and he started doing it the true story is that there's one like precursor to that epiphany which was that he was stuck between a rock and a hard place he had this software business that was successful it was profitable and i think at the time it was even you know had shown growth or had been showing growth over the last 10 years and he was getting zero credit in the stock market for it and he's like what am i supposed to do like we're a successful company we've been operating successfully for you know 15 plus years and the market is basically saying give us back the cash we don't we will not value you for any of the cash you have on hand you should just give it back to us we're going to give you no stock credit for how you might invest it how you might use that cash how you might grow your business we're going to give you zero credit for it and so he had this problem which was no matter what he did with his company at the time he couldn't get the stock price to go up he couldn't increase shareholder value and so he had in some ways nothing to lose because he was stuck and he had been stuck in this plateau for so long and the market he had said he says in some interviews like the market was giving me a very clear message we don't believe that you can invest this cash in any way that's going to grow your business well then he's like well screw that why don't i just do something else with it if i can't grow microstrategy with it maybe i can grow it through investment and he went and he looked at real estate he looked at gold he looked at all the different ways that he could do it and he basically at that point deduced that bitcoin was his best bet to invest the money to actually grow the stock and was he like a crypto guy so 2020 for a lot of the hardcores was late in the game for crypto was he like he was he was skeptical he did not believe in bitcoin somebody had told him about it he didn't believe so he wasn't one of these like early hackers he went and watched a bunch of pomps interviews and he started reading about he started learning about it the other thing that was true was that he looked at the amount of uh inflation and he realized that the kind of stated goal of two or three percent inflation was misleading that it didn't count a bunch of other things it also didn't take into account the fact that if you were an investor you just put the money in the s&p 500 it was growing at you know 10 15 a year and he was like look if i can't beat that there's really no reason to invest in my company if i don't have the ability to beat that rate and so what he wanted to do was you know like most bitcoin maximalists they just at the end of the day they look at fiat currency and they believe that here you have a a weak currency and if you could ever if you could borrow a weak currency at zero percent interest rate and use it to buy a hard currency like bitcoin that's a good trade so that's the the two things that he wanted to do was he wanted to get out of fiat because he didn't like the direction that fiat was going with inflation and um and secondly he knew his stock was stuck okay so that was that part back then but at that time he wasn't doing this thing where he's borrowing billions of dollars to buy bitcoin and so let me just like kind of walk you through the model of what he's doing now okay so basically microstrategy issues debt they use that that convertible bond corporate bond and so that like today they just did a five billion dollar whatever corporate bond offer who they raise it from uh bond buyers the bond market so there's trillions of dollars that get invested in bonds and one of the things you know you might say why does why do why are people buying a microstrategy bond is it because of the underlying business and it was just buying bitcoin themselves or just buy bitcoin themselves the re the arbitrage is that he realized there's you know a trillion dollar plus market of people who of people who buy bonds that because of their structure they're not allowed to buy security so they can't buy stocks they can't buy real estate they can't buy uh bitcoin directly they can't buy the bitcoin etf so the bond market cannot access bitcoin unless they access it through a bond got it that's the mandate of those funds is that they can only buy bonds that's why people gave them the money was you're going to buy bonds it's a zero percent uh interest rate but it can you can convert the bond into microstrategy stock at a certain price at 300 400 500 600 dollars a share higher than the current price of the thing so it's like a long-term call option on microstrategy okay so if you were in the bond market and you wanted access to bitcoin but your bylaws and your mandate does not allow you to buy bitcoin directly then that's a crazy loophole that's a crazy loophole supply demand so he's the only supply on the market to absorb this this demand that's there to get access to bitcoin type of yield it's by by issuing these these things okay so that's the first part so then he buys bitcoin and he goes and he tells the whole market i'm i'm a forever buyer of bitcoin i will increasingly be buying billions and billions of dollars of bitcoin i'm doing it at the market price and i will continue doing that that instills a bunch of confidence in the bitcoin market because bitcoin says wow there's this whale who says i don't give a damn i'm doing this i'm deep pocketed and i'm going to keep doing this and so he takes supply off the market he signals to the market that i'm a forever holder and he says i'm going to keep buying bigger and bigger amounts as we go so the bitcoin price goes up so now bitcoin price goes up which then causes his stock to go up because his stock is based on the fact that they have 30 billion dollars of bitcoin sitting there and the stock goes up and then he sells more equity at a premium and he buys even more bitcoin now he's selling equity shares to buy bitcoin rinse and repeat is he selling any of his equity in the company um i don't know i'm not sure and is he liable for any of these uh convertible bonds or these bonds it's not like a personal guarantee no it's a corporate bond if this goes south and this collapses then his you know net worth which is highly based on his holdings of micro strategy are going to go down right and his reputation and everything else and what's his net worth now how much of micro strategy does he own he owns 9.9 percent of micro strategy so as of today just off micro strategy he's worth uh eight billion dollars okay in 2020 the company was worth 1.4 billion so he was worth a measly 140 million dollars so he's grown from 140 million dollar net worth assuming that is his only money which is probably isn't all the way up to close to 10 billion so it definitely had asymmetric upside versus downside for him right like uh hitching his wagon to the bitcoin rocket ship represented a way for him to like you know go explode up in a good way in a way that he was never going to be able to do with just micro strategy the declining software business at the same time you know there obviously is reputational risk and there's capital risk now okay so how is it going they've basically acquired almost 400 000 bitcoin um they've outperformed every company in the sp 500 and last week alone it saw 136 billion dollars of trading volume to put that in perspective even game stop during the game stop the game stop never saw this so he's basically created he's intentionally turned him turned micro strategy into a meme stock meaning he's detached it from the underlying business in the way that game stop did and and created a product that the option traders want that the bond traders want that the bitcoin maximalists want that the bitcoin skeptics hate and want to go short now what what could go wrong let's go let's go to there um and by the way let's also say the craziness of not only doing this but then spending the last four years just on tour being a bitcoin evangelist is also like a really extreme step to take right like there were no half measures in what he did this is a you know sort of elon musk style all in reputationally all in financially all in and he has that personality he's got the types of i don't know him other than the 60 minutes we spent virtually with him but he seemed like he had the personality where he's super high iq super low like emotional normal human emotions where he's like right but it makes sense the math says this therefore i do that even if that is a ridiculous thing to most people's standards high iq high t count yeah like yeah like he he ponies up okay so now what's the you know at the same time maybe i'm just uh like a pts deed from past crypto cycles but like i mentioned every crypto cycle this happens somebody gets uber aggressive they're seen as a genius they overextend or they commit malpractice and they come crashing down when the cycle you know inevitably these things are all cyclical when it goes down last cycle it was ftx it was dokuan it was three errors capital these were multi-billion dollar vehicles that were created very quickly they they burned bright and then they fizzled out um due to one of those two reasons so i'm on the lookout right now bitcoin's at an all-time high instead of just jubilation i'm just keeping an eye out you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me type of thing so i'm just keeping an eye on what might what might it be the cycle on the other side he's made a couple of genius calls so back in i want to say when was it 2007 ish time there's a bunch of interviews of michael saylor talking about apple maybe 2012 and he basically is talking about he he's on a thing and he's like apple's gonna go to two thousand dollars a share and he's like you don't understand what's happening apple is inventing he the same way that he's talking about bitcoin how bitcoin is this you know the greatest invention ever how it's going to be millions of dollars a coin he was talking about apple the same way he's like you have a super supercomputer in your pocket do you understand what this means you know you know that four billion people are going to be carrying this thing around and then apple's going to be making x all the numbers just sounded insane to people at the time and when he was talking about it and it's all come true like his his entire bet on apple he's like he's like i don't know why you would own any stock besides apple and like if you had listed a michael seller at that time so he's always he's always had this like you all are stupid this is obvious and he's right sometimes yeah i mean i don't know these are oversimplifications but yeah like i guess the guy's fascinating he is a fascinating guy i think he's described him well when he's extremely high iq he's extremely high cojones and when he gets conviction on something he sounds insane and so okay you know i think the the main thing is uh where does this go wrong so i think the main place it goes wrong obviously if bitcoin's price starts to crash the problem will be if for whatever reason microstrategy stock which today trades at like a two and a half times multiple of nab you know nav is the net asset values like the underlying asset that it holds right it owns 33 billion dollars bitcoin so the question is why is it an 83 billion dollar company which is what you think it should be it should if you own it should be like a 35 billion dollar company yeah it should be it should be whatever the asset is plus like the multiple profit for software it's a bitcoin holding an acquisition company and so maybe you say okay here's its holdings great and then on top of that maybe there's some premium for the fact that it's able to acquire them on leverage it could do things that a bitcoin etf can't right so bitcoin etf can issue a bond it is different but the question is is two and a half x the right multiple yes and the question is the down spiral looks like this the unwinding looks like this which is microstrategy for whatever reason either because bitcoin price goes down or the stock market just changes its tune on it starts to not trade at such a premium to the nav and now all this money that it's borrowed these bonds expire 2027 2028 2029 if those were to convert he would be forced into selling bitcoin and once he becomes a forced seller now the whole market the whole bitcoin market will start to crash because it'll say oh my god microstrategy is going to have to unwind its entire bitcoin position that's going to be 35 billion dollars or more of bitcoin hitting the market how much is bitcoin worth like how much what percentage uh of a player is he he owns about one percent of the bitcoin float today and he's trying to get you know two percent basically dude this guy's intense yeah this guy i i guess my short story is i don't know what's going to happen i i guess my disclaimer is this i do not know what's going to happen more than that i'm a novice when it comes to this however i've been in a few crypto cycles before and i've seen in every every single crypto cycle when crypto goes up somebody starts being very aggressive acquiring uh buying buying crypto using leverage like he's doing right now it hasn't ended well in previous cycles and right now everybody is calling this the infinite money glitch you go on youtube you search microstrategy infinite money glitch he's a god he's the best and it always makes you wonder what is the scenario where this unravels and do i believe that that could come true here there is no strategy that is risk-free there is no free lunch and i think that right now the entire narrative is about how this is a free lunch how this is a free money glitch and i don't believe that i don't know enough to know the specifics about this but my spidey sense is tingling who's the um the most conservative bitcoin per so uh conservative being um like they're rational and they could explain the pros and the cons without being overly emotional who's that in the bitcoin world so that's a good question who do i trust the most to have a rational opinion about bitcoin that is a great question yeah okay so there's there's this guy like andreas antonopoulos who i believe is that but he's a technologist so you don't you you listen to him about how bitcoin as a technology um has uh has great potential so you know you read his book which is called um the internet of money and he's extremely rational and he's a good faith actor who's who's the person that's like you know if we all buy into this and if it works you know the upside is this but if we don't the downside is this and this is like who just says like like here's all the potential i think a lot of people say that i think a lot of people understand this figure a lot of people say like look bitcoin has these properties it could become x it could become the next goal actually most people fall into the bucket of they don't price that as 100 certainty right they say it's possible and there's a potential for that that's why i own some of it but i don't put my entire net worth in it and that it is also possible that it doesn't doesn't get adopted or that there's a technical flaw or that governments beat it down in these ways or that it becomes uh unpopular for these reasons and that's the risk in this right like there's a bunch of people that feel that those vocal thought leader rationalists what do they say about michael sailor they don't take a position like right now even as i'm saying this i'm thinking to myself yeah i'm gonna go cut this in post because why take a position what's the upside the upside is well there is some upside i might be right a few years from now you're gonna look good by like predicting things um and there's also the upside of like just doing what's right and telling everyone don't waste your money on this thing yeah but i guess it's uh you have to be a smart enough to understand it b you have to have the desire to like look right by putting your neck on the line with a prediction yeah the bitcoin community has doesn't seem like it typically has the like the moral fiber no no i wasn't gonna say that i was gonna say uh they don't mind expressing they don't they're very vocal they you know if someone thinks you're full of it they're also very wishful about their bags right that's i think that's goes back to your question of who could you trust to not speak just hopefully about their bag right they just they wanted to be true so much that they convinced themselves it's true and risk-free what i'm trying to get at is who's the person who i can trust to find out what the opinion uh of michael sailor is i have searched long and hard because before this podcast i did research to say can and i literally tweeted this out so if you think i'm an idiot i i also think i'm an idiot my tweet today was can someone with a better brain than me explain what sailor is doing a no strategies without risk what are the risks what is the math if bitcoin drops to x dollars it becomes a problem and b why is the stock trading at such a premium to now that post has you know maybe a hundred plus replies i read every single one of them i read other threads that people have put out about this if there was one great explanation i would have just pointed you to it and i would have read it out loud i have not found one myself that doesn't mean it doesn't exist i have not found one myself that i can read and i can say oh in simple terms i understand why he's doing this why it's working today what the risks are how it would unravel if it unraveled i'm only recently at the age where i don't trust everyone uh like like like up until recently like my logic was constantly like well the institutions are buying into this therefore it must be safe or like you don't like whoever's raising the money for this guy like surely they know what they're talking about so now i'm i i've just two years ago got to the age where it's like you know they're flawed humans just like me and so i don't know who to trust with any with these types of situations because i'm so uneducated on the topic but i have uh my spidey senses tingling i wouldn't i with my own money i wouldn't touch any of this yeah yeah that's what i would say right now i have i have no proof uh other than it just it doesn't feel good do you know what the uh i think i think the supreme court or someone like that like defined pornography uh like they said like you know you don't see it it's hard to they're like it's hard to define but you know it when you see it you know what's the difference between pornography and like a nudity the national geographic tv show you know it when you see it i don't exactly know it when i see it this situation with him but i know that something doesn't feel right and i can't explain why okay so here here's my commitment um i brought this up today half baked and i admit that um i'm gonna go and try to find the smartest people i can to explain this to me until i am satisfied with the simple explanation of what's going on and then i'll share that if i leave this in i'm saying that as a bookmark to say let's hold opinions till part two i might just take this whole part out because i'm uncomfortable with the level of half informed speculation that was in this section uh i think it's interesting i think it's interesting but you know that like shockingly people look to you for like this like you are so like i asked you that question uh of like who's rational that people look to there are many people who would say sean i am rational but you had two criteria who's rational and intelligent but a lot of people that i fall a little short on in terms of these things right and i think i think that you vote like vocal like you're like i'm still working through this problem uh i think that's actually quite valuable yeah i guess i'm just like only 10 of the way working through it and i'm just thinking maybe i should have gone to 50 before coming on the pot and talking about it but i will say this a lot of bit a lot of the uh people have done well with bitcoin and the people who understand bitcoin it is the midwit meme like they they look at bitcoin and they look at all the information and then they reduce it down into a very simple way of looking at things and you know the simple way of looking at things which is either um this is uh it's a better version of gold and so it'll be you know it's a it's a tech improvement on gold um there's people who reduce it down and basically just say uh would i rather have would i rather have hard money or soft money meaning would i rather save wealth in a would i rather store wealth in a currency that can't inflate mathematically or uh a currency that will inflate and if you just whittle things down like that to a level of simplicity you can be right without even knowing all the details and so i think one of the challenges with your question of who are the smart intelligent people is that the smartest most rational people i know about bitcoin a long time ago you know eight years ago told me a very simple thing bought it put it in cold cold storage and moved on with their life um and they don't follow all the twists and turns and they don't try to hop on the next wave and the next trend they don't do crazy options trading or 100x leverage they don't do any of those things and they made a simple opinion based on a very simple assessment um and they've proven to be right and not over complicating it this has been the signal of who's actually intelligent about this versus somebody who's every day on the news has an opinion on every single thing is trying to outsmart everybody those tend to not be the people that i actually you know trust their opinion on this stuff have you seen that show love on the spectrum yeah i have actually the show about autistic people dating right yeah and there's this one episode where these two guys dating this girl and he was like do you like tacos and she goes yeah i like chicken and cheese and he was like i don't have anything else to say but i want to let you know i'm having a good time and i want to normalize that um in both dating and on this podcast which is um uh and that's sort of how i feel right now which is i don't have anything else to say but i want to let you know i really enjoy this topic you you you you you you you you
