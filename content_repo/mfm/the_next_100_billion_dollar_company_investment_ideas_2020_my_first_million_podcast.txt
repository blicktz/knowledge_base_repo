I have a question for you now so before last week I think maybe it was when I was with Stu but I shared this anecdote or this sort of advice which was if you're offered a seat on a rocket ship you know don't ask which seat just sit down and buckle up and this is just career advice which is if you're not going to start your own company yeah you got a flack for it did I? yeah oh I thought people loved it what do you mean? well what was the criticism?

it's a nice sized audience not everyone's going to be happy but what was what was the criticism based on? it wasn't even controversial just stuff like titles it was just comments like people saying titles are important how much you get paid is more important things like that that's crazy disagree hard disagree okay so anyways the question was sort of that led to a different question which is what are the rocket ships of today? and so somebody by the way took that idea and made a rocket ship newsletter for jobs or whatever but beyond that I was just sort of thinking just my thought experiment what companies that today are worth 1 to 5 billion do I believe will be multi-hundred billion so what's just as a way of phrasing it simpler what 5 billion dollar company today could become a 500 billion dollar company in the future?

I say this because we have friends who bought Facebook secondary stock back in 2006 2007 when Facebook was valued at over a billion dollars and today Facebook's like whatever 500 billion dollar company and that you know it was clear it wasn't going to zero it was clear it was a thing and the question but you could have invested then and got a phenomenal return and I have several friends who did I had a friend Alex oh no sorry Josh Buckley who's a good guy founder and British guy? yeah he's a British guy and so he he was telling me we were just hanging out one day and he's like yeah I'm buying secondary stock of Stripe as much as I can get and I was like oh well like what do you mean like I'm not doing that why are you doing that I should do that and he was like yeah I just think Stripe's a great company and there's secondary stock available and I'm just buying it I'm like well what's the valuation it's already like a 2 billion dollar company he's like yeah but it's like Stripe's gonna be big he's like I think Stripe's gonna be huge so I'm just buying up secondary and now so Stripe's valued now at like 20 billion dollars so he took essentially like a no risk bet in my opinion and 10x'd his money on a private company that was it was already a unicorn but wasn't yet on the stock market wasn't doing like 10% a year you know that's a 10x appreciation so long story short what companies do you think have that potential that are in the single digit billions today or less that you think could be a Facebook Google Amazon of our generation so a few years ago I answered this question and I thought it was Atlassian and I went in on that and it worked okay tell me about that what do you mean it worked back then it was can you just look go ahead Henry look go to Atlassian stock we were busy today I invested in Atlassian stock I mean it's not like I like yeah Atlassian it's spelled with an A AT AT there it is yeah and then go to all time I bought Atlassian Max on the far right I bought it when it went public so what did it go up by it's 3X so that's like a 3X already so I 3X my money so I bought Atlassian because I read their annual report and I was like oh these guys are great right so their market cap's now 35 billion yeah so I bought it right when it went out so that worked out well what do you think can get to the over 100 billion because it's very hard to get over 100 billion how many companies are worth over 100 billion like 50 very few especially if you think about tech companies so some of the tech companies that made it Amazon made it Google made it Microsoft made it Facebook made it Uber did not quite make it yet but it's getting there Tesla made it like I think I invested in Tesla when it was at about this number 5 5 to 8 billion oh really and now it's almost 100 billion and so like that's a big lift of a company that it's out there it's not a seed saved startup you're taking a bet on right it's a company that's out there and the other way to take the bet on it even if you're not an investor is to go work at one of these companies right so like Airbnb was a good candidate now it's value too high to qualify for this Airbnb is like I don't know 35 billion or something like that we'll see what happens with this but it's not in the single digit billions anymore but when we when we moved to San Francisco we could have done that right when I moved to San Francisco you applied I had a job offer at Airbnb when it was worth a billion 1 billion maybe less I don't know there was only no it was less it was 2012 right so let's just say it was at a billion which it wasn't but let's say it was yeah I would have made 10 million dollars I don't know it's 35x so even if you had just gotten a sort of standard stock package which was like over 4 years you're gonna get 200 grand I would have made 5 or 10 million dollars yeah that's insane and I got fired before I even showed up to work so some other candidates that I put up here Flexport I think is a candidate maybe oh you got some inside intel that sounded like a juicy maybe well Ryan told me he thinks it's gonna be massive or it's gonna go bankrupt which is like how you're gonna be when you're yeah that's how you're gonna be that's how you gotta be this was harder than I thought I also tweeted this out so the most popular answers I got was Airtable and Carta and I pretty much disagree with both of those I don't know and I asked these are smart people replying and I was like Carta? why Carta?

we should get Carta to sponsor this podcast by the way yeah why are they not sponsoring this podcast? I don't know you guys need a sponsor and I'm gonna I don't give a fuck if people sponsor I'm gonna tell you the truth Carta it's the best option out there but it still needs a lot to improve right I use it I give you guys 5 grand a year I'm happy that I give you the money but it can improve yeah so Airtable Airtable it would have to basically replace Excel in the corporate world for it to do this otherwise it will not be a hundred billion dollar company how about Gusto? Gusto's a good one so I think there's a lot that are in the sort of either HR tech just you need to be in huge spaces I like Gusto and Rippling yeah Gusto, Rippling I think I would bet I mean a hundred billion it's a high bar but yeah so other ones that I put up here so Stripe but it's past this point so Coinbase only if the Bitcoin if Bitcoin actually becomes like if Bitcoin actually is the thing it becomes the global reserve currency then well it doesn't have to be the largest Bitcoin sort of company the largest Bitcoin brand would be I think yeah it just has can it become Bank of America can it become Wells Fargo yeah I think Bitcoin has to become that relevant for Coinbase to be yeah I buy that Open Door is another one just because residential real estate is so big so if they actually have a working model they could become a hundred billion dollar company I don't buy that because what because Zillow and Trulia aren't that huge they don't do what these guys do though Zillow and Trulia they sell leads to brokers they're now trying to copy Open Door so now they offer what Open Door offers but Open Door is literally buying and selling the houses they're flipping houses at scale which is pretty crazy what else this was tough I don't know that's all I had but I put this on here I wasn't going to talk about it initially but I'm like I want to bring this up I want people to tell me what I'm wrong about what companies I should be considering in this but I think this is a really important question because for me I'm going to go try to buy secondary stock in all these companies and if you're working you should go work at one of these companies a hundred billion is that's impossible I won't even I'm not even going to try to predict that because like only like a few hundred people a few a few hundred businesses have ever probably done that I don't know the number but that's really hard to say but if I had to make a prediction I do think that there will be some new search engines and I also think that some of the new Chrome replacements could be quite large so Brave is one of them what's another one replacing the browser yeah anything that are replacing browsers I think are kind of cool and could potentially be that big I think there's going to be a lot of browser I think if any company nails AR they will they will be able to do this but that's a ways away I believe how about Zoosk is that what it's called Zoosk the self-driving car company yeah yeah so that was the other I considered all the self-driving car companies because I'm like if if one of them becomes a success a successful self-driving car company the market leader will be worth over a hundred billion it's just more likely I believe it's more likely to be Tesla or one of the incumbents they'll buy one of these companies rather than that company independently going from where it is today which is one billion to a hundred billion how about this what companies are public now that could grow that much so I was talking to Moise the other day and we were looking at stamps.com they were crazy undervalued and the next day we were like let's buy this the next day we didn't buy in time it went up 50% went up 50% yeah I love that it was coincidental just I saw an interesting stat over the last 10 years if you had just bought the fang companies so Facebook Amazon Apple Google in the 10 years it outperformed all VCs or sorry it outperformed even this sort of top like expected returns of venture capital so the public market if you just bought the five most popular tech stocks you did better it was a 24% IRR over 10 years okay well what's public now that could I don't fucking know that's a great question that's hard you gotta really bet on industries yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
