got caught okay you got got and okay i think we should create a set of the forbes 30 under 30. i think we need like the madoff 1000. um for all the grifters and con artists that are that are out there all right we don't normally let ben have ideas but we let the man out of the cage he's got an idea ben what if you you texted us this morning you want to try something what do you want to try we're doing a new segment fellas we're just gonna we're going quick through the news and we're having you guys react people want to know what the fellas think about what's happening so we're gonna we're gonna find out we're calling i'm gonna call this the boys react i've been trying to make this the boys thing a thing for a little while now and it hasn't happened but as i taught my daughter yesterday we never give up and so the boys react is going to be uh we're going to react to the news here so ben you have some news segments uh or news stories i guess and um sam sam actually likes the news sam sam's into into the news i'm like dude i i read the news like crazy you don't read the news i'm an anti-newser i just love drama you know how i love preppers i'm like whatever that is where you avoid the news at all costs yeah i just like gossip i'm a big fan of drama my life's pretty boring so i i need i need drama i love the comment sections too somebody said this the other day that i think it was like naval or one of these smart guys they go um the goal of the media is to make every problem your problem and i was like oh that's pretty true that's kind of like what the news is it's like oh there's a flood in this county i don't live in let me watch this for 20 minutes it's why do i care about this this has nothing to do with me all right but anyways sorry let's start let's start with the most interesting one ben what is it we're starting a little close to home uh your friend nikita beer uh his social app gas was acquired by discord for an undisclosed amount what do you guys think about your buddy nikita being acquired by discord give the background sean about this guy like because it's a pretty he it's a caper i call this a caper i don't even know what that mean a cape a caper it's like uh what is it no a caper it's like a uh a scheme but like uh it's like when you would rob a bank you know you'd be like what's that great caper fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me he just fooled the tech industry twice dude he sold the same app so he built an app called tbh that was like uh you know let a teenager go on and it basically quiz you about people in your school your friends and be like who's the most cute boy in your life and you're like oh sam and it's like who's the most likely to be famous oh it's ben right you just do that right and then they would text and it's like eight years ago yeah so he's cute download my app and of course that worked he did that and like it immediately went viral because it went viral facebook buys the thing because facebook has like a system internally that says like viral teen app and then it's like must acquire must acquire viral teenage app you know like get that young blood in here and so they acquired it people had said 100 million dollars i don't it's not 100 million dollars uh but but i think something more like 30 40 million bucks and um and this was in 2017 2017.

he sells the app promptly the app gets shut down within like a year because there was never any retention in this app he then sits at facebook for four years and vests out the entire every cent of his earn out which is just hilarious in its own right um and all he did was just tweet all day you know like yeah he worked in the new products division and uh you know half released some apps i guess and then he he leaves you know what's it called recidivism sam you're a prison guy he leaves the jail of facebook and he does the same goddamn thing again he creates another teen app for compliments he tells us this in advance he goes yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna make an app that makes like uh 10 million dollars in three months and we both kind of laughed it off and we're like is that even possible and then he pretty much did it i think gas app has made seven million in gross sales in like three-ish months so you know pretty much called his shot which we do respect but also we have to clarify one thing sam ben said he's our friend is he still our friend after how insufferable he is in the group chat so he is insufferable but i kind of like it a little bit uh i think it's pretty hilarious i love a good troll i think that you're missing some of the data here so he sold the company to discord there's no release on price or anything like that but uh some people can make guesses but basically between leaving or being at facebook and discord he creates this mystique i call him the jewish great gatsby he creates this kind of mystique where he's got this really lovely home in la i i he's single or at least he's not married and he like hosts really fun parties and then he posts on twitter about like his opinion on going viral and all like legends like or quote legends start following him and they like message him and they he's created this aura of sophistication and of like he knows what he's doing with apps which is true it's all true he's very talented but it was pretty cool how it was like kind of systematic so he has the talent he has the skill but he did a great job of also flexing that he had the talent and he had the skill and people start flocking to him and he starts launching this thing and here's the analogy he's like he's like the guy who moved he moved to a new high school as a sophomore and then didn't try to make a single friend but he just went to lunch and he was just totally content sitting by himself he wasn't a loser he was almost too cool to have to try and because of that everyone's like who is this guy does he have a is his girlfriend in college oh my god and he would just be like you know texting his college girlfriend that you don't know if you know if they exist but he just built this aura this mystique around him by almost not trying whereas everybody else on twitter is like hey follow me for more threads about how great i am right and he's he's trying to do the exact opposite where he's just like only posting and um you know just hinting and posting little screenshots that make you think he's up to something big at all times yeah you're like who's this kid coming up to school as a 16 year old in a motorcycle you know like this guy's got a neck tattoo like i can't confirm that he's a badass but like all all signs point to it that that was his thing and he never he didn't deny it he didn't confirm it so it could be true it could not be true but the fact is is that he created this app something happened to it like there was a crazy rumor with the app that it was used for child sex trafficking which wasn't true he changed the name of the app then he changed the name again a third time and it takes off and he sells it uh we're recording this on a wednesday i believe it was announced yesterday this is a wonderful caper not to say that discord didn't get value i have no idea what the truth is uh the truth is probably like they're gonna make something cool of it who knows but he pulled it off he called the shot he pulled it off and he did it in such an obnoxious way and that's why i love him you know i love guys like that i love what he did and honestly i love the way he did it too but the problem is he's like a fart a fart is amazing when you're more than six feet away but you don't want to be too close to the fart like you know the fart's not funny when you're right up against it and so that's the problem with this is we were too close to it we got we had to hear him and he loves smelling his own scent he loves smelling his own fart too and so you know he will in our group chat just post every like twitter mention where somebody's like oh my god nikita has done it again nikita is the best it's like bro i don't need your twitter mentions posted here uh you know for me for me to see uh it is completely he's an insufferable fart but i do respect what he's pulled off yeah it's pretty funny so this is like an interesting thing i can't believe he pulled it off but he called his shot i respect that i think it's cool also he's done a thing like you know um mr beast does this thing where like if you go talk to a pretty serious business person they will like reference a mr beast like a mr beast ism where they're like um well mr b said uh yeah yeah jimmy just says you know we just try to make great videos as if like nobody else tries to make great videos or he'll be like uh or he'll be like you know we just um we're willing to put more into our content trying to make the best content possible blah blah blah it's like and then if somebody goes and looks and they're like bro you you your your video is put your hand on this car and the last person to take their hand off you know the last person with their hand on the car keeps the car like this is not like you know you're not steven spielberg over here but didn't we talk about this where we're like look we're gonna do this thing and we're gonna send them a welcome letter and we're just gonna make it really delightful it's just gonna be a beautiful really well done just beautifully done and if you do it like that people start to buy in they start to eat that little puppy chow and so similarly he um mr beast does this reality distortion where he makes you believe that he is the deepest thinker he's creating the most epic beautiful well done content he is really thoughtful it's just so it's like you know watch me fart in people's ears and like it's true that people i'm on a fart kick today but people um people do like it the content definitely works but it creates this almost this mystique around it and i feel like nikita did the same thing where he'll tweet out where he'll be like um just move the butthole a little closer so tweet out like uh you know the you know um the underrated metric in social networking is density uh by far more important than spread and he's like you know like if you're still measuring k factor you might as well still be using a blackberry right and he'll like he'll tweet out that makes you think like damn this this no that i don't know about social networking or he'd be like there's only five people on earth that can tell you about building social networks the problem is they're all unhirable because their name are names are mark zuckerberg jack dorsey and nikita beer and it's like so and and so by the way i i think there's levels to this there's levels so so i think he does a great job of creating it's like bro you created a app that lets me say which which girl in my high school is the cutest and then it texts her somebody said you're cute right like yeah there's beauty in the simplicity for sure but they almost make it sound more complicated and artistic than it really is and uh and and trust me it's it's not we're not we're not like every other social app you see we're changing the world one popularity contest at a time we are we're democratizing popularity he went on um on like cnbc or one of these like news networks or whatever and they were like we have here the founder of the hit teen app the sensational app jaz nikita what what inspired you to do this and he's like you know we just believe that teens you know the world needed a little more positivity and that uh we wanted to create a safe space for whatever dude the only safe space he wanted was a vacation home in in tahoe you wanted to you know you you wanted to fly private that's what you wanted hey mission accomplished i respect that that is amazing yeah his next app is gonna be called plebe uh but in all seriousness he pulled it off i think it's cool uh yeah i make fun of him because uh because of how obnoxious he's been for four months in this group chat but uh but you know deep down uh he's my kind of people i respect uh i respect what he's done and i also respect the massive troll that he's played on everybody here so this is good speaking of trolls who didn't pull it off uh ben we got to get to the next story before we get to the next story though we do have to remind everyone we have a gentleman's agreement here everyone follows it if you follow if you listen to us it doesn't matter what app you're listening to you have to go to our youtube page and you click subscribe that's the gentleman's agreement i have my pen here am i going to need this for the gentleman's agreement do i need to sign something or what do i do you actually don't see all you have to do is go to our youtube page and you click subscribe you don't even need a pen that's how easy it is we made this gentleman's agreement incredibly simple you go and you subscribe and then we work for you and we make this content for you and we reveal our life and dedicate our lives to you it's simple that's the gentleman's agreement i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better next topic from someone who pulled off a caper to someone who did not jpmorgan chase bought college financial aid platform frank for 175 million dollars it has now shut down the website and claims that they fabricated more than four million accounts um on their first email to their customer list they got a 70 bounce back uh founder charlie javis i think it's pronounced uh denies that this is fraud and claims that jp morgan is just inventing reasons to not pay her fellas boys who do you believe well jp morgan this lady was on uh like that's easy uh this lady was a forbes 30 under 30 and then just like a couple years later sells her app for nine nine figures 100 million plus and uh it's pretty hilarious they even found they tracked it down i believe where they talked to the developers it was a it was like a they hired one freelancer i think who they said hey can you like make some test data to put in here and he starts doing it and they're the the guy was like i think this is fraud i'm out so they found those emails and then they did it again with another contractor and who actually did do it and they convinced the contractor that it wasn't fraud and so they've kind of like honed in on this that it seems quite clear that it's fraud uh bold bold move very bold move very easy to catch so really stupid like this seems like really a foolish mistake yeah this is like um jp morgan's got a little egg on the face for not not noticing this because this is pretty easy to notice i mean the fact that they sent one email and 70 bounced back right like that that sounds uh like it wasn't this a really sophisticated you know botnet that you know was simulating real users it was just a bunch of fake fake emails in a uh uh you know in a database so you know that sounds pretty easy and also it says uh there's there's an email with her she's asking the professor who who ended up doing this will the will the fake emails look real with an eye check or is it better to use unique id right so like you know handed the cookie jar as we say around here that i mean you got caught okay you got got and okay i think we should create instead of the forbes 30 to 30 i think we need like the made off 1000 um for all the grifters and con artists that are that are out there um you know i yeah i think that you know maybe the caper caper 20 or something like that we got to come up with something here and we need to just annually i think we should just do a show where we just rank the best cons of the year and uh and give them their due let them put that on their bio dude i'm down and what's crazy is this is so so when i sold the hustle we had i think 1.7 million subscribers we used this service hubspot paid for it and it was a service i forget the name of it but i believe it did two things we uploaded our whole email list and then i think hubspot uploaded some of their email i don't remember exactly how it worked i think they did it and it showed the crossover like how many we each shared in a huge amount of emails i imagine hubspot has like hundreds of million i have no idea a lot of emails and then i also think it checked for fraud and it was like a couple days to do this it was pretty simple um there's just a few other services where they make fake data and the reason they do this is if you have a sensitive thing like a bank startup you put a whole bunch of fake data in it and it like makes up people and you can test your data because you can't use like you know obviously real social security numbers when you're testing certain things and they would make up fake stuff just to test the software make sure it all works tonic i think it's called tonic.ai it's the it then says the fake data company we talked about them on the pod i love this idea i've been trying to yeah i forgot i need to invest in this yeah i think it's a cool thing and so also with gpt3 whatever it's called i was like thinking i'm like dude i should just i'm not going to do this but maybe i i was like i should just make up fake reviews for all of my like products and you could just like make up fake reviews or you can like make up negative reviews for all your competitors products but uh i was like are you looking for a nomination to the made up 1000 we'd be happy to have you but you do need to formally submit the application put my application in yeah and we have to make everyone pay a a 500 application fee too right if there's no con going on on our side what are we doing here yeah yeah yeah well don't you want to win the award it's an award yeah we did a thing with milk road where um we had this philosophy which is like we should be we should bank that in the future we're going to cut out all advertisers and be our own advertisers i mean only promote our own product our own service in this newsletter um that's the only way to hold yourself like accountable to not just acquiring like shitty subscribers and so we we had started this new growth channel we're like oh let's try this thing out we heard there you know the rates are pretty good we tried it out uh we tried it for like a week and we're like oh the numbers look pretty good we're getting cheap signups they're opening the email that sounds great and i was like hey ben just you know just for just to double check here why don't you just email all those people that signed up and um just ask him like you know a simple quite like you know hey like ask them a one-line question that would be trivial for them to answer just to be like hey i just wanted to know blah blah blah i'm the founder of this thing just wanted to know blank uh because they're opening the thing daily it looks like okay fantastic surely they would they would reply to an email from the owner of the thing they read every day right um and he was like dude guess how many i forgot how many there was like a couple thousand people on this thing he was like guess how many people replied i was like well you didn't say percentage so man this is a number of people who replied i was like i don't know like 400 500 and he was like two we got two replies turned off the channel oh my god it's like wow and i know a bunch of other people that are still buying from this trap this like you know this uh this marketing player this traffic source and i'm like well they're they're just dumping money down the drain if they're doing that dude seeing uh billy mcfarland and the thornos lady go to jail um like this woman potentially could go to jail it's pretty crazy that like what do they not think like just like eight months in advance it's like man this isn't like internet play games this is like go to prison games you're this is really screwing up a hundred plus million dollar acquisition and 70 of the users were fake that is crazy you go to prison for that type of stuff that is wild and it's just crazy to think that no one's there and they're like uh charlie um you know like are you do you like generic oreos and bologna sandwiches if yes then this is great because that's what you're going to be eaten for like the next nine months in prison it's great generic oreos that's that's nice well not not when it's every day and watered down kool-aid but like it's just it's it's pretty wild that people don't think ahead but uh this is such an obvious scam also jp morgan you guys suck man you guys gotta be on top of the ball like this is such a this seems pretty easy to to figure out yeah fair enough all right what's what's next all right um bitcoin and ethereum are up 23 percent over the last week uh crypto is rallying uh one major cause is continued rise of inflation 6.5 percent annualized in december the question for you fellas is crypto back no you want to just end it there well i will give you that's a great answer sam i will give you a slightly different answer um do i get to say like i told you so no i don't get to say i told you so yeah in fact i might maybe take the other the other l did i did i sell book road too early they sell the bottom um no i i think that a lot of things are rallying right now why because people did i think it's just a simple answer people did an end of year sell-off in december for tax loss harvesting and a lot of people will re-enter and then that creates some upward momentum and when there's upward momentum that makes people think hey is it coming back is this the rally uh did we did we hit the bottom is it time to buy back in and so people are buying back in um i don't think it's because inflation in december because guess what we had inflation in october and november and september and august too like where where was you know if if inflation was driving crypto up it should have been up all year last year not uh not down and so i don't think that that narrative holds i think it's much more likely that the same way that tech stocks are having a little brief rally um it's uh it's kind of like new year optimism uh people being done with their kind of like in crypto there's no wash sale rules so you could sell book the loss for tax purposes and buy back in one minute later uh if you wanted to and so i think people are just buying back in and i think there's a little bit of people chasing momentum that's my guess have you ever looked at the correlation between g-wagon prices use rolex market and miami penthouses and how it relates to crypto there's gotta be a correlation there i have not there's gotta be a correlation there we got our best data people on it did you see um yeah ben google that did you see uh uh i'm just gonna start telling ben just to google random stuff that are ungoogleable uh did did you see that there was a guy in like you know how we have this facebook group for mfm that we don't really check often but there was a guy who was like posting in a bunch and he created this website where you can sell your nft at a loss for tax purposes it's kind of interesting it was a great idea honestly um what's it called i forgot i'm gonna forget the name but uh ben might actually know it um it was called they advertised in the milk road so i remember seeing it there and being like oh wow this is actually a great idea hold on what did you say it was like a really it was like a white guy with like blonde hair looks like what is it unsellable nfts yeah yeah that's it unsellable nfts and so basically um if you wanted to book a a loss on your nft they would basically let you instantly get liquidity on it and get it right back i think is the is the idea um which is just a very useful simple tool so you know good on that guy for creating that that that was a smart smart idea so is this the segment dem boys dem boys react is that it i think i think we're not ready for dem boys yeah i think we're still the boys until until we get a little more street cred go to the youtube comments and tell us is the boys gonna stick can i make it a thing because i sure would like that yeah like just type it's like a thing or not a thing in the comments i just want to i'll do i'll read the poll and if it says not a thing i'll only continue for another three or four years if it says it's a thing i'm totally validated all right that's it so so so so so so so
