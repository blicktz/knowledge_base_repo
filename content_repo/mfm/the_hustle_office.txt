What's up, Hustle Ambassadors? Instead of writing an email today, I'm feeling a little lazy, so instead, I'm just going to give you a little tour of our office. Ready?

Alright. We decided to move in to this house. I gotta make sure these cars are across.

To this house instead of an office because we thought it was a little more exciting. So, let's go inside. Okay, up the stairs.

Here's our sticker. Do you have one? Or if you don't have one, let me know.

We'll send you one. Here's the office history. See, Eva, wave.

Oh, okay, yeah, that's perfect. We're doing some reorganizing, so the chairs are all over the place. Jackie, say hi.

Hi. Here's our new conference room that we're still reorganizing. Stickers everywhere.

I don't feel like writing an email, so I'm just going to send a video. Oh. Here's Kendall.

He's writing the emails that you read. Who's that? This is going to the Hustle Ambassadors.

Oh, what's up? There's Scott doing gross stuff. Hey.

What's going on? Here's our editorial calendar. Can't see that.

There's intern Kyle. Say hi, Kyle. Just say hi.

Hi. That's good. And here we are.

We just got this new setup. So there it is. This is your Hustle Ambassador email for the day.

Peace. Peace. Peace.
