first story made me inspired the second story made me double inspired and the third story just pissed me off all right so i have a theme here for this episode have you seen this meme that's going around on twitter where it's like a stick figure and he's like this and he's at his computer and it says share a bit of lore about yourself so share some lore and the lore is a sort of lore means you know the epic backstory or the the sort of untold backstory of something and so i have three pretty insane lore stories that i want to tell you i think you might know about this first person i it's it was new to me and i'm going to call them we haven't done this segment a while but they are the billy of the week and the billy of the week is a person named amadeo giannini do you know who that is no i don't think so all right so amadeo you are the billy of the week here's the story so this guy is born in san jose he's born to like you know italian immigrant parents his father is murdered when he's seven years old so he's raised by his mom his mom remarries so his stepfather is in a business that you're kind of familiar with he was stepfather was a fruit stand wholesaler which is i think kind of what your parents do they're wholesale adjacent for fruit something like that that's like a fruit broker they are produce and fruit brokers yes so that's exactly what his family did and at age 14 amadeo drops out of school decides to come work in the family business because he needs to help the family make money and this guy's an incredibly sharp business operator and so he joins the business he ends up just really taking over the business and really revamping it to the point where by the time he's in his mid-20s the business has done so well they're selling fruit all throughout california now and he's able to sell his share of the business for um a hundred thousand dollars that doesn't sound like much this is the equivalent of a few million dollars uh maybe two million dollars back then this is like in like 1900 so he does that and he's he's thinking about what's next and he decides you know i want to give back to my community a little bit he volunteers to be on a board of a bank and when he's at the bank he notices something he doesn't like and he notices that the bank would basically lend money to the people who didn't need it and deny money to the people who needed it and so he's like you know the bank was all about underwriting you know sort of the least risky loans it could do so it was lending to very very wealthy people with a lot of collateral but the kind of small business person who needed it was not getting it he then decides to create his own bank he's like you know what i'm gonna make my own bank that's going to serve the little man the common man and he calls it the bank of italy so he opens up the bank of italy in san francisco in the north beach neighborhood which is a strange name that's that's kind of a weird bank of italy right haven't heard of it whatever uh you know but but that's that's his heritage that's where he's from so he starts doing this and this is um 1904 now in 1906 something happens in san francisco which is a devastating earthquake um devastating earthquake happens and one of the weird things about the earthquake was that the earthquake happens a lot of people didn't have earthquake insurance but they had fire insurance so what people were doing was earthquake hits they would then light their building on fire because they wanted to get a payout from the the from the insurance companies that way so san francisco is ruined and the the narrative is basically like that's the end of that city but uh while most banks basically just shut their doors literally seal their vaults some melted shut amadeo goes in as soon as the earthquake is happening the fires are happening and he basically takes all the money out of the vault he doesn't want looters to come and take the money that his customers have stored there and he puts it in a like a fruit wagon he puts it under like a box of oranges and he gets it out of there and like two days later or a week later basically when all the all the banks are shut and san francisco's in ruin he pops open his bank again um by the wharf on a table with just basically a wooden plank and he's got his box of cash basically and he says we're back we're open for business if you need a loan just come to me where did the original money come from by the way so he had sold his fruit stand business and then he raised uh 500 000 the equivalent about five million dollars today he wrote from kind of friends family people who we had met during his time as a businessman in the fruit business and the business was i will lend out money to qualified or certain people and they will pay me eight percent interest or something like that depending on their uh their the situation his motto or what he wanted was basically um all the other banks will serving the elite the big businesses wealthy individuals but what if you were like me what if you were a fruit peddler um what if you're a dock worker you're a seamstress you know forget it and so he's basically like if nobody else is going to bank these people i will and he's his job is to serve the everyday man and the everyday woman now this all sounds like good marketing speak but there's something kind of interesting about the way this guy has done this which is that he uh you know i'll tell you this in a second but as this thing becomes more and more successful he never pays himself more than fifty thousand dollars a year in salary now you might say all right well he doesn't need salaries he's going to own the bank he also doesn't own any equity in this bank and so he just decides that this should be owned by whoever wants to be anybody should be able to be a shareholder i don't want the power concentrated in me so i don't own any of this so he creates the bank of italy and he starts lending out money and he's lending it often on a handshake no contract and often with no underwriting because these are people that didn't have a lot of assets to go with but he believed in the people in his community okay so this sounds very similar to his uh other like italian kind of uh cousins tony soprano i think they would lend money on a handshake so but this guy are you saying with an iron fist yeah all right also to the everyday man who just needed a little something something to like run away uh so you're saying was he actually benevolent yes he's actually benevolent so which is the why this is kind of like lore right that's actually kind of a crazy story because up till now everything so far has been something that every business tycoon would say but then actually you know they're basically greeny pink so this guy's the real deal pietro's the real deal and when the when the fire happens and everybody wants and and everybody else ran away he decides to give loans to people on no collateral no contract and the crazy thing about this is during that period that one year when the after the earthquakes and the fire happened and he's the only guy lending money out he's doing it with no underwriting no nothing no contracts even he ends up getting paid back every single loan every penny of every loan gets it ended up getting paid back so he did not lose money on a single loan which is kind of a crazy sort of act of good faith in humanity which is kind of crazy so wow he does that two days after the earthquake not a single loan defaults and he then starts to get innovative again remember he's a good operator and so he realizes look at that time the bank business was a local business you would open up a bank you would serve the people that are in your geographic radius and that was sort of it he realizes that you know uh because of the way he did his fruit business in california he was selling fruit all up and down the coast of california and he's like it sucks to have different banks in every place because i can't expand so he becomes the first guy to do the bank branch model so he's like we're gonna have local branches in every place i'm gonna figure out how to sync the ledger in the back end right i'm gonna figure out how to make sure all the balances are kept up to date i'm gonna make sure that we sort of have a local model but a central headquarters that's able to do this expansion and he keeps he expands all throughout california so it becomes very very successful he's basically pioneering interstate banking um he helps fund a bunch of interesting things so the california like agricultural boom so he's providing credit to all the farmers the vineyards all the stuff the food distributors like those are the people he knew he meets this entrepreneur again he's trying to he's trying to bank the people who are not qualified so he meets this entrepreneur who's got this crazy idea to create a film even though this guy's never created films create a film that's completely animated just drawings he's going to turn drawings into a movie and so he says you know this fellow walt disney i believe in you and even though he'd been rejected by everybody else he funds and finances personally actually this is not even out of the bank uh walt disney snow white the first uh you know disney film no it was the first animate full-length animated film nobody else would do it uh there's these crazy guys in san francisco that say we want to build this bridge a big giant bridge and he says you know what even though all the other banks have deemed this too risky he funds the golden gate bridge and over time he ends up merging with another bank called the bank of america and rebrands the bank of italy to bank of america and creates bank of america which becomes the biggest bank on earth and even while it does that he still never takes more than fifty thousand dollars a year salary he owns zero stock in bank of america his family does not um you know inherit this giant fortune and he dies in 1949 not owning a single share of the bank that he founded and his philosophy was that serving the needs of others is the only legitimate business what a badass story that was really good good job um that's that's what a baller that's absolutely insane so it wasn't like a sam maltman like oh i don't own any shares type of thing yeah you just do this yeah i just i just love it it was but it was that that was real so yeah walt disney said about him he says he goes amadeo that man that man gave us oxygen when we needed to breathe so crazy he started it in the north beach of san francisco uh the famous italian neighborhood of san francisco this is really cool uh i and i think if i remember correctly is this still the case doesn't bank of america they use the logo of him pulling fruit or something like that uh which i've do i don't know about it i remember seeing like a famous a famous logo of um or like they've used this logo before of a guy like pulling stuff um and another one interestingly is wells fargo wells fargo was started in san francisco as well and they started as a i think they i think that uh the 1906 earthquake i think also helped their business thrive um this is cool that's cool uh i wonder if there's another example of someone who truly like founded something and actually did not benefit financially from it in this like in this scale i mean what are the odds that there's a founder of a company that's worth more than 300 billion that did not do it for personal profit and took no share and it took no took no wealth out of it that's i mean that's got to be it's got to be number one all right i read a ton i would say almost a book a week and the reason i read so much is because my philosophy towards reading is i want to see what worked for the winners that i love and what strategies they use and then i want to see what mistakes uh did they all make what were the common flaws that they all had and i just want to avoid that and so hubspot asked me to put together a list of the books that have changed my life so far in 2025 and i did that so i listed out seven books that made a meaningful difference in my life and i explained what the differences that they had on me or what actions i took because of the book and then also i listed out my very particular ways of reading because i'm pretty strategic about how i read and how i read so much and how i remember what i read and things like that and so i put this together in a very simple guide it's seven books that had a huge impact on my life and you can scan the qr code below if you want to read it or there's a link you guys know what to do there's a link in the description just go ahead and click it and you'll see the guide that i made so it's the seven books that had a massive change in my life this year so far and then also how i'm able to read so much so check it out below have you heard of john bogle yeah vanguard so john bogle there's this thing called i originally learned about him because there's this thing called bogleheads it's like a have you ever been to bogleheads.com it's a forum where people discuss financial advice or investing and the general thesis of bogleheads is exactly what i buy into which is just super boring just buy an index fund john bogle and this is all the top of my head uh so i could get some of this wrong but john bogle founded that so he created this thing called the van uh vanguard group which created one of the first the uh index funds and that is now uh voo and vt vti which are the two largest and it's something like a trillion dollars in assets or something insane like that and john bogle owned a portion of it but i think when he died i think his net worth was like 50 or 100 million dollars uh compared to the trillion dollars in aum that the company has and so not the same as this bank of america guy but a little bit of a similar like kind of had a robin hood type of vibe well you did one on chuck feeney who gave it away which i think is is you know simpler but i mean i've heard of a lot of people who give it away i've never heard of anyone who built it and never took anything from from day one i think that's like that's pretty remarkable and you saw this story on twitter where they're talking about uh the that was it the lore well i was on the most interesting man in the world's profile most interesting on twitter yeah shield and he was talking actually about uh lloyds of london how during that he was he was telling a story more about lloyds of london which is about uh during the when those fires happened lloyds at the time people were a little bit distrustful of like an overseas insurer and lloyds of london said um pay they they instructed their their team pay all claims in full regardless of what coverage they had and this just this restored and they put an incredible amount of trust in lloyds of london and gave them an incredible reputation and so in times of trouble uh you know trouble is opportunity and they they sort of saw the opportunity to step in and be the most trusted part of when everybody else was trying to deny as many of the claims as possible even ones that they really should have paid out lloyds went the exact other way and that helped build their reputation and then he had a footnote at the bottom that this is similar to how bank of america started and i thought that's interesting i never never really heard this story and i went and started reading about it so i think about these moments all the time these moments where the data says to do one thing and everyone says to do this one thing and you choose to do the opposite and it doesn't make sense and it somehow works i've had many opportunities in my career to take those chances and i basically never do like like very very seldom because uh when you're up against those situations it's it's you need courage you need you need to be a little crazy you need a bunch of you need a bunch of that and like for example i think jeff bezos has this um story where he uh where he was like yeah the data shows that we can raise prices and we will just make more revenue but that's i mean nothing will change people are just going to continue buying and then a polly was like why don't you do this he's like well because we said we're going to be the lowest low cost provider like we said you want to like be able to buy everything from us at a low price so i don't care what i don't care what the data says the mission is the mission and there's all these i've heard of a variety of stories like this that i'm incredibly inspired by have you ever had an opportunity to take one of these moments that you actually took it or do you typically follow the data so i have i have two two mini stories and i can't go into too much detail because i i've never talked about i've never really announced these companies but my e-commerce company when the tariffs hit and uh trump started raising tariffs on all the countries and you know one country goes to 30 percent and china goes to 150 percent and which is pretty crazy like imagine you're selling something that typically let's just round numbers so let's just pretend something called this ball let's pretend this ball cost you know a dollar to to make and you sell it for three dollars okay but then all of a sudden you make these in china now this ball no longer cost a dollar it costs still cost the dollar but then you have 150 extra tariff which means now this ball cost you two dollars and fifty cents so you can no longer charge three dollars for this right to make the same uh you know margin you this ball now needs to cost whatever six seven and so everyone in our space started raising prices so one company raised prices the second company raised price and and they all did it like back to back because it's kind of like oh they took the bullet already look now's the time like a friday news dump like let's all raise our prices and we were about to do it the ceo of our company wanted to do it and then i was like what if we just do the exact opposite like what if we just don't raise the price at all like not to cut the price because that would be like suicidal but like let's let's not raise the price and so i wrote out this like long message kind of like this like copywriting sort of thing like hey guys you know blah blah blah almost like a bit like a like a like a prank basically so yeah as you know this is the terror situation you know this is the reality of the situation is this i just want to let you guys know like we're not raising prices and i was and literally the crowd roared on social media thousands and thousands like people sharing this in other communities and other groups being like this is the type of company to you know to respect and i'm like oh my god this is amazing pat on the back turns out if you just give away look at me people love you i got robin hood out here man and then three months later i'm like looking at the pnl our margin has dropped to three percent we have a three percent eboda margin five percent or something like that and you know i want it to be 15 or 20 and i'm like ah how do we fix this and it's like i guess we gotta raise the prices and so i'm like i'm gonna try to figure out how to go back how to go back at this point and raise the prices now because it just doesn't make any sense to run this business at this cost yeah this is the hard part i'm referring to this is what this is this is the hard part so i took the uh short term like roar of the crowd uh to be like god everybody loves it when i give away dollar bills for 70 cents this is i'm the man i'm a genius and now i'm like oh god this is what's the second time uh the second was a little bit different which was um uh one of my other companies we had a situation where the business is going great it's actually a slightly different situation but the principle of trouble is opportunity so this wasn't a pricing giveaway stuff but it was like business is going gangbusters and then adversity hits something happened a competitor did something and then all of a sudden changed the dynamics and now we have to figure out what's going on and as we're figuring it out like it definitely in the moment feels like absolute like it feels like trash you wake up and you can't you wake up and you're just like oh my god like my business that was so great yesterday now like oh i was so hopeful and now i'm absolutely hopeless like we all know startups are this roller coaster even knowing that doesn't quite prepare you for when you go from that peak and then the roller coaster starts to drop and um we just had this moment where we were like okay one mindset here is damage control so minimize the amount of bleeding that happens here but before we go into just like minimize damage mode let me just ask a question like is there a way where we come out the other side of this much better off like is there a lloyds of london moment here where we could do something that on the surface might sound a little crazy a little unorthodox but in a time of trouble when everybody else is doing x what if we just did y like would that work is there a possibility for that and so again i can't like go into too much of the detail here but i think it led to a slightly different mindset of like actually you know what i think when we come out the other side of this we're gonna not just be stronger because we we survived but like i think there's a thrive possibility here if we just nailed xyz and we never would have even figured this out had this not happened right and everybody else went this everyone else went left but if we go right i think we might end up being like really have separated ourselves from the pack and so we'll see how that one plays out but you know i just sort of always remind myself which is like within every disadvantage baked is a small potential advantage if you could figure it out right and that trouble is opportunity so the the natural reaction in trouble is that trouble is problems trouble is pain and yeah there might be some challenges there might be some pain but trouble is also opportunity if you are have your eyes open during the trouble to figure out where is the opportunity so we had tim ferris on uh the other day have you one of the most suggested books that he has or that he recommends to others is the 22 immutable laws of marketing have you read that book i've never actually read it now i started reading it this weekend because i'm just i want to learn and he was just on and uh whatever and uh it's only 110 pages it's very short and it's very easy and one and it's written by these two guys that are marketing consultants whatever and they have a lot of wonderful clients you kind of trust them but they give you 22 laws not to break and one of the laws refers to uh basically the idea of when everyone is going one way it's significantly better and easier for you to not try to be better than them but to be different and one frame one framework is to be the opposite and you call you call out that opposite and when you call it the opposite the thing you you you can't insult the the other thing you just have to like objectively say what it is so for example um they talk about two different mouthwashes one was listerine i forget the other one but the other one was the second place player and they're like well instead of going after listerine and like mocking it we're just going to say listerine makes you smell like you just left the doctor because it's like of clinical use and whatever we are the opposite this is the one that actually tastes good and so they're not exactly saying one's better or one's uh worse they're just saying this is what this is and then we are the exact opposite and it gives you all of these laws to follow it's an amazing book but i'm rereading it and what i'm learning is that what you're describing is a marketing problem and how most problems in business are marketing issues and i didn't really think about i didn't really think about that until recently until i started reading this and how perceptions reality and so like the truth or the there is no objective truth as to what products are necessarily better or worse it's about what we think is better and so it's this book is really good you should reread it because what you're describing is like it's sort of like when you reread the 48 laws of power and you like see like oh this person is committing this like they are doing this like you could do the same thing you get the neo in the matrix moment where you see the code you're like ah okay yeah it's pretty cool he's like are you so you're telling me i'll i'll be able to um dodge bullets he's like i'm telling you when you're ready you won't have to right it's like basically if you understand psychology at a certain level then you're able to make less you're able to do less work and have a better result i used to have i don't know if you remember this at the office we used to come to monkey inferno we used to have a giant poster that i made where it was three triangles and then it was a picture of an ugly circle and it just said different is better than better for sure and i i made this for our team because like we're always just trying to say how we're better than everybody and everybody says they're better and everybody's trying to be better we're all trying to one-up themselves the only thing we have to focus on is say how we're different the public can decide if that's better for them um right maybe you want the mouthwash that's really clinical maybe you want the mouthwash that tastes good right right like what do you want well our job is just to highlight the difference and uh and it's really hard to be better than something that's been out has more funding more people working there it's been out for 20 extra years like it's really hard to topple the incumbent with a with a better product when actually you just have to be a significantly different product that will be way better for a certain set of customers all right so the second one all right the second one is modern day so we went you know whatever 130 years ago now we have a today situation that kind of inspired me i think it'll inspire a lot of other people too so do you know who do you know who preston thorpe is preston thorpe i don't think so you may have seen this story because it was going viral recently but here's the story so i see this headline that there's this guy who's a software developer he's an engineer except the weird thing is that he's incarcerated right now he's an he's an employees and he's a he's a software engineer for them but he's incarcerated in a prison in maine and he has been for a while and so i was like how did this happen what is the story here and so the story is pretty crazy basically this guy grows up he's 17 years old he's a computer geek he he's you know sort of always like he's torrenting music and movies he's doing what a lot of people were doing uh you know a lot of us who were on our computers in when we were teenagers not me of course for anyone listening but you know others and uh you know somewhere along the way he um this is what he says he goes i get kicked out of my house by my parents for being a stupid 17 year old like kids are but instead of being broken homeless on couches i come back i'm apologetic um and i beg mom and dad to let me back in um that i'm sure was their plan and it worked the problem was i stumbled headfirst into the into the dark web uh where silk road you know pre-silk road of internet wholesale drugs and he's like uh there was a place where you could buy chemicals from you know for pennies from sketchy companies in india and china and canada and holland and they would sell them in bulk um so instead of just being totally apologetic and reformed i ended up going off the deep end and suddenly i'm making tens of thousands of dollars a week by the eight uh you know by the age of 18 19 years old selling drugs that i'm buying wholesale so he's a you know so what was he buying he was buying like mdma weed stuff like that okay all right he was buying that and he was selling it that's so age 20 he gets arrested for the first time they catch mdma coming in the mail from vancouver they catch some weed coming from california and because of the weed he ends up going to prison and so he goes to prison he goes for a couple of years and he gets out and here's what he says he goes a few years later i leave prison with zero dollars in my pockets because lawyers and commissary are expensive and nobody pays you uh nobody pays what they owe you when uh when you go to jail um and so then i'm i'm get out and i'm living in a halfway house it smells like crack smoke it's filled with parole officers and junkies and i'm left with a difficult choice um i can continue to live here and walk every day to a temp agency hoping to get a ten dollar an hour manual labor job but i don't have an id or a social security card at this point or i could go to new york uh go see some old associates and come back home after a week with ten or twenty thousand dollars in my pocket and i could spend my time living in a comfy comfy luxury hotel um until i get my get back on my feet and rent an apartment i chose the latter and obviously i was back in prison a short 14 months after uh after a short 14 months of addiction and misery where's he writing this on his blog on his blog it's called my story and he says i've incarcerated now with this sentence um since 2017 and he says the following he goes i came in with a terrible attitude a terrible outlook on life outlook on life and no hope for my future i've spent i've spent he spent three of the 10 years that he's been there um in solitary confinement so 22 23 hours a day um he's and he writes parentheses 10 of my life question mark and at some point i truly became one of the people that people looked at me and saw when i first came into prison at 20. they would ask is this your first bid and he would say first i'm not coming back here and they would always laugh the older heads would always laugh everyone says that but everyone comes back and sure enough i did and so he talks about how he's there and during the pandemic he just he got lucky that he happened to be at this prison in maine that has this program where you can both enroll in a co in college coursework while you're in prison but you can also they also gave him limited internet access so some some prisons have this college kind of coursework that you could do to try to learn to better yourself but very few have the internet access so he gets on he immediately blows past the he gets hooked on programming and he blows past the college coursework starts doing starts becoming self-taught and just sort of um gets absolutely that's 14 15 hours a day he spends learning how to code learning about ultimately like databases he becomes a huge open source contributor to projects and people don't know because they just see his open source code they don't know his backstory so they they reach out with a job offer and then they find out about him well one company who did that was willing to actually employ him and so for the past few years he's working a full-time job from prison and he pays 10 of his wages to i guess like whatever he has whatever he owes or has to pay back and then the rest you know he keeps and he's like become this kind of inspiring figure and i just thought this was kind of an amazing uh example of you know doing what you want you know of making the most out of a otherwise pretty bleak situation he said he's falling quote well when you when i googled him his linkedin came up first and he is he's employed at torso is that right torso yeah wow okay and so what do you say see he had this one quote that i really like so he goes there was one day after spending a few years where i had an epiphany i started questioning everything about my life i no longer knew why i had accepted the former identity and situation none of it made sense to me anymore and i decided i was no longer okay being where i was or who i had become this is fantastic this is a great find it says on his linkedin he gets out this year i know i'm excited for him i'm rooting for him this is the this is the the new cereal for me um so so i thought this was pretty inspiring i do have one more and this one is a different lore story i hope this by the way if you know if you're connected to this guy he works at is it terso i don't know what that company is is that a big reputable company i had never heard of him before this so you know they've gotten a lot of pub from this but they're basically trying to rewrite sqlite is what i picked up if you're if you're somehow can get connected with this guy i'm not sure if he's allowed to watch youtube or whatever i would love to like see him comment uh let me tell you something not only is he allowed he restricts himself to one hour a day of youtube entertainment and the rest he spends coding he's got more self control than you or me they're just like us yeah yeah he did a podcast recently so i saw him on a podcast from prison and i really want to get him on here so if anybody can make that happen or knows him or can get us connected please do well presson if you see this comment on the youtube uh in the youtube comment section that'll be fun and we'll actually pin it and we'll see if we can get you on all right so i gave you one the bank of america guy the generous titan the the guy who builds the biggest bank in the history of planet earth takes no equity and essentially no salary in the process and doesn't yeah somebody one of these sort of uh bank moguls who says all the right things but then actually did all the right yeah he's about it kind of amazing he's about that life all right so then uh we have preston inspiring guy rising up from uh from you know his circumstances and doesn't let the past dictate the present um okay now the last one is a guy named stephen thomas and this one is a different different sort of lore story that just kind of also captured my imagination and sort of broke my brain a little bit all right so this guy stephen in 2011 he he's like a programmer i think in 2011 he gets paid to make a video about bitcoin and uh again 2011 so you know bitcoin i think the white paper was like a 09 thing i think bitcoin started in 2010 so it's one year into bitcoin and he makes an educational video about bitcoin he gets paid 7 000 bitcoin to do it and 7 000 bitcoin at the time is like 10 grand basically it's a couple it's like a dollar or two per bitcoin who paid him like who if you're a year in was it like satoshi i mean was it like a i don't think so um i think there was like you know some early companies that were you know interested in or you know making educational content about this um so that same 7 000 bitcoin is today worth 400 million bitcoin but of course that assumes you held now the crazy thing about stephen is he held he held the whole way now you might be wondering how does this guy have this incredible you know belief this conviction this foresight is he an investing genius does he have the self-discipline of a navy seal like how did he get himself to hold all the way up to you know bitcoin today 118 000 well the answer is he couldn't sell he lost the password to his bitcoin because what he did was when he got to bitcoin he stored it he did a best practice he stored it on a hardware wallet the iron key at the time the most secure way to hold bitcoin and he writes the password down to his iron key on a piece of paper folds it up puts it somewhere safe problem is he forgets about it because at the time it was a little bit of a smaller thing you know you know 7 10k cool i'm gonna hold this so we'll see what happens life happens and he loses the piece of paper is iron key a brand or is that like a protocol so it's a company wow company that that makes the it's the name of the device let's say great great product it works yeah exactly uh also great marketing for his product in a way i actually know i take the back it's pretty terrible work this is my fear with hardware wallets in general is you lose you you are the security vulnerability you lose the password so he loses the password and he goes and he tries to guess guess what it was guesses once guesses twice the problem is iron key has a limit you only get 10 so he has a 400 million dollar treasure sitting on a device that's in his house just sitting on his desk and he can't unlock it and he tries everything he tries to remember he tries looking everywhere for he tries to remember it he has hypnosis done to him to try to see if the hypnosis can bring it back out of his subconscious mind nothing's working he has now tried eight of his 10 password guesses oh he has two left as of as of right now now that alone is already just like oh dude what a it's like a party story it's like it gets weird dude have you seen the the old tv show twilight have you ever seen that like there's a famous episode thing no no no this is from the 50s there's a there's a very famous episode where this guy's like all i want to do is read all day and there's a doom apocalypse the world like ends and everyone dies and he's all by himself and he's like finally i get to read all day and then he's walking to go grab his favorite book and his glasses fall off and he mistakenly steps on him and it's like one of these like be careful what you wish for type of thing and uh this is this is it this is like it's like when you ask the genie for something but you weren't specific enough and it like this is that story that sucks it's almost worse it's like he had he found the genie and lost the lamp is actually what kind of what happened here um and so he he's got this genie he's got this lamp he's got this 400 million dollar treasure sitting on his desk which would be one of the biggest like found treasures sunken you know think about sunken treasures all around the world or discoveries of you know diamonds or gold or things like that this guy's just got one in his house it's crazy so now he's got two guesses left and this was as of 2021 and there's this team of basically like cryptographers slash treasure hunters who heard about this story and were like we're gonna try to break the iron key so they start working on all these methods now what they're what they're gonna do they weren't able to figure out how to actually like just pick the lock to open it without knowing the password but they took a different approach they're like can we get rid of this 10 password limit right if we can get rid of the 10 get 10 guess limit we can guess an infinite number of times so what they do is they figure out how to use a laser to cut open the usb without triggering the anti-tampering devices then they use nitric acid that they put on the thing to like get rid of another defense and these guys actually have done it they figured out how to turn the iron key into an infinite guess situation no way when did this happen like recently this happened a few years ago three or three four years ago oh here's the problem stefan doesn't want to work with them why he he goes i made a handshake deal with two other groups to try to crack this and i want to honor that and they're like what and so the the quote from these guys is we've cracked the iron key we just haven't cracked stefan yet oh they have the solution and he won't use it because he made a handshake agreement two other groups promising them a portion of the uh of of the proceeds but there's a never go around wait so it's seven thousand it's seven thousand oh so that's seven hundred million dollars uh yeah now it is yeah so there's there should be enough to go around right where you could have like three parties to work on this there should be more than enough in fact there's also other things that he could do he could just sell it today for a guaranteed payout to any of these groups right like you could be like i'll take 50 million today and you guys go ahead if you crack it you there's i think it's 800 million total or whatever 800 million is is uh you know minus 50 you can keep 750 if you can crack it but if you don't the risk is on you so he has like all these options and it's so bizarre to me that he is not taking any of the fantastic options that are in front of him um isn't this just weird this is weird is he wealthy complete nonsense nonsense what's this like i'm looking him up it looks like he it made me mad to be honest with you the first one the first story made me uh inspired the second story made me double inspired and the third story just pissed me off is stefan uh rich or or anything like that like is he a big deal i don't know if he's i mean i think he's done well he has done other stuff in the realm of crypto so he started this company called coil that was like trying to do something interesting in crypto failed he now is the creator of interledger which is like a kind of like an open payments protocol he's trying to make um yeah it's kind of weird i mean he's not 800 million dollars rich like you know i think this would be the the greatest thing he's ever done do you have any friends that have like like for example my roommate james uh was was like a hacker early on and he was hardcore in the space and he was doing the typical stuff like he was buying things like as soon as bitcoin was accepted in this weird experimental way he was like hell yeah let's do it uh and he like you know spent a thousand bitcoin on whatever do you have any friends who have done crazy things like that i have a friend that lost 200 bitcoin i know that i know personally just which today like you know every year it just sort of updates how bad that loss is so now it's a 23 million dollar loss he was kind of kicking himself when that was like a you know 200 000 loss or whatever at the time but he's like like you lost my mind he's like i mined 200 bitcoin it's on a like a a a hard drive somewhere i think i think i threw out the hard drive i think i threw out the laptop like it's gone and insane there's another guy that's got this story where he um his usb or his hard drive his bitcoin hard drive was in the landfill and he was trying to search for it they wouldn't they wouldn't let him he's like i will buy the whole landfill and he tried to purchase the landfill and they turned him down and this guy's just like trying to get access to this to this landfill to go search for his hardware so that's it that's what i got for you three stories um that's just my gift to you this week sam all right that's awesome that's great that's it that's it that's the pod
