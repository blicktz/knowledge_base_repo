It's sort of like if you look at what do our rich friends do now that's not common and then that's just going to become like more people are going to do that thing. What's going on? So did you see Andrew Huberman replying to my tweet?

Yeah, I did. I feel like kind of giddy a little bit. I feel a little honored.

Yeah. Do you feel I mean it's kind of cool to interact with them, right? Yeah, I think he's great.

I just I think he's really great. I like the cool part about this podcast is that we me and you get to hang out often and then once in a while like there's a bunch of guests I would say for all the guests I like them all but maybe two out of every 10 I'm like oh this is a this person you know they're my kind of people I just really get along with them and I really respect what they're doing and he's definitely one of those people. So hear me out.

I think that we should get okay so you have to go somewhere on Wednesday and so I went and found a guest tell me what you think about this guest and then when I got this person I was real I realized we should do this way often way more so I met this guy and he has his business that's like a fine local services business in California and I go what did you used to do and I was in the CIA I go what did you do there and he said I would go to the Middle East and I would try to commit people get people to commit treason and I would do it by trying to influence them and persuade them and basically give me secrets so I can you know we could do espionage and I was like that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard can you tell me everything and I just sat down for like an hour and I asked him questions and I asked him to come in the pod or podcast or that was pre pod pre pod and so I I go dude you just want to come out and tell me all these he like told me stories about being in like an alley in Lebanon trying to get some person to show up and he the way that he convinced he's got all these like weird stories and and and it's about persuasion and influence and shit and I realized I'm like Sean and I should just start doing that way more just getting people who are like interested in regardless if it has to do with money or not yeah yeah I think that's cool I met a guy once who he was like using our product and we held a meetup and like I think 200 people flew to our office and it was a big party basically and uh this guy and he was like he was always very mysterious because our product was kind of like clubhouse so you could just kind of sit there hang out all day just chat it was always online and I was like oh so you like don't work or what's the deal like you're always online doing this he's like oh yeah I'm like in between you know gigs and I was like oh my unemployment I didn't really think too much of it but when he showed up I was I noticed two things one is the guy was incredibly muscular like you know I kind of like bumped into him and it was like I hit a rock and I was like oh that was so strange but he wasn't trying to look super fit but I could tell it's like you know one of those people that like yeah they could do 90 000 pull-ups it's like oh your core is just incredibly you're just your whole body's made of muscle um it's not that you have giant muscles but your whole body is a muscle and um so I was like okay that's interesting noted and then later on in the night he um like I introduced him to two people one person was from Russia he spoke Russian with them I introduced another person from Pakistan he spoke in like Urdu with them and I was like how many languages do you speak was he a white guy white guy and I was like and he spoke with like per almost like a perfect accent and I was like what the hell why do you know how to speak in all these different languages he's like oh um and he kind of like as the night got on like you know he wasn't drinking but we were all drinking and he's like he kind of confided he was like yeah I was actually a spy for many years uh and he starts telling me these stories and they're so unbelievable that I'm like I just kind of think this guy is he lying is he telling the truth it's very hard to tell because the stories are so good like you know the story is like you know he's in a bar in Russia and you know this mobsters there and then Yuri Milner the the famous investor comes in and he's like okay I want to talk to Yuri um and Yuri just kind of blows him off and he says something in Russian and he's like the perfect one-liner and I was like what's going on here so we go to the battery later that night the battery is basically this private members club in San Francisco that is like a soho house for San Francisco and my the previous investor who bankrolled my whole company the idea lab that I was working at he created the battery so we go we're hanging out there and on the way out it's like two in the morning we're leaving and the battery has I think 14 hotel rooms but really there's like the penthouse that you rent out for parties and the penthouse I think was like 10 grand a night at least maybe 15 grand a night to rent out um and there's an elevator that goes straight up to the penthouse and so at that elevator we're walking out and at the elevator is Elon Musk he's getting in the elevator and it's him it's Jason Calacanis and it's two other people we don't know and uh and I was just like you know kind of like fangirl moment was like oh that's Elon Musk and so the guy the spy guy he's with me and he goes oh Elon's there he goes hold on he walks over and they're waiting for the elevator the elevator's about to be there he walks straight up to them and he goes like classic picker bar this doesn't address Elon he goes Jason he's like Jason and he goes to Jason Calacanis Jason Calacanis is like oh hey uh what's up then he's like he's like Jason um I met you last year at the conference and I told you you know what I do with the government and all that um uh you know I offered you a tour I I offered you a tour but I forgot to give you my number um let me give you my number now and I'll be able to get you that tour and if uh if if Elon wants to come he can come too oh my god he's like he's like he like focused on he's got guys it was just sort of like uh you know Elon if you're interested you're welcome to join as well you can take along and then he walked away and I was just laughing because it wasn't like some super it's like he tried to do a super smooth move wasn't that smooth in my opinion but it was still hilarious and he had the balls to approach so you know good for him so who was the guy uh I mean I don't want to say his name but yeah he's just a guy and I like haven't seen him since that was my one night with the CIA guy well this guy's coming on uh when you're gone and long story short we should do more cool like that yeah for sure speaking of cool can you I don't know what's going on with this constitutional and I know you know everything about it can you tell me because it's actually amazing or like yes I think it's amazing I got a dm a few days ago and it says hey a group of us are getting together to buy the constitution okay it's like like like the United States Constitution the United States Constitution I think there's um 11 of them right there's 11 copies I think there's only one that's in the hands of private private buyers this is the one who owns it um so I don't know who owns it but it's being auctioned off by Sotheby's so they said hey there's a Sotheby's auction in a couple days we're going to create a dow which is a crypto term for basically like a group just a group of people think of it like a company um we're going to form a dow and anybody could contribute contribute any amount you want and we're going to try to buy the constitution I was like what the and I was like you know I was like that's great um I was like how much is it you know and I think he said they're going to need I want to say 10 or 20 million dollars I think it's 20 million dollars that they're going to need to raise who messaged you um I mean I don't think they all want their like name out there necessarily okay well who's the organizer behind this it's a it's a small group of kind of like nft collectors so they basically it's not packy or no he's kind of so they they basically approached me packy and I think some others to try to help get the word out so the the amazing thing is so there's this thing called so they created constitution dow and um and they have raised in three days I think three million dollars from two thousand people something like that so I'll just pull up their twitter handle so the twitter twitter handle is constitution dow and it says we the people for the people we're buying we're buying the constitution um from Sotheby's in four days we need your help and then if you go to the website it shows that they have uh it says amazing copy at the top what if we held hands and bought the constitution together it's just hilarious way of putting it and then it says they've raised 3.6 million dollars so far and I think they need where do they write their target um okay I don't think they write their target anywhere here uh but I I'm pretty sure I asked the guy I'm pretty sure they said they need like roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that's crazy it's actually pretty amazing so who who how does it work who owns it and who and how is it tracked and how do you know to trust these people the way this would work is a group of people get together they buy a thing now this is how they've bought several other things so they bought uh the people are creating dow's to buy crypto punks so oh you want a crypto punk but a punk costs like a million dollars now you don't have a million dollars well you want to put you want to invest ten ten thousand dollars into a crypto punk cool so we can all pull together ten thousand each and buy a crypto punk collectively for a million dollars and we all own whatever that math comes out to as you know we don't do public math something like whatever you know less than one percent of the crypto punk is yours and you can sell your stake in the crypto so they fractionally own it so that's what I think they're trying to do here is they're trying to fractionally own uh the constitution which is hilarious they're going to turn the con they can take the actual constitution they're going to turn it into an f nft and then you can fractionally own the nft and what laws or my loose understanding of it how does it protect the investors how are the investors protected um protected in what way what do you need protection from who's who's that to get you um they can lie about the price that they sold it they can never sell it they can uh who so okay we're buying it if they get a hold of it then they can accidentally ruin it i don't know how they do custody so like i don't know who actually holds the keys maybe it's a group that owns the keys i think the way the dow is structured is there's a wallet the wallet holds the nft and it requires x percent vote in order to do anything with it to move the nft again um so you kind of vote as a group and if whatever over 50 of people do it then um then then they're gonna okay hold on let me tell you what this person said um so okay maybe i could say his name it says it in his profile so this guy austin kane reached out he goes um we're literally he just he started off hot we are literally purchasing the constitution of the united states okay i go cool how much is it uh southerby's estimate is around 15 to 20 million we're building around the clock you're the nft we did shaped his views on this idea so i'd love to have you be a part of it blah blah and they're basically pulling together assets i think the discord group that they have has like thousands of members like i think they had 10 million in soft commitments like verbal commitments and three point something million actually funded uh commitments and so uh you crowd fund the dow um and then i think they what they plan to do is they actually plan to hold the physical constitution in like the smithsonian or something like that um so they they plan to like have have do they make a profit does this guy austin make a profit for organizing um i don't know they don't you know there's not a ton of details and about the how the dow is structured and whether they have like some preferential thing and you know oh by the way so this is the same idea they got 10 million in three days 10 millions they're soft commitments they have 3.6 actually wired into their wallet and you're gonna say we had this for the jordan thing and yeah uh looking like i was talking to a friend about that the other day i'm like i still think that would be great the only reason it i like if we ever actually wanted to do this i think there's the difference is is that that that constitution is likely just being sold to the highest bidder whereas if so if jordan found out that someone was going to do x y and z he'd be like no that i don't want to do that yeah yeah perhaps perhaps uh then again it's been on the market for what seven ten years something like that so maybe maybe he's ready to sell if somebody can actually meet me uh you know meet the price i think we one challenge we had was a we're just busy and just kind of around saying it somebody would actually have to go boots on the ground figure out go see it go figure out why it's not selling figure out what the you know the the rules are around could people airbnb it or could you turn it into a museum or could you do something with it or is it literally going to be an inactive asset um you know but i think this is something that can happen there's another version of this have you heard of kraus house no what's that so i'm a little jealous i didn't think of this idea myself but i like my name i might just do my own the name is really good kraus house so kraus house which is k-r-a-u-s uh house um um it might be the weird spelling of house too but basically they're uh it's kraus house dot club and here's what it says we're a dow of basketball fans and we're crazy enough that we're going to try to buy an nba team and so they're basically trying to do the same thing they're trying to crowd fund and buy an nba team today nba teams are owned by billionaires you know successful business people steve ballmer types who go buy these teams for one to two billion dollars and the idea here is why don't why wouldn't all the fans of let's say you know like the diehard crazy fans of you know the grizzlies or whatever like uh why wouldn't they band together could they band together could they raise enough money um between fans of the team and investors who just would love to own a piece of an nba team and you buy the team and then you you control the team through the same sort of vote so you decide which gm do we hire do we keep this person on for another year or not and so it's sort of like a crowd controlled nba team which is you can't you that that's a yeah it's a dope idea it's incredibly it's impossible because with buying a basketball team uh or any american sports major like one of the top four or five sports it's impossible to buy or not impossible the the issue is not the lack of money the issue is that it's like you know in england they knight you and they start calling you sir richard branson in america we allow you to buy a sports team like it's a select group of people and very few people are actually allowed to do it and it's done that way on purpose so for all the people that's true you you basically you have to get approved by the other 30 owners so um you know they can vote to block you but that's not to say they would vote to block this like i think this could generate a ton of uh attention and press and be seen as pretty forward thinking i don't think it's a given that they would block this um i don't think it's a given that they block it but my point is is this is not like a thing like oh i'll just get the money and buy it i'll just go and buy it right yeah but i do think money is the limiting factor here because uh if you go like there's a team that's for sale right now and if you want to buy them you have to go put up the you know sort of like you i think you need to come over the top with the bid so you're not going to get a deal here you'd have to say okay you know the price is 2 billion we're going to play 2 billion or we're going to pay 2.4 we're going to play 3 billion because we have to be the winning bidder and if you could choose between a simple clean transaction with another billionaire you'd probably take that so we're going to have to like buy something that's got hair on the deal now there's another group that's doing this in a much more uh practical way and i don't know if practical is better so what they're trying to do is they're they have a dow and they're trying to buy a like fourth tier um soccer team in like the english premier league or whatever so there's like not a not a team that's i don't know how soccer works but it's like not the actual premier league but it's like you know there's the ranking system where you can like ladder in or you can get demoted out so they're buying one at the bottom and that's like a no it's it's you know the show ted lasso they're basically trying to do ted lasso so they're buying this like joke of a team who did that and they're like great uh it's another group of people another another crypto group uh that's putting this together and they're they're buying the team they're gonna oh and that they can do that's a pretty permissionless thing and the price is like not you don't need two billion dollars to do it you can buy it for 10 million dollars and so you're going to buy this team for 10 million bucks they're going to crowd control the whole thing they're going to mint nfts because they're going to own the ip of the team brand and they're going to they're trying to be like they're trying to show what uh technology kind of like first crypto first team how they would run their team as an example that other bigger teams might be able to like look at and say oh that's smart how they are they minted they sold 20 million dollars of nfts for their team and every jersey comes with that nft how does that work um or well you know there's a social token that gets you access for season tickets like what does that mean and so they're trying to demonstrate it that way and they're trying to literally rank up and the goal is to eventually get into the premier league and be you know can they one day go play against manchester united or whatever um that would be the dream i don't want to spend much time talking about nfts and crypto because i'm so bored of it but i just read this amazing wall street journal article about gary vanderchuk did you happen to see that i didn't see that but uh i've been following kind of what he's been doing but tell me what what stood out to you gary's if for the listeners gary's been on the pod a ton if you everyone probably knows who he is if you don't know he's basically he's a celebrity for having a big mouth but he's like cool and he's and he talked but he talks a lot and he owns an agency that at this point is quite large if i had a bet i would say they're like a 200 million revenue business like it's really big and he bootstrapped it and he is on fire lately so basically before we get to the article lately he launched a thing with michael rubin where um i forget michael rubin launched two new businesses and gary's a partner in one of them i think it's the like nft trading card one is that it yeah you tell me about this yeah yes and then he also is doing he has a new book coming out and he just launched this thing like a year ago we had him on when he did it called v friends which i think it's like a collection of nfts i think it's valued north of 500 million dollars right uh i'll have to look up the latest but yeah it was basically like a top 10 top 15 it's been a top 10 top 15 um crypto project for its entirety basically and i talked to him like the day it launched or something like that um i was with him at this dinner and i think he said that he made like 20 or 30 million dollars that day from it like just a huge sum of money there's been 93 million dollars of sales of v friends and i think he gets you know let's say at 10 to 10 to 15 stake uh of royalty on every sale um so i think it's pretty easy to estimate at the i think at the low end he's made 10 million dollars off of v friends at the high end it could be like 30 million so he's just like prolific let's say what it does he decided to make a nft token that you could own it and it guarantees you one utility just the way we did an nft that said you get five minutes of air time on our pod someday by the way the guy who bought it reached out okay what he said he's an interesting guy doing interesting things and so you know he want i asked him i said do you want to cash that in or you're gonna hold and uh he hasn't replied yet the um uh gary v did one where he said if you only is the buyer my conference is the buyer just a rich guy is just like a rich crypto guy i think he's yeah i think he's like crypto rich basically not like mega mega rich not like crypto billionaire rich i don't think um but it's like a wealthy crypto guy who's yeah like got in early ish and has done very well and is now and doing a bunch of things so anyways gary v's his nft if you bought it great you have this nft which might be cool as an nft you might like the art it might be might he might launch more products into it someday but at the very minimum it gave you access to his conference so it was a conference ticket in a way for that you could use and and there's the only i think the only way to get into the conference maybe so that's what he did and he hasn't even i think he just announced when the conference is going to happen and it's going to happen for a guaranteed three years or something yeah so we kind of bumped it back but whatever so kind of cool so his latest thing he's got this new book it's called 12 something 12 things to be a good leader something like that i forget and he had a rule that or he created this thing where if you bought 12 copies of the book you would receive a mystery nft it's still to be determined what that nft or uh in token actually like what does that actually get you but he that's what he promised and so far as of today it is the largest pre-order ever in in publishing history he has uh i think as of yesterday he has sold one million copies of his book before it's even gone live and the people have no idea uh you know what what they're getting the way that he did it was he last night or a few days ago he did a three-hour live youtube and instagram thing where he told people to buy the book um and his whole shtick is basically like i don't ask for much and i provide a ton of content when i have a book come out i'm begging everyone to buy it so that's kind of cool and that's what he did and it's the largest book release ever and that is nuts that is so crazy so uh the way and you know why people are buying this right you know why people are buying 12 copies of this book because oh did i not say the 12th copy they get one of these tokens right they get they get a mystery nft so he promised you that there's gonna be an nft it's gonna be good and it's gonna be for anybody who buys i i think i don't know if there's tears or what but like yeah 12 or more uh books you're gonna be able to get one and so um and so so it's kind of crazy right like that's in one million books is an insane number of books to sell very few books do a million a million copies i think um i was looking at this site because i i signed up to write a book next year with uh tucker max's thing and i was like okay so what's like good you know is good like a hundred thousand copies ten thousand copies no i bet it's like a thousand they're like the you know some stat 99 point whatever percent don't sell a thousand won't even sell a thousand copies ten thousand copies it's like you know yes the best sellers do eventually sell you know like a hundred thousand copies and then there's things like you know like for our work week or in this category at least atomic habits i think atomic habits he did three million copies sold in about the first two years or something like that and the biggest winner of the past five years is mark manson's book which one was that the subtle art of not giving a fuck that book was so big that when i was reading the uh quarterly reports for whatever it's owned by harper's which is owned by foc the one of rubert murdoch's companies i don't remember if it's fox or news corp but anyway they like one of their big things was talking about that book and how it's like saved their publishing business right uh and there's basically so so why did this work so uh one reason why it worked is because gary's been doing this for you know he's been building trust for like 20 years uh you know like i've known about gary v for 10 years and i thought you know he didn't start then i don't think so definitely before that so he's built up a lot of trust and he's like maniacal about content production like he he creates so much content in addition to everything else he does um and it helps right the content helps feed the agency it helps feed all the things he helps sell books but like the amount of content he produces is wild so he builds up this trust he was talking about nfts before he's talking about trading cards before trading cards had their huge run-up so if you're like oh gary's talking about trading cards i don't know about that i'm gonna i'm gonna hold off and see how it goes then you just see this huge run-up at basketball cards then gary v starts talking about pokemon and um then he starts talking about nfts pokemon goes up through the roof nfts go up through the roof and then you look at his track record you say oh man he kind of was also big on social media before social media was obvious he was saying you know i remember when instagram got bought he went on the news and everybody's underpriced he's like this is this is a steal and everybody else thought oh my god they paid a billion dollars it has zero dollars in revenue like what are they doing and he was like are you joking like this is a this is absolute steal by facebook he was talking about musically and music how people make how kids were making music videos before musically turned into tick tock and i remember tons of people making fun of him like okay you know great yeah yeah 12 12 we're all gonna be like 12 year olds making dance videos in our bedrooms he was right so he's right on social media he's right on baseball on trading cards he was right on pokemon then he was right on nfts he started talking about nfts and if he's had this huge bull run partly because he like i have his stature him and logan paul when they started talking about pokemon they started talking about nfts it actually drove a lot of attention into nfts a lot of adoption so um then he launches his own and you're like oh do i want to buy this v friends this doodle that he made it's priced at two and a half eth uh so he auctioned off the initial ones at two and a half eth uh today the floor price meaning the minimum you could the lowest price you can buy it for is 8.1 so if you just bought if you just bought hit uh that's like do eight times roughly four grand so you know 32 32 000. um so basically you you're up almost 4x on you're up 3x basically on on the last thing he told you about so this time when he says hey buy my book i'm gonna get you a special nft you might have missed v friends you missed the nfts when i told you about them you missed you know the basketball cards before they they all got hot get this one right and i think if you have a track record of being early and right this kind of like fomo builds and people just start to trust you and i think that's what's happening right here is people are like all right cool i'm in i'll do this yeah and i think what i would like to do is i i don't know this but eventually i would like to do it is i want to look at what he's been wrong about so gary is right a lot but he takes a ton of shots and i was reading glass door reviews of vayner media to understand like what's what's cool about working there why people like it so much uh and they were saying like the the haters of which there always be haters where it was like the negative review said something like he's always saying the latest and greatest thing is going to be the next big thing for example and then they named like four apps and i'm like oh i'm not even like these are dead those are cool like two years ago and so i'd be curious what what he's been wrong about but i do think that that he's likely right more than he's wrong and he's been right in big ways yeah um i was actually watching him so he did another cool thing actually not to make this the kind of gary v hour but um he did an interview with mark zuckerberg which i thought was a pretty big deal amazing amazing it was so good yeah he it was good dude he steamrolled suck too he kept interrupting of which the comments were just ripping him for he steamrolled mark zuckerberg yeah he somebody said in the comments they go uh gary's talking to mark about social like he's his big brother and mark's his little brother but you know obviously mark's like we're like invented social networking and like runs runs the world um but it was true he really was kind of like all over him he's a better talker than mark right so that's actually kind of natural he's a better um speaker he's more engaging and he has he's quicker off the cuff and mark is a little bit more you know rehearsed and kind of thoughtful about his words that doesn't always play super well you know in front of a camera but uh what did you think of that interview did you hear anything that yeah i thought it was great i thought gary said something cool about how he's nfts were going to be big because of farmville and how people would pay for these badges and then he also referenced another facebook app that i didn't i don't know what it was but my context clues were like okay it was like a thing where you could like purchase a cool picture and he was like that's how i knew it was going to be big and mark goes you know i never really thought of that yeah and i thought that was funny i thought that was pretty cool also mark's haircut was horrible as if they just like put a ball on his head and just cut the bangs around it what's he doing with a bad haircut like that it's all actually gary had a great line in that which he's like he's like basically mark's talking about like the the the metaverse you're gonna have this this avatar you're gonna have like your character who has its own virtual clothing and it wears that like it looks like a sim basically if you ever played the sims and gary's like you've been living this life like basically like mark already looks like a sim like mark looks more like a character from a video game than an actual human being he talks more like a character of a video game than a human being and he wears the same exact thing every day on purpose which is what your character in a video game does like black shirt blue pants and he said and he and he nagged him and he goes this is you already he didn't go into details but he was he was kind of like complimenting like you've been ahead of the curve but i thought it was hilarious um you know that he called him out on that in a way um all right let me ask you a quick question so i've been thinking about this something i've been thinking about we've had a bunch of friends talk about screen time limiting screen time and i've been thinking about this so i just did a very short amount of research so basically uh i was curious about what trends have existed where rich that separated rich people from poor people for example um in in the greek and roman era which actually i don't know what years those were actually um bc sometime bc uh basically the you were rich if you were uh very very white and roman poetry would praise the white girl and that meant like the the pale and and paleless was yeah it was a was a mark of beauty and um of social class and things like that because basically you're not outside working really hard of course uh that changed and in the 1960s like uh it kind of started around right around that time where being tan meant that you have a leisure you know you have enough time to go hang out outside and have fun and skin tone became kind of a marker of wealth and in during world war ii women were using tea bags as self self tanner coco chanel around uh the the 1930s 1940s talked about uh being bronze and being tan and so now it's like became popular to be tan so what do you think and i'll tell you what i think mine is what do you think in like 20 30 50 100 years is going to be that thing my opinion is what it's going to be is a lack of screen time so not like like it's gonna be like oh you use a computer no i don't know i don't use it yeah i think it's going to be people and so like uh mark lori talked about that i believe jack dorsey talked about that elon musk has mentioned it bill gage says his kids don't get screen time that's what he said yeah he said this a few years ago this came out i think he kind of backed off it because it sounds really bad because like dude you addicted the whole earth to social media and you're like don't let your kids do it but uh let me see what the the exact thing is but i remember for sure um that he either limited or um or said you know uh said he wouldn't do it so he said i noticed that once i kind of got a little bit more success in my career like i don't check anything uh on the weekends and like some for like different projects like i'll get to it when i get to it like i'm just not going to check my email uh i don't want to be on a screen yeah i remember it was a big deal when he said i think his kids were like under three at the time so it was like uh you're probably not doing a ton of it was like my daughter's too she has a ton of screen time but like you know i get mark sarker doesn't have to do that necessarily so he he was like yeah maybe when they get older as they get older i'm sure they will but uh but people were like hey you know the people the media sort of out to get you you know in this kind of case i've got i've got a couple like pretty wealthy friends and they'll be like yeah like our kid has never like we don't use our phone in front of them um we don't let them see a phone and then i you know i'll go and hang out with other friends who maybe aren't in that position and like we go out to dinner and they're playing on the phone the whole time and so that's my pretty i think it's already happening and i think it's going to happen in the next 20 30 years there's a few more so there's actually um there's actually uh you know other ones so i think back in the day uh being fatter so having a big belly used to be a sign of wealth um because obviously you had enough like means to to eat food and you were you had a leisurely lifestyle and now it's the exact opposite right so like um uh you know having you know abs is more seen as a higher status thing than having a belly uh somebody used to i have a big nose people used to tell somebody told me once like oh back in the day that was like a sign of like great power and authority or something like that i don't know if that one really could change over time because you can't really control it as much i guess nose jobs but but i think you're absolutely right that these things shift over time that the status signals that you have shift and it's basically you want to be doing what the masses are not doing so um you know if everybody's on horseback you want to be in a car when everybody's on in a car you want to go learn horseback riding um that sort of thing same thing with like hunting like you know uh having others hunt for you and then now it's like a a status symbol in a way to be able to have the free time and the skill to be able to go out and um go out and go hunting like have a hobby have a hobby like that i think that um i think you're absolutely right that being away from like the digital experience like how like being able to not have to either work online play online or talk to people online it's going to be a status like it's definitely like a status symbol because it's going to be so rare it's going to be rare you know more rare than whatever you know a diamond or gold or anything like that it's because everybody is going to be completely engrossed as we already are halfway there in like kind of like the online world so having anything in the offline world is going to be like a extreme luxury and that actually like if in terms of like money making and business that actually like is an interesting trend to look at um there's this thing called a uh what's the dumb phone thing is it called a light phone like um i keep hearing a lot of people talk about this thing have you heard of the light phone i i don't know much about getting it so basically if you haven't seen it the light phone is a really minimalistic looking phone looks pretty cool honestly uh looks very clean design just like like a very basic phone that doesn't have apps like it looks like a zoom remember a zune or microsoft it looks like the early cell phones but just like cleaner and um you know like a flip phone or whatever and basically it's just a phone that doesn't have apps so you can text on it you could call on it but you can't use the internet beyond that and um it's meant to be like hey do you want to like you don't want to be detached from the world maybe your kids or whatever like uh you know as you uh you know if you need to be reached for an emergency but uh but you don't want to be kind of like on instagram you know at the time i think it's a great idea the problem with it is kind of an inconvenience with it which is like i think you need to like you need to be like switch your sim card every time you want to use it and like that if you want to use the same phone number so that's kind of annoying but um um i think it's great and i'm surprised this isn't bigger i think it was like a kickstarter project uh i'll buy it i'm gonna buy it so we just did this nft thing and we said we'll do content stuff i'm gonna set us up with the uh or i'll set it up and you can decide if you want to go with the health thing with that executive checkup and then i'll uh i'll buy one of these uh light phones and we could talk about it i think it's amazing i think it's cool you can still use music i think it's really cool yeah i think it's great and and what else comes to mind that's like this uh so what are some other things so there's obviously in-person experiences so travel meetings concerts i think that already kind of has like a bit of a premium but i think that'll get extended the premium will get larger the uh the rarity will get will get higher on on that because if most meetings just happen over zoom then you'll it'll be a special meeting when you make an effort to go fly and meet somebody face to face um same thing with a concert if you you know going there and being there and experiencing it it's going to be one of those feelings you can really only get by doing that so it's going to become more valuable over time like i was talking to a comedian and he said like he's like dude i was worried like you know after covid what would happen he's like demand is roaring back he's like the demand now for shows is higher than it was pre-pandemic and so you're asking what else is like this uh well the rich people poor people think what else could be kind of a status symbol i think i have a couple yeah i think like the splitting time thing between cities um it's still expensive but it's one place it's still expensive but it's not prohibitively expensive um so like i think that that's going to be uh far more calm i'm doing it now and i realize i'm like in a fortunate situation but i think that it's far more uh accommodating than ever before uh so i think that like that part-time living and in splitting time between cities is going to be quite common um i don't know what else yeah i think that's a that's actually a great one uh it's sort of like if you look at what do our what do our rich trends do now that's not common and then that's just going to become like like more people are going to do that thing so like you know like you're talking about having a few either airbnbs or like having three homes and just shift like throughout the year just shifting based on where you want to be in whatever season you want to be in and not having like a hometown um dude here's a more of a thing here's one and you're getting into it now i've been into it for a minute as well which is did you see it so i guess well kind of i tweeted out asking people to see to say like what would like so i'm i'm building this house um and i'm like how would you optimize it for longevity health and fitness and i got so many amazing replies and the most consistent one was cold plunge and sauna so many people are interested in that and i think that that's a much bigger trend than i ever thought so i think having home saunas and and home cold tubs that is something that's going to be that's i think we're still in the early stages of that i never would have thought that that was going to be a thing uh yeah that's the i just bought a sauna by the way like two days ago i know i saw you what's his name andrew said like don't do infrared and you're like uh but i bought an infrared is that so okay yeah uh by the way there's a sick company so check this out is it uh david david's company florenz have you seen this this guy just dm'd me who i'm friends with he spoke at hustlecon he goes hey i just met with sean about my sauna business and he said this guy yeah and he said that you also like this type of stuff have you um did you go look at it did you see it that's sick uh he just he he dm'd me a video and you want to explain what it was so basically how do you spell it uh uh floor so there's two that that got um that got uh that got kind of like highlighted here um where are you at the url is we are florenz um how do you spell florenz uh f-l-o-r-e-n-s f-l-o-r-e-n-s okay um okay so basically we are florenz uh so basically what he's done is he's built a in a custom kind of like new version of in-home sauna it plugs into a normal normal outlet which when i was looking up saunas that was like one big thing it's like you have to i don't want to have to get an electrician out here to handle the power of the sauna it's like small enough where it fits in uh it's like a great like like it's like made for like you know one person it could fit easily then there's a super nice like super clean design so like most saunas kind of look like this kind of same cabin looking feel this looks like it fits in like a modern home it's like very slick looking um and so he's building this thing and he showed me one he's got it i'm gonna go visit him he's got one down here not too far from where i live that's in the procedure uh so then there's one then there's one of the presidio called ancient ritual have you seen this one or that's when i saw ancient ritual so ain't so there's two so ancient ritual is the other one that people are kind of hyping up and i think that one is like almost like peloton for a sauna so you get in normally when you get into a sauna you're like on your own it's like dude here go sit in this this hot box and like think or you know talk to the naked guy next to you like i don't know like do whatever you want to do i think what ancient i don't know exactly what ancient ritual is doing but i think what they're doing is it's sort of like a guided meditation they have sounds they have sense they have like uh they'll talk you through like what to what to like it's like it's like calm or like headspace like meets a sauna uh that's my like prediction they're a little bit they're very stealthy there's like nothing on the website but that's my understanding of it just from uh figuring it out dude the florence thing is amazing yeah so i'm really excited about both of these i don't think either of these is like you know mega huge business but i think it's i think it could definitely be a really healthy business um and it might be one of those that surprises you maybe there's bigger demand maybe this is maybe this ends up like pools right like i think um our buddies are in the they bought a pool construction company who was telling me something like you know um like some absurd percentage of homes like uh 50 of homes or whatever in in areas that can host a pool like will get a pool in some in the suburbs and um and it's like a it's or it's that's not the exact percentage but it's like it's a 50 000 average ticket um it's the number one like kind of like optional upgrade to a house that that happens and um and so you know those companies are doing really well pool construction companies and so maybe if you fast forward 10 years down the road sauna and cold plunge is going to be as common as swimming pool is in america like i could i could see a world where that's the case i definitely could too so um i'll have to remember exactly what these the the the study says but there's a there was a very reputable and famous study and it said two interesting things the first thing that it said was if you sauna for two 20-minute sessions a week it decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease by something like 30 or 40 percent a massive number then it said if you sauna for three 20-minute sessions a week it's going to decrease it by like 60 percent like it's like the the numbers are like astronomical just from two to three let alone zero to two and so saunas like uh i i the what the way it works is basically like when your body heats up that much um i guess it stresses it and that's that's a really healthy and good stress and uh anyway it's pretty sick i'm all about that do you want to talk about these last two things you have on here i'm very eager what those are yeah uh let's talk about them by the way just to put an end point on this um like we talk about this because just we're interested in it and like whatever it's just this is our hangout if you want to be able to fall on the wall great but i would also say there's been a big lesson i've learned that is anytime people live anytime you discover a group of people who are very interested in and living a lifestyle that is different than yours is very easily initially to write it off and just say oh that's frivolous that's um that's just kind of like whatever you know they're out of touch or uh they're weird or whatever like it doesn't really matter what what category it is like when i when i saw gamers and people who stream video games and watch other people playing video games it was so strange to me i remember making fun of this kid in college because i walked in on him and he was watching somebody else play a video game on a live stream and the guy was playing in korea and i was like you're watching a dude in korea play this video game why don't you just play better yet why don't you get outside and like let's go go get some food and i made fun of him for it and then years later i'm like selling my company to twitch and like i'm i'm like talking about how great this trend is and he's like called me he's like you mother you know like i dude you made fun of me for this 10 years ago and here you are now like now you're on board and i that's happened to me so many times in life that now i go the exact opposite way i see some somebody like you who says the same thing that our other buddy said which is maybe i should go to the mayo clinic and get these advanced scans done once a year i think huh maybe that's something more people are going to want to do why would he want to do this why are people choosing plant-based lifestyles what is that all about you know like and so now i lean in anytime we discover these things and that's become some of the best a like either like discoveries life changes i can make or b investments it's a great way to invest because you're actually on the like the cutting edge of stuff you're in early which is super important obviously there's a book on like a famous business book on it where he talks i think it's crossing the chasm or something where he talks about like early adopters and then like the there's basically this like bell curve of people where it's like in the beginning of the bell curve it's like late people who are late to it and then like the middle is like the average joe and there's like early adopters and there's one more like cutting edge and you and i both have like a handful of friends of which i would actually say that i i forget the names of them but in that bell curve there's people who are getting on names because you got the idea right but you uh like butchered all the names so it's basically the earliest is innovators and it's like the people actually like figuring things out and then there's early adopters then there's early majority that's the kind of like big chunk late majority that's the other part of the big chunk and then there's the laggards who are like you know people who still have aol email addresses and like you know are looking driving around looking for blockbusters and for a lot of things i would say you are on the right side you're uh either an innovator or the one next to it an early adopter i'm trying to go i'm intense i'm intentionally trying to go that way so i thought uh you know i'm just not that i'm not like a futurist type of guy because i've been so wrong and i i figured out the formula for it the formula for it is um have an ego make a prediction be wrong like five times and have it rubbed in your face how wrong you were boom you're not you're now a futurist uh like i remember the first time the iphone came out and i was like who the wants to like read tiny text on a screen like that's awful i was like nobody's gonna watch a movie on this i was like yeah you can watch who would ever watch a movie on this like tiny square like that's like that would be the worst it's worse than an airplane headrest like i remember saying these things to people and you know like i was in college i was like a junior in college there's nobody remembers this but i remember being that wrong snapchat i remember being that wrong my username still has the word test in it because i was so certain i was like snapchat this is this stupid right this is just for kids and dick pics and stuff like that like certainly won't go on beyond this bitcoin i was wrong early on right like guys in my office were telling me about it back in 2012 2013 and i was kind of laughing and saying guys let's focus on something like legit here and now i'm like you know a bitcoin evangelist and so like twitch same thing i was wrong about streaming i've been wrong so many times that i've actually flipped the script now i kind of had to reassess my life and say i'm not going to be very good as a technology entrepreneur or a technology investor if i just continue to write off the big things as dumb and stupid early on like i need to go the exact opposite way okay what would it take for me to do that and then i just i just inverted so instead of you know anytime i see that the same feeling i instead lean into curiosity what's making people want to do this when i think it's so strange and now that's that's like flip the script for me and we either had justin or emmett on at hustlecon or on here and they're talking about justin tv which was the site before twitch became a thing and it was basically uh anyone could log in and create their own live tv channel and emmet i believe you could tell me if i'm wrong i believe the story was like emmet but like there's a small corner of the site where these like guys are watching video games and it wasn't a lot of people like thousands of people but they were spending it was two percent i think of the traffic um at that time but they were spending a significant amount of time watching and he was like that's this is the one that we got to go to and and i don't even think it was that as data driven actually the data pointed against it because again remember it was a small trap it was a small amount they had a combination of two things working in their favor number one emmet was like i i guess actually the number one factor was they were the current thing wasn't working and they had like no like they had nothing to lose they don't they were going to run out of money and fail or they had to try something dramatically different and um when you feel like you're fucked and you have nothing to lose you actually have the one of the greatest assets on your side um which is that you know when you have nothing to lose you play completely differently than when you feel like you have something to lose so that was the first thing they had to change the the things that were popular were all like uh illegal streams it's legal streams of sports so they knew oh people want to watch this but we can't ever build a business around this yeah so what 90 of people are doing on this site we can't use the two percent thing worked and then the other one was he was like i personally like watching these so he's like i'm gonna go with that like these are my favorite things to watch on the network so if i'm gonna work on this i'm gonna work on the ones that i personally find you know the most interesting and actually most of the company wanted to go work on the hotter sexier idea which was called uh what was the thing called the video thing they had not vidi their their version of it called social cam social cam so the company split in half they said all right justin tv is not going to work abandon ship and we got to figure out you know what's the what's the emergency ship and so they had this i think michael seibel who now runs y combinator and justin khan they wanted to do social cam it was instagram for video instagram is the hottest startup in the silicon valley but it's photos we're going to do instagram for video and they were able to instantly raise money they got tons of initial hype and traction and press and all the talented people in the company wanted to go work there so i talked to this guy jacob who's the og designer at twitch and he's still there he's still at the company today and i said uh how'd you know like to bet on twitch instead of social cam he goes oh no dude i wanted to be on social cam they were just like nah like we don't like teams full bro like you go work on on the thing with emmet because emmet is his childhood friend he's like you you got to go do that one he's like ah fuck all right whatever and you know so like that was what seemed like the great idea but actually what emmet did which was leaned into this really weird behavior unique lifestyle that these gamers were doing where they were streaming themselves playing for eight hours a day that turned out to be the thing and that's kind of my point which is like i think that there's like these i i do it on online communities particularly reddit but you can right now you could do it on twitter or you could just type in like any idea or any hobby and type in the word forum and you could just find like these niche communities of people that are kind of freaks and it's fun to like learn all about it like for example intermittent fasting fasting is now like we all talk about it um i remember like eight years ago i remember business insider wrote an article about like a microsoft executive and they mocked him for the like intermittent fasting what is this and uh but there's there's been communities online where i've like read about people doing this for forever and you're like fasting like no like breakfast is the most important meal of the day just look at anything they make fun of silicon valley for at the beginning of coronavirus it's like vcs are so paranoid about the real world that they're wearing masks to conferences guess what everybody's doing now wearing masks right uh oh my god intermittent fasting silicon valley's latest craze not eating till noon every day you know what a google what google engineers are doing right it's like make media loves to make fun of it guess what that's what everybody's going to be doing um you know what are some other things that are like that i think you know some of them are meditation by the way was like that too uh people made fun of it and then you know boom it's like the new yoga uh the other ones i think that that are happening are like stem cell or any like blood platelet spinning stuff where it's like oh you have knee pain well these guys they like go to puerto rico and like go to germany and like get this blood spinning treatment and go get stem cells injected in their knees that and uh now they feel good and gene editing i think is gene editing is one another one uh breath work i think breath work is where meditation was i invest in this thing called other ships they just actually launched their app i use it every single day and um like i use it religiously because it makes you feel so good and to to the average person like i do it outside now after huberman was like get get sunlight on your eyes first thing in the morning so i do it outdoors um and i'm sitting in my driveway basically doing it and neighbors are walking by they're walking their dog but they feel as a very normal behavior go for a morning walk and they see me like doing fucking breathing techniques on my driveway and they think i'm a nut uh and i love it i go louder as soon as somebody walks by because i want them to know they live next to somebody from the future dude there's this guy his name was bill uh well let's start with there's this guy named arthur leonard he's uh he's dead now but in the 60s and 70s he was a new zealand track and field coach and he had runners like paul walker uh or not paul walker uh that's john walker uh peter furious yeah yeah peter snell and all these like new zealand guys who started winning the olympics in the 1500 meters 5k and 10k and everyone's like dude what are you doing with your runners and he goes we run like 120 miles a week we do long distance running and we go slow and we just do it just a shitload of it and this one coach from oregon got really interested and uh his name was bill bowerman and he goes well i'm the track and field coach at oregon university i have all these great runners what are you doing and he goes over to in the 1970s in new zealand and he learns from arthur leonard and he comes back and he starts making it popular and two things happen university oregon gets really good at track and field and he ends up um making shoes for his runners so they can run a little bit faster and he calls it nike he calls that company nike he starts it with a with another runner phil knight and the other thing that happens and this just it worked out perfectly is he starts talking about it to all of his friends he even writes a book about it and i believe it's called like the joy of jogging and the idea of jogging it wasn't even like a thing in the 70s people like what do you mean you're just gonna run like art is it from what yeah like aren't the police gonna go after you and and like it like it was like astounding like prior to 1970s right so there was a it was a jogging craze of the 70s prior to that people didn't go out and run that just like wasn't like a thing and so anyway that's like another example where like running became popular and bowerman created nike to kind of capitalize on it right uh let's wrap up with this last thing here what is this i always enjoy your wisdom wisdom as shit put yourself out there announce what you're trying to do and how you're trying to do it so this actually came from the facebook uh the zuckerberg interview with gary v so gary v goes you change your name to meta you change the name company's name to met us like you know like what's that about you kind of wanted to like announce this to what's the kind of like the thinking behind that because i i think i get it but you know explain it and zuck basically said this thing he goes um he goes you know i think this is really important and he goes you know how it is when you run a company because you have you know hundreds of employees thousands of places we have thousands tens of thousands of employees it's really hard to get the message out inside your own company one of the best ways to get your company to realize you're serious about something is to go talk about it externally so that's the first thing he said and i thought that was so true when whenever a statement gets made publicly inside the company they also read that article they read that press and say i guess we are committed to this i guess we are i guess that is a top level priority and they start to take it seriously so all of a sudden the product managers start adding features for that thing or the top talent will switch to that division because they know that that's an area for growth for the company so it works internally then he goes the other thing is he's like you know we um we wanted to put a message out there to the world like he goes i think it's really powerful he goes we wanted to say what we were doing so that people who want that to exist will come work for facebook and gary goes yeah it's like a recruiting thing right he goes he goes yeah he goes it's kind of amazing you know if you just say what you're trying to do and how you go about doing it um that like it repels he goes you'll get a lot of hate and he's like we always get hate anytime we announce anything we get hate um he's like so that's going to come anyways and he's like when you say what you're trying to do what you're trying to build uh you know what you're trying to do with your life and basically how you're trying to go about it you will repel the people who find that off-putting and you will attract the people who want it and he said it so simply this is not a oh i've never thought of that or wow that's such a new concept it's not that but it reminded me of like a lot of good things that have happened in my life that simply came from saying what the hell i'm trying to do why i'm doing it why i'm so excited about doing it and how i'm planning to go about it here's what i plan to do because the other thing facebook announced was we're investing 10 billion dollars into you know the metaverse uh this year like into our ar and vr projects and 10 billion is like a huge number and so that that basically says we're changing the name and we're investing 10 billion dollars that means this is our future this is the bet and um and so that will attract talent now i just thought that's such a powerful concept for anybody it doesn't even really matter what the what the stakes are like i've done this when i try to hire interns most people when they try to hire interns they spend all their time you know they'll they'll write a blog they'll write a job post and then they'll like you know hope and pray the right person comes by and the better way to do it is you write a job post that would attract the you think about who the ideal person for this is and you say what would make them stop what they're doing and be like holy i gotta check this out i gotta go reach out i gotta talk to them and so now you're not going to write a normal job description that says the role the responsibilities the requirements minimum you you you also need to know who you don't want to work there exactly and it'll work out so like i put a thing up on twitter once i remember i think i've talked about this before on here i put up yeah people shit on you people shit on me uh they appreciate me for everything i do this one this one it was i kind of like almost hand wrote it and made it look handwritten and i said hiring an intern i said you're going to get three years of experience in the next 12 months um i don't drink coffee so you'll never have to go fetch me some um you're not going to know what to do i'm going to throw you in the deep end but don't worry don't don't worry i won't let you drown and i said uh you're going to work on this this and this for me because i'm trying to do x i might start what the startup was at the time is i'm trying to build x and i want somebody who can come in and do things like a b and c and who knows what else um and i basically was like you know whatever and there's a ps at the end and this got like hundreds of applicants to come in why just because i didn't write a normal job description secondly because i said it i said what the hell i'm trying to do and it attracted the type of people who who want to do something like that with their life you know they they found they found an overlap between their interests it sounds again so simple but if you kind of check yourself you say have i done that when's the last time i put a stake in the ground i put a flag in the ground and said here's like i'm sampar here's what i'm doing so that you would attract like-minded people i think you kind of did it with the fitness influencer thing to be honest you go i'm gonna do it i'm gonna get away from this business stuff and i'm gonna focus on being i'm gonna become a fitness influencer i'm half joking but i'm also half serious and um and then you started posting the content every day and you started like doing it in public on facebook you post on twitter you post it and i'm sure some people make funnier some people leave kind of comments that are like slight jabs or whatever um but like you put it out there and i'm betting your dms are full of people who are now yeah sending you cool equipment ideas yeah flying out to meet you like that's just what happens when you do that and it's not what i told people that someone was like you want to make money off this i was like no but like i would love like a professional athlete to think that this is kind of cool and be like oh i don't know you like fitness you want to come over right uh or you know like a chieberman like he didn't find us this way but he's like oh you're into like you know the body and things like that that's neat i want to learn a little bit about the media business can i uh learn it from you um have you read the book 48 laws of power i haven't read it now but i've heard some of them and i find it weird uh like the summary that basically the guy goes on tick tock i don't know how he's in my algorithm but the author robert green he does like one individual power at a time on tick tock and it always comes up but it'll always be something so generic that i don't know how to like it's like very weird he'll be like laws of power like um don't you don't want other people to like you or something like that it's like something like that and i'm like okay i don't know what this dude his books books so hyped his books are like so in-depth i believe that like in some prisons in some state prisons throughout the country and some states have banned the book it's it's it's incredibly interesting powerful it's no for real it is it's crazy it's a crazy book and law number 25 i used to memorize the laws when i read it law number 25 and i just had to google it now i don't remember it that well law number 25 is to always uh or consistently recreate yourself and he says be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you and incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life and with this facebook thing as well as a lot of other things they get made fun of for doing that but these huge gestures oftentimes work out well like i did here's this little example of it i had a twitter bio for the last few months i just changed it but i thought it was good 10 million rev or something i basically said every twitter bio i ever saw was like the past and i thought okay i see the value in that like it's good for somebody to land and know what you're doing but i thought what's more interesting is like what are you trying to do now i said how could i plant my flag just in the the top of my profile and it was very controversial i think a lot of people felt i i don't know they don't tell me but i'm i'm assuming there are not there are a bunch of people out there who probably read it and was like this is kind of cringy or like why is he saying this is weird and there's some people that would do it what was it cringy all you did was said i want to make a hundred or no the business will do 10 million in revenue this year i said three things i said four things i said i'm trying to be in a great mood daily yeah i'm going to get into phenomenal shape for the first time in my life i'm going to make 10 million dollars by december and i'm going to um i remember my last one was uh something else but those are the three there's something about fitness maybe the second one was fitness getting phenomenal shape for the first time that and uh something else maybe it was like i don't know blah blah family something to make me sound good after i said i want 10 million bucks by december okay so i put that out there and i got i would say five really important messages from there of like really great connections that came out of it from people just being like yo like respect i respect you for putting that there uh i might be able to help you with the fitness thing or i might be able to help you with i see you have the mood thing what are you doing for that i want to learn i'm like great i would love to teach it um or 10 million bucks how you plan to do it how far along are you come on i get an email from one guy he keeps saying how far long are you you're getting close your thing is inspiring me my i set my goal to my goal is not 10 million my goal is 100 000 but i want to make 100 000 and and so like it attracts like-minded people um and i and i i don't even think that that was that good of one version of this i think the the law 25 you just said is super important to like continuously reinvent and craft it and like play with it um don't get stuck in like whatever you used to say three years ago or even three months ago necessarily if it's no longer the the most badass exciting fun version of you and what you're trying to do do you um and what does it say now you want to build a hundred million dollar brand or something yeah i said i'm building a hundred million dollar brand and uh and i put that i'm investing in company badass companies like xyz what are the odds that um what so you're building a business right now which we purposely don't talk about it but you're building a business right now that's in a totally separate field than you are in now if if you you being like media uh media sean different than anything i've done before also yeah yes and many people including me well i haven't done this but this is something i would have i would do would say well what the hell just focus on like the main thing yeah um but do you think it's gonna work out like it seems like it might work out right yeah i think it's gonna work out um i'm pretty like i think it's gonna work out i the reason why i mean i started with my wife so like i wanted to start a business with her i think we had the idea together i thought that would be fun i never did it normally i would go work all day be super like you know excited and stimulated by like all the there she's not into tech she's not into like the stuff i'm into so i'd come home and you know she'd say how's your day and i'd be like ah it's great like yeah it's hard to much further in depth than that right so this was a cool thing we could do together while we uh you know like had our first two kids and i got two little kids now so that's why i went into this very different thing and also as a challenge and also we have a couple friends that also do e-commerce and we're doing really well with it so i thought okay i can learn from them and and kind of we can bounce off each other bounce ideas off each other would you sell it next year for like 20 or 30 million dollars no i think it can get to i think it gets 100 and like i think we should just go all the way that's pretty awesome and you're enjoying it still it's not exhausting oh it's a pain in the ass tons of times but like you know overall yeah like somebody like our buddy uh sully who um who i talked to and kind of like look up to his business mentor he was like he really wanted to advise and help me with it and i was like okay um why do you want to do this like you know your time on this is not gonna not gonna pay off like you know you have if you just spent that same hour in your other business or in one of these other 10 things it's just honestly it's more valuable for you and as your friend like i don't want you to make a decision today that is actually a bad decision he goes uh like don't worry about that like he goes i'm basically you know like i was like you could just be having free time he goes uh yeah i don't this is my free time he's like i i'm only happy when i'm in a prison of my own making i thought it was a badass way of saying it he's like you know i don't want to do nothing i like doing hard things challenging things as long as i get to choose what the hard and challenging thing is if it's something i don't want to do and it's even remotely harder challenging i'm like a whiny baby but when it's really hard but i chose it i i picked this poison then uh i have so much fun like i just wake up every day energized and i was like wow that's a great way to to know yourself well um we can wrap up there i think what did you uh where's ben ben what do you think i think we covered a lot of interesting things i like the the philosophical wisdom yeah the end was really great it got my wheels turning about like what i can build kind of in public how i can put myself out there more i love that part i think building in public is overrated by the way i'm gonna do it with this ketchup thing but i think it's overrated you know it's better than building in public just doing cool not talking about it and being private yeah that's fair um i'm actually i'm doing both right now i have one thing that's in private and a bunch of stuff that's in public and i actually like them both um ben what if i say what if you were going to put yourself out there what are you trying to do how would you put your plant your flag so that you can like a magnet attract like-minded people to you what's your what's your version of i'm ben and here's what i'm trying to do right now well so i mean obviously a lot of people know about my podcast already how to take over the world and uh i'm trying to make it a a top 100 podcast in the world across any category so we're trending in the right direction but uh i haven't really put that out in in public yet and uh i guess now it is so there we go sam asked an important question every every goal or dream should have a time associated with it yeah you always have to have it you know so what would be otherwise you know it's a it's a endless wish so what would be what do you want um how much time is left in 2021 uh we got six weeks yeah uh let's say in six weeks let's say let's uh i got a little more than a month all right everybody go subscribe if you listen to this go subscribe to the how to take over the world pocket it's honestly an amazing podcast that's why we've run some episodes on this feed before uh all right we'll get you closer um and i think you know like if you just said all right um i think one of the reasons people struggle with this question is they feel the pressure like oh this is my purpose in life or my mission in life i better get it right and actually you want to do the exact opposite you want to treat it like a kid when you say what do you want to be when they grow up and they say i'm going to be a dinosaur i want to be a firefighter i want to be a pizza man i want to be a pizza and it's like okay the best way to get to this statement is actually to put zero pressure on it and say it out loud and then say it out loud again say a different thing out loud say like play with the ideas until something sticks with you and hits with you and then you say okay and then how do i juice that if that's the dream on level seven what would it be on level 10 what would it be if i turned the knob all the way broke the knob off the volume thing and it's now at like volume 12 accidentally what would that be of this of this podcast like what would it be right now if you cranked it up by the way i feel like we both put ourselves out there of like putting a number to it meanwhile sam is like i'm just gonna be a fitness influencer but like where where's where's your number in timeline sam we're not no i have one it's to be weigh 185 pounds by january 15th come on okay okay my bad my bad i have it written down on this piece of paper that's not that's not an influencer that's not an influencer goal that's just the fitness goal well that is because where are you at now so you're at 196. so you started at 210.

sam's basically saying in the next two months i want to lose 11 i want to lose 11 pounds but i'm more i'm you know he's already like you know somewhat in shape so you know i don't know if it's i don't know if you have like a body fat thing or whatever so now what will that attract it'll attract other people who also want to lose weight or have just done it right those are the two people that are going to reach out to sam hey me too or i just did it you can do it too here's what i here's what worked for me and so like that's the power of doing this and of saying it out loud is convincing yourself and bet don't come at the master when it comes to goal setting okay i'm the self man i'm i'm the man i'm a manifest cowboy baby i get it done i just want to know when you're going to have a hundred thousand instagram followers sam that's all i want to know bro the manifest cowboy is hilarious my buddy uh has the best nicknames i just discovered he because he he showed up uh for this thing and i was like dude you showed up like i thought you'd be late and i thought like you know you might skip it today because you didn't have to do it and uh his our other friend was there he goes that's why they call him mr show up and i thought he was joking and then literally someone called him mr i was like is that your actual nickname mr show up and he's like yeah he's like that was the thing he's like he's like anytime somebody needed like whatever it was a ride to the airport oh you know like you need to ride home for the airport i'll be there just give me 15 minutes i'll show up and like you'd give him a throwaway invitation to a party you'd be like hey i'm going to this thing um but uh you know you won't know anybody there and it's two hours away and like it might not be fun he's like cool i'll go and they're like you showed up to the party like you don't know anyone here i can't believe you showed up and that became his reputation mr who is this guy is this guy dom that i work with i love this guy and he's like i thought that nickname mr show up like i wish that was my nickname because i can tell you one thing mr show up is going to win in life because 80 of life is just showing up and uh and if you're mr show up you're you're acing that part of life that's hilarious um i think it's gonna be a good app i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back
