opened up a world where my life is more rich not rich even monetarily just like rich like fulfilling because of all these really cool people i've gotten to connect with i think what's interesting is like how do you become a part i think what's more interesting about the facebook games besides whatever people spam or not spam is like how do you be around the tidal waves so i think where i've been very fortunate and lucky is that in my career either i'm an ambulance chaser or i'm like a visionary or maybe a little bit of both where like i was in the facebook game world i was in personal finance world i was in social networking world i was in sas world with sumo i was in e-commerce world with you know some of a shopify and lately i'm back in content world and i think what's been the beautiful part about that you know in app sumo i've been in the software world which has been amazing i think the amazing part about that is that it's opened up a world where my life is more rich not rich even monetarily just like rich like fulfilling because of all these really cool people i've gotten to connect with like i got to meet this guy nick nimmin and i'm going to talk with him on friday about videos and then i've got to meet um this guy javier mercedes who lives in austin who came over and showed me how lighting like okay look let's switch lighting here let's switch lighting here and i think what's amazing is try to figure out which category is going to either be big or which category you're interested in and then how to interject yourself in that conversation so you're like well no i'm not a developer i don't have any e-commerce products to start guess what start a fucking youtube channel reviewing those products or start an instagram account where each day you just post hey here's my favorite e-commerce product today here's why or start a newsletter on sunfox.com like hey here's my weekly e-commerce product of the week and email that company saying hey i just promoted you this week one of the easiest things that anyone especially early on can do is flatter people legitimately don't just bullshit because it's obvious but just flatter hey i love your stuff that's an easy way to open the door and then do what you can to start helping people and so i i think with i've been lucky and intentional about what am i curious about and what's becoming more popular and how can i connect with people that are inspiring me i would also say like sam i wouldn't call those that that facebook game era because uh there's a whole bunch of other friends that we have that started or like kind of caught their first big wave on when facebook platform opened up like the very first episode of this podcast sully that's how he caught his big wave was he made a facebook app called superlatives and it was about you know saying which of your friends is most likely to end up in jail or you know stuff goofy stuff like that or you know uh i know some of the lolaps guys listen to this and they were yeah they were you know the fastest growing company in the world at the time probably like you know oh my god you know you'd launch a product and get to 10 million users in a day and that just breaks your mental model of the world and so i think two things a you're right that the people who go there were the type of people that sniffed out interesting spaces before they're proven out so if you're that type of person you're going to end up in a lot of those types of situations the second is you get this crash course on hypergrowth and marketing in a way that's like you can't learn like this guy who um the guy who sold tbh to facebook recently um oh yeah yeah yeah he tweeted this thing out yesterday that was like it was good first time social app founder is like oh we're going to build a platform for intellectual conversations it's like you know i get 23 users and five percent retention and then he's like by the fifth year that same founder's like all right let's just have people vote on who's hot and it's like result 10 million users 40 retention it's like you know um it's very true it's like uh the only way to really ever get good is by putting yourself out there so when you're saying go start a youtube channel or somebody goes and has to build a facebook app and you see that the apps that grow are the ones that tap into people's core needs like they want to know about their friends they want to take quizzes about themselves and learn you know goofy personality quizzes and it's the person on the sidelines who's like oh all that stuff's dumb and what they're missing is that they don't sort of figure out you know at the end of the day you get rewarded for giving people what they want not what you want people to want and then the second thing is that if you really want to get good at anything you got to be in like the eye of the storm and these new platforms or these areas where there's a lot of growth a lot of action happening that's where you sharpen your skills so you know you might not have ever made money off the facebook games right like you got a bunch of users and i made i made money well you might have made money i think the question is if you i think you need to pick are you trying to make money you're trying to learn because i think sometimes when you're young you're like well i want to make money off this person it's like well maybe there's a lot more long-term dividends by just trying to focus on what you can learn but but also wouldn't you say like i've seen this in my life sounds like you were in the same where it's when you're trying to make money that you end up learning because you're trying to do something hard and you have you learn the hard way like what actually works and what doesn't versus if you just say i want to learn a lot of times people take a very sort of passive or intellectual approach to it now that's different than saying i want to make money so i take this job at intel that pays me a guaranteed six figures or whatever it is you may not learn the most doing that path because you're not actually challenging yourself uh in the same way but i think the two things i would highlight there is that i think there's passion or interest or curiosity and then i think there's opportunity and i think i've i've chased opportunities to make money which have been fleeting they've been profitable but fleeting and i think when you're in your 20s you should do those frankly you should just do the things that are like hot and exciting if you think you want to make money and then in your 30s you start reflecting more like wow mortality is real what's really important and i think you'll come back to finding how do i work on problems and things that i want created for in my own world and for you that's what that's helping people sort of overcome their fears to start businesses is that the one step removed from that no it's exactly that it's like i want to be on the ground level helping people overcome fears start businesses and marketing in businesses i i love seeing the underdog succeed i love seeing like this guy ali abdahl is a popular youtuber or i love seeing companies like meat fox who got promoted on app sumo and now they have a business around it uh or a phone wagon is a popular one today for doing phone calls and that guy ali he's great he's uh i think he listens to this podcast but he's a doctor right he's a doctor youtuber or is that yeah dude he's so i mean he's so impressive he's like you know people like i don't have enough time this guy's a full-time professional doctor making three high quality youtube videos every week and he engages as an audience and he's put you know he's just very genuine i really enjoy can you spell his name a-l-i-a-b-d-a-a-l you know and i think it's interesting is that you have to think about on the reverse of that how do you become someone that people want to meet how do you make things or do things that others want to connect with and i think we're like oh i'll just do stuff and hope hope it happens this guy looks amazing i just love the like i just did a quick google uh dude's dope dude is just dope i love this guy he's just like i found him because he blogged like hey here's some cool shit i found this week and our podcast was in it and so i was like okay who's this guy who's giving us a shout and then i checked out his youtube channel and i was like wait this guy's amazing well i think that's something that even in my newsletter every week now we have a section where we promote other people i think the more that you can go and this is one of those things that's like stupid obvious but no one does it it's like go help a bunch of other people and there's a good chance that you'll be able to connect and and get a lot of things you want like i heard a quote yesterday and i got to go in four minutes guys the quote that i heard yesterday that was like really powerful to me it was um it was like your rewards in life will be exact proportion to your contribution that's interesting i don't know if it's true though because i feel like i you can definitely make money by like some bullshit facebook like uh uh fleeting app you know what i mean but i definitely think it's the way to live by
