extreme force of will extreme bias for action and a questioning of the the default speeds it changes everything yeah you know i'm on this uh business entertainment kick where i'm looking for content that is about business but is made to be entertaining um so it's not just like a an informational video or blog post and so there's a new show called fighting that i watched uh that i thought was really good did you see it i saw the commercials for it how do you get it it's on roku but i don't have roku you just google like watch fighting and it's roku just lets you just it's on their website but you don't have to sign up you don't do anything you just click and just watch it so uh it's very cool i mean they basically follow around dana you know behind the scenes and the ufc like kind of the machine behind the show and the ufc just to put this in perspective they basically there is no off season the ufc is 52 weeks a year every saturday has to be an epic show it's a live event with pay-per-view it's got fighters who get injured and pull out or get arrested and now they can't fight and there's all kinds of things that can and will go wrong but it's like the actual epitome of the show must go on so i wanted to share with you a couple of my thoughts watching this from a founder's point of view so the first thing is as silly as this sounds i do think that dana white is on my mount rushmore of startup founders and i know he didn't technically found the ufc but he basically did he created the goddamn thing he's a madman he is a workhorse he's a machine and i really don't think the ufc happens if there's no dana white and this got me thinking there are some companies that i will call inevitable an inevitable company is one whose time has just come so you know youtube today is a giant company but youtube's time had come like if wasn't youtube if chad and steve had not created youtube somebody else would have created the equivalent of youtube like the idea of putting hosting video online was gonna happen it was happening somebody was gonna win that space that's an inevitable idea the momentum of internet speeds going up and being fast enough where you can now upload and download videos was was was going to a point where video became it was an obvious thing we had flicker for photos we were going to have the version of that for videos i would say that google was an inevitable idea the more popular the internet got people already needed search engines and portals google happened to be the winner of all the search engine portals but there was going to be a way to search the internet that was going to happen so there's inevitable companies and then there's companies that i honestly don't think if it was not for the force of will of the founder for the vision the skill and the determination of the founder that wouldn't would not have happened or would not have happened for like 50 more years it would have missed a whole generation of people had that person not made that thing happen my examples that i would put here are elon's company so i think tesla and spacex would not have happened um and would not have happened at least for another 50 years had he not made those happen i think it required an a level of insanity self-funding um technical brilliance uh determination to keep going even against the odds of failure all of that for him to be able to pull those off um i think the ufc is in that that non-inevitable bucket where if the ufc had just died it was about to go bankrupt before he before dana bought it for two million dollars i don't think that something like the ufc necessarily would have happened yeah i mean i totally agree because it wasn't like a wanted thing we did it was one of those products where we didn't know we wanted and at first it was a freak show like i don't know if you remember one of the more famous guys who's first started fighting was this black guy who would use one boxing glove and one free hand and he fought against like a 300 pound it looks like a creative character in a video game all of the people look like creative characters yeah there's one hawaiian guy who is like a sumo wrestler looking guy and he fought the dude with the one boxing arm uh it's weird and it was a freak show at first but then it took like 10 years and then athletes started doing it and it became it was condemned like john mccain famously i think in congress or senate or whatever asked for every state to outlaw the ufc he called it human cockfighting and he was like this is terrible we need to end this and john mccain the american hero the war with the war hero was now saying this is this is disgusting basically and so dana had to find venues that would support him which is why by the way dana and trump are so close now is because trump would allow dana to host fights at his trump properties in um atlantic city and so that's why you know dana had to fight and scrap state by state city by city event by event almost going out of business many times they went 40 million dollars in the hole before turning this thing around turning it into a 10 billion dollar company data's got this uh great story it was like during the cockfighting like when people started saying that stuff and he was like well what do you think these athletes think and people were like they're you know maybe they're miserable they got to go through all this pain and he goes let me tell you what they think they're killers and they want to go out and like do something that is active they need to get this energy out and they live their life like they're on head like they're in heaven and they look at your life you just go to work at nine you come home at five you sit in a cubicle as hell these guys are free this is what they were born to do and what they feel like they need to do so if you take this away from them you're hurting them way more than when they get in the rig and i thought that was actually a pretty good uh spin on it so one of the cool things about this show is it showed a couple things i'll give you the big takeaway and then some of the small takeaways so here's the big takeaway i said the word force of will and i use that word that phrase very specifically because i think it describes a certain trait of a founder and i try to have this i think the best founders all have this and by the way this comes with some trade-offs when you have force of will it is as brute forcey as it sounds it is uncomfortable to be around sometimes you are pushing people maybe you're holding a higher standard maybe you're demanding that things are done a certain way or done at a certain speed that does not feel good to the other people that are in the organization that may be used to working in other environments where they don't have that and so there's a little story so basically it's like the one of the big fights of the year is coming up in 18 days and they've done everything they've prepped all the marketing they've got the billboard they show them painting the billboards at night they show them making all the marketing videos they show them doing all the different things they go into promoting a live show they're selling tickets all of this which fight this was a i don't remember which one there was either the one where john jones had to pull out or there was the one where um charles olivera pulled out okay and so 18 days before he gets a call fighter got hurt in his last round of his last sparring session he was sparring without headgear i think it's olivera this is all this is recent yeah he gets a cut on his on his eye and he can't fight so now the main event that they've sold all the tickets for that they've done all the promotion for that's been building up for six months months the main event falls through and he's like and it's basically him and his guy hunter campbell and they're sitting in this room and this is this is business as usual disasters are business as usual for him and he talks about this he goes give me all the stress i eat that up he goes i can take i can take it all i and you can just see he's built up this resilience this tolerance like imagine the ufc which is a live events fighting business it's stadiums full of people when covet happened that kills the business there was no other business and dana not only was a sport that survived covet where it got shut down and you couldn't do live events for over a year you can't just turn off a business for a year and hope it's all gonna be okay instead he was the first sport back he created something called fight island he created a bubble where he's like cool we'll test everybody then they get here and now everybody here is tested nobody comes in or out and he found an island in the middle east that they could do this on and he branded it as fight island they were the first sport back it was incredible so he was used to this so he's talking and he's like what if we did this fight what if we did this fight and the guys in the room are like yeah we could call them um you know i put out a call he's gonna call me back whatever and somebody walks by they go his manager's in the lunchroom right now they're here and dana within 0.1 seconds just hops out of his chair nobody else does dana hops out of his chair leaves the meeting you see him and the camera's following him he goes to the cafeteria he's not even at the table yet and he starts saying he's like uzman versus whoever uzman versus versus i forgot who he's gonna fight at the time but um uzman versus gaichi versus gaichi let's pretend it was gaichi and the manager's like eating a salad he's like what and he's like uzman versus gaichi we gotta do it and he's like no man i don't wanna do this he's like he's like what are you kidding me this is a huge opportunity for him if he fights this guy or he's comes out he's like who's one versus hamza you gotta do it and the guy's like um he's like no no he's not ready blah blah blah not ready who do you want to fight he says this other guy he goes what does that do for you and he immediately he basically in like four seconds cuts the deal with him and and khabib was there and khabib was like no i think dana's right i think this is what he should do it's gonna be huge for his career and so they cut the deal and um and the agent who's an he's like a super agent he's like the you know like uh he's an agent for all these fighters you would think an agent's like r emmanuel he says in the thing he goes this is why i don't talk to dana anymore he's too intimidating for me uh like he's too too like forceful for me about what what he wants to do and so i saw that and i noticed and i said most people will watch that scene and they'll they won't even pay attention to what just happened which is that the greatest founders in the world the greatest ceos in the world they cut through the all right look the question that sean and i get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our lives constantly on this podcast and we give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of frameworks and throughout all the podcasts well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show there's a another video i saw recently of uh what's who's the guy walter isaacson who did the bio of elon musk with elon and he's on someone's podcast i think i think he's on steve's podcast and he's telling the story and he says elon is talking to the twitter team and he's like hey cut costs we need to shut down the sacramento um server farm and his engineers like okay i'm gonna be tricky because those servers are used for all of our infrastructure but we could do it we'll make a plan and we'll be able to do that in six months six months what are you talking about we need to do this faster it's gonna take six months elon that infrastructure is critical it's so interwoven into everything that we do we're gonna experience big big issues we'll we'll make a plan and we'll get it done i promise you we'll get it done in six months i need this done in six weeks six weeks we can't do this in six weeks we would have to do a b c it could be done in six days let's do it in six days now these guys are reeling and they're like elon it can't six it can't be done six weeks six days it can't be done that way so he he leaves the meeting and i think he was going to uh like texas or uh for christmas yeah it's christmas eve it's christmas eve he's flying to texas to go see his family and his his two cousins or anything are on the plane with him and they're brainstorming they're like god six months six weeks this is ridiculous and then um someone on the plane has the idea they're like why don't we just go to sacramento right now we'll just rip the servers out ourselves because one of the cousins one of the cousins i think worked at solar city or whatever and he was like you know we could we could use some servers we definitely need some servers and he's like all right sounds good and what's he do the idea was like if we just take the servers offline they're gonna have to figure out how to fix it and they'll fix it in faster than six weeks i promise you that and i think that was underlying it so elon on the plane on christmas day basically christmas eve you know they're flying to uh to texas midway through the flight just tells the pilot turn around we're gonna go land in sacramento pilots like okay and then he says hey do you have a pocket knife and the pilot's like yeah i do his bodyguard his bodyguard was like here i got one and like whips out this pocket knife and so they go to sacramento they take the knife they basically and the server the company that the farm basically they were like hey we're closed dude it's christmas eve and he's like let me in these are my servers uh open this door and now i don't need you to do anything just open this door i'm going in opens the door gets in takes down the servers i don't know the exact ending of the story but same thing extreme force of will extreme bias for action and a questioning of the the default speeds for everybody in the company and when you know that your default speed or your default clarity of thinking is going to be questioned it changes everything and so i've been on the other side of this when i was at twitch emmet was somebody who i've always said his oven burns a little hotter he's smarter than than the average bear and i felt that if you were in a room with emmet and you presented a plan that to nine out of ten people in the company it would sound okay they wouldn't challenge your assumptions emmet would always challenge the assumptions of why we're doing it how much it's going to cost why it has to take that long etc and if your logic was not bulletproof if you were not already maxed out in your thinking of what was possible you were going to eat in that meeting you are going to get shredded in front of like 18 people and not in a mean way but your logic is going to get shredded you are going to get verbally undressed and that changes things when you once that once you know that that's what's on the line you come in a little differently you sit a little straighter you walk a little faster you you know dot your dot your eyes and cross your t's when you go into those meetings and so he only had to do it once and then for the next 18 months i was ready every meeting with emmett and so i think that this is just a very valuable trait that they don't was emmett nice about it was he is emmett a courteous person emmett sort of has that like autistic forgiveness where you're like he's not being mean about it he's not being nice about it he's being very direct but you're like he's oh that's just how he is he's just being direct he's just like he's not trying to be he's not trying to be mean and i wouldn't even say mean is the right word he's just trying to get to the truth and he needs you to get out of the way so that the truth can appear he doesn't care about your feelings in the search for the truth and in fact the more you kind of try to get in the way of the truth the more he's like what are you doing get out of the way we're trying to find the truth here that's the way i would describe how it felt from my point of view and really like i was rarely on the receiving end of it but i saw it happen many a time and i took note very quickly of like okay you got to come correct here well because i don't like people who are like and i used to behave this way and i and i regret how i used to behave but of like being needlessly rude and i think that the people who are needlessly rude i think dana would fall in that category because he loves to fight he loves to battle so he just told this story last week he goes let me tell you something i'm going to war right now with caesar's palace and they're like why he goes for the last six months i've been playing like back baccarat or some like uh casino game with them he goes i'm up 17 million dollars on them right now he goes i wake up in the morning and i think how am i going to win this war today and he goes i'm going to lose eventually because they're going to win but right now i'm crushing them and each morning i wake up i go to work and instead of going home or he said he goes like uh when my when my kids are asleep i go back to the casino and i'm ready to go to war and i thrive off that he goes i want my back against the wall and i want to go to war so i gotta say this because i'm a anybody who's an actual gambling degenerate you listen to dana's gambling story and this is only going to apply to one percent of the audience so i apologize for the 99 who are like who cares about this i care a lot about this so his story has some holes on his gambling stuff here's i would like to list some of the holes that i'd like to come on to talk about he tells some of the holes like he tells us one time that he got too drunk and he lost he goes i think i lost sixty thousand dollars and i wake up in the morning and they're like hey man you owe us he goes yeah i'll get you the 60 he goes no no no no no it's six million yeah i'm not saying he doesn't admit that he loses i just in that interview he said i'm up 17 million on caesars this year year to date he says my rule is that if i make a million bucks i walk and if i lose i'm willing to lose up to six million oh my god then he says um i've only lost twice this year so it doesn't add up how do you if you win if you walk away when you win a million or you lose six million and you're up 17 million and you've only lost two days of the year and it's we're halfway through the year the math ain't math and on that one fourth thing he represents himself as a like skilled gambler who beats the house he's playing baccarat which is like a 50 50 push game and yeah blackjack where you're down for 49 51 there is no skilled like the biggest loser in the world is a professional blackjack player i'm just gonna say that again the biggest loser in the world is a professional blackjack player because you're professional at something that is stacked against you is a by definition losing game secondly you're probably really smart and could have done so many things with your life and you chose to play a game that is stacked against you as your professional career and third you're delusional because there's no such thing as a professional blackjack player that is why that is the biggest loser job in the world well he's but the fact that he like continues to do it i'm not saying dana is that by the way dana's job is running the umc well just a side tangent to any professional blackjack player out there that makes no sense he could be a degenerate and also and also a great business he could be a degenerate gambler and also probably is what jordan was and many others are so what else did you learn in that documentary or that the force of will bias to action speed cutting through the bs um i think is is tremendous and his other employees even said this like the head of pr was like she goes yeah work starts at uh work starts at 8 30. it's 6 30 right now i'm doing my workout but dana just texted me saying are you at the office yet i told him not yet but i'll be there soon and she was like you know dana's gonna do this press conference dana's the type where once he decides he's gonna do something he's like a rhino going to do it he's gonna bulldoze through and you're either with him on it and you're helping him do that or you should just get out of the way and you know i i just thought man another really hard job being the head of pr for the ufc is a very difficult job and that woman is with him everywhere uh i forget her name but uh londa or linda or something she's always with him and what you'll see what you'll notice is they do the press conferences after the fight in new york time it's like at 2 a.m and then you'll see a monday in france for another press conference right they work their asses off yeah 100 let me tell you all right so we talked about a company on here a bunch of times but i actually just met the the founder so i'm gonna do a little bit of a repeat but remember how we talked about 29 0 29 the ever sing thing it's the outdoor race where you kind of run up and down a hill as many times as it takes to run the equivalent of mount everest an awesome thing started by friend of the pod jesse itzler and uh and others yeah so it's uh i guess everest is 29 000 feet so hence 29 000 0 29 is the name of their uh brand we've talked about them a bunch but the guy coincidentally joined hampton recently so i was able to like i called them this morning and i was just talking through them because i've been so fascinated we talked about uh high rocks and we talked about a bunch of these underground um uh not underground but these like niche sporting events and i actually think they're better businesses than i previously thought so let me tell you about this one so so if you go to uh 29 0 29 i think it's called 29 29 everesting.com you can go to the website but check this out so they do seven events a year each event only has 300 people this year they sold out the entire year in four minutes for all of the events and he's purposely keeping this small so if you do that math that's 13 million dollars in ticket sales that he's done and he told me that basically they want to own all the accommodation and so basically it's turnkey you pay 6 500 you show up in some locations you can stay at like a fairmont hotel which is where they they partner with or they do like glamping and you go to like whistler and all these like really beautiful places and so you show up you do this event and the reason they keep it at 300 people is so you can meet everyone and so you can have this experience where you get to know all your people and so you keep coming back year after year but listen to this they started in 2017 when they started in 2017 jesse itzler was mark's partner on this which is like the whole idea of like an influencer partnering with you jesse only had 5 000 followers on instagram when they started he wasn't that big of a deal and yet in their first year of business they made 500 000 in revenue in 2018 their second year of business they did a million dollars in revenue by 2020 he said they were doing really great but covet happened the business got wiped out and so in 21 22 they had to start all over again but he says it's a great business he's like it's negative working capital people pay up front and i can use that money to go and pay for all the accommodations and pay for everything and he says it's a great business i was like well what's wrong about this business well he said the first thing that sucks is it's a fad meaning tough mutter um a bunch of other events like you look at some of these events like spartan race they get really popular really fast and the tough matter was doing 100 million in revenue now it filed for bankruptcy a couple years ago like you you have to figure out how to keep people coming back over and over and over again and i asked him i said how do you how do you do that like what are like the what are like the keys to make this work because this is kind of an interesting thing i i don't know if i would ever want to start one of these but maybe one day he said the first thing you need a story so you have to tell your friends what's something exciting that you're going to be doing and it can't be really like running a marathon because everyone kind of does that but it has to be a little bit more exciting you need a story you need to be going somewhere beautiful you need to be doing some ridiculous race the second thing it's got to be challenging do you know how many people who start a marathon finish uh 70 percent 99 99 of people who start a marathon end up finishing that particular race not so hard then it's not so hard in his opinion you need roughly a 70 or 75 chance he said for his events roughly 70 of people go through with it 30 fail the third thing you have to learn some type of skill like a new skill or acquire some type of new fitness in order to accomplish it and the last thing it needs to be in a beautiful place or it looks cool in photos so i was thinking about this let me give you three ideas for ridiculous fitness events that could work out you ready all right hit me all right the first one we're going to call it the burly beer mile you dress up like paul bunyan you go in the mountains on a track near a track you run one lap chug a beer run another lap chug a beer you do that four times four beers one mile what do you think about the beerly the burly beer mile look if you can give people any excuse to drink you already have 80 of a good business okay uh there's a reason that like top golf is really popular there's a reason that people go to baseball games still it's not because they're wondering what's going to happen in the top of the sixth it's because they want to eat hot dogs and drink beer outside like giving people an excuse to drink is a great business model if you just layer on top of that a contrast a juxtaposition oh it's fitness and beer love it i'm already in i don't know about the paul bunyan i think that's uh not sure that's on trend with the aesthetics that we're going for here but i think if we workshop this idea a little bit you could have something all right how about the paddle prison break a paddle boat race from alcatraz to the coast of san francisco the prison break oh i like this one my mind was still on the beer one for a second by the way i feel like just the beer mile or the beer the beer marathon it's a half marathon and you drink 13 beers i think has uh has legs um or maybe it's like maybe it's a it's a quarter marathon it's six beers and uh six miles or something like that dude i did it by the way i did a beer mile in college so you uh chug a beer to start run a lap whatever you for four beers four laps one mile i threw up and if you throw up you have to run a fifth lap it took me 15 minutes to do it it was horrible yeah but we call that the victory lap it's like oh i had to do a victory lap why because i threw up during it oh man you sound fun all right so let's do um prison break so prison break is we drop you off the side of alcatraz in a in a small boat a paddle boat we're going to call it a paddle boat we're going to call it the paddle prison break is there like a lane set up or we're just going to lose people into the ocean here what's going on we got some liability concerns we're not going to let details get in the way of a good idea here i think i think there is definitely something to the prison break uh out of alcatraz if you can do that there's a swim race that happens every year but i'll give you my last uh horrible fitness idea you ready we're going to call it for the prison break you have to start in cuffs great for the carto adds a story adds a challenge you're going to have to learn and have to help each other get out of the cuff so everybody's in cuffs you need somebody in this race who like can just get out of cuffs and then they'll get the little pick and they'll start picking other people out and then that's how you get out of this and you have to have a criminal record in order to get invited you must have to have at least uh a little gold patch on your on the shoulder if you actually have a felony or misdemeanor yeah we'll just call you out there and the last horrible idea we're going to call it the skyline scramble a race through nyc but you can't touch the ground you got to go from building to building up like a parkour challenge yeah baby the only person who survives wins no these are all horrible ideas but i did think it was incredibly interesting to hear this guy's business i didn't actually think that this company could be as good as it is but i'll be eager to see if this thing works i uh i do i think these types of experiential businesses i remember when i ran a conference it wasn't the same thing but like having a thing that you work towards and then all the people come to it was like it was a very fulfilling thing to do versus just being on the internet all the time it felt nice to meet your customers and things like that it was pretty awesome so you didn't give me the heads up about this but i'm down to workshop a few ideas live for you here if you'd like all right what do you got when you were thinking of these what what how did you put yourself in the mindset to even come up with these ideas what were you what got you going well they're not very good ideas so uh so whatever mindset i was in i would say avoid that all right we're gonna go with um maybe nostalgia so uh the boston rover it's it's red rover remember that game red rover it's but with just all the people in the city of boston as many people get on one team and we're playing red rover just a city-wide hide-and-go-seek a city-wide hide-and-go-seek exactly it's not really fitness at this point no children's games i've gone into it's they're all horrible ideas but i just thought that this segment is fascinating dude i think that uh one day i could see myself doing this yeah to make one of these yeah yeah yeah they seem awesome it's like the um you know how we talked about um like viral food it's like how do you make how do you make your restaurant go viral well you need like some type of food that's either oversized or extra small or is a different color or it's typically a side for example uh cookie dough make it the main yeah it's like cookie dough you make that the main thing or you mash up two things that don't go together or you mash up two things that yeah and i'm like what could you do for fitness and i thought it was interesting um same idea by the way the way speaking of beautiful settings and doing races in memorable places where should people be racing to right now i think they should race to wander.com mfm why should they do that well it's actually a pretty good deal here so if you go to wander right now wander is a place where you can go rent beautiful um luxury vacation uh experiences i'm booking one right now actually

got a bone to pick with wander which is the pictures are so good that i started booking vacations to places i don't even want to go i just like normally you're like i pick a city and then let me find a place to stay here i went and i was like dude this house is sick i guess i'm going to naples like where am i going i don't know like i'm going to florida now i wasn't even trying to go to florida and so well they're setting they're setting expectations so high so for example have you ever seen um have you ever seen like people who take pictures of the pyramids and then they zoom out and there's like hot dog vendors and there's like you know what i mean instagram versus reality type of thing like these photos are so freaking good if they zoom out is there going to be like a trailer right next to the home like how are these so no dude i've had people who use these for like corporate off sites because like some of these places are pretty baller so they use it to like do a there's like one in sonoma i know my friends did for a corporate off site and they were like no it was sick it was amazing um there might there has to be i mean these photos look so good that there has to be some version of like shoot for the stars and you still land on the moon type of thing but uh yeah if it's anywhere near as good as it looks i'm uh i'm very excited you have on this document the difference between running a business for growth versus ebitda versus cash flow i'm interested you got my attention yeah this is a ceo school uh tactical session when you were running the hustle did you obviously all of these things are good you want growth you want ebitda you want cash flow the problem is when you want three things equally you usually get none um so they're generally in any business at any point in time tends to be some some order of priority uh when you were at the hustle did you which of these did you focus on and was there ever a shift in oh now we're focusing on this instead of this i didn't run the business long enough you know we sold like four and a half years in to make the shift but it was for the longest time it was revenue was the number one priority followed by cash flow followed by profit and so what i wanted to do was double revenue every year so i think we went from like 500 000 in revenue to 2.2 to like 5 to 12 or something like that and we didn't make a lot of profit along the way i think the year we sold we did maybe a million in profit but our cash flow was high so i was able to add like two million dollars to our bank account and explain to somebody who's like wait how do you have a million dollars of profit two million of cash flow how does that work in a business like the hustle so i'll give you guys a really easy example so we had this thing called trends it was 300 a year but for the sake of this conversation let's just say it was 1200 a year and uh if a customer paid up front let's say they paid me on june 1st 1200 for an annual subscription my cash flow was 1200 that's how much my business accepted into our bank account but the way that gap accounting generally accepted uh principles of accounting the way that works is that 1200 was really only a hundred dollars in june a hundred dollars in july and a hundred dollars each month and so my revenue was only a hundred dollars per month that they stayed with me even though i collected 1200 thus my profit let's just say that it cost me uh 75 to produce the content my profit was a hundred dollars minus 75 dollars uh so 25 bucks exactly and so i'm in the situation right now i have a business that my e-com business where we've been running it for maybe four years now and it's doing really well it's been i was only growth focused so i was like you i wanted to double or more every year and so we did which the reason being is typically not always typically it's harder to grow revenue but it's easier to once revenue is grown to become profitable exactly i think it's the right order of operations actually there there's one pre-step even before growth which is just product market fit meaning have i made something that people want do i feel like uh if i produce this that there's a market pull for this so once we you know it's a verify product market fit great now it was grow i think in year one we did six or seven million i think in year two we basically got to 12 something year three was bigger than that now year four is bigger than that so we've basically been you know uh growing by somewhere between 50 and 100 every year four years but i have pulled out exactly zero dollars from this business i have put in my pocket zero dollars from this business in four years wait really yeah i've taken nothing out of the business i've reinvested everything but it's not a oh i could have took a ton of money out of this business it's like well like for example one year we basically had no profit we did you know eight figures of revenue and we were break even essentially and i was like what are we doing here how did this happen so like the bank did but did the bank account ever go up like was your was your cash position ever good well in econ you have one other variable which is inventory and so the cash has been pretty steady but the inventory assets are going up but they're also inventory that might take a while to move it might be slow it might be whatever and so you don't i don't want my cash tied up in inventory that is not actually the plan that's a it's a byproduct unless you can pay your employees and bills and inventory it sucks yeah exactly so i've been going through this process where i shifted from where i first was in growth and then i shifted to ebitda and so um that required a certain set of skills so i'll share with you some of the lessons learned shifting to ebitda first so we and we've successfully shifted to ebitda and so we even being uh earnings before interest tax uh amortization uh amortization and uh depreciation exactly um okay so what what did i do to make that shift the first thing was uh and the reason i'm saying this is because there's probably people out there who are running a business that's been high growth low low cash flow or high growth low profit and um for some businesses that's the right move you want to stay in that mode for a very long time maybe it's a winner take all market maybe it's a land grab situation maybe you're venture backed and it's a billion dollar a bust this is not that this is a business i own that i you know if we sell this business it might be you know a hundred million dollars or less is is like where this will thing will land but that's great we own the business we have no outside um you know investors and so it's no big deal so anyways the point of this uh point of this rant is basically how do you make that shift so i first went and talked to people who so step one figure out what the right ebitda target is so i go talk to people who are in the same space to figure out what ebitda margin is kind of the low end of what's possible to the high end of what's possible and then i ended up shooting for somewhere like you know the 60 mark like 10 to 25 percent yeah so for me that's like 17 uh margin so the best ones were like yeah we have 25 like the econ ones but then you dig under the hood it's like oh you don't do any marketing like somehow well i do so that's just not going to happen um but getting to 17 18 is like wow that would be really great and then the low end is like 10 so that's the first thing then envelope uh create like a ebit of what i call it ebit of budget so basically you take for every hundred dollars of revenue that comes in what percentage is going to go to each of the following categories my overheads my cost of goods sold my opex my advertising and marketing etc and so you create an ebit of budget and you basically say what where does the dollars flow today so you do a last 12 months look back say we're on average every month we're spending five percent of revenue on overhead and you know 12 on uh in the e-com case maybe it's shipping fulfillment whatever so you create a current status budget and then you say well in order to get my margin i need to find you know eight points of extra profit margin somewhere so where's it going to come from and so you start to basically pull calories from from these different departments all right marketing you're gonna have to give me two points here and shipping you're gonna have to find a way to cut off one point and you basically find the extra eight points of margin that you're going to need and that stuff is uh it's it's not hard to do it in a spreadsheet it's really hard to track it on a weekly and monthly basis to make sure that it's really hard so once i did that now it's time to communicate so step three communicate the plan relentlessly so i then go to the leaders of the company i say hey guys forget everything i said before now this is what matters right uh we still want to grow sure secondary priority first priority is we're going to grow ebitda what's ebitda where where are we tracking this today so i'll show them hey here's what it is here's what it needs to be here's how we get there and here's the cadence of how we're going to track this and now i put the vote the onus on them i said you need to find me one or two points of margin in your department or you need to find me three points over here how are you going to do it so come to me tomorrow or in two days with a plan of how you're going to get that extra margin and also i want you to create a report that tracks this you know the sort of uh you know if you're a cost center or you're a profit center of the business you need to create a little dashboard and you need to show me how you're going to basically update that every single week or every single month so we do that and every single month i start hammering people on this and then the fourth step is tie their incentives too so i go to my cmo and i say great last year your bonus was based on revenue this year your bonus is based on ebitda do you want your and by the way i'll actually increase your bonus you can it will remove the cap you can actually get a bigger bonus if you're able to get even bigger ebitda so now it's on you to figure out how that happens but if we don't hit our ebitda targets you get no bonus okay so now incentives are aligned to achieve that thing and so those are the kind of the first four steps last step which is basically actually go do the thing over and over and over again somebody gave me some great advice along the way they go oh you're in ebitda mode yes called spring cleaning so here's what you're going to do you're going to go and you're going to say there's got to be some low-hanging fruit you're going to go and you're going to find a bunch of sas subscriptions that you should cut off you're going to find this this agency you're paying too much and realize that we don't need that agency whatever it is and you're going to feel like cool we cut the cost schedule a calendar reminder in 30 days you're going to do the exact same thing again yeah and you're going to feel like well we already cleaned it out but it's just like cleaning a house you first clean out the surface level mess once that's gone now you start to realize oh wait we never actually dusted this area or this closet and actually stuff now let's start to unpack this closet and so we've done i would say three or four of these spring cleanings now this year and it's only six months into the year so i've done it at least three times maybe four and each time we go and we unearth more stuff and you can't do it every day that's not the right way to focus on it but like you know on a monthly or every two months basis to go back through and say all right let's uh let's trim some more fat where's more fat and inevitably you will find more things but why are you why are you going after ebitda because so i i'll mention this a little bit but if people rag on me i'm not like incredibly well versed but i've been looking into like ebitda might be like so there's this thing called gap generally accepted uh principles whatever it's like what we all like abide by there's a lot of in there why ebitda versus cash flow cash flow also works cash flow required me to do a second big project so the second big project was okay where's that cash going why doesn't the cash go in my pocket oh the cash goes into inventory and so separately we did this like after i did the ebitda cleanup first first couple months i said okay great now the ebitda is great every month but my bank balance is not going up proportionate to the ebitda and so first three months of the year we killed it on ebitda awesome where's the money going oh it's going into inventory how do we get our inventory levels to be right size so that this cash flow flows to the owners of the business and not to the warehouse because today it's going to the warehouse and um which is a separate challenge and a separate discipline altogether and it's a three-legged stool you need all three legs to have an amazing business you need a growth leg because if you're not growing the business is not worth very much um you need profit if you don't have profit this is not worth very much and then you need that profit to result in free cash flow and if you can get all three you have a beautiful amazing business but in order i kind of wanted to go in in those three because again there's not going to really be much cash flow if you're operating at a net loss so i needed to first be making sure there's a surplus of profit then i needed to make sure that circles of profit is resulting in free cash flow and you just so happen to be in an industry where those ebitda and cash flow things they're really hard it's really hard like to figure out the inventory and stuff like that that is a science i uh i am not envious of people through this my major takeaway is e-com is a terrible business to be in um and when is it not a terrible business if you are if you are winning the game and you still think it's a bad bad category to be in that's when you know it's a bad category most people they lose the game they're failing at it and then they blame the category right uh so for example and the opposite is true too i was telling somebody about podcasts oh man podcast is great blah blah blah he goes well yeah you won the lottery so of course you love lottery tickets like you know your podcast is popular it works like of course podcasting is great for you but for the million podcasts that are not really getting listened to is it would you would it feel the same way right is it winning dependent and so this one is interesting because our e-com store is winning and even in winning i'm like note to self this is not the category to be in next time um beyond that i would say playing the game on hard mode has a bunch of disadvantages and i wouldn't put myself in this position voluntarily however once you're in a position where you're playing some game on hard mode there is one big benefit which is is if you ever get to play an easier game you will dominate it's like a it's like i was playing pickleball with a guy it was his first time playing pickleball he's amazing i'm like yeah why are you doing he's like well i'm playing college tennis it's like i played a harder game and i won that game so like yeah i'm pretty good at pickleball it's not so it's not that hard for me in the same way i was listening to uh andrew and chris from tiny they were doing like a q a and they the guy was like yeah i'm in e-commerce d2c which you guys say you don't love that space would would you recommend i just quit or what should i go do and he goes well one of the things that worked for us was because we ran agencies which are can be low margin grindy businesses with a bunch of hr problems and hard to scale because we did you know e-commerce once we went into easier businesses we just cleaned up we could buy a software business that was running at 10 margins and get it to 40 just because that guy wasn't really he wasn't willing ruthless with pricing he was not negotiating with vendors he was not you know taking care of you know all these little things that we had we had to do to survive in these other categories that in a softer category you're you're not as on the hook for who do you think is winning in e-commerce and what attributes do they have shopify face no i mean of course of course of course retailers uh d2c whatever you want to call it i think right now the retailers that are taking advantage of tick tock the tick tock flywheel are cleaning up and what i mean by that is there is a very specific moment of time right now where you can create content on tick tock either yourself as a brand or even better you use an army of affiliates and uc creators and whether it's with tick tock shops or people just hear about the brand so much on tick tock they go google search it and they find your amazon or they find your ddc shop that flywheel i'm invested in a couple of companies that are doing this that flywheel is pretty unreal right now but only for certain categories i would imagine is it only for things where young people are using nope that's amazing that's ridiculous right let's move on i've said too much all right i want to talk about one thing that you actually had on here that i have no idea like it's it's way out of character for you your dream house or do you want to do painted chickens well i don't have much to say about the dream house except for dude look at this sick house that's the entire topic but let's go there it's an amazing house this is a house that uh this guy on my team uh sent me and i can't believe it it's the most beautiful house i've ever seen in san francisco it's 11 000 square feet estimated market value 23 million dollars and it's on the ocean in san francisco i mean there's just a few photos so this house is first to get a 11 000 square foot home in san francisco is very very hard to do every view is like the golden gate bridge you're right on the water you're right on the ocean but even if you didn't want to go in the ocean well guess what you have an infinity pool in the back that's just just spilling over into the pacific ocean on top of that there's one photo in here that i just have to show you i see a beautiful uh porch that's overlooking the san francisco golden gate bridge next photo 24. like a wine cellar that is big enough that it was bigger than my childhood bedroom 25.

a huge home theater that looks like they're just watching like some type of nature documentary so awesome they're sitting here here it is the reason i i want this home to begin with 26. a half court basketball court with all windows where you can see the golden gate bridge this is awesome is this floor to ceiling like 25 foot uh ceiling all glass window you're seeing you're looking at the ocean the breeze it's all there's a glass door that's open you see the golden gate bridge and you have a beautiful basketball court inside your home with all all this light wood that i just love oh my god this is crazy dude this house is unreal i must buy this house it's not for sale so that's the first problem but besides that i am i now have a target i now have a desire you know i thought i had enough money now i have a desire i need to be able to drop 30 million bucks on this house dude in order to buy a 30 million dollar home oh check this out though okay so it was owned by sharon stone before that or after that do you know who owned it a dentist a dentist owned this house what the hell yeah it says this guy was a dentist in order to buy a 30 million dollar house you'll tell me how much money i need 28 million and then i'm gonna borrow two and i'm gonna buy this house with every dollar i own and that's it no i think you need i think you need 100 million dollars to buy a 30 million dollar house would you say that's accurate probably at minimum yeah at minimum the maintenance the taxes on a house like this is going to be pretty insane too like your carrying costs are going to be what half a million to a million bucks a year yeah it could be no it doesn't well it could be that it would be that high probably because you're on the coast and you got this taxes taxes alone in san francisco of this on this house is going to be like quarter million to three hundred thousand dollars a year that's just the property taxes so all the maintenance all the insurance all the all the cleaning all that stuff on top of this thing it's got to be at least another quarter million so at least half a million bucks yeah that's insane that's insane this is a it's a sick house the uh the last thing i wanted to ask you about you said you wrote some essay yeah your boy's getting his paul grandma and i started writing essays why i told you i'm just in a creative season and i wanted to do different things i like writing and i was like well what do i want to write about i realized i want to write about the stuff that i'm curious about or whenever i feel like i have a um a golden insight so something that anything that feels insightful to me i want to be able to write it down and why do i care about that you want to spread your seed baby you got to spread that seed well that's part of it but i actually the bigger part is i've known uh there's this feedback loop that happens which is once you have to deliver something you start to look for it meaning when we start this podcast and let's say every week we got to do this podcast and when you show up to this podcast you got to have three interesting business things to say right you need to have three interesting business topics and in order to do that your brain starts to now go see interest go find interesting business topics starts to ask a few more questions start to write a few more notes just to pay a little more attention and this wonderful feedback loop gets built where you start getting smarter about business more because you have this outlet where you got to go put it and you're on the hook to go put it somewhere every so often so in the same way one of my favorite things is to learn something new right i'm just kind of like a learning junkie right well what by having a place to go right i now am hunting for more insightful things i'm reading more i'm talking to people more i'm having more you know connections between two different ideas that are disconnected and so that's the real reason because the thing i shared with you i haven't even published yet i'm going to publish all these on my website just uh seanperu.com but right now this one's on a google doc i'll throw it up after after this so that it's at least online so the essay is called paint painted chickens and uh our painted chicken and the reason it's called painted chicken is because have you ever been inside of a subway do you eat subway when i was a kid yeah and so i like subway i admit it um but subway the quality has gone like way down since i was a kid and i can't tell has the has the quality gone down or have our tastes uh gone up no the quality's gone down you know i know this you know all the controversy with chipotle right now no no dude like uh gen z hates chipotle why so basically the the things started trending on tick tock there's like chipotle uh gypping you on quantity okay or just like you know basically like the way that this like chipotle used to be bomb now it sucks here's why and different people have different reasons why the taste but one of the big ones is like they're just skimping on the on the thing and so then the ceo came out and did this hilarious thing you didn't see this no it's so funny the ceo came out and he goes oh man look if you go into chipotle and uh you want a little bit more our guys are great about this just you just give them the look and he does this like stupid look like you do that our guys are and girls and girls our guys and girls are great at and hooking you up with this and so there's all these memes now of people being like yeah when i go into a chipotle and i make this face like their reaction which is like they're not like i got you bro let me hook it up and these and they're like also impersonating him where they're like when you go into a chipotle and you give the look our guys and girls and trans and and black people too they're all great at doing this and people are making fun of this ceo for like uh you know flubbing this uh this this speech that he gave so anyway chipotle's under the microscope right now well now they all like kava which i just went to it's awesome yeah they like kava well one of the reasons so then the founders will i think came out or somebody who was like the ex ceo came out and he said two things he goes it's insane that people think uh we would tell our staff to uh like skimp on portions that's terrible for business like we've tested this the thing you do for business if you want to grow revenue and grow profits in a store is you give people bigger portions which makes them love the place to come back sales go through the roof and waste also goes down because you're giving them the food versus throwing it away if you actually want to save on food waste it's not by doing less portions it's by having more customers first so that you sell through all your food that's the way you reduce food waste it's not by skimping to customers and then they don't come back because they're angry right at least like that would be counterproductive the second thing that came out was the guy said basically when uh chipotle had all those e coli scares they had to change their whole supply chain i don't remember this like there's a yeah like two three times like whoops whoops again oh e coli again sorry about that so they changed all of their operating procedures so what they used to do was in the store in the back they that's where they would you know chop the veggies right there they would do whatever now it all comes pre-bagged sealed from like a central headquarters where they can have really tight food safety vacuum seal it or whatever ship it to the store store just has to open it they're not doing the food prep on site well the result of that is the food tastes less fresh and the result of that is that they say they cut down the number of suppliers they were working with because it was too much risk so instead of local produce local farms for the meat they now started going to cut a few vendors that are now shipping out much farther distances and maybe are more mass production less less taste so the taste actually has gone down not just the taste but because of the supply chain changes so they need to they need to i mean bring back e coli or whatever it was like yeah dude let's roll the dice let's live a little right like the food's got to taste good who cares if you get sick once you get which is insane if they sell if they serve millions of customers when it's like four people you know that is that's like statistically insignificant i would imagine which is always the worst argument like whenever one of these social networks they're like dude do you realize like they're getting hammered by congress and all they want to say is there's two billion monthly active users how many people are in your state how many murders are there in your state per day do i blame you no i run a state a hundred times bigger than yours like they can't say that but that's the the reality is the law of large numbers if you're facebook literally anything that can happen is going to happen on your platform every single day that's just the rule of statistics even the most like oddest strangest most screwed up behaviors are gonna happen because it's so many people it's insane yeah and so now they've had to change this whole thing but what was your essay about them so my essay is about i call it painted chicken because if you go to subway subway's motto was eat fresh and if you go into subway it's just hilarious to hear eat fresh and then literally he's opening up a bag of chicken and you see the chicken and the chicken has grill marks on it but you're like hmm how come all the grill marks are so uniform what kind of grill do they use if you go look it up that the grill marks are painted on they don't grill the chicken that's not what those grill marks are the grill marks the group the grill marks are literally painted on the chicken and so i i love this analogy because in every business there are there's always lip service you know every business has these stupid things that they say go go read the website of like bp and bp will be like we care about communities and the environment and they're like spilling oil into the ocean right like everybody has their their version of eat fresh which is you say eat fresh and then you just you're painting on chicken and so what i what i wanted to talk about was what are the few examples where there's not painted chicken meaning what are the examples where a company has values that they actually live by and they actually mean something because i think anybody would agree that like a value system is very very important i remember in my first business i was um trying to make a decision we asked our mentor like oh we're doing a sushi restaurant thing it was like should we use the eco-friendly packaging but it's more expensive and it's kind of like the paper straw it disintegrates but it's good for the environment or she would use this one that's cheaper bad for the environment and it's super durable it's actually good packaging and she was like well you're asking the wrong question you're asking the question of which packaging should we use but the question is what do we value more the environment or the convenience and affordability there is no right answer it's just a question of what you value more and you should just does all your decisions need to come upstream move your decision making upstream once you know your value system everything becomes obvious after that and this is just a good life a good bit of life wisdom if you're if you're in a situation where you don't know what to do with somebody oh should i they treated me this way but i should should i respond kindly should i be mean back should i should i ignore them what should i do well if your value system is i'm a kind person that's what i do i don't i don't change my behavior based on other people well then the answer is obvious just be kind and move on right like that's it so what i started to look at was what are the company values that i actually remember that meant something to not only me but but the people who worked in that company and the first one that comes to mind is facebook's move fast and break things yeah i loved it you like i think you've heard that everybody's heard that phrase by now right so i said move fast and break things like okay that's great is that popular because facebook is popular like maybe it's just a popular value because facebook was so popular all right that's theory one well sam what's uh what's microsoft's core value what's microsoft's move fast and break things no idea no idea twitter lyft uber and pick any of these companies right do you know any any of them like no we don't know any from any of them in fact the only other one that i could remember like move fast and break things was google's do you know what google's is do you know evil yeah don't be evil exactly don't be evil um but then it got it got silly because they maybe did a little evil well exactly so then i was thinking well here what what is it to learn from this so the first thing i learned is maybe these are memorable because they're catchy right maybe that's the first thing which is that instead of just saying integrity you should um you should say don't be evil don't be evil is more provocative it's more catchy it's more interesting than integrity or honesty or be good right if they just said be good versus don't be evil none of us would remember that google's values be good but a lot of us paid attention when they said our value is don't be evil so i think there's something to lesson one is if you make it provocative you make it memorable if you make it memorable people might actually use it so that's the first first little takeaway the second is well there are other catchy rhyming thing you know there's you could just try to be catchy like the the quicker picker upper that's it's cool but why does why does move fast and break things have a little bit more weight to it i think it's because it you have to pay the price right so you got to pay the cost to be the boss and what i thought was interesting was if i went to 100 ceos of fortune 500 companies and i said hey we think that you should you're the company should move fast that speed is an important value speed is important right moving fast would you say that's a value for your team of course hunter bread of 100 would nod their head and say yep of course definitely we value speed awesome and if you said well when you move fast like naturally something sometimes things might go wrong you might you might bump into some things you might break some things when you're moving so fast so let's let's let's agree that it's actually uh it's going to be move fast and and break things how many of the out of the 100 would now agree and the reality is that 99 would be chicken and they would be like well hope well no no no we're not trying to break things around here it depends it's it's speed without breaking things and once you go to speed without breaking things you're now subway eat fresh painted chicken you're right it's now a unusable non-useful value it might be something you put on your website but it's never going to have any weight you're never going to be one of these generational type of companies that operates differently and is known for how they operate and so i went and read this quote from zuck and i want to read this to you so he says the value is actually move fast but my theory on values is that most organizations have a lot of values that don't mean very much they're just table stakes like if you say just be honest of course you're going to be honest you should be honest everybody agrees with that everybody knows that it means nothing it's not an option to not be honest that's automatic so he goes i think the defining principle for a company meaning your company's going to have one thing that you guys really do is your a plus strength should be something something more interesting that has a trade-off so move fast is interesting for us because we had to give something up to get it so the question is actually what are you willing to give up values are not free nothing is dude that's insane i mean what an insightful person to i mean he's just like an eloquent guy for how young he was i mean that's a that's a that's a really good uh quote and so if i think about other great values that have like had resonance and stuck with people and meant something to people you know for example nike's this is more of a slogan but just do it if you think about the the phrasing of just do it is is nike's just do it as powerful if it just said do it or do things like it's it's very different right the word just changes it because just implies there's a cost just implies that that it's don't hit the snooze button don't don't shy away from it it's gonna hurt it's gonna be painful it's gonna be uncomfortable but just do it and so i thought there's something to learn in that that's kind of inspiring for me so my my essay was basically um if you want your culture your values to mean something and my friend siki has this great phrase he said culture is there's many ways to define it but the best way is what do people do when the boss isn't around i love that i thought that was pretty powerful it's your default behavior and um if you want your default behavior to mean something to be different to be a defining characteristic of your company that is different than the way other companies in your space operate here's the three step formula which is you choose one thing not 10 things so for fast for facebook it was moving fast for apple it's thinking differently for for nike it's action um then you make it real by acknowledging the cost or the trade-off and lastly you make it catchy you make it provocative you phrase it in a way that's going to turn heads so that's my that's my essay called painted chicken first that's awesome second have while you're on this little like value driven mission driven company uh quest have you heard of this company called brunello cuccelli you probably haven't because it's not your shtick but they may opera singer who is that no it's this italian company that makes really expensive cashmere clothing and their most their most famous thing is like uh sweaters so it's i'm wearing a free t-shirt made at 100 polyester from a youtuber bro yeah that's why i knew it wasn't your shtick but it's not my shtick either but it kind of has is becoming it because i like it so much but brunello cuccelli the founder started it because he was like an expert at i guess cashmere like he was i don't know what the term is but he he knew how to put together clothing and he basically was like you know my dad worked his ass off he was working seven days a week and i wanted to create a humane workplace and so we're going to do that by creating these amazing sweaters where we hand stitch and it's done perfectly what do you say it's done beautifully uh and he makes these really high-end sweaters and the clothing is great whatever but what's more interesting is this guy the founder and i just saw that someone shared this uh photo of his schedule 6 a.m wakes up at his countryside how home slowly gets dressed goes to the office at 8 30 and then he says at one i walk home for lunch uh then i take a 30 minute siesta at 3 o'clock i go back to work at 5 30 the whole company stops working and takes the late afternoon walk because we believe that uh rest is super important to being uh soulful and personal studies important as well he has light supper at 8 p.m and from 9 p.m he heads out to the cafe to meet friends where they discuss politics philosophy religion and other subjects late into the night and i was like is this guy legit is he the real deal he is so this company this sweater business it's a publicly traded company i didn't realize that it's a publicly traded company with a market cap of like four billion dollars he's building his company to build a great workplace and a great create great products not to make money first and it just because of that i want to give him more money and he's going to make more profit yeah i'm on the website right now and it's you know just from a swipe file like you know there's so many little things that they do in their brand and marketing that is uh congruent completely congruent with everything you just said one of the great marketing uh lessons i learned a long time ago was somebody said yeah it's got to be epoch epoch what's epoch epoc they said every point of contact so they said once you decide what you what you're all about every point of contact meaning when somebody hits you in on your if you're all about luxury but then your customer service hotline is like some janky old web form it's not every point of contact like i'm looking at for example one of the little gifts on the site for you know he's just like go go click on the sweater section or whatever it's this guy and it's a model but the model he's peeling an orange and he pops like an orange slice into his mouth he's just kind of wandering he's like walking a little slightly aimlessly he's just sort of like he's chilling he's not trying too hard he's enjoying himself he's right by the water and i'm like man the creative direction to say because you know normally what you said is you have the founder who's got their beliefs then you have the revenue team that's trying to jack up revenue and they're adding pop-ups on the website try to make it like you know improve conversion they have the creative director who's not even invited to the meetings and they're trying to do one thing over here and it is not congruent at all and people whether they can see it or not they feel it and you could feel when something is congruent it's the same reason the apple store looks the way it does and the iphone looks the way it does and the packaging looks the way it does and the commercials look the way they do it is congruent when it's done well as a brand but it's very rare to see that to be honest yeah these guys are on top of it now i like them uh i don't know if i want to spend like i'm looking at 1500 for a polo uh i don't know if i'm there yet but uh i'm definitely thinking about it uh maybe i'd buy it maybe i'd buy a two thousand dollar sweater but like everything they have is high-end like it's one of those he wants to attract a good customer and i think he's repelled me successfully i would not be a good customer of this but you know what's cool you said his schedule light supper light supper i don't think i've ever had a light supper i'm eating heavy dinners over here and i just realized just changing the words if i said if i just changed my words i said okay what am i going to have for my light supper tonight i bet that would fix my diet just that one you change your words you change your life i bet you if i just changed that one word light supper it wasn't even in my goddamn vocabulary until just now yeah uh thank you i'll be taking that um is that it is that the pod that's it
