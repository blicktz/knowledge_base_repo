you know there's probably like 10 blog posts that matter the most if you're going to do a startup one of them is the paul graham essay do things that don't scale uh where he's talking about with airbnb uh early on and if you're kind of in the startup world just fast forward 30 seconds but if you're not you'll like this story um if you haven't heard it so airbnb is in y combinator they're struggling airbnb is not really working they have like i don't know 20 customers or something low and they go into paul graham's office he's the the advisor from y combinator and he's like okay so tell me how it's going and they're like well you know it's small and not really growing and he's like okay but tell me what have you learned from your customers you've been out there what'd you learn and they're like well you know most of our customers you know most of our customers are in new york and they're putting their apartments up he's like they're in new york they're like yeah like most of your customers in new york he's like yeah he's like what are you doing here like go to new york you need to go to new york now and like uh why are you in san francisco if your customers are in new york so he sent them over there and what they did which is something that nobody else was doing was if you ever saw an apartment listing before the photos look like shit because it would be somebody on their crappy mobile phone at that time taking a photo of a dirty apartment and listing it for rent and so it was like the worst sales pitch and so they started themselves going in they said hey can we send up they would tell their customers hey we want to do professional photos of your place it increases bookings by 40 percent um are you open to that and then they would show up as the professional photographer and be like hey by the way i'm the founder and they would take photos and that airbnb listing started to look great and everyone told them this won't scale and they also thought this won't scale and to an extent it did because even now today there's a sort of fleet of photographers that will come and take photos of your place to list it because it was just that important and they found a way to make it scale i think that's a great story another thing that shocks people is i think even if you have hundreds of thousands of users maybe as high as millions you could really i've done this with us i will just call and talk i only need to talk to about 10 people right and i can see the pattern that represents tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people right i could you could just tell you so like what you could do is a b test shit and wait if you're just starting you're not gonna it's not gonna be significant um and that could work fine if you just call 10 people you really get the information right totally i was talking to emmett so emmett's the ceo of twitch where i'm working and um one you know being at a big company has all these different weird things that aren't really related to my core interest which is startups so i ask emmet all the time just tell me about the early days and so i asked him i said hey uh when you guys were pivoting from justin tv to twitch was that obvious he's like no dude at justin tv like less than two percent of the watch time was on video games it wasn't obvious that this was the thing to do he's like i just liked it and i thought there was an option and he goes and then i talked to a bunch of customers and i said do you have your notes from that and he's like yeah i do and so he sent me his notes from the initial conversations he had with all these streamers all these customers and we publish those no no i don't probably not but i was reading through them and it was fascinating so first was just like first lesson was just go ask the founder or ceo about the early days i bet you they have a bunch of resources that are awesome like he sent me the old pitch decks and stuff like that um i think i sent you one slide which was my favorite slide the title of the slide because it was a progress update for their early investors yeah and it just said um we're like a bulldozer in a field full of flowers and he just and then it was a list of all the shit they got done that month and i was like this attitude like if i said that today at twitch it would be like what is this maniac saying like why is your slide so aggressive uh but that's how they were early on so then he had all these notes of his customer conversations and he always tells everybody at twitch he's like go talk to people by the sixth conversation you'll hear the same thing over and over again it takes six phone calls basically to figure out the pattern and by the sixth one you'll know and uh you'll you won't even want to do 50 conversations you'll be like all right i i can predict what this person's gonna say before they even say it after six that's awesome i think we just got ourselves another clip clip it uh what do you want to want to uh first of all share that deck with me again and also ask him ask him if we can make that public yeah i will ask him actually because it's pretty cool what do you want to get what do you want to do uh the one thing i can share out of that by the way he asked three he's like i said you know oh customer interviews is there a whole skill set to learn he goes no dude i has three questions i said what do you like about your current platform what do you dislike about your current platform and what will it take to get you to switch to twitch and that's what he asked every single customer and then he just heard the common things and he would build it and he'd go back to him he said you told me this is what it would take for you to switch two weeks later here it is are you ready and then sometimes they're like no still he's like okay cool what's next and he would just like keep doing that three questions that's badass just to wrap that up if you want to learn about this stuff i think the best book i've ever read on this is called the mom test yeah i love that jack recommended me that book yep it's fantastic it's the best thing tiny book too like it's a long blog post 50 pages that book um in terms of your business life it might change yeah the mom test
