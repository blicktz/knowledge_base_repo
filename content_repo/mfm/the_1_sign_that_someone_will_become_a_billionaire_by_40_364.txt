he goes seven of the eight richest people in the world right now on our in america right now are fierce nerds right so you have like zuckerberg bill gates elon musk like you have these like these steps jeff bezos these types of folks but also he says intelligence is you know part of the thing but fierce nerds are not they're not winners because they're the smartest of the nerds in fact they're usually only moderately intelligent uh compared to other nerds but they are way more competitive and impatient than than the average nerd and this is the difference between basically like who becomes a professor and who becomes like a founder or a great investor or something like this all right in this episode we're talking about sam's fight with a bunch of nannies yeah it's that's a crazy story that's in the beginning uh sean just had lunch with a billionaire i had dinner with him that'd be actually a few days before super fascinating guy this this we're actually going to share a couple stories that very few people get to see i think that's the most interesting part we also do a couple ideas we got a apple-esque bat apple-esque business for bathrooms and a business around the idea of an iq test so that's a little side hustle we got for you so it's got everything we got frameworks we got stories we got ideas we got it all have you ever seen this meme of like a black guy with a red shirt like clasping hands with a white guy with a blue shirt and it's like we're in this together type of vibe the firm the firm handshake meme yeah it's like us versus the world race class it doesn't matter i just had a real life incident how like that happened to me so i was out i'm in brooklyn right now i was out in this park in front of my house like doing push-ups and sit-ups and just like walking my dog just hanging out and i see this guy or i see like these four nannies like all skedaddle out of like an area where they're sitting and then i see this like dude who's clearly harassing them like coming after them and i run over there and i'm like hey what's going on and they're like this guy just like spit on us he's acting crazy he's bothering us and so i give him my dog's leash uh because i had my dog with me and i go hey hold my dog for me and we i walked over and i start talking to the guy to get him to go away and then like it's like oh this is clearly going to become a fist fight and then like five other guys who are all around the street these guys just like basically sit on the block all day i don't know what they do but like one dude was like a dominican dude another guy was a black guy we were all and i'm sitting there shirtless in bright green running shorts with a fanny pack on with airpods still in my ear and we just like corral these women these four is like a jamaican nanny it was like a asian nanny an older white woman it looks like and it's like we were all just like corralling these guy or the the these these nannies in this like circle and we're just standing there like a elephant guarding its herd you know what i'm saying and it was like the it was like the real life meme of us coming together and at the end the crazy person he walked away and we just look at each other like job well done you know just like who cares about our backgrounds who cares what we look like we just we're champions of the nannies and i just got hyped over that first of all the fanny and the nannies that's an amazing combo don't don't mess with that secondly what was that analogy like an elephant guarding its herd i don't know i watched national geographic when the lions come like the whole community of elephants like get in a circle and they put like the babies in the middle and they're just saying like you know bring it on dog and they're just ready to fight and that's how it felt like we were just these you're like you know they call people like renaissance man like you're not a renaissance man but you do have this strange set of influences that you watch and you consume and you play with so like we need like another word you're like a redneck sans man or something like that like yeah i don't know what these things are you're like you know like when you're when you're swashbuckling over at the thing it's like no i don't know that like why do you know that like you know i like i'm watching cops but on commercial break i'm reading ernest hemingway you know what i'm saying like can't stop me exactly can't stop me you know how many episodes of cops have you watched all of them jacksonville florida is my favorite part how do you think i know so much about florida what episode have i not watched uh all right dude by the way cops i think was the first reality tv and that should start in the 80s i love this happened this morning for you yeah like an hour and a half ago isn't it amazing when you when something amazing happens in the morning the rest of your day you got a totally different pep in your step like i remember once i went skydiving and i did it in the morning and skydiving was okay i was it was cool whatever it's over in like five minutes right like it's like a lot of build up that it's over in five minutes it's like you know it's like your first time doing it it's like you know a lot of build up and then it's just over and the one thing i remember was cool 30 in the morning and then i like yeah exactly i had to go on the rest of my day well i also made the same joke i said your first time doing it and you said the same joke so that's why i was like okay oh it made but we could do it again we could do it two times well that's like when you would you make a joke the second time and someone's like you already said that one i'm like oh well i thought i thought no one heard me i thought maybe you didn't hear it yeah the um but the rest of your day is like you feel like a champion who could do all things that's how i felt the day after i sky the morning after i skydived and i feel like you're you're in that mood now right you fought off the crazy guy the crazy spitting guy with a bunch of nannies you saved a bunch of nannies and by proxy they're babies and so i don't know you could kind of do anything i could just tell you hey sam you know recite you know tell me the next five companies that are going to become trillion dollar companies and you could just tell me i can ask you any question right now you could yeah dude look i i created the un of fighting off you know bad guys it was just a bunch of us all looking different different backgrounds it was like it was like the beginning of a 90s sitcom you know what i'm saying like yeah you know the blue collar guy the doctor you know we all came together yeah it was it was right it was like a cross between uh you know golden girls and like power rangers so you you um can we talk about dharmesh because i have a lot of interesting things to talk about because i got to hang out with him can you talk about what what you all did yeah i think we both basically hung out with dharmesh so dharmesh is the founder of hubspot hubspot is the company that bought your company he's a billionaire hubspot is a he's been there for i don't even know how many years 15 plus years now the beginning so kind of epic founder built a i don't know 20 billion dollar company or something like that and um awesome guy really fun guy to hang out with he listens to the pod so he's kind of like like-minded and kind of knows our personalities but we had never hung out in person neither had you so i think you hung out with him at the conference and then like a few days later i grabbed lunch with him because he flew to san francisco um give me your kind of initial take give me what you liked give me maybe something you didn't expect and i'll do the same so he's lovely like he's a sweetheart of a person he's um easy to talk to like he's incredibly like he seems emotionally like well balanced and like knows what he what he is and what he isn't so a lovely hang and then the second thing and i mean this with love and i mean this as a compliment he is so odd he has done so many unique things in his life that he like you you wouldn't even know like he's odd in that he's like quirky but he's also eclect uh incredibly eclectic so he's done so many interesting things and when he tells you the stories about his interesting things you realize oh you're like a lovely guy to be around and you have my back and we're friends but you are you're kind of a shark you will you'll you win you win at everything you do and you spot opportunities for example he just casually throws out these things and he's done this to me like eight times so i found out that when he was in his 20s he was like you know i almost didn't even and this reminds me of you he goes i almost didn't even want to start tech companies because i've i um was going to become a professional poker player i was like what he goes yeah basically like me and my brother uh we uh we we're up like you know mid to high six figures over our career our short career of blackjack because we learned how to play blackjack and we learned how to do well and also we speak a language that isn't very common i actually don't know what language it is but a language we're in india they don't even speak it that that much and he's like we could talk at like the tables and like discuss strategy and no one would even know and uh we just would win we i i'm up and i know how to do it the right way and i almost became a professional poker player and so he like Has like all these little weird things that he'll tell stories about and I'm like oh you're you're a killer and you're also so unique yeah have you ever read that Paul Graham blog post called fierce nerds no what is it I mean uh years ago 10 years ago it's old right um no not that old maybe like uh let's see when did he publish this he published this 2021 it's a one year so it's an amazing post I'm gonna read you a couple pieces of it but it is it's one of those like Paul Graham I think is somebody said this earlier they go uh uh what's that guy Andrew Tate they saw some tweet that was really funny was Paul Graham was my Andrew Tate like growing up which is like so funny so it's such a funny it's such a deep cut joke but if you get it you're like it just hits the spot so um all right so he wrote this post and he goes most people think of nerds as quiet you know sort of like diffident people right just sort of like uh you know passive and or and in most social situations they are they're they're quiet and you know they're not the star quarterback in the middle of the gym right they're um they're kind of a fish out of water in a bunch of different things he goes um but this is an illusion because when that only happens when non-nerds observe them because they're observing them in non-nerdy situations so you see a nerd at prom you just see them as a quiet sort of passive nerd there's no alpha in them and he goes but in fact some nerds are quite fierce fierce nerds are a small but interesting group they are extremely competitive more competitive I would say than competitive non-nerds because the competition is more personal to them partly because they're not emotionally mature and they they distance themselves from it uh but also because there's less randomness in the types of competition that they engage therefore they're justified in making it more personal so this is like fierce nerds who get really into chess or a game that is less luck based more skill based uh this often happens with gaming or programming competitions or math competitions or spelling bees or way less about luck way more about skill dharmesh told me a story he was like when I was in grade school or high school I uh like I got in trouble because I just like didn't go to school or like something like that and I was like why he goes well I had never seen a ping pong table and they had one of those in the dorm and I right when I saw it I decided I'm gonna be the best at this and so I dedicated my high school years to being the best ping pong player uh but sorry go ahead really yes that's amazing uh I love how you get these gems out of people like what question do you ask that gets that answer I uh like I'll just say like like wow you're like really unique like how are you so why are you so different no no how did you really say wow you're so freaking weird man yeah I would say you do weird stuff your whole life I was like you're a weirdo I'm like I'm kind of a weird I'll say like I'm kind of a weirdo too but you're like extreme weird like what were you like in high school yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's the Sam Park question I I needed to get that out of you that those are great because I'll be honest with you I had lunch with him and super nice by the way keep reading your article okay yeah yeah fair enough uh so he goes so he goes on to talk about it he's like here's some other things about about fierce nerds one they're independent minded they're willing to basically stand on what they believe even though it is socially awkward you know in school this becomes kind of a liability for them but as soon as they graduate they go into kind of the professional world it becomes an extreme asset for them um they're also impatient they're annoyed by rules rather than being just like you know unaware of them or passively following them and he goes I'm not he goes I'm not I'm not sure why fierce nerds are impatient but they most of them seem to be you'll notice at first in conversation they tend to interrupt you at first it's merely annoying but it's but the more promising fierce nerds it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving the problem they have this competitiveness and impatience right so those are two of the like characteristics and um he goes when you combine these qualities in sufficient quantity the result is quite formidable and uh then he gives some examples and he goes that's a beautiful sentence by the way more part if you combine these insufficient yeah that's a really good sentence yeah he goes seven of the eight richest people in the world right now on our in america right now are fierce nerds right so you have like zuckerberg bill gates elon musk like you have these like these steps jeff bezos these types of folks um he goes the bad news he goes he goes indeed he basically but also he says intelligence is you know part of the thing but fierce nerds are not they're not winners because they're the smartest of the nerds in fact they're usually only moderately intelligent uh compared to other nerds but they are way more competitive and impatient than than the average nerd and this is the difference between basically like who becomes a professor and who becomes like a founder or a great investor or something like this and so um he goes he goes he goes the idea of a fierce nerd is not a common one so a lot of you might be reading this and might realize hmm that's me and he goes and now and i love this writing he goes and it is to you young fierce nerd that i now turn and he goes and he starts talking directly to the fierce nerd he goes he goes i got good good news and bad news the good news is your fierceness is going to help you solve difficult problems so you know scientific technical problems blah blah blah you can get rich in business um ingrid it is great for you know survival to be a fierce nerd he goes the bad news is that if not exercise your fierceness will turn into bitterness and you'll become an intellectual playground bully a grumpy cis admin the forum troll the hater and the shooter down of new ideas he goes how do you avoid this fate and by the way he created hacker news so i think he runs into a lot of fierce nerds uh on hacker news he goes how do you avoid this fate work on ambitious projects because if you succeed it brings you the kind of satisfaction that will neutralize your bitterness you don't have to succeed to feel that feel this merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds a sense of satisfaction um and it and it and even if you don't succeed it'll keep you busy so you're not so bitter i thought this is an amazing blog post like one of his you you you best i sent literally i read this i sent it to emmet at twitch i was like hey it's you like this is you this is what i would describe you as like a fierce nerd and he went through y combinator so you know he's like you know the archetype for it so you just pulled this up by the way without having any preparation and you did a really good job by the way of like reading that i was like enthralled uh but dude paul graham very hard by the way because i read this i know a year ago and i'm like skimming it trying to cut the boring parts and also remember what the hell was this article about that was actually quite difficult i know you did a really good job i was like tell me more tell me more um paul graham's a great writer uh i love i'm gonna go back and reread that okay and i interrupted you to i interrupted the interruption so you met with dharmash and you said to be honest he was a nice guy i forget what you said so so he's a fierce nerd that's the first thing and i think you pulled out some good stories the ping pong story the poker story this is classic fierce nerd hallmarks right all green flags uh going going towards that the second part was super nice guy and our lunch was totally fine but there is a certain uh it's he's this type of person i actually there's a bunch of people like this i might be like this where you're almost better to talk to online it's like you spent more time talking to people online that your online social skill is better than your in-person social skill i felt this myself because right i left the house for the first time in many you know many days to go do a social hangout like he even texted he was like you know totally understand by the way if you don't want to come i'm like you i don't like to leave the house and you know i'm protective of my time and i was like no no i want to do this i'll i'll drive an hour let's do this um i felt rusty and i could feel almost that he was a little rusty or like put differently not rusty necessarily but his main comfort zone right his pocket his cockpit as a pilot is sitting at his desk in front of a computer and i know a bunch of people like this i have this guy we used to work with jake if you met him he's as quiet as a mouse in slack he's like the class clown and i was like what who is this guy that's you dude you're like the most soft spoken like you know that foot pedal on a piano that makes all the keys like muted he's like that for real life like somebody needs to like take the foot off the foot pedal for him and but then you get him in slack and the guy's like you know the number one troll willing to cut the edgy jokes and i was like i can't believe this is the same guy and it's like he was 21 years old he basically grew up in malaysia his only like english social interactions were online in like in chat rooms games discord that sort of thing and so you know that's just his persona and i've met so many people that are like this that i've now come to realize it's not something weird about them it's actually a completely normal thing and it's better to just figure out what's you where are you the most you is it through text messaging is it on phone calls is it through written emails is it in person is it like long form in person what is the version of you that's the most you uh like what would you say it is for you um writing like long form writing um i think that's what i prefer like these podcasts like i usually have to lay down for like 30 minutes because i'm like i'm like dead after after them so no i mean i'm okay at this but like writing i prefer but listen to this so i think darmesh would actually agree with you elevate your legs to to get the blood back to your brain yeah i'm just like i'm so tired i passed out what happened uh uh darmesh um it would probably agree with you i would imagine and but so listen to this so they they asked you and me to like show up so basically i was supposed to speak at this event and they were like hey uh one of the main people had to cancel because something happened can you show up like in 12 hours the next morning and come and speak in front of 10 000 people and i was like i mean i guess i could just like show up and riff in front of 10 000 people but i i don't prefer that does darmesh want to like do a thing and they're like no he hates public speaking i'm like just let me ask him he'll do it so he ended up doing it but backstage i asked him about that and he's like yeah i don't i hate public speaking i'm not good at it and i go well you just did a keynote earlier today why'd you do that and he goes i'll tell you why basically for the six months or five months or whatever it was leading up to this event i had this process where i read a bunch of comedy books and i realized that the laugh per minute was the most important thing for a talk and so what i did was i got first i made a presentation i got and i created a zoom call and i got 10 hubspot employees to do it and i recorded the whole thing then i got 20 to come and then 50 to come and then 100 to come and what i did was i adapted each time and i built this python i built this python script that analyzed the audio of the call to figure out what my laugh per minute was and then each time i adapted it to get more laughs per minute so for example and he knew the exact numbers he goes i had 96 slides on this presentation and i had to click next 120 times and i know on which laugh and on which word to hit next because i practiced it so much because i'm optimizing for lap my he kept calling it the the lpm wow and uh what the hell this is amazing it's amazing these types of stories it's amazing and he like he and i went back and watched his talk and he goes in fact so here's like another like side tangent have if you've ever been to a big conference have you noticed whether it's ted talk or even steve jobs all the big conferences that have more than a thousand people they all use the same slide clicker have you ever seen that clicker it only has two buttons a red which means back and a right and a green which means next so here's the secret that clicker it doesn't actually change the slide it goes to a light like a light that says red or green and there's someone on the other end of the slide hitting left or right did you know that no yeah so that's like oh so it's so stupid because they do it because like the the presenters or the organizers will be like well in case you could screw up someone's here and we'll do a better job but it's not automated like this is how it works at all big conferences so it's like this is a clicker or whatever we have to do a talk on it actually they have a they've completely monopolized it so every single big conference has this and and i told him that he goes dude trust me i know i've gotten in fights with these people for eight years because i built a device and a program to make it so that clicker could actually work directly with the computer because in order to optimize my lpm i need the click to happen faster than a human being can see the light and click next because i've that's how i've set it up and every once in a while there'll be a slight delay which decreases my lpm and so this is how this guy looks at everything and he told me about his lpm like you think about your t levels yeah he just like spends months optimizing his lpm and this is just like when i hear stories like this i think a you're unstoppable like this is why you're successful and b i love you like i i just you're my hero and everything you're about i'm into now and i just i love it man i love when these people are so extreme about shit it's awesome that's amazing uh that is amazing what an amazing story you've made my day um that that is really incredible i i can't even uh yeah i can't even kind of wrap my head around the level of nerdery it takes to go that deep on something like you know um i feel like i live my life in this like 80 20 way where like good enough is as good as it gets and like i just kind of good enough is as good as it gets for like almost everything in my life very rarely do i try to like take something to that like nth degree that in that olympic level of obsession and part of me is very jealous of people who do that um like we another fierce nerd we had was this guy quinn who used to work at um at our company and quinn same thing most soft-spoken guy you might have met him he had the big crazy yeah i know uh most soft-spoken guy gentle like if there was a fly that landed on his wrist he'd be like it's your wrist now fly right like he just didn't want to harm a bug never said a bad word about anybody and um he was like a fierce nerd like we we started playing like these little word games in the office and i was like oh quinn you should play like this uh like you know like imagine like wordle but like 10 years ago and he's like oh i could see him like getting like visibly stressed about it and i was like whoa like no problem man what's wrong like you you don't want to play he goes no but if i play then i'm just gonna get super obsessed with it like i'm just gonna take it too far and i was like what do you mean he's like he's like yeah i just have to be careful with games like this i just get like really into it i just have to win and i was like you like what do you mean like you're this ruthless competitor get get out of here and he goes did i ever show you uh the girlfriend thing and i was like what's the girlfriend thing and he goes you know that game that's like that word scramble game uh like basically it's a bunch of nine letters on a grid you're trying to like create as many words as you can just like dragging your finger across the line he's like yeah my girlfriend beat me in that game once and then i went to google's headquarters and i programmed the artificial robot arm to just make as many swipes as possible in like every like per second and uh like i just crushed her and i'd like i'm the world record holder now of this game like he basically created he like programmed the robotic arm he added a little like nerf gun tip to it so it'd be soft like it could just scrape against the screen and then he just programmed it to move in every direction the optimal path to like create as many words as it can and like you know a minute and it's like his time is like unbelievably higher than everybody else and his girlfriend's like well this game's not fun anymore like i don't understand what's happening like what happened here and he's like i happened dude let me tell you one more last uh dharmash story so he owns like uh he has an eight figure domain portfolio so like random things like he owns cambridge.com which he like just lets the government use um you know how i um i have this copywriting thing i i was using try copy that and he goes hey for your birthday i bought you copy that.com and i was like what that's like he's like try not being a bitch he punched me in the stomach and walked away he punched his stomach but then gave you the credentials thanks dad dude that's hilarious so he owns all these domain names and i was like what okay well you have this wordle thing and you have all these domains any projects that interest you he goes i've been thinking really a lot about creating a venn diagram community i was like what what are you crazy he goes well i own venn diagram.com and i love communities and i'm into math and i think there's a lot of other people who are also obsessed with venn diagrams i think i'm going to build a really cool community for venn diagrams and uh i don't know if you're going to follow through with that you can just see them having like a tattoo on their arm of just a van there's a bunch of venners yeah yeah we're all just venners just getting in a room finding overlaps everywhere yeah yeah but i don't know like what it's like there's a circle there's a circle and you see how this circle like what are they gonna do just talk about it all the time i mean i i don't understand like what the like you know this circle's bigger this one's smaller i i don't know he's gonna vend man you can't you can't help it but that's what he's gonna build is a venn diagram community because he owns venn diagram.com can i can i tell you five random domains that i own uh actually i'm gonna tell you six random domains that i own i want you i'm gonna say let's play a little game i'm gonna say a domain and you're gonna just pitch me a business off off the domain off the top of your head all right okay all right you froze all right there you go um okay number one excelmonkeys.com a domain i own excelmonkeys.com what does it do all right excelmonkeys.com that's where you buy smart chimpanzees that that's your best idea with excel monkeys you buy smart monkeys yeah because they excel monkey's so smart they could use excel yeah excel monkeys it would be um that would be the name of a tax service yeah it could be a tax service it could also be like selling amazing excel templates for stuff it's like oh you need like a cash flow statement here's a great one you need like a p l here's a great excel wait did you buy excel monkeys because that's what i used to call people no did you do that yeah whenever i meet these finance nerds in reality i was always jealous of them because they were making more money than me like my friends and i'd be like dude you're just an excel monkey man like they're just all you do is play on excel you don't do anything you don't create real value like me like you know i'd write a newsletter dude i i have so many phrases like that like um bankers who are always making powerpoints i'm like ah freaking slide jockey over here i don't even know what i don't even know why but i'm like i want it to be derogatory or like uh the best one of all of them is the finance department that like watches the budget you have to get your expenses it's like oh yeah i gotta go talk to the bean counters i like heard something some guy say this he was like in his 60s and i think it's a common phrase but i was like oh that was like a racial slur as far as i was concerned i was like wow calling someone a bean counter that sounds i like that you were allowed to say that in the office that's incredible i'm going to use that when i was uh you know younger and i was jealous of all these bankers they'd be like oh you know i work in banking like oh no which branch you

find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hubspot grow better i got um it's tummytime.com it's tummy time baby it's tummy time okay what is it what are we doing at tummy time just uh what do you do on tummy time is that when the what's the baby do just sit there and watch tv what's tummy time i don't even know dude kind of they just lay on their tummy it helps them like uh you know like develop their core strength or their neck strength to like look up so they don't just be face down but they don't necessarily watch tv but yeah i guess you could do that obviously you're going to be selling baby aerobics classes i don't know for sure you'd go for like a six minute abs thing it's tummy time baby and it's all i don't even know what that is i you know i'm not i don't i'm not there yet and what are the last two we're gonna have to work on your improv skills you've been working on comedy but not improv i feel like uh i feel like the on the spot throw something at you i'm gonna practice i'm gonna keep doing this segment until you're dude i'm i'm still at the yes and part of the book what's the one thing everyone knows about improv yes and there's like the number one tell that you've never done improv is that you you say you know an improv you know an improv we have this thing called yes and it means don't disagree with me in this meeting instead say yes and then make my idea better because it's bad right now have you ever gone out to dinner with a bunch of improv people dude i did improv for like you know eight weeks of my life dude i've gone out to dinner what time i went to dinner nothing more obnoxious than a bunch of improvers i'd rather be with the venners yes i'd rather be with the venn diagram dorks than a bunch of improvers yuck they go it goes like in in in like places i don't want to be number two on top of that list is improvers number one is people who are part of acapella groups oh my god i was about to say the same thing acapella where they're just like hey yeah yeah yeah dude oh god here we go you know shabuya shabuya don't sing to me in the on the mcdonald's line that you want a number one brah just tell me a big back with no with no onions you know what makes any situation worse singing i cannot stand the acapella people i didn't realize that was a thing where i grew up in missouri if you're part of the acapella people would make fun of you but then i started meeting people on the east coast like these people who go to harvard and cornell and and they would brag about being part of like they're so serious about it i'd be like dude why are you telling people that what are you doing like don't be talking about this in public you don't talk about that and they're like why it's awesome i was always amazed at acapella people dude on duke's campus like who gets laid number one basketball players number two acapella and i was like what the hell what's going on it was crazy yeah i have these like dating rules by the way uh never date anybody who's into who's an equ what is it called equestrian somebody who likes to ride horses never date a horseback rider never date a dancer uh never date an acapella person uh those are my three those are the three like you just never want to do it why they're obsessed with something that's by all accounts useless number two they all of their hobbies are extremely either expensive or time consuming away from you number number three half of those hobbies basically are like really intimate with other people that are not you they're just going to be doing salsa with some like you know some suave guy from latin america who doesn't speak english but is touching all over your person you don't want to do that right so these hobbies and the same and then also you can't do the thing so oh you're at a wedding great isn't it awesome you date a dancer no it's not awesome you turn into a pole while they are doing like actual dancing or oh you date a singer great why don't you just sit there and nod and like tap your foot while they who they actually know how to sing so it's like do you can't do together i never dance at weddings i just act like i have to go to the bathroom every song i freaking hate it i hate wedding dance floors i watch the ufc you're like i find two bathrooms on opposite poles yeah i just make laps between them dude i don't ever dance like i i watched a ufc fight the toilet the other day like i at a wedding i don't i hate dancing saturday nights i watched ufc at like three weddings already yeah i hate going to weddings and going to the dance floor i just tell sarah like don't even ask me and they're like well it's fun i'm like uh no this is the worst i don't want to do this i don't know what to do i don't like it it just it ain't for me there's a great little chris d'alea clip on youtube out if you see that he goes there's no bigger dick move than inviting your friend to your wedding because if you're doing an out-of-state wedding and you invite me like you know what you just did to me you know what you just did you cost me money time i don't want to be at a wedding and i thought it was like very very true um all right new uh new segment so or a new idea so i got two ideas for you would you like to hear about i'll give you options would you like to hear about the next apple or would you like to hear about um the next the next little side hustle that i think could kind of work the next apple or the next side also that might kind of work well the second one all right just as i expected um do you know your iq no of course not ben do you know your iq of course he does i i've done only unofficial iq tests what does that mean yeah like a banner ad on a website yeah so there's some online that's supposed to be better than others but basically in order to get your actual iq it's supposed to be like proctored and they have someone administer it but you can go take tests online i took one of the better ones um and it's still not like a totally accurate iq okay i had one of the better arby's the other day so it's kind of like that yeah what did you get yeah what's your iq it said 132. oh this genius level right no no but it's it's it's smart but not genius so um i think you could create a ddc iq brand uh so i think you could basically take the same playbook that everybody's using for ddc brands right uh we were just joking about banner ads but yes banner ads uh facebook ads taboola ads everywhere i think you could optimize a funnel that basically buys clicks for less than a dollar and then converts you know let's call it uh i don't know whatever 10 of people uh you need to convert 10 of people to pay you the 25 bucks that it's going to take or the you know maybe it's the maybe it's maybe it's 99 bucks or something like that you have to figure out some version of the economics that's going to make sense to make this the math work on the cac versus the the value but i feel like somebody could create a funnel that will get you in why do i think that this will work it's not really economics driven it's just work backwards from what's an ad that i think would work and i think an ad that's like only geniuses can solve this puzzle um like i i don't know if you've seen these ads on tick tock that are like people say this puzzle is impossible or this number game is impossible you can't draw a line through these four things without lifting your finger and you're like i bet i can do that that looks doable and you like click it and then now it tells you to download some game but instead of a game i think it could be basically like an iq game and i think you can basically make a monthly subscription that's like these are iq games or iq tests to get your score um for either you or maybe maybe it's maybe we're going after the baby einsteins maybe it's for your kids because i think people want to know if their kid's a genius more than as an adult it's less less important and so i think somebody can build a d2c iq test that like i don't know exactly how well it'll do but would it surprise you if i told you dude i met this guy and he runs this like facebook funnel that basically takes you down an iq test and then you pay for your results and uh and like half the people forget to cancel their subscription um and the guy makes you know 50 50 000 a month or the guy makes 100 000 a month doing this would you be shocked if i told you that no in fact i think you could build a company that could actually make nine figures like 100 million plus and here's why um i think i've told you about this but have you ever heard of gallop you've definitely heard of gallop like they they're cited in the surveys yeah there's surveys well they own this company uh called uh clifton strengths have you heard of clifton strengths i i think clifton strength we've talked about it is wait wait we talked about it way back in the day but we should do it again because the pod was way smaller back then but yeah i've done this test the strength finder test i don't have all my research so i'm going off memory but basically strengths finders i think it was a test and then a book or a book then a test something like that it's a book that has a link to the test inside so basically the book is like you don't even need to read the book the book just has like a code so go to this website type in this thing now you take the test and then it gives you at the end like your six or seven strengths it's like oh you're a futurist it's just like literally tarot card reading to me like it's like you're a futurist you're a determined leader you're a uh you know problem solver or whatever i don't know what they are but like i took the test and i was like oh they just gave me seven like generically positive words like oh for sure i can identify with some of these and like great what does this do it's a horoscope but basically gallop the company gallop is a survey business they own strengths finders and gallop is privately owned but if i remember correctly four years ago maybe it's two years ago when i did research on them i think they're north of a billion dollars in revenue and clifton strengths finder i think what it is is um so they charge like 40 to 50 bucks for one of these simple things and but then they do like more heavy duty consulting where they're like put your whole company through it and during my research i'm pretty sure that that test was making hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue because they have thousands of employees and like i don't know where they're based like minnesota or like something they're just like one of these i guess they're the main thing gallop is based in dc but it's one of these companies that you like totally forget about that exists and you just don't even think about it but if you look at the traffic of their website and you look at some of the numbers based off of news articles it's like a pretty wildly huge company right is it private or is it public it's uh it's private it might have been public at one point but it's like they have on wikipedia it says they've got 50 offices and i know they have thousands and thousands of employees and it's privately owned by uh i think still uh just the the family wow uh yeah that's amazing yeah so i think you could do like the this is like the enterprise personality test that's what i call it uh you could do the personality test you could do the love languages uh test you could do iq uh i think you could do a d2c funnel that would work with these things um so i don't know i'm kind of interested in this i think this is like if you're a good internet marketer like actually not good i think you kind of need to be an amazing internet marketer yeah if you're amazing internet marketer the world is your oyster but like one fun one that i think somebody could spin up would be um these like sort of uh take a test get a score type things whether it's personality or it's iq okay so that's that's that one now let me tell you my apple idea all right i'm taking a shower today and that's nice you're welcome the my one of my favorite feelings of the day i'll give you a list of my favorite feelings most people don't have this list but i gotta i got a list of favorite feelings throughout the day in my top five two of them maybe three come in the bathroom showers wash my hands taking a poop love all three of them my trainer says this thing by the way do you do it in that order that'd be you'd be a freak if you did it in that order it's not a routine in that order no actually we go the other way right there's a there's a method to by the way my trainer has this thing he says which is like uh he's like yeah of all my clients he's like the number one thing people actually like struggle with is like stress and he goes what's the opposite of stress and it's like i don't know relief he's like yeah relief satisfaction he goes he goes think about how many things a day stress you out i was like oh that's a lot there's a bunch of things that can stress somebody out he goes think about how many things give you relief in a day he goes i was like kind of struggling to think of anything he's like he's like people usually have relief once a day it's right when they're pooping and he's like that's the only time they experience this emotion that's why they're bad at it they don't practice that emotion very much and i was like wow that's that's interesting so anyways back to my story i love having clean hands after washing my hands i love taking a shower and i love the relief all right great so but when i'm in those situations right now if i go to my shower nothing that special i i don't know i got standard showerhead shampoo body wash got a loofah in there because you know my wife hooks me up you know so this is this is like that's what i'm working with and for something that i do every day something that's like you know kind of an important part of my day why are i think somebody could make an apple for the bathroom and what what is the company that's apple for the bathroom going to do so i don't know have you ever tried to like hack your shower experience to make it more awesome it's really hard to do things yeah i bought i was really interested in like different shower heads and i remember researching them on wire cutter and i bought the fanciest one and then i it wasn't even that fancy but the best one and i remember like it took forever to call handyman to install it it was a pain in the ass where did you fall fall into the trap installing it right it's always the install that's like you know who's going to do that god that's versus like a a nest a nest was like easy i i did that and same thing with toilets it's like you we've probably all heard that there's these japanese toilets that are amazing that will like you know give you a butt massage or whatever you know they're they're like incredible toilets but who's going to rip out their toilet and replace it with this fancy one that's a that's a big big overhaul and washing your hands nobody even touches the mirror nobody touches like there's so i think you can build a product that simply says i'm going to give people relaxation and relief i'm going to give them uh motivation and inspiration through products just for the bathroom and you could just nerd out about how to make the bathroom experience amazing like i bought these little eucalyptus like pods that you put in the shower it basically when hot water hits the the pod it like releases like this eucalyptus like kind of like uh aroma awesome right like the the thing itself is kind of janky like it's not the best product like uh you know in between it gets all soggy it's not great it's like it's only good the first time but the concept is amazing and it's like why isn't there just a better diffuser that's going to add this like eucalyptus steam into my shower while i'm doing this why isn't there an add-on attachment that doesn't require me to replace my shower head but just makes the shower head better um why isn't there something that's on my mirror that is motivational and inspirational that's like that looks nice why isn't there a product that's like washing your hands but it's not washing your hands it's like some heat uv i don't know something that's gonna like make my hands feel clean and toasty um why isn't there uh eight sleep for the toilet that's a device that sits inside the toilet and measures your pee and your poo and tells you when you need to go see a doctor or you know the quality of your hydration or whatever else i think that somebody should build a company i want some somebody who is like that venn diagram between quantified self they like they want to like optimize they you know the rob dyrdick i am human optimization they're that guy but they're also a hardware nerd and somebody who has that overlap i just wish that they would create apple for the bathroom so it's i think it's something i wish somebody made because i would buy hundreds of dollars worth of products from a brand that could actually do that well what do you think of this idea dude so uh i i haven't researched a ton of this but um there's two interesting players in this space right now so interestingly both of them have come from like tier one vc-backed businesses that they previously started in traditional like cool kid area so the first one i think is it called revolution bathrooms uh made revolution made revolution so it started by renovation i believe it started by i think is roger dickey i think his name is his company was called gigster successful tech guy who started like businesses i think they have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars and he like up and quit like this one like company that he had gixer that was killing it and he's like i'm gonna get into the bathroom business and so a little bit different than what you're talking about but interesting but another one that's actually really cool have you heard a block renovation they do the same thing right ish yeah i believe they do the same thing but basically the coolest thing about this is if you go to the website it looks slick and cool and everything and it almost fits your venn diagram once because the guy who started it his name is luke sherwin he's the former founder of casper uh so he like took casper public and left and then he started this thing for bathrooms and i think at this point i think they've brought in 90 million in funding or 50 million in funding i forget but it's like close to 100 million and i think it's like doing really really well yeah both of these are basically how do you renovate your bathroom so that you get a like super nice looking bathroom or in their case kitchen also um like just like pick from the menu it's like here's you know here's five amazing bathroom designs pick one and then we have people that can install that bathroom in your bathroom turnkey versus today the way you do a renovation it's like all right what are you guys thinking for tile it's like i don't know i never thought about tile uh what are the options and how much does each one of these costs and like okay then what about sinks and you just sort of have to piecemeal it whereas this was like a turnkey bathroom in a box which is a great idea this was one of the first ideas we brought up on on this show by the way was i saw this ad and i was like this made renovation idea is amazing and i should have just invested in it because back then it was like in a seed stage like it was very early and um yeah both these have done really well i have you ever tried to buy a bidet so like what you can do is buy these like bidet uh covers where basically it's like this like it's basically just a sophisticated toilet seat and dude they are so janky like you have like an electrical right there never installed it and in fact broke my toilet trying to install it dude they're so janky and you have like a cord going from like where your like electric razor goes and you're like what the why is this cord like going like across the room yeah it's like running from the kitchen into my bathroom yeah and then you've got this like stupid hose that goes up to the top of the toilet it just looks like a like a science experiment like it's duct taped together it sucks right but i've always wanted one you know like whenever you know you use one yeah i want a real bidet yeah that's sick that's dope so yeah i'm on board i i think this is uh the next apple that's ambitious maybe the next company that gets bought by apple i didn't say it's the next apple i said it's apple for the bathrooms meaning it's a company that just cares about the design the simplicity of use and um just making a really high quality product and people are willing to pay a premium way more than you think they're willing to pay three times more if you could actually pull that level of quality off and i think that you have this place where people go all the time you have the shower you have toilet you have a sink you have a mirror if these things to work with and then you have all the accessories oh maybe this scale that i have in my bathroom is like i don't know it's just like some random weight scale maybe there's like a really good version of that that can go with it you could just cross sell into all these different categories but you just say we're going to own the bathroom we're going to make the goddamn best products ever for the bathroom and i think if somebody just simply took that idea and then just decided to execute on that for like 10 years you could have a billion dollar company in the same way that like you know the nest thermostat was able to sell for a billion dollars right like i think if you can if you can actually pull off this thing that's in every home and with a bathroom you've got like three or four in every home so it's like you have this like um this thing that today everybody kind of ignores and just treats in this uh sort of like it's an afterthought type of way no i think that's dope i'm in you want to do one more or what uh i want to talk about one other concept which is uh actually do you have one we could do one of yours if you want no if you want to do one all right no i gave a talk at hustle con with this phrase and in my mind i was like oh yeah we've already talked about that but i'm like wait a minute no that was just at hustle con i don't know there's like a couple hundred people in the room at my breakout talk uh so most people have not heard this concept the one on selling a company it was the one on how to sell your company and in general it's really about like you know how to do a part of business that you don't do often and maybe you don't have the reps in so like most people who become like business owners ceos you're great at product you may be great at marketing you might be good at finance and making money what you're not good at is stuff that you only do once in a while like fundraising or um m a or um you know things like that it's sort of like these large one-off transactions that are very important very expensive you don't want to get them wrong but you also don't have reps doing it and um and the other side like when you're fundraising the investor they talk to hundreds of people like you every month they're getting tons of reps so you it's a very asymmetric skill set you don't really know how to negotiate like them you don't know what clauses are standard and what are not standard um so you don't have that same level of reps that the other party has same thing with m a you're going and talking to somebody who does m a for a living and um and they've done hundreds of deals and you don't know the first thing about the first thing and so here's the solution that most people have right like if you're really big you can afford a banker like uh did you guys use a banker i don't think so when you when you sold right you may have i had hired advisors but i had hired one and then i disliked them so i fired them so i ended up being the banker right and same thing when we sold i was the banker but i had a i talked to a banker who could kind of like give me some free advice from time to time this amazing guy really good lawyer that was like a huge thing although i do see the value in a banker i do think that a good banker totally is worth a fee a good lawyer is 100 needed right this guy dick filipini he he was amazing actually he was a banker that helped me but we were too small for like his normal deals right he does 100 million dollar plus deals and we were way under that so um so basically i was like okay well i don't have i could maybe do a boutique banker but again which one i don't know who's good who's not uh you said you had a great lawyer cool i got a lawyer is my lawyer great are they okay are they good like how am i supposed to assess this and by the time you you figure out if your lawyer was good or not in a transaction it's too late it's too late it's done same thing with tax strategy or negotiation all these different components and so i had talked about like um doing this process is like a very fundraising is usually like an intense sprint uh mna is like an intense sprint it's this couple month process that you work on really hard it becomes your main focus at the end of the day you're trying to like get to this amazing endpoint i was like i made the comparison i was like it's like birth and a baby and you go through this labor process and then by the end you like you have the thing you wanted at the end and so just like when you're having a baby you you might have a doula a doula is somebody that kind of like they're not your doctor right this the doctor would be like your lawyer right uh they're not your nurse they're which would be like maybe your your cpa um they're just somebody who's there to coach you guide you and they've been they've seen the births of hundreds of babies whereas this might be your first and i talked about you need a deal doula i was like if you're going to do a deal if you're going to do a transaction you're going to do a fundraising you need a deal deal deal it's different than a mentor a mentor is this like general thing in life that's like going to be your kind of like your you know the better version of your dad and a deal doula specific it's for this period of time it's around one specific problem or process that you're going through and i talked about how when i when i sold my last company i had these five deal doulas i started with and eventually it ended up being these two that i was working with the most but like i talked to five and uh who else yeah uh there was this guy flawed who had talked to who gave me great advice like he told me one thing like each one of them told me like one thing that was really important so that guy dick was one of them uh but like for example flawed told me he's like you need to he's like oh cool i was like so excited i was like look we got this like these guys are interested they're about to give us a term sheet tomorrow and he was like you know just sort of chuckling he's like sure i was like oh you don't think they'll do it he's like it'll happen it's just every timeline you think of is wrong everything they say is going to fall through and then come back and then half fall through again he's like this is the normal m a process so you might have an outlier where it just all goes smoothly but like if you're going to have a normal m a process you should expect these bumps and bruises and it's like you know going through these contractions basically there's like painful ups and downs during the process he also said he's like you need to turn your company into a giant buy button i was like what do you mean he's like you know when you go to amazon it's like one click checkout he's like you think because these guys are giving your term sheet you're at the end it's like this is when you're gonna have to sprint the hardest he's like let me see your data room i was like oh yeah we're working on it he's like wrong answer bucko like you know you know that's what you you shouldn't be at lunch with me you should be turning your company into a buy button you need everything so organized so precise uh ready for them answer all of their questions dude did i show you my data room you did yeah i had a fire data room me and this woman named ed this woman named ed who works with me ed is probably i think she's in her 60s and when i hired her she was great but she didn't like know how to use technology really and i would it would be like me and her on the phone with hubspot and hubspot would have like five representatives then they would have like six lawyers who are probably two grand an hour a piece then they would have like six accountants and so like this meeting cost them fifty thousand dollars and it'd be ed and i and they would be asking those questions or different documents and like okay we'll get it for you and i remember them like having a list and he didn't know how to take a screenshot on a computer and i just hear her constantly with her phone and every once in a while she would bring it up and their phone just taking taking pictures of the screen and i just you know and i would have the messenger ed put your phone on silent i know what you're doing and she was just taking pictures and we would you know we talked about fierce nerds ed is like a fierce grandmother like i would go to your office and you'd be like oh how's you know how's your daughter like she knows her name she's like remember my daughter's name it's like show me pictures she was like so kind and cuddly she's the best she'd be like you submitted your invoice wrong like keep this organized we're running a tight ship around here and i was like yeah wow this is how did you find this woman because i was like she's like the polar opposite of you plus she was so needed for what you guys had as your operation needed i i'm always been really good at finding those people because she was she worked in banking for a long time actually and she was like really successful banking a person and she comes off as this like really nice naive woman it's like not even a little bit she's like pretty not sharky but like she's she'll get you because she worked in banking in japan where she was like helping companies go public i think at morgan stanley so it's like she's like a shark like say no more yeah and then she like raised her daughter she had a daughter and decided not to work and raised her and she came to me and she was like i don't really need the money but i want a job to prove to my young daughter who just graduated college that uh i'm a badass and that women can be badasses and i was like oh yeah cool you're hired id like i love that and uh she ended up being amazing and i remember her i'm during the due diligence process i had a teacher how to use uh dropbox and i had a teacher like some like pretty like basic computer stuff like how to like copy and paste and then she like bought a course on udemy and stayed up all night and mastered it and she's like all right i know how to do it now but like if i didn't show her how to do something i would see her taking a screenshot like she would have her phone just up and hear a click and i'm like edi they could see this anyway sorry go ahead she's amazing i don't know what she's doing now but like she's still there i need to hire her she's still working with you guys yeah she's still there amazing i would have thought like you know normally in like these acquisitions they don't like bring on the finance team or whatever but that's that's amazing i would never let her go she's she's so good she was the most impressive honestly i i like you but she was the most impressive person at the hustle like she was wonderful man people know you they know trying to know stuff she was the most in person impressive person there yeah she was wonderful i don't even know what we're talking about this oh deal deal doula here's the here's the i don't know if it's a business idea but i hear i know that if you're going to do a transaction you need somebody like this which is every time i've done one of these things i need this person and here's what they teach me how to do they teach me how to use the lawyers they teach me how to use the accountants they teach me how to do the negotiation because they've been through hundreds of these so they know what to expect so they can emotionally coach you when you're like going through ups and downs they're your therapist they're your advisor on the business side of things in negotiation but that's honestly the least usually that's pretty obvious about what you should do there um they're your your speechwriter and your copywriter as you uh you know prepare to like you know write a pitch deck or um you know a follow-up email or whatever it is and the most important thing is they teach you how to use expensive lawyers and accountants because if you just go to a lawyer and you say what should i do you're going to end up with a document that's basically the constitution and it's like oh great you lawyered the out of this but like that wasn't what we needed in our business case like you didn't a lawyer if you defer too much to the lawyer they're going to over lawyer things if you don't if you don't listen to the lawyer you're going to have too much liability how do you find that line that judgment is the most important thing and judgment is something you can't really hack there's no shortcuts to judgment the closest thing you can get to it is partner up or borrow somebody else's judgment one of these deal doulas so same thing on the fundraising side you see a term sheet you don't know all these terms what do they mean should i agree to this liquidation preference they oh they have this you know clawback thing what what is this should i agree a deal doula is the one who can kind of teach you how to do that or i love that you know my tax person's suggesting this and they're going to say don't do that it's going to over yes that saves you in taxes but it's going to add deal risk over here because it's going to introduce delays and complexity that you don't want to have that's a really good it's been so indispensable to me i'm like i don't think there's a business because normally these are successful business people that's the only person you can get to do this and they don't want money for this they're just doing it because they want to help you typically um maybe somebody could make a business out of this but even if they don't my advice to any founder out there is if you're going through either a fundraising or an m a process make sure you have your deal doulas to keep you sane and keep you smart about how you're going to go through the process dude there are so many things that i didn't even know like i didn't even know to ask for example when people talk to me about selling their companies i'll be like well you know you really want to optimize for uh time to close so you want to like close as quickly as possible because in my head i was like why does it matter they gave you a thing i'm like well just happens for example brian halligan the ceo of hubspot got into a near-death accident five days after the deal closed i'm like if that happened at any other point or if the economy changed like just happens or like the person leading the deal quits like stuff changes all the time and another thing that i didn't even notice look for is like i would get these offers from these pe firms from small businesses from and then hubspot has a board a board of directors they're a huge company and they're like well we we present the loi before we gave it to you to our board of directors and i was like this isn't going to go through yada yada yada well once the board approves it the likelihood that it's going to get done is quite high because the employees have to look good to the board and they already like you know they can't whereas you have another guy who's just like a smaller business and it's just the founder leading the deal it's like oh he he don't give a he'll bail at any point like he just he's like you know it's their money they're you know what i'm saying like the dynamics are different and so there's all these things that i didn't quite understand that now i know that you really it's hard to learn unless you've been there because you don't even know what to ask with our last deal one of we took the low we took the second highest offer like uh we turned down the top offer and we took the second offer and why was that well there was like a bunch of intangible reasons maybe we preferred one over the other but it was like you know i personally i personally left i don't know million and a half to two million dollars total on the table uh just me on taking the second deal over the first deal which is like that was a lot of money to me i that wasn't small like that was that was meaningful um and the reason i did it one of one of the reasons there was a few the one was you know our team they want we wanted our team to to our whole team to go with the deal then and that was only going to happen with the second one that's probably the biggest reason but there was some small reason like commute and stuff like that but the other one was likelihood to close um they had told me they go look yes we've been a pain in the ass in negotiation like we're sticklers about this stuff like we we don't move super fast but the good news is that means we've thought it through and we've got our approvals already once we sign this thing we will close and we will close on time and he's like that's the good news the bad news is leading up to it we're not the quickest fastest deal makers who are going to promise you everything it's like we're only going to promise you what we can deliver that's the ideal that's the that's the ideal setup by the way and i didn't really know how to value it at the time like he was pitching it to me as a value and i was like yeah whatever the other guys are offering more like what do i care um but in retrospect that actually was quite an important thing because it's very important 100 of the second best deal is better than no deal from the from the best offer right or somebody who's going to re try to retrade the deal in the last minute like that's one of the worst signs you can have is somebody who comes back and in the 11th hours trying to retrade the deal and they told us that these guys were like we're not going to retrade the deal we are going to close and so that's the good news the bad news is it takes us longer to get to the term sheet and we're not necessarily going to be the top offer we're going to offer you the best we can and now i've learned that that's actually quite important um in this process but as a first time first time going through it i didn't know how to wait that you also gave me some good advice which was you were like tell them everything tell them up front all the reasons that they shouldn't buy you all the skeletons in the closet drag them out once okay not the very first meeting but like once they're interested and it's getting to where like hey we're going to make an offer um or we're making an offer say before we do that i'm gonna literally brainstorm and try to figure out every reason why i think you maybe shouldn't do this deal and um you know hey we don't have our ducks in a row on this um this is an unknown this is like a contract dispute we're in but whatever they may be right you have to drag those out and basically let somebody run away then because it is far less painful and less wasteful to let them run away then they're gonna find it out no deal closes without the finding anyway so they're gonna find it out no matter what your instinct is oh don't tell them that's that's always the first time entrepreneur's instinct that was my instinct the first time and then i somebody gave me this advice you gave it to me also which was no no no don't do that um just tell them what's great what's bad about your business you're gonna get in bed together they need to know both sides of it and if you lie you're getting sued anyway like you're yeah you definitely can't lie you definitely can't lie that's obvious but you can't even just hope they don't see it or don't find it because they're gonna see it or find it and you and then they're gonna say and they'll say uh what the what else yeah yeah and so it was actually a mega trust builder to do that um you know when we sold the the first company so those are some of the things that you kind of only learn through these deals you don't you don't learn that except through either experience or talking with people who are experienced so anyways that's my rant on deal doulas it's i think a very underrated thing we went we've covered it all we've this has been a this has been a roller coaster dude there was a comment on youtube about a guy unsubscribing he goes ah i'm unsubscribing last few episodes haven't been great i replied i said good yeah you said good some other guy was like man what are you talking about these guys are trying to i said over my dead body i am now i now work for you you know big booty three five seven on youtube i now work for you i dude what one guy motivated beyond belief to come with the fire every time one guy wrote these guys are great comma overall and i was like oh that's a good day you got me that's that's great that's an amazing one the um it's remember petty court it's petty court and court is in session uh that's how i feel when i read the youtube comments yeah that that was a good one the comments are actually quite good you had such a funny um such a funny joke in a group chat where it was the the no offense thing and then yeah yeah you're an an idiot with all due respect respect you're an ugly dude with all due respect yeah it's like when people start sentences saying i'm not racist but uh it's like oh okay the other thing that i hate you're a dumbass no offense yeah the other thing i hate when people say is well as at least he's honest i'm like what but his honest opinion sucks i don't care if he's honest like i don't he's a he's a straight shooter it's like you're shooting though yeah yeah like you're straight shooter yeah but what you say is stupid and i just you know what i mean it's like dumb i hate it i i've always hated that excuse oh man good times all right we're out you
