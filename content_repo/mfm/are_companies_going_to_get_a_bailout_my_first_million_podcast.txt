one really interesting thing that's happening is what does this mean for various businesses what does this mean for the overall economy and i'm not going to pretend to be an expert i don't know what's going to happen probably nobody does but there's definitely better people than me are predicting so let me just put out put that out there from the beginning but i will say some of the interesting things that i've been reading and i'll share that with you guys and then if you know more great keep going beyond that so the first is the prospect of bailouts so there's all these different industries cruise lines airlines hotels casinos movie theaters sports leagues that are not going to survive this thing or they're going to have a lot of trouble because we're not like two weeks away from this ending the i think the new york governor came out today and predicted that they said that the curve looks like in 45 days this is going to peak so a month and a half the patient curve peaks and that's just the peak it still has to sort of decline all the way back to normal from there so a month and a half from now um that's when they're projecting this so all these businesses are having trouble and a lot of people believe that we're going to have to do a bailout of the airline industry hotel industry casino industry what do you think about that well i'll i have two points the first is bailout um i'm conflicted i'm i'm relatively i don't know i'm not hardcore but i'm right of center in terms of capitalism where i'm like let the weak go down and let the strong get stronger it's really hard i i don't know i haven't made my opinion yet because i was very much against a lot of socialist stuff and then when i see our our our rich country hurting and there are people that can help us i'm like man what do we do here so right i i i'm i'm i'm i'm having to reflect on my beliefs and this is uh changing them and so there's there's two interesting things going on so the first is what i call the blue collar bailout so i i tweeted this uh two days ago i said i think we're going to need a blue collar bailout which is a lot of people who go to jobs retail jobs uh they work in these casinos they work on these cruise ships they work in the stadiums whatever they're not going to be able to withstand being out of work for a month or two months or whatever and um that's going to really hurt the economy because it's a huge percentage of you know citizens in the country i said we've seen bailouts when it comes to big car companies energy companies but we've never seen a blue collar bailout banks um you know the government rushes to help the sort of institutions that are deeply tied in with them but will they help the constituents and today for the first time they discuss um you know a potential stipend that they'll give out i think a thousand dollars sort of andrew yang style trump trump and his uh crew talked today about doing that so i think that's very interesting it's 850 billion i think that's what it would cost i think well it was he's they're discussing 850 billion dollar uh stimulus package for regular people yeah and so i think they're going to have to do something like this otherwise too many people are going to dip into the poverty cycle and once you sort of once you get on that track it's just very hard to get out it's like being on the wrong end of a game of tetherball and the other person is just hitting it just out of your reach and it's just getting tighter and tighter so i think they're going to need to do that you you you you
