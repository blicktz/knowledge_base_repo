for a lot of companies like it could be like we work or instacart these things that are uber these things that are really large it's they're very simple concepts and they're not that hard to execute but what's really hard is controlling your emotions that's that that that's incredibly challenging and what i've learned throughout the years through paying a lot of money for therapy and coaching and reading is that the majority of of both good and bad behavior that you have now it started back in childhood and so what i tell people and what i've learned and what i tell myself is if you just study your childhood you're going to learn a lot about why you are reacting to certain things and i remember being a kid i was i was only four or five years old and this is just an example of what of how things that happen when you're when you're a kid a lot of times you don't even realize it but it actually sticks sticks with you i remember when i was a kid and i was at a we were at like a bar or restaurant or something with my family and my father was drinking it must have been like a jack and coke or something and i remember he ordered this glass and i saw him get the straw and take it out and i was like why are you doing that dad i was a little kid he goes and he just made some comment no big deal he's like oh men don't drink with straws and he didn't even think twice he was just joking or i don't know he just said that because he meant like he was saying like men don't use like dainty straws when they're drinking alcoholic drinks and my whole life i never used a straw and it wasn't until i was older when i realized oh he was first of all probably he was just he just made some off-handed comment he didn't even think about it and second of all he was referring to alcohol and so for my whole life when i went to mcdonald's or a fast food restaurant as a kid i would never i would always pull the straw out of the drink and that's an example of how little things happen when you're young and sometimes you notice them and sometimes you don't but they entirely shape how you behave as an adult and i think it's very important to study your childhood and to study how you were raised trauma that happened when you're young because as you grow a company all of those all of those things that that happen to you they become magnified so good things and bad things uh both 10x as you get more people and as you get a little bit more successful and the way you react to things the way you the way you gauge risk the way that you react to people doing what you said or them not doing what you said the way you trust people a lot of that stems from how you were raised and things that happened to you as a kid and so what i do is i i have a therapist so i've gone to therapy every week for maybe 10 years and i've had to work through a lot of interesting things but i think it's quite common that people have the same issues that i have but going to therapy is incredibly important or at least it has been for me and the other thing that i've did is i have a ceo coach that has helped a ton it's pretty much like therapy but it's all related to your job but like you really talk about all types of relationships girlfriends wives boyfriends husbands father mother i mean you talk about all this stuff co-workers and so that has been incredibly helpful for me and so the things that have made a massive impact the resources that that have made a massive impact are i use torch so torch.io that's my that's my coach um we pay him uh his name's peter we pay him a monthly fee and myself and adam the president of our company go to him and it's been wonderful the second thing is the body keeps the score it's a great book on dealing with trauma now trauma a lot of times people think that means soldiers who are in war and who saw people die and their best friends and they're dealing with ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder but the reality is a lot of people can go have that so whether you your parents or your siblings or someone in your life was abusive to you as a kid or it could be you just got really scared you saw something that was pretty wild it could be when i lived in missouri when i grew up i remember being in uh fourth grade and seeing 9 11 and it could be it's it's a could be relatively small but that made a massive difference on me and that was a small indicator or a small example of trauma and that shapes how you feel and so what the body keeps the score does is it teaches you how to recognize when you've experienced a little bit of trauma or a lot of bit of trauma trauma and how to deal with it and so that's a great book you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
