okay this idea is called milo again okay what is milo so milo is a company that got started back in the day that a guy who came on the pod jack abraham started yeah and what milo did was a very simple thing milo said if you if you said oh i need to go buy scotch tape it would say you would just type it it was a search engine for finding where you can go buy a specific product in person so you'd be like i want to buy uh you know whatever like um whatever phillips razor or something like that you just type it in and it would be like it's in stock at this target near you so it took where you are and then it knew all the store's inventory and it just told you if the product's in stock right there and like there's like the world is moving towards e-commerce yes but there's still like a a very healthy slice of people that go shop in real stores and or they want something now today and they don't want to wait for it to be delivered in an x amount of time and so this idea milo milo got bought by ebay for like 75 million after like a couple years and then it kind of like you know like many acquisitions just sort of faded away and disappeared inside of ebay but this idea is still a great idea dude i completely agree man i tried buying something the other day like some chairs or something and i had to go to like eight different like home depot.com tractorsupply.com lowes.com walmart.com even when you go you're seeing the generic thing you're not seeing like you're saying like those home depot carry this okay yeah now let's go to store locator type in my thing it sucks and then i have to go to each one and do that and it's like socks i completely i needed kids cough medicine and i was like dude i just need to know do you have kids robitessim or not and then like usually like cvs or home depot or whatever they you type something in and they're like this isn't near you and it's like oh well because up here it says my zip code is like you know eight hours away when i was on vacation you don't have like an easy way where it's just like search you know what i mean uh it's i completely agree it takes forever and i was trying to do this the other day it's a pain in the back pain in the ass i was using google shopping but it's not easy exactly and i know it's also hard to build right because you have to have like real-time inventory of physical stores yeah but that's not that hard if you go to target and ask for like a vacuum you they go to target.com and like type in like that vacuum to figure out where it is in the store right so it's in some system so you need to build like integrations with like the major back-end inventory systems in order to be able to do this and you have a really strong reason why they should give you that access it's like hey dude i'm going to send you a customer like i'm going to send you foot traffic to your store like is there anything a store wants more than foot traffic to the store i don't think so so you know like to me milo is an idea and by the way this just general thing which is companies that go get that get acquired and then like kind of like dissolve in the big company just go restart those companies like three years later yeah i actually think that's a really fantastic idea that's one of so that business model i have said that i hate the advertising business model i don't entirely hate it but i do hate that when you're a publisher and you have to say stuff that you don't really want to because of an advertiser but and so i don't love that model but i love non-publishing business advertising models because it's the perfect alignment so basically with milo you have a site that gets lots of traffic and then you allow someone to pay money for a per click or a per view basis and it's very fair it's the easiest sales process i think i'm all about that right uh okay i got some more random ideas these ideas by the way they're a little bit more like the tipsy the drunk ideas the uh so this might be another drunk idea segment i might have to take a fake shot here and we might do drunk ideas because these are these are you know very very loose no milo again is all right good bad ideas are bad ideas but they're the good version like i'm giving you a good bad idea did have you ever asked did you ever ask that guy jack uh what he if you could we could just email him and be like is this cool it was it would this work again oh no i didn't ask him yeah we should ask him we'll see what he says but also that people should know this when a founder goes into a space they can tell you a lot of things about it but they have so much scar tissue about that space that they will always tell you like nine times out of ten i should say nine times out of ten they're going to tell you don't do it because they have trauma and like you shouldn't necessarily listen to the don't do it you should listen to all the reasons why they say don't do it and then assess are those still true or do i have a compelling reason why those are no longer true um but yeah we should we should ask all right so here's my here's drunk idea number two all right you're um you take zoom calls right yeah you get a pulse yeah what's the experience like okay let's say you had a meeting with me before the era of zoom we were meeting in person you come to my office for a meeting what's that experience like while you're waiting for that meeting and just in the three minutes before the meeting what what do you get so lately nothing but i recently did something where they had an ad on zoom and i thought that was intriguing no no in real life what do you get what's the best version of a real life before your meeting you show up at the building you've done this water yeah water famous new york bougie places you've been there when someone attractive greets you they ask you if you need anything to drink they give you the drink that you have a seat you look around they got art everywhere you start to feel like wow this company's pretty cool huh like yeah oh look at that they got that wall over there with all the like cool you know little hand awards that they want yeah you know like i went to one the other day and the bathroom sign oh by the way there's another drunk idea but this is coming next coming next drunk idea the bathroom sign of this thing was uh it didn't say men it said batman and they had like a cape on the guy little silhouette and i was like oh these guys they like to have a good time these guys got a great sense of humor so i got all this all this information all this persuasion before i even went into the meeting which where which office is this i can't say but we um but zoom needs this zoom needs a waiting room experience this is a feature for some product manager at zoom we need a dope waiting room experience or even even it can be built off zoom right there's like whatever a trillion zoom calls a day give me a dope waiting room where i can send somebody that's connected to the zoom call and then when they're ready they can come in but before that they get a branded they get a branded experience a virtual office a virtual vibe of who they're dealing with what that person's all about and uh create a little a little website a little website space for them to to hang out and have some fun have a drink enjoy themselves i did this call with a company i forget what they're making maybe they're making a game and i logged in and i was like a little bit early and they had like a teaser video like a one minute long teaser video and because they were the host of the zoom it automatically played and so when i got to have the meeting i was like pretty psyched up yeah i was psyched up it was awesome it was really cool and it almost felt like they were like it i was like is this what is this new feature is this was that an ad that you paid zoom to play and they're like no they have this new feature where they allow you to show like an amp up video like a video prior to the meeting starting and it was really cool but dude how about the fact that zoom has been we've been in a pandemic for three or two years and it's like the same shit over and over and over again yeah no features and the stock cut in half what's going on yeah this is not good i'm more mad about one of those than the other i'll let them figure out which is actually bothering me and there's so many people that go to that uh landing page where it says like click here to open up zoom and it's just a blank yeah it's a blank page there's so much real estate there i get there when i've already clicked a zoom link guess what i do want to open zoom you didn't have to re-ask me dude yes means yes zoom on similar web zoom.com gets 1.7 billion visits a month and it's the 26th most popular website in the world and that page is just this blank page i cannot believe that they can make maybe hundreds of millions of dollars a year just in like an ad just like the new batman movie needs to play like a 15 second trailer to everybody today like that's what that's what needs to happen for real i do think that that's like so much wasted space yeah i'm i'm more in the meeting room the waiting room bucket i want you to be able to like say something about who you are by showing what you know you can decorate it you can put your little drinks they're a little interactive thing you can play jenga you can do whatever you want right like make it make it cool all right so that's one idea the second one is what i teased a second ago it's called i don't have a personality give me one or i'm not funny make me funny it's a it's a store like spencer's back in the day remember spencer's or what i just went to hot topic i just went to one the other day yeah it's awesome all right that's the actual joke for me and sarah we had like a date night on friday and we're like you want to go walk around the mall and go to the food court so we did and it was awesome date night that's awesome it was awesome man it was so much fun so spencer's is still a thing yes and hot topic we went to both of them and this shirt that i'm got that i'm wearing i bought it from abercrombie dude abercrombie's cool right now i believe you i believe you um so my idea is it's the b2b version of spencer's so it's just shit for you to put around the office that's gonna make your office more fun and interesting i think we should workshop that name a little bit though what was your name i don't have a personality please give me one yeah maybe there's an acronym in there yeah like we want like it needs to be a word that's like botox but it's for injecting personality into your company instead of like filler into your like lips so so basically what this is botox for your company what it's going to do is it takes all the common items of a office of any office so bathroom door plaque you know the bathroom door signs uh the exit sign the emergency exit sign meeting room things little chashkis on the table for meetings um you know like your welcome desk sign in mat and and and like little bell you know like it's just all items like that and then it'll make you seem like the fun interesting version of your company because we just have the we take the common and we do it uncommonly and that's what we do here we used to have this exit sign do you remember this we had this exit sign at the dojo where over the exit side someone wrote ipo because that was that was like that was the goal the the goal exit was an ipo so we had an ipo sign instead of an exit sign uh it was pretty awesome but uh i completely agree yeah like this could be toilet paper opportunity opportunity in that toilet paper roll there's an opportunity in the bathroom mirrors there's opportunity everywhere in your office to demonstrate a little personality one time when i went to vayner media they had vayner branded bottles of water it was awesome and i still remember it stuck out have you been to a company that has a head of their own branded bottles it was just no but i also i don't feel like i would have thought that was awesome why do you think that was so awesome was the label like just looked amazing or something i just it was weird i thought it was cool it was quirky it stood out it was just a i mean it was just a normal cheap costco bottle of water and somehow some company they probably paid a quarter per bottle and they just wrapped it just had their label on it i thought it was neat i remember when i went to twitch for the first time when we were trying to sell the company and they were like you want anything to drink you know here's the little fridge and i opened up there was a it was my first time ever seeing boxed water and so i was like huh boxed water fun i got that was like their gimmick and i was like that's cool i picked it up you ever drank boxed water tastes nasty by the way does taste good tastes disgusting and also you're drinking from the old school like milk carton yeah it's like drinking orange it's like drinking orange juice out of like a thermo like a metal thermos it just doesn't taste good it doesn't doesn't taste right and then it doesn't even look right or feel right so now i'm in this meeting trying to sell my company biggest day of my life and i'm like a toddler drinking from this like carton of water and like the thing was just getting all wet and disintegrating and i was like oh god like do you have a do you have like a dumpster i can go throw this away in because it doesn't fit in any normal trash can it's like a paper straw all right here's my next drunk idea um sean's like fuck them turtles choke on these i don't want to choke myself to save the turtles that's what was happening with the boxed water i have moved straight to the end so the the next one is i don't know what i need to call this i need a catchy name i'm gonna call it um discord property managers because i can't think of a name okay so basically there's a ton of discords out there now basically this is like community managers is a job title right a lot of people have communities communities are all the rage now and there's a ton of discords especially in the crypto world there's a ton of discords they're so hard to figure out that are just like noisy they're spammers and scammers and then there's new people coming in they never use discord and never use crypto this is a confusion all around i think somebody should build the best property management company for your discords just be like dude we are the best at managing discords and we will manage your discord for this flat fee and just build a brand around being an amazing property manager for your digital property for your digital spaces that's a great idea so vayner media who we'll talk about them again when they started their whole thing was like social media is new we're like the guys you know we know how to handle it and basically most of their job titles were called community managers or early on a popular job title at their company was a community manager we basically just meant we'll comment on everyone's comment uh you know if you're uh right oreos and someone like makes a comment on about oreos we just reply and i actually think that you and they got big that way i bet you vander media makes 200 plus million in revenue it's a big ass company and you do the exact same thing but now the new community or the new social is community and i think that you've got you know david spinks yeah of course he was he was it was way early he was just early dude he just if he started that like two years ago instead of seven years ago that would be like a hundred million dollar company right now and uh he was just a little too early he was early make it all the way so david spinks had this company called cmx summit it originally was a conference for community managers then it was like an online community and everything and he sold it i don't even remember who the big idea was like you have a you have a ceo then you have a cto they handle they're they're in charge of the technical part of things you have a cio they're the chief information officer cso cmo for marketing so you have all these c-suites and that his belief was that community is going to be a big part of companies and so you're going to have a cxo i think it was the thing they were going for which is like a a chief community officer or some like that i don't know why it was x cmx i don't know what they were trying to do but like basically it was this is going to be a job title at the c-suite level and then you're going to have then like a senior community manager and then like a junior community manager and like there's a whole new job function and he was right don't know how to do it and he was totally right and totally early which is the same thing as being totally wrong and that's what sucks yeah he was totally right and totally uh early i completely agree uh he was on that like it felt like 10 years ago yeah but i think this is a good idea it would be a pain in the butt to run an agency but i think this is an agency that could crush let me give you uh okay can i give you two ideas so there's a guy i'm gonna these are these are 100 stolen from another podcast i heard so i listen to bill simmons podcast sports podcast and bill has his buddy kevin wild or wilds something that he comes on and he does half-baked ideas what's and he is he is like we need to get him on this pod because his half-baked ideas are like he does drunk ideas and he's been doing this for years and it's just a running bit this guy he only comes on like twice a year but when he does he's got these amazing ones so can i give you yeah the two most recent ones he did and he's by the way he's amazing at pitching them he's even better than me at pitching these these drunk ideas all right so first one is called fit furniture okay fit furniture you might be wondering what is what is fit furniture been hearing a lot about it lately do we make the highest quality furniture no we do not do we have the best prices sure don't do we have furniture that fits through doorways you bet your ass we do because moving furniture is a requirement of furniture and all furniture is built as if everybody's home has just open walls that you could just drag these things through so fit furniture is furniture optimized to fit through the standard doorway width that's you know do you know uh love sack you remember love sack yeah of course so they're huge beanbags right yeah but their new shtick is furniture that fits through a door it's modular oh my god it's a it's a it's a couch that you take apart and i i try so at my airbnb the way it works these guys are idiots they put a spiral staircase going up and you on the second floor and that's the only stairs and you can't carry anything up a spiral staircase so i was like i can't get a couch unless i can take it apart uh and there was this company in texas and they're the couch guys and they take apart your couch just for this problem they take the whole thing apart and they rebuild it wherever you want it and i was like all right well i can't do that so i looked at i i looked at love because it's an airbnb i don't want a fancy couch i looked at love sack they're interesting but it's like three grand for one of their couches or four grand for one of the couches so i ended up going with a futon because i could build a futon upstairs but uh dude it was such a pain finding a couch that could fit into certain doorways that wasn't like over five thousand dollars i completely agree if you want to pay five star prices for that college experience sam's short-term rental scotch covered sleep on a futon well so the stars no we don't call it a futon because if we call it a pull-out couch because it's like crazy comfortable it's basically like a mattress that you can sit on sometimes but uh yeah i didn't i was embarrassed to call people i was embarrassed to call it a futon that's for sure that was your nickname in college right the pull-out yeah all right let me give you a second idea his second idea is called bulletin board material so this is for this for i think this is for you i think you are the target market for this so it's for somebody somebody who you got a little chip on your shoulder and you like it it's that chip on your shoulder has made you who you are there would be no hustle if there weren't any doubters dude they say skeptics chips on shoulders create chips in pockets exactly but what happens if you you grew up around nice people you don't have a chip on your shoulder or maybe you had that chip sold the hustle and now everybody tells you you're so great you don't know or you are so unlucky that you had a healthy father and a healthy mother who treated you well like you don't like me right you can do anything that's such a disadvantage because i grew up in an emotion emotionally healthy household the biggest disadvantage there is the biggest with money we help solve that problem we are for the healthy middle class family who has lost their edge and what bulletin board material is it is haters as a service and so what we do is we go and find the people oh my first person would love the podcast every day people love the podcast but guess what in some corners of the internet there's people who hate this podcast and so what haters as a service does is it compiles that information and it takes out the real toxic stuff that's gonna you know give you nightmares at night so there's some filtering and it just drips to you a little motivation every week that just reminds you that some people believe you can't do it that some people say you're not so prepared for this podcast some people say sean your camera's not working and you know you got to get that sorted and so it just gives you that healthy dose of haterade it's like we be your best and we just hire a bunch of immigrant mothers who children are grown and they have some free time and they're like well you know your brother's a doctor sean you know exactly i actually know two women who could run the service single-handedly i'm not gonna name any names they can serve thousands of customers well you're not you know it's not too late to go back to school yeah so haters as a service uh what do you think of that idea yeah yeah i'm down we'll just call it like it has to it just you're just nagging people all day yeah exactly uh and it's immigrant mom.com yeah yeah live like an immigrant yeah there's a reason why immigrants are always the best immigrant mentality.com um all right yeah those are those are my drunk ideas you got any drunk ideas i feel like um i'm not creative like you all my ideas are just like legitimate money making ideas you know it's hard for me to come up with bad ideas how do you do it yeah i'm like the lady gaga of ideas there are no deep hits or there's no deep tracks hits only all right that's it that's the episode you
