i want to give you feedback that i got from from listeners sean you ready am i prepared for this is this harsh critical feedback i need to okay great no okay so what i'm noticing with this podcast is we have a similar amount of views each week and i think it's the same people over and over i think we're like part of people's routine which is cool um and the i think that one of the secrets to growing a podcast is you have to have guests so when we had andrew he shared it so all the people who like him came and listened and i hope we've got them hooked and they're going to listen from now on and so the way that we're going to do this is we're just going to get more guests but here's what people keep telling me and this they weren't saying this about andrew but they like it when it's just you and i riffing it and just making shit up on the fly yeah yeah i i've felt that and i think it's even more on these zoom calls because the zoom call pace is a little slower when we're in person it's a little bit better i think to have that third guest on the seat and uh it definitely depends their guests got to bring that bring the energy you can't just be successful and smart that is not enough you have to bring energy you got to know what people want to hear about and get to the point and so you know that's the the rubric for guests which is hard when you're also trying to find famous guests because they help the show grow and just for the record sean and i have recorded with i think we've done a bunch of times i personally have done it a bunch of times and it was wonderful people who i like and it just turned out to be bad and we just don't publish yeah we throw it away and we don't even tell them we just throw it away yeah and i've done it a couple times like for throughout the years for whatever i don't even remember what i was recording stuff for i've interviewed someone who was like an amazing operator and the content was whack and i'm like no trash um exactly and so anyway the feedback that we're getting son is that people like us because they say that i'm more optimist and you're more uh like down to earth and uh that we riff and they love that and that they can't get that anywhere but you and i are like let's go get more guests and people don't like the guests but unfortunately that helps us grow yeah well we'll keep mixing it in uh dude i had a call yesterday that i was like if i had just recorded this this would have been like one of the dopest podcasts ever it was just me and furcon we have a call every once a week now that's just called cool shit and he lives in like the edge of like technology he's like in the dark web basically not in a legal way but sort of like he's on the forefront of what's interesting he's just like a he's just a nerd he's just like a very typical silicon valley engineer just yeah nerd he knows how to touch a reality in a good way he knows me well enough and also he loves money enough where he knows how to take that stuff and bubble up the the bits that are interesting the bits that are relevant and not just get lost in the weeds of technology so uh that combo was amazing but unfortunately i didn't record the other thing i was going to say about the guests is um being guests on other people's podcasts is the other way to grow so i had ishan let yesterday reach out to like 50 podcasts and just be like hey i'll go on and talk about it right like i'll go on i just sold my company i can go on and talk about that hey we built a podcast that did a million downloads in the first six months we could talk about how we did that and um so i think guesting on other people's podcasts might be a good way you did this with gary v with pomp uh yeah i've probably so there's a caveat there i've i've probably been a guest a hundred times and uh there was a period like over the trailing six months i have it set on my calendar from three o'clock to five o'clock that's only guessing on podcasts and um i would do it and some of the small ones just drove nothing right like it was total hit or miss and so i would spend like three weeks doing it and it's almost like and you probably like this it's like being the comedian you just say the same shit over and over and you kind of figure out what hits and it's fun it's almost like therapy you just talk about yourself it's cool but uh it definitely gets a little repetitive and it the results are not always there but they are sometimes yeah and you know the thing you said at the beginning which is um for podcasting you get this base and it's the sticky sticky base of people who want to who who listen to it all the time it becomes a part of their routine they start to really love you that sort of thing it's very different than other products i built where i'm like all right i want to get millions of users to just visit this page or like just use this once a week or subscribe to this and kind of forget about it like that's been a lot of the products i built this is the opposite it's like an army of a hundred thousand people who will like go to war for you i think there's people in this group that would if i said hey i need you to beat this person up they would go beat that person up like there's people who really have your back and when i started this i remember i was talking to sully who's the very first guest on the pod and he was like you know what are you thinking next you just sold the company and i was like you know i really like this podcast thing he goes okay like is that a business like in some ways it's a step down right it's like i'm gonna make way less doing this than i did my last business or any other business i want to do and i was like look i want to just be in like a million people's ear balls every morning if i did that i just know that that's a good thing and i don't know how to get there but i'm going to do that i'm going to get into a million people's ear balls every morning on their way to work and the way to work i think that's powerful yeah i mean it may or may not be a business but it definitely will lead to way more opportunity i've had a lot of i mean i've been doing the content thing a little bit like before the podcast so i kind of understand it but the podcast definitely is different um i remember i went to new york and i just tweeted i was like i'm we're gonna be over i'm gonna be over here because i was there for a hustle advertising crap and i just tweeted i was like yeah i want to be here i had 200 people want to come and so we only let maybe 20 come and because we're in people's ears dude like these people this kid ryan said something to me and he's like yeah you know because you said how much you like this thing and i was like i don't remember what you're talking about and like they think they know you and it's funny and you know the other thing i like is that people are the people who listen this are actually pretty they're really smart and successful you know i think a lot of podcasts that are about business they cater to kind of lowest common denominator so it's like oh the wantrepreneur is their core market and you know in our facebook group for this podcast i posted something saying hey i'm doing something cool for people who have a business that does over a million dollars a year and there's like 100 plus replies just in that facebook group people who have businesses doing over a million dollars a year right so these are not like kind of like the wantrepreneur who's you know at their nine-to-five job or a college kid or something like that like of course there are people like that but the audience also is mixed with a lot of interesting successful people there's a bunch of vcs that listen to this it's crazy um so anyways enough about the podcast let's give people some uh some other topics or ideas you you
