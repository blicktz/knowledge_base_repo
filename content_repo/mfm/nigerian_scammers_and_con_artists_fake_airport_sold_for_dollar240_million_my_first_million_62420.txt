it's like you know martin luther king's one of my heroes but he also cheated on his wife a lot uh i was saying i talked to this lady i met her at a conference and she worked uh for google but or like the thing inside of google uh what what's it called google labs or something x x and she told me about these like businesses that they've launched where they'll do like 100 million in revenue or something but they're like it's too small like it won't move the needle they just really yeah that's surprising um i i i i don't believe that i'd love to hear which ones of these projects that they had done she told me that um she's like it's like we don't know how big it can get so we're just gonna kill it and she also said that they had a hard time finding leaders because the people who they would have were people who had started companies in the past and they just paid them so much at google that they were like like i don't go i don't care yeah there's a pretty cool story about uh have you heard about the cisco spin out spin in model no so so a lot of companies try to do these like innovation labs innovation arms innovation blah blah blah you know just a lot of it's just like kind of pr puff but the companies genuinely they do want to innovate right why would they not um but it's really hard for them and cisco is one of the few companies that's done this really well where they have incubated and they do what they call spin out spin in uh multiple businesses that have been worth over a billion dollars to cisco and um so i was like how the hell do they do that and what they have is they have this little group of i think four people who have now since left but they have this group of four that were there for god knows how many years 15 20 years something like that and they called them some nickname i don't know i'm gonna make it up called the m group or something like that it's like the m team and what they would do is they would have some idea or they would uh either that team would have an idea or the company would have an idea and they would spin out this group so they were their own company they would get their own little office they would build this product they would they would build it up and cisco would have the right to just rebuy it for like 500 million dollars whenever they're ready um whenever whenever they view it's ready and so there's a whole bunch uh and so that same team did this three or four times uh that same group of four or five people they went out built the thing spun back in and they did it again and again and then now they've actually left and that group of people i think they're just doing their own thing but um if you want to look it up i should have looked it up before this but i didn't know we were going to talk about it but who's on that cap table uh i think it's just those four people and cisco itself or something like that i don't know how i don't know exactly how it works starting companies with a buyer in mind with well you are though you have the right to buy i have the right to buy back um which is an interesting strategy i vc i forget who it was and he's like i don't really i typically don't invest in companies when they like have like an exit plan in mind like because i want them to because i think that then they're not in it for the right reasons but he goes he goes one time i did do that i invested in this guy and he said this company is going to buy us probably in 36 months because we're going to build something they can't build and i'm going to operate fast with them and it ended up becoming true right all right so here's the article business insider article why cisco showered these three men with billions and uh of course it's like behind a paywall but um who are the guys do we know them prame somebody uh mario uh mazola and no i don't know them they're they're older they're older they're not sort of i don't think they're in sort of like the same scene that we we roll in but uh but yeah it worked for a while and then now they they stopped doing it i think some companies have tried to replicate it but it hasn't worked for them i'm not sure exactly why but you know if you could figure out how to help big companies innovate there's obviously a lot of money to be had there so um before we get into this i gotta ask the listeners and use something so jack our friend jack smith introduced me to this guy a few years ago and i don't even want to say what the service is yet but okay i think i could say a little bit there's a ride sharing service one of the ride sharing services and what this guy does is he ha i think this is how he does it i don't exactly know but you can buy discounted credits right so you know how i pay 20 bucks and i get 40 worth of rides have you done it so he showed it to me years ago right this was like i don't know how long two years ago maybe he showed it to us and i was like oh great i take rides all the time would love to then as i went through the website i was like is this like a a is this a scam i don't think so because jack said he's doing it he recommended it i've done it but then i was like is this gonna get my account banned like this is too good to be true so my skepticism went off i didn't do it i forgot about it and then he posted about it in the in our private my first million facebook group he said hey did you guys know about this is a really cool clever uh hack and system that this guy's created uh jack loves those things so tell me more about what's got your high here yeah so first of all sean turn your mic up just a little bit i think okay yeah say something hold on just a little right abreu he's gonna turn it up a little bit and put okay i turned it up is that better much better okay so he has this service now he's doing it for uh of similar things and okay so jack was like hey you should have this guy on the podcast and i'm like okay so pros this guy is a hustler he's doing amazing stuff and i i'm pretty sure i think he's either said it or i figured it out i'm pretty sure the way he does it this guy's in india i think what he does is he has a network of like thousands of teenagers and kids and he just gives them a first ride on on on a ride service and he gets the ten dollars back like in referral and then sells it either that he's gaming the it's it's not as far as i understand it's not like illegal there's no like sort of illicit hacking everything he just says hey they have a referral system which is cool you get a you know um every time you refer somebody you get a certain amount of credits and what he realizes he can do cheaper maybe shorter rides in india and that will count as a new customer that's been referred and so he can give you in the u.s uh you know your full credit for a a lightweight ride there and the arbitrage there's some money he keeps some money and we get a saving and then the ride the person who takes the ride gets a free ride so it's like a win-win-win for everybody but the service and to add to complexity if you pay with bitcoin you get a bigger discount which is what i've done and if you like do xyz like it's it's it looks incredibly shady long story short it's interesting it's a cool story it's definitely it's not a scam but it's questionable about the ethics and so do we want to promote this or not um yeah of course i it's not promoting it i am interested in this guy's story and i think a lot of people would be interested in it you can make your own judgment after you hear him out as to well we've been called out for promoting unethical behavior yeah but people will call you off or whatever i i don't think we're promoting anything it's one thing okay it's promoting if we say this is awesome go do this okay that's fair but that's an opinion right um but i think the right thing to do is to say hey here's somebody who's doing something interesting they're they found a way to hustle and create uh you know create a business for themselves as well as value for others um we should hear them out and then let people judge for themselves is this like past the gray area and and not not cool for them or is this actually like you know fine and so i think i think that's we should leave that up to the listener but our job is to tell the story and also i'm curious so why not have them on who cares capital j journalists all right well uh he's met he messaged you and i we'll we'll set it up um i don't even know if he speaks english well enough i guess we'll find out right yeah we'll find out we'll bring him on so i had some other of these um um these are more like actual scams but i wanted to talk about them i don't know why i wanted to just tell you some things that i've seen okay so um recently i don't know if you've seen on youtube or if it's just in my recommendations but all day every day there's a live stream of chamath palihapitiya who's kind of like a known investor early facebook guy billionaire um it's like chamath talking about bitcoin and it has always like 40 50 000 live viewers watching it at any given time and it says bitcoin giveaway chamath bitcoin giveaway and what they did so what someone's doing which is just totally a scam they have a stream going they have a video embedded of chamath talking about bitcoin from like five years ago it's not chamath doing this by the way he's trying to get it taken down and then on the screen it says bitcoin giveaway send me your address and i'll send bitcoin to somebody and i think they're just making money off the ad revenue of this live stream um and it has like 40 50 000 people i'm sure some of that's bot traffic and some of it is real traffic um but it's hilarious that somebody's doing this like a what a waste of time and b it's hilarious that youtube allows this chamath's trying to take it down uh but hey okay so that's one little thing i noticed here's another one um you know when the u.s government came out with the kind of ppp like hey if you're unemployed or you're an employer and you have people you can get access to money so um of course the nigerian sort of scammers came out and they actually took out a hundred million dollars from the system i don't know if you heard about this they just filed as either unemployed people or or employers of unemployed people uh or sorry employers who qualify for ppp the sort of nigerian scam ring it's called the uh what's it's called the 409 scam i think it's called is that the name of the program is that like the country code of it so a lot of these guys are based out of lagos nigeria i think and i think and i believe that they're there because for some reason it's part of i don't know how it got embedded into that particular culture where they're where they it became a thing but i think um i also think that there's uh not really strict laws around like there's a lot of loopholes and law that you can not get punished so this guy totally scammed uh or these these group of people scammed out a hundred million dollars uh out of the government out of the u.s government while the u.s government was giving away money for like in a really intense two week three week frenzy um abreu just linked some guy in from wikipedia emmanuel new day i don't know how you say his name but he um sold an airport for 240 million dollars he didn't own this airport he just sold it uh which is crazy um so there's that and then here's some other ones that i thought were interesting so you know super packs like the political um fundraising thing which sort of like gets around the normal uh donation limits for yeah it's like uh it's like a it's like they like form a company or a fund and you give money to the fund and that fund's allowed to to donate a larger larger quantity of money right so there's super packs for every cause so my uh my friend who's uh my friend jason had this hilarious idea uh he didn't do this but he was just like he's very politically minded and he hated super packs because he's like oh god like it's the super packs who get behind let's say the gun lobby or whoever that like fund these things that i don't agree with necessarily and i just think super packs are kind of shady there's lack of transparency blah blah and then he sort of had this idea of like if you can't beat up join him so he was like i know what i'll do and i thought this is a hilarious idea he's like for every issue i'm just gonna spin up two super packs one taking each side and i'm just gonna raise all the money i can for both sides and i'm gonna take a cut of both sides of it for every issue um he's like until they shut down super packs and i thought that was a hilarious way to fight super packs didn't uh do you remember at founders dojo where i used to work out of it was like this office that was kind of like ehrlich boxman on the tv show silicon valley i think dave did something like this where he created a a donation thing who was running trump versus obama uh trump versus hillary and he created like he like created something where he was like pledged support to hillary and then he also had a pledge of support for obama uh trump like he did both of those things yeah exactly there's all kinds of crazy stuff i don't know i don't know why i needed to bring up a bunch of fake scams what what's the wealthiest person who you know who got money off of like a shady way i gotta think about that do you have one i don't know if this is shady but i i have a bunch of friends that have made a lot of money like 30 40 50 million dollars off of what i consider to be borderline unethical internet marketing practices like for example people who have run call centers like you know how you get a phone call from like marriott hotels it's not really familiar it's like or you know uh if you i knew a guy who had a company hold on so it's not really from marriott and then what i don't know how the scam works i get the calls all the time but they'll say like you know you won this you won like it basically they're selling you travel packages like you were picked from a random drawing to get a discount on a all-exclusive trip to sandals so that's not unethical it's just obnoxious and then i know a guy who made a bunch of money off a co-registration company so like when you sign up uh on xpedia they sell your email address to 18 other travel stuff and he was the middle man and he made like 50 million dollars and bet it all on uh in the stock market and one big okay um the closest i the first thing that came to mind or the closest thing that came to mind i don't actually know this person but i i you know know know the guy's kid and and this is the dad um so this guy navine jane who oh i know him see of this thing called infospace back in the day and like during the dot-com boom infospace was like you know riding high and then you know sort of overnight infospace crashes but he had sort of sold out or you know protected his own interest right before the crash and was like you know everybody lost their jobs in their 401ks in the company and this guy was like a billionaire and um so that was sort of shady and then he started this thing called intellius after the fact uh i think that's the name of it yeah and it had a similar outcome uh yeah intellius is this like shady thing where you would sign up for a free credit check i think or it's like back you could find information from public records about people or about yourself uh i don't remember exactly what the what the product was because i don't spend too much time you know like thinking about this stuff but basically there was this tiny check box at the bottom which was like cool you got this free credit check but then we're going to charge you 20 bucks a month just kind of on subscription after that for blah blah some bullshit and so they were making millions and millions of dollars and people were all like wait what am i getting i just paid like 200 this year for intellius what does that mean what is this and people kind of screenshotted the flow and showed how like you know size four font the the fine print was that you're going to get charged for this thing um and so that was pretty bad yeah that guy claims to be a billionaire yeah exactly and he's a pretty like kind of crazy charismatic guy and he's now got this like company that's about going to the moon like a rockets company and all kinds of stuff but he's definitely you know behind that smile there's definitely like some skeletons or some baggage um like you know neither of those two two stories infospace or or i think it's called intellius um neither of those seemed like the most up and up companies well let's talk about some legit companies right after our podcast monday i went and bought a car on my trip so there you go you committed i love it uh if anything take take um take inspiration from the massive immediate action that that sam and hopefully me take whenever we say we're going to do something we just go commit and just do it right away yeah i uh like i made the decision saturday i bought a car monday i just went like i showed up to buy the car and i was like yeah i i guess i'll take that one and uh they're like how do you want to pay for it and i was like oh shit i didn't even think about it and they just took a debit card right um okay so so let's do some other companies or some other ideas uh that you got what else you got otherwise i have a couple we can do we did a ton of research that we didn't even get to last time so why don't you i i pull i have our sheet up why don't you kick it off all right so i'll do one uh so this one actually comes also from jack uh so this is sort of the jack episode he's the guest but we don't have him here um so he was talking a little bit about baseball cards and i know baseball cards are hot right now because gary v's been really pumping baseball cards to talk about baseball cards all the time and um so baseball cards are like a collector's item they hunt they have value they've they appreciate over time um it's you know like many many goods of that kind um now one thing that's a common problem for people who are buying selling and trading baseball cards is the actual receiving of the you know you receive a shipment you have to open it up you hope it's not damaged you have to verify that it's real and then if you sell it you got to sort of go through that whole shipping process right back to the other person hope that nothing goes wrong in the process and so for people who are collecting these as a sort of financial asset in some ways um and they don't they're not like sitting there trying to carry them with them to school or something like that you don't need the physical card he was saying why is there not sort of a central repository where you can like a like a like a safety deposit a fort knox for for the baseball cards where basically you buy and sell it online but it never moves it just sort of exchanges ownership but it's all stored in the central vault where it's cooled properly so they don't degrade they're all verified by a professional there who's centrally located you don't have to deal with any of the shipping costs or or potential issues there um so i think that's the headline the fort knox of baseball cards yeah so i think it's a pretty clever idea and obviously could extend to sneakers could extend to art could extend to other things maybe there's something like this that exists i don't do baseball cards or art do you dabble with any of this stuff um i got into shoes after i learned about them we wrote about it on trends about a year ago and i've since gotten into them yeah but not to the point of wanting to make money off of it but to the point of like spending 300 on a pair but i did do research on this and it seems as though there's not a great solution so jack's on to something we wrote about this actually um heritage auction house what i would do if i wanted to create this which i actually think this is a wonderful idea i don't i don't i certainly don't have time so i'm not going to but this is a great idea and what i would maybe do is contact a lot of the auction houses and be like what are you guys doing now right what why can't this work and or collectors you know high-end collectors people who have a portfolio of these things um because i think it is a very small it's a small it's a niche community obviously it's a small number of people you think well just just that's like a it depends on your reference point right so it's like in all of society yeah it's super niche but in terms like how many people do you think are actively investing in or trading baseball cards right like is it in the tens of thousands of thousands of thousands billions of people i'm saying like potential customers you have to convince to use your service hundreds of thousands hundreds of dollars okay that's interesting well i would bet it's i would bet it's lower um like and the reason why is like for there's always a long tail of really casual people but of people who actively do it and have like some you know above let's call it 250 worth of value um locked in it you know like shopify has like 50 000 ish or it did two years ago when i looked at this maybe it's a hundred thousand now power sellers uh etsy sort of in that same range twitch has like in the 50 000 ish uh partners sorry i don't think there's a hundred thousand sellers i think that there's a hundred thousand people who are interested in transacting in this market right right so i think you could get i think what my point is that the kind of circle of influence is pretty tight here where the number of people you would need to convince and that you could go learn from to see if this is a real problem is kind of small and that's great it's like kind of like online poker where you just go get these 15 pros to do something and now they sway the rest of the casual community with them as like oh yeah that's the best practice that's how we do things now it's pretty interesting and i i love it and i like it's i wonder i would have to imagine this has significantly better economics or maybe not in storage so do you know how the companies like clutter are doing i always assume that those companies are on the verge of failure now i don't know if they because and i think omni actually it's like everything's going great we keep raising money we keep adding high profile people and we shut down like that's how these companies tend to go or they they break out you know but do you know that public storage you know the company public storage storage is huge yeah it's the most profitable company uh on the stock market is that right by cool claim is that by margin so it like does four billion in revenue and like two billion in net income interesting yeah it's like the most profitable thing now they don't do what they don't do all this high cost shit that all the new startups do where they like want to bring you your stuff they just say like here's a room bring your stuff it's yours give us a hundred dollars a month um but it it could be a it's a really cool idea i that's my point and so also another thing i'm sure a lot of people know this but i was ignorant and i didn't know this but these storage companies they're real estate businesses yes um it's just a it's just a way to get profit to buy real estate a great book i read when i was in college that inspired me i was like on the verge of going down the real estate track rather than entrepreneurial track or the sort of startup track um and it's called confessions of a real estate entrepreneur it's an awesome book if you're a total noob and you're just curious about how the hell do people make money it's not about the terms and the tactics and all that stuff it's this one guy being like i wanted to make it real estate so then so he's like my first deal i had no money and i found this warehouse and then i negotiated this and he just walks through deal by deal for like 10 deals of confessions of a real estate entrepreneur and one of them was about storage and you know the whole game with real estate is you sort of need to see value where others don't so other people look at this 25 000 square foot store warehouse and they say okay warehouses are valued at x dollars per square foot so this building is worth y and what you need to say is hey if i subdivided this warehouse into tiny storage units and i add it all up now it's worth you know x plus y dollars per square foot is more it's worth more so i can go buy it i can actually pay more than the guy next to me because i'm gonna i know i can get more value out of it than that person can because i know how to change use or add value in some way that's what we work did they took office floors and say hey what if we subdivided it and rented this out by the desk and so that's like a common real estate strategy that's what storage units are and if anyone listening to this i think some people will get mad at me i don't give a fuck real estate has the highest ratio of rich and dumb people like right uh how do you what you know what i'm saying where it's like exactly what you're saying it's got the highest ratio of low iq rich people yes that's very true doesn't mean if you do real estate you're low iq it means there are more wealthy people in real estate who are not not superstar geniuses who you know work themselves normal just normal smart hardworking people right a normal smart rational person who uh obviously had some skills took some risks but there are more wealthy people in real estate that way if you just said hey sean you know in the next 10 years you die if you don't get wealthy i'd be like cool going to real estate like that's that's my best path my highest likelihood chance of becoming wealthy is through real estate versus any other sort of venture yeah it's that was the highest it's the highest dumb people to rich people job i've ever seen in my life i love it uh okay so that's my that's that's jack's uh jack's idea which is sort of fort knox for baseball cards i like it uh what else we got um let's go to uh are we gonna talk about hay did we talk about hay i don't think we did we didn't go for it um okay by the way this i look at what i'm drinking here i drink these all day heineken zero point zero it's called heineken zero it's not not it's not the same as non-alcoholic beer it's zero alcohol beer i've been drinking these all day they're awesome wait what do you mean it's not the same as non-alcoholic beer what's the difference i don't know the legality but the i drink a lot of non-alcoholic beer because i like beer the normal non-alcoholic beer says it has less than 0.5 alcohol this has 0.0 and heineken said that this is their fastest growing category and you like it i love it i i drink i'll drink four a day so what's in it that makes it taste does it taste like beer or it tastes like something else uh it's a it's a they call it a malt and yeast beverage it's a unique recipe it has zero percent alcohol is brewed with pure malt and special a yeast just like the original heineken lager beer um it has the same taste but without the alcohol that's hilarious they sell the same product with without the expensive ingredient and can charge the same for it so here let's give you less ingredients water malted barley hop extract and natural flavor that's all it is so oh man i love these uh i drink them like crazy um they're awesome okay um we apparently we did talk about hay a little bit but what did you want to talk about uh i just wanted to sort of call out the the sort of marketing side of things uh of what they do so have you read the book rework which is their the 37 signals book years ago but they basically say that like one of the marketing principles that they talk about is like to have an enemy right yeah i think there's a chapter called pick a fight um and i want to read it so let me see if i can pull it up real quick um hold on give me two seconds and i i don't know if you do this but um i do it all the time but here's the here's the like summary of the thing okay so should i should have pulled i should have pulled up my book before i did this hold on um okay so here's a section of it if you think a competitor sucks say so when you do that you'll find others who agree with you and rally to your side being the anti-blank is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers for example dunkin donuts positions itself as the anti-starbucks it it adds mock starbucks uh for using you know these fake italian words you know instead of just saying small medium large uh or they'll do a campaign like uh they made a site called dunkinbeatstarbucks.com where visitors can send e-cards with statements like friends don't let friends drink starbucks audi is another example it takes on the old guard of car manufacturers it puts old and old luxury brands like rolls royce and mercedes on notice by touting how it's a fresh alternative apple jabs at microsoft with ads that compare mac and pc owners um etc etc all these examples show the power and direction you can gain by having a target in your sights who do you want to take a shot at you can even pit yourself as the opponent of an entire industry dyson's airblade starts with the premise that the hand dryer industry itself is a failure and then tells it and then positions itself as faster more hygienic option i can't believe it's not butter puts the puts the enemy right in its own name having an enemy gives you a great story to tell your customers taking a stand always stands out people get stoked by conflict they take sides passions are ignited it's a good way to get people to take notice what do you think uh picking an enemy yeah i'm down i uh right now my enemy is the new york times a little bit and basically uh the media and people journalists who say they don't have a bias button like they can't admit they do um so yeah i'm i'm down with that and with hey.com i call it hey.com i think it's working well i think that um so they picked uh who i think initially they picked just traditional email like gmail as the enemy um for being like cluttered you just keep getting spammed by random things email you don't want it's a headache um you know pay for this it's better and now they picked apple and it was a way better fight to pick because it's a more novel story and it doesn't seem as self-serving as when they pick gmail as the competitor and i like that i actually like these guys a lot and so i'm going to talk about them a little bit but in general i really like them and i respect them but i do think that it's a little lame what they like some of these moves are a little bit lame because they also pick a fight with like main mainstream startups about giving equity when they're like make millions of these guys probably make 10 million 15 million a year in profit and they're very very wealthy and i feel like it's a little hypocritical um so they they um on twitter people are calling this beef marketing so just have a beef with everybody just to keep keeping your keep your name relevant and there's always going to be some people that agree with your side of the story so for example against the startup industry they are anti-vc don't take funding be profitable which is weird because they've taken funding from jeff bezos right but on the whole they they don't play this or they are profitable and they don't play these sort of uh raise to a b c d e like sort of get big big big big big ipo um so they picked that fight they picked the fight of you don't need to work 80 hours a week 30 is enough be productive just be smart don't kill yourself you don't have to be a workaholic the other day that they are working through the weekend to resolve all the issues right but i'm saying in general they i'm not saying these are correct i'm saying these are the fights that they they easily trigger people just like they triggered you just now then there's uh then they also do like they take summers off which is part of their kind of like don't be a workaholic thing um and they have one more which is sort of like don't depend on any platform um so like don't be don't be dependent on anybody and these five i get it and i like a lot of their philosophy i just think it's stupid when you make rules you know what i mean like when you make rules around something it's like dude not everything has a rule like a lot of times like you can't say that you are anti-vc i'm not anti-vc at all right i'm just like pro like let's be logical and let's look at a variety of options right but that doesn't sell right so so if you just looked at it in terms of like if they if you just said they're doing all of this for marketing purposes um if you if you believe that to be true then what they've done is incredibly effective it's sort of like buffer right maybe you don't agree that you should transparently put all your company salaries and revenue and and and losses out there publicly but if you look at it like marketing has been undeniably effective at marketing the company no i'm on board i think look uh it's working for them i just think that some of their opinions are bullshit but uh i like them a lot and i think that it's incredibly effective for them so why don't you pick more fights that was kind of my takeaway when i saw this i feel like you guys could do way more of this i think we should and so like let's come up with a game plan right now so i just picked a fight with a guy today did you see my twitter no i didn't what is it wait hold on one second got me yeah okay i'm looking at your twitter right now so you picked a fight with this two vd vldy is that the person yeah so what is this tell me what happened they copied my landing page they copied trends completely and i just they're full of um and i emailed them and told them to off and they like try to justify it i'm like no you're lying like i just looked you up on web archive you just copied our page like i see when we launched and then when you launched you right word for word ripped us off that's uh okay so you picked a fight with them but that's actually uh if you look at like what the rules are of this game that's actually a bad fight you don't pick a fight with people littler than you you gotta exactly so who should i what should i do you think well you said new york times so first i was thinking uh because you guys have as a competitor like uh morning brew right so like they pretty similar pretty they're kind of similar size and that's one that could be more like pewdiepie versus t-series where the feud actually would help both sides grow so that's more like wrestling where you could be like cool i'm gonna attack you you attack me this is just gonna generate a bunch of buzz it's sort of like the barstool color daddy thing where it's like both sides end up more popular and uh through the through the drama so like that's one that i think you guys could do the other one would be more like against the mainstream uh mainstream media which could be new york times now there has to be some level of authenticity to it um so it's got to be something you genuinely do believe like it could be the thing that like why are you guys pretending like you're not biased um but that doesn't tell a great story about you guys and what you do it's not that you guys are like it's not that the value prop of the hustle is to be opinionated clearly and be subjective not even try to be objective i don't think that's like what y'all do so i think you got to pick a fight that a makes sense b is polarizing uh and c somehow tells the story of what the hustle is all about by being the opposite of the thing you're hating on i thought about making fun of the skim because i think they're like a joke but then i was like i i don't know if i would win that fight yeah i don't know i think there's something here because i think in general you do have strong opinions about things um but i don't see that come through via the hustle maybe intentionally maybe maybe you've censored it maybe you haven't but i think you know i'm not in favor of censorship um how about this um let me let me let me a small tangent something that i'm we're testing and i'm thinking about launching is i'm pretty obsessed with the idea of expert opinion as opposed to journalist opinion and one thing i'm testing is i've built this network of like a thousand experts and every day we're emailing them stories and getting their opinion and we're going to just publish their opinion we're not going to touch it we're not going to edit it we're just going to say here's exactly what they said right and that's interesting to me and i'm going to get people to pay money for it yeah i think that's actually pretty dope um it's like a private twitter i saw the um like mock-up you guys did i didn't love that but i love the idea of this because when i think about it this actually what i care about i care about what do the people who actually know their shit think about this and not the journalists with their opinion the editor with their agenda the journalist talking to an expert and then like siphoning off one quote and having that be you know that fitting into some narrative i just like let's say it's the like right now the nba is about to resume and there's a big debate should they come back or should they not come back um some of the players don't want to come back because of coronavirus some of the players don't want to come back because it takes away from the black lives matter movement um and there's all these espn talking heads that talk about this like there's literally this guy brian windhorse who's like you know the opposite of a basketball player he's like a short fat white guy who's never played basketball and he's always talking about what should should happen what shouldn't happen and i'd rather just be like cool the the ping goes out to all the nba players and here's the 80 responses we got back lebron said this i don't know if it's anonymized or if it's with their name but that would be way more interesting to me it's like here's what they actually think yeah so that's what i'm thinking about building or that's what we're attempting to build and and in that case the enemy to me is clear it's just like journalism as a whole journalism because if you think about it like we don't need you everyone with a phone is a journalist and i hate when here i i hate the fact that journalists journalism is a circle jerk on twitter like they only want to impress each other they don't want to impress their audiences like you have to like what i tell our team i'm like guys we don't serve each other we serve our readers like we are their waiters we are their servants we exist to give them information um and my team who has worked at a variety of places are like well that's so different than other places because it's all about how do we win awards or how do we uh do this or that and i'm like yeah that baffles me that that is the thing so that's our enemy for that yeah okay i like that i think that could be good um cool pick a fight i like it okay i have another random idea or or thing to talk about so we both like this comedian chris d'elea and uh uh he was a funny guy we thought he was great the best i'll speak for myself yeah i don't know i don't know how you felt but we thought he was hilarious whatever he's a comedian i thought he was the best i've i've seen him live a couple times and um i listened to his podcast a bunch that's one of the few podcasts i listened to anyways last week gets exposed as sort of like a creep and so um bunch of people come out and say hey chris d'elea was messaging me when i was you know 17 16 years old um and asking me for nude pictures and all this bad stuff right so a whole bunch of people come out at once turns out chris d'elea is creeping around or allegedly creeping around and so this comes out he's sort of getting canceled right now um so two questions for you um or a question for you what was your reaction when that happened um and then i have an idea based on that my reaction was if uh i was even bummed that he was accused uh and the evidence was pretty damn strong and so i believe it to be true and in my head i think well fuck you like you're you're the worst so i feel pissed off because i i was a huge huge huge fan and uh i uh i don't know i'll still listen to his jokes but uh i will not like support him financially yeah so that was my other question well if you're listening to him you're still supporting him in some way i guess so but i don't know if i would pay money to go see him right so that's kind of my other question is uh and nobody really talks about this it's sort of like cool i'm a fan or you're canceled but i think in reality you know as so many people this is you know two of my favorite comedians louis ck and chris d'elea both came out to be doing really creepy messed up behavior but there's also people who are clearly still fans of louis ck they're probably not fans of what he did but they're still fans of him they'll still listen to his stuff they'll go to his shows and i was wondering how do you deal with that kind of like being torn between like well you don't like what they did and maybe you don't even like the person but you kind of like their art you know like i don't know do people still watch the show or whatever you know yeah i still watch the cosby show i listen to r kelly i love michael jackson music here's my logic right here's here with great people people who achieve greatness who are like world class at the craft are nine out of ten times fucking weird and hopefully only weird sometimes they're also bad people right and i just accept that like the people who i like are also good there's a great quote where it says like every great man's a bad man um and in this case it is incredibly true we're like he's with all this great stuff he just has also done a ton of bad shit so i still like will absolutely listen to his stuff but i won't uh i think he's a piece of shit right isn't that weird that's i i'm sort of in the same boat i don't know how to feel it's that's why i brought it up because i'm that's not weird i mean if you like surely like there's some like like i don't know i don't even like it in political but maybe like chick like chick-fil-a it's like dude my taste buds don't know that you hate gays right right right so it's like i can it's hard you know i could i could disagree with you but still enjoy your stuff right yeah and i think i mean with with all with all that's coming out um everybody's gonna have to figure out how they're gonna deal with this because your favorite something musician athlete comedian politician one of your favorites is gonna go down for being a total either asshole creep criminal bad guy you know something's gonna come out and um i think everybody's gonna have to ask themselves cool how am i gonna deal with that am i gonna still consume their stuff that i like or am i gonna protest it am i gonna think they're a piece of shit am i gonna be conflicted what's gonna happen it's like it's like you know martin luther king's one of my heroes but he also cheated on his wife a lot right or that's like the rumor um so it's like i had heard about that's really crazy apparently i just learned about this but like the fbi was tracking him for a while because he was seen as sort of like a potential enemy of the state and they like bugged his hotel rooms or whatever there's reportedly uh no one's seen this i guess but it's there's reportedly tapes of him sleeping with like 40 different women you know outside of his marriage um and participating in you know some sort of sexually deviant activities but he's martin luther freaking king right and he's got like you know a day a day named after him and everything else yeah so that's what my opinion is just like everyone who's great is also bad in another person's perspective and you just you just got to take the whole person right okay so the idea i had off this was actually um a wiki leaks for creeps because one of the things that was really disturbing that came out of this was not just oh this guy i thought was cool i liked turns out to be not so cool and i don't like what he did um but it was like a lot of these text messages were from like 10 plus years ago and so and same thing with like a lot of the people that get canceled like the bill cosby stuff a lot of that stuff i think was happening like in the 90s or something like that and it takes sometimes decades for the stuff to come out and i think that's a shame because you know a the person sort of gets away with it and continues to harm other people or sort of you know be a you know a menace in society is out on the loose as long as these things stay secret but i understand why people don't expose things because then they get tied up and wrapped up in it and you know you could see the girls who came out and said something about crystalia their twitter they're getting attacked by his fans who are like you know well why'd you why'd you send them the picture and like stupid stuff like that and so i think there needs to be sort of a wiki leaks for creeps um where there is a there is a way to dump anonymously uh evidence and claims against people and then there needs to be some sort of like verifying function like a set of journalists kind of like the people who went and studied the panama papers and like dug into it and try to figure out what's what's real what's not um but like a guaranteed sort of anonymity layer so that you know information can get out faster what do you think of that as long as there's a trustworthy third party to verify i'm into it it's just so easy to accuse people of doing bad stuff totally and that's the reason this can't be a company because you'll just die of sort of libel and slander you know like because anything that turns out not to be true you get just get sued out of existence i think there was like a a there was an app that used to rate guys i think it's called lola or lala i remember that this i remember that i uh my roommate was rated on it and it said like not so nice shit cheated on me and like small dick and i was like oh dude that sucks i was like i'm sorry right i mean that sucks um so yeah like i think you can't really do this as a company but i think for society it would be good if there's a way for people to be able to come forward about bad behavior better for a whistleblower network to come forward and not just about like how wikileaks is about sort of documents around certain things but actually around you know racism sexual harassment things like that i think there needs to be something like this and obviously i haven't put a lot of thought into this i'm not an expert about this stuff but when i saw that it takes 10 years to come out i'm like something's broken yeah it is crazy that like hannibal burris joked about that bill cosby thing and his joke was something like what everyone knows this everyone knows this guy harvey weinstein everybody knew that like everyone we all talked about this we all know this and it's like whoa whoa whoa what i didn't know this this is crazy like i wish i would have um i agree with that i also think that there's a lot of room to deconstruct wikipedia i think wikipedia is i i'm like i wouldn't say i'm a hardcore libertarian but i'm libertarian or i tend to be on a lot of topics and i think that wikipedia should actually be a non-profit or some type of like owned by the government and should be like a national treasure that yeah the department of education should just own wikipedia and fund it through you know what is the a break look up the department of education funding and i bet that would cover you know easily what wikipedia needs to stay around and it's doing a hell of a lot more than the department of education probably is isn't wikipedia already in a non-profit it might be a non-profit but i want to make sure it never goes out of business i think that wikipedia is a treasure and same with wikipedia uh reddit i'm like reddit don't make money you don't need to make money well you just ask for a little donation thing and just let us see your expenses and i'll just give you a little bit and everyone will it's like one of the few things where i'm like donation or government funding is the way to go right on uh okay i want to give people in the last four minutes oh my god department of education 68 billion in funding yeah they could afford to how much you think wikipedia i don't even know i mean if you're if you have five billion page views a month how much well they say on their thing we need this much to survive i don't know what it is but it's like i just no i don't think it's above two billion i don't think i don't even know like what what do you think twitch costs to run like if you had no people so i can't say okay if i are just for the hosting like i'm ignorant i know nothing does it cost more than 10 million do you think it would cost more than 10 million a month yes but i can't i can't say about twitch but i would just say i'm no wikipedia sorry wikipedia you think wikipedia costs more than 10 million a month just in hosting i think it's probably about that that'd be my guess so they need uh 200 million dollars a year aws could just fund it and be like hey this is powered by aws it could be on every page powered by aws get free hosting um that way wikipedia's funding is around 100 million a year there it is um okay so i let's give them one more idea before we go because we talked about a bunch of random topics today um okay business idea so i just got my new house and i'm renting this place and as part of it you need renter's insurance and so i'm like oh fuck here's a task i don't want to go do you gotta go get lemonade yeah i gotta go do whatever but then i was thinking about it i was like and the guy who's telling me i need renter's insurance is the broker the agent who like rented me the house and i was like why isn't this just part of the lease where like you're like hey by the way check this box because you need renter's insurance and just do it through me um and you have your renter's insurance done and so obviously this guy is not an insurance company but what i think you could do is create a back office insurance company where the storefront is actually just all the rental agents and brokers that already are talking to the customer just signed the deal they're the ones trying to enforce these terms and force you to have insurance um why aren't they empowered so i'll give you an example of this i have a buddy named guy gal great name fucking top five name guy gal guy gal is his name oh that's great and uh guy has this company um called rise i believe is the name of the company and what he does is he's like hey you know all these when you go to sell a house and the sign goes up and it's like caldwell banker or like yeah whatever kb homes or whatever it is it's like always the brokerage name and then like the agent is kind of like a very secondary footer thing um he's like dude the the world is shifting where the agents really want their own brand up front the agents are the one who go do the marketing the sales so what he did was he's like he go and the brokerage takes a huge fee so when an agent gets their fee i think the brokerage would take 50 and so he's like look through technology i can make a more streamlined brokerage and what i could do is i can be a hidden back office for any agent so you're the agent your your name is alex you know alex rompero well you could just be the rompero group and you could build your brand as the as the storefront forget caldwell banker you don't need those guys i will be the the back office i'll take care of the legal compliance and paperwork that the brokerage normally does and i will only charge you x percent fee and it's less than the 50 percent that that isn't this exactly what caldwell banker does caldwell banker does it but they are the back office but they put their brand first and um a broker can try to like kind of put their own marketing front on top but it's not their core model and they take a huge cut so what this guy did what he did with rise is really smart he he targeted the top one percent of agents in every market he goes to them he said dude you're a top one percent you don't need caldwell banker you are the brand and he said bring your book of business to me i'll do the same work that they do for you with the lower cut and i'm gonna um and look you push a button your website gets spun up automatically um i'll take care of all your sort of technology needs and i take 15 instead of 50 or whatever it is and um so i think it's a really smart model he's doing really really well is he doing i can't say but the company's doing well and i think it's a really smart model attacking a very big space which is this back-end brokerage thing for home sales i think you could do the same thing for insurance i think you could build an invisible insurance company and have the brokers or the agents be the storefront and just say hey you should just offer this to all your clients when they rent from you or buy from you but why wouldn't lemonade or one of these companies go to those guys and do this they could i don't know maybe they maybe they will um i'm not sure but i know that compass kind of did this in the real estate space um i know that uh there's this awesome company i really wanted to invest in called what is it called damn i'm gonna forget the name but there's someone doing this for business insurance where they where they're trying to be a back office as a service i've seen that i think there's more that i think there's more companies that can do this that are not doing this today um where you empower the agent who is already at the point of sale and you give them a thing to upsell that gives them a little bit of money and it makes your customer acquisition free and you just need to provide the back-end service for it so i think there's a whole class of businesses like this yeah i need to go and research all this i'm this and this interests me a lot i'm gonna go look up caldwell banker i don't even i see their signs i don't even know what they do entirely yeah deep dive it and deep dive compass because they kind of disrupted this yeah they crush it um all right i gotta run my computer batteries at one percent by the way michael bisbing oh i agree a brain says compass is bs michael bisbing wants to come on the podcast you want him yes i love please be that'd be great down i'm gonna shut my computer i gotta go see you me too see ya you you
