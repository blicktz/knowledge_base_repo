the second skill that i think is incredibly important and this is maybe the number one or number two skill i think in terms of business i think it's the number one skill and so this skill is copywriting i think copywriting is the most important skill that you can have for business and one of the most important skills that you can have in life and here's why when you learn how to write well you learn how to think well you when you learn how to write clearly you learn how to think clearly and copywriting is a particular type of writing but it's not just limited to writing copywriting is understanding how people think and how they feel and how to use the written word or a script or spoken word in order to sell a product or sell an idea basically how to use words to get people to do what you want them to do and the way that you do that is you have to understand what motivates them what makes them uh uh what what makes them work and so this can be applied to literally anything i have made tens of millions of dollars this way using copywriting but i've also met my wife this way i learned when i was when i was trying to meet her she was that way out of my league and so i used what i learned in copywriting to like get her attention and make her or at least try to make her interested in me um copywriting copywriting is incredibly effective i've used it to get customers like as in people to buy stuff from us or for the hustle to get advertisers i've used it to get speakers to our events i've used it to recruit people i've used it to sell people on this interesting idea i have copywriting is incredibly important and it boils down to a bunch of really simple principles but the easiest one to remember for this conversation is ada a-i-d-a attention interest desire action for the majority of your copywriting life which for most of you it has nothing to do with getting a job it's just a good skill set to have in life attention interest desire action is the framework that you need so when you write you line it up with attention can i get your attention interest can i tell you some facts that get you interested and get you to fall down the slippery slope because once i get you to start reading my work i can get you to uh keep buying into what i'm saying it's really hard to get people to fall down that slope but interest uh by specifically tell them very interesting facts and features about the story that you just started with your your your action point or sorry your uh attention point desire is the second part so i'm going to make you desire whatever i'm i'm i'm selling um and i'm going to get you to desire that by telling you things that you don't know and how this can benefit your life and then finally action i'm going to tell you specifically how to get you to act um and so here's an example that my friend neville always uses uses that i love which is if i'm going to tell i'm going to try and convince a 15 year old guy to drink more water i could say drink more water it's healthy for you or and a lot of these facts aren't necessarily true because i didn't research what water does for you but i very easily could use this premise for that i'm going to say have you ever seen those guys with huge muscles at the gym carrying around gallons of water in their hand it's like they use those milk containers to carry water so that's how i get your attention you see they're doing that because if you drink a if you drink a gallon of water a day the likelihood that your muscles will grow by 30 percent more than had you not drink water now the reason that happens and this is the desire part the uh yeah this is the desire part the reason that happens is because water has these molecules in them that helps oxygen travel through your blood and oxygen is needed to build up your muscles that's my desire part is i'm trying to show you how to build up your muscles and when that oxygen goes to your muscles they grow 30 faster so and this is the action part if you want to build big muscles and be healthier than before you need to drink about a gallon of water a day per 100 pounds of body weight so that action part i specifically explain how to do that now that was just a silly example i don't i don't none of that shit's true but you get the point this ada it works wonderfully and i always think that i always tell people you got to learn copywriting and there's a few great ways to learn it of course um
