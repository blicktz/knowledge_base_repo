manzil so this is cool this is one of my favorite reasons to do the podcast is that interesting people just reach out and tell me about their business so uh manzil is uh this so this guy sam reached out he listens to the podcast what's his last name sam malaco something like that and um so he was like hey i got this business you know would love some help with it um or just would love to chat and so i said okay let's let's chat so i get on the phone and i end up blown away by what these guys are doing so they teach me about something i've never heard of and is now very finance very very uh fascinating to me so what they do is manzil does islamic financing oh we talked about what's that mean we talked about not on the podcast but we talked about it offline because i was pretty interested in it so um henry do you know what islamic financing is if you didn't know legion i don't think you'll know this one so are you are you muslim i'm not i'm hindu well i'm neither but like my my family is hindu um so i didn't know about this but basically in the muslim faith there's um actually uh sort of uh the advice is against um traditional loans so uh interest which is known as like riba i think in the in in their faith is uh frowned upon in these so a traditional mortgage where you go to the bank you have your down payment you take out a loan and you're paying interest is actually not compliant with um with their with their faith and their law and which is actually common in a lot of other different religions is that true yeah so i'm catholic christian and uh i was raised that way and there's definitely rules regarding handling money and interest and things like that yeah and i think the the fundamental basis i'm going to kind of butcher this so i apologize but i'll i'm just trying to explain as best as i understand it uh so so apparently uh you know money uh sort of fiat currency which is just not uh pegged in anything it's just a made-up concept uh the the belief system is that money has no value inherent value in itself and so you should not be charged interest for borrowing money which is this sort of abstract concept so they have loans or they have uh sort of agreements which can work as long as both sides are taking shared risk and um getting sort of shared shared upside shared return in some way um so there's there's sam islamic i believe so yeah and his partner muhammad is also and so they were explaining to me that hey there's this big thing called islamic financing and there's these islamic challenger banks and so if you ever heard the word challenger bank uh check this out it's pretty pretty cool we know that banking's been around forever there's these big bank brands that are you know in every country there's there's big banks that are worth billions of dollars and recently over the last let's say five to seven years there's these things called challenger banks or neo banks they're called and so in brazil there's a bank called new bank and you bank and and new bank is worth 10 billion dollars it's one of the most valuable startups in brazil in uh the uk there's challenger banks oh my god i'm gonna forget the name but challenger just means a new one it's a startup bank yeah and they're they offer different things so what what these guys did was better digital access so mobile apps uh quicker ability to get sort of credit cards and debit cards spun up um and so there's you know there's a couple of them that are huge now um a few different multi-billion dollar startups done this what these guys have done is they've done this for a faith-based uh bank which is basically say there's a set of customers out there in this case muslims who are not being served well by the generic banks and we can make a bank that serves them better and the way we're going to do it is you want to take a mortgage out you can either take a sort of a mortgage out a traditional mortgage which is not compliant or you can take one out that's compliant with your faith we've come up with a mechanism that is blessed by sort of the the village elders you know the sort of leaders in the in the community uh that says yes this is you know i think sharnia law is what it's called it's compliant with sharnia law and then on the other side this is um this will this works as a mortgage you can actually buy your home and so these guys have this have this concept and in other countries this is apparently really big so in africa indonesia places where the muslim population is the dominant population they've already solved this problem but in places like u.s canada where it's just a minority of the population is is muslim they don't have these banks yet so i love this startup idea because how are they doing so how they're doing so they've they spent a lot of time making sure that they can actually get it to be compliant and actually get the financial mechanism to work that took them a while over a year maybe two years now they've gotten that to work and they have uh basically they have two sides of a marketplace on one side they have people who are investors because you know if you're going to issue mortgages their average mortgage is like five hundred thousand dollars so it takes a lot of capital to start this business they don't want to be the one they don't want to go raise a billion dollars and then start issuing these loans they want on one side to have investors who will put in the capital to fund these loans and on the other side they want to have the borroweres who are trying to buy a home who can pull from this pool of you know sort of halal financing you know this uh this financing that's compliant and so they have 10 million dollars committed on the on the investor side 1.2 million in their bank 10 million total and then um and they're just every week they're trying to close more of those checks i think which is a small amount but this is like just inbound interest this is not like they haven't really done anything yet but 10 million will let you let you do if you just do half a million dollar loans that means they can do whatever 20 mortgages um uh right now and every mortgage has a certain value so it's about worth about i don't know 20k a year to them is that mortgage just in their fee that they get on top of it um and so and on the other side they have all these applicants i think you know about a thousand applicants and these are what they call super prime applicants because these are people who are doctors lawyers they have good jobs they they have the money they have the means to to to afford their homes they're just looking for a solution that doesn't force them to compromise their faith so i really like this business there's a working model in the uk there's a working model in um in africa there's working model in india there's nothing in canada where these guys are and there's nothing really in the u.s uh where how many muslims do you think there are in america i think there's look this up i think there's like a couple million only two two million i want to say roughly um that's pretty interesting i like that i think that there's a bunch of weird rules around banking i mean they're not weird they should be there but um and so starting a starting a bank i think is it's almost nearly impossible it's very difficult so what all the neobanks do all the charter banks do not real banks they're not real banks they sit on top of bbva or they sit on top of these other banks and they're just the applicant they're the consumer facing layer but the banking happens with their underlying partner and it's sort of like the lead gen model that you're talking about they go to these banks say hey i can get you a whole bunch more customers i'm going to spend all the money doing the marketing they'll be banking with you but we own this sort of relationship yeah and that's actually pretty common i use this thing my debit card is simple here it's simple i've heard of it yeah um this is my debit card it's pretty cool i like it because the customer service i can just text and they're like easy these like young guys in portland and they they're easy to chat with and they answer 24 hours a day they were acquired for 100 million dollars and i was like this is like a freaking bank that's it yeah and i did not a bank yeah and it was what's it called bbva yeah that's who they use bbva compass i think it's exactly they're under there and there's a few that are underneath all these now the very first there's now one of the challenger banks got their very first banking charter banking license which is very rare i forget their name but they just announced a couple weeks ago last two weeks that so the so now it's very interesting now once that seal broke because it was so hard to apply for this yeah i think and they all want it robin hood wants their license brex wants their license it's just very hard for them to get i think you need five percent or what's the number i think you need 10 percent in reserve yeah you need a certain amount of reserve that's not even the problem it's just that there's no incentive for the government to give these out they're like ah you you kind of highfalutin you know tech startups do i really want to give this to you you've only been around for so long i don't know if i have the trust in you so now the seal is broken the first one got it we'll see what that means um but what i like about these guys is they're not a bank they're not taking your deposits they're just doing loan issuance so on one side they have the reserve cap the investment fund but they're using other people's money opm on one side yeah other people's money to make the loans and they're the broker and they take one to two percent of the transaction fee and people are willing to pay a premium to have halal financing just like people are willing to pay a premium for halal meat or for vegan or kosher meat you know whatever like right people are willing to pay a premium for things that are compliant with their faith i think this could be big and you know what's interesting i think that they've had a hard time raising money from traditional vcs because this is they didn't understand hard to understand yeah you have to like you know most vcs are old white guys and you know it's uh the sort of cliche and you know i know they do look into it but i think that there's that there's the natural challenges of any high aspiration startup they have those they have the problems that any any startup that's really ambitious but then they also have the problem of like first they need to educate you about this problem like you saw how i stumbled through this explanation and i talked to these guys for an hour you know and that's where i am after an hour of really trying to understand it but you and you read this by furcon your your best so i ran yeah i ran it by him i introduced them yesterday i said hey furcon understands this he's muslim he's an investor he's a technologist and he's an entrepreneur if he doesn't like this i don't like this and what did he say and so he so he's like i've looked into this he's like a lot of my friends really wanted this i tried to look at what options are available in the u.s they suck they're really super high premiums is he practicing um yeah like you know to an extent like what i want to know is do really like like he doesn't pray five times a day but he doesn't eat pork right so he's like culturally he drinks but like his dad runs the mosque in san jose and you know like it's it's so even people who are like culture who aren't incredibly devout are into this if he had the option he would prefer halal financing over not if it was convenient and he's like the problem with all the existing options they're not convenient they're not easy to use and they're very high premiums he's like if these guys did it conveniently i think this could be baked so he's going to talk to them we'll see like i'm not a practicing catholic anymore are you you guys catholic you're catholic for sure right do you eat meat on friday on lent me too i went to an all boys catholic high school i don't practice anymore but that's another thing i don't eat meat during lent on fridays i try not to so it's kind of it sounds like that's what it's kind of like where it's like people it's a spectrum it's a you prefer it but not yeah you prefer it especially if it's convenient for you you you know the way henry just said that a lot of guilt there like yeah i should but i don't so there's you know if you can make it where people do what they want to do without lifting a finger then they'll do it you know it's great that's pretty cool i like that i like that thing or i like that angle of finding because i don't know anything about muslim culture i don't know anything about hindu culture which is you where you're from you i don't know you probably don't know too much about catholic yeah it's kind of an interesting way to like look at how other religions do things um right another thing that we should talk about not today because i don't think we know what we're talking about we definitely don't yet is building things on top of banks i think that's super interesting what do you mean by that so like what simple did and like what what's the name of this company manzel man spell it m-a-n-z-i-l manzel okay kind of like what manzel did a building a building a front end on top of someone else's back end right which is the bank um i think that that's really interesting simple.com is my uh card i didn't know they did this at first this is kind of what drop shipping is so where you build the layer that says i'm going to get the customer to a landing page and they buy yep but it's just going to place an order with this other manufacturer and they'll ship it directly to them super effective i like that with banks because um like simple they did this all i mean it's it's a little different the card is all white and it's a branding like looking yeah um and their app is really good and so it's kind of interesting i i think this is kind of what brex is doing right that's totally what credit card they're layered on top of mastercard um i i love these things i really like that you
