all right sam i got a billy of the week for you i'm excited about it i got goosebumps thinking about this guy steve jobs elon musk thomas edison look if those guys were going on a road trip but there's only one set of keys they would toss it to this guy he would get to drive and his name is tom ryan tom ryan is basically the leonardo da vinci of calories okay this is a guy who has invented some of the most iconic foods in history he invented the mcgriddle he invented stuffed crust cheese pizza he invented um smash burger the chain he invented the beef dip sandwich at quiznos he invented his guy has just been inventing things in the food category the mcflurry he's just been inventing things for you know just decades and he is like the godfather of food science and so i want to tell you a little bit about this guy okay i'm i'm interested because i didn't think that some of like a dipping a sandwich in aju i didn't think that was like an invention and so well okay so some of these things i'm using the word invention a little liberally right some of them he genuinely invented meaning like nobody had done that before some of it is he created that product at that company which was not previously a product and so sometimes it might be like oh well you know somebody else had had the idea of you know a sweet sandwich okay but cool he invented the mcgriddle it's a specific thing that he invented that made it work and here's why but can we can we start by me asking how'd you even discover this were you like on the mcgrittle wikipedia page just you know when you're eating something and it's so good you're like i'd like to pay homage who's the man who invented this i'd like to put some flowers on his tombstone that's not exactly what happened i saw tick tock about this guy and i was like there's no way one guy did all this okay all right so this guy basically he goes to college and when he's at college he has his girlfriend the girlfriend's taking a food science class so she convinces him to take it he goes there and immediately falls in love he's like oh my god i didn't even realize there's a whole science behind things like ketchup and ice cream like there's literally like chemistry science but then there's also sort of the brain science psychology the tongue science of like what flavors work and so then he not only studies food science he then gets a master's in something called lipid toxicology right so this guy's just studying like the science of fat um and i would say this guy's like you know i don't know what the what the equivalent of the nobel priest prize is but for like obesity but this guy deserves it so he um he just so he goes and he gets a job at duncan hines he then works at jiff and he's like pioneering a lot of their peanut butter work that he that you know does some really great peanut butter work the best work yeah he's like you know these open ai researchers that are just getting poached from lab to lab that was him going from heinz food lab to the jiff food lab and then he gets a call from pizza hut and they recruit him as head of new products because he got this reputation because even at jiff he was launching new products and so he gets this reputation as being like this sort of mad mad genius and his friend tells him when he gets the job at pizza hut for head of new products he goes dude i'm so sorry because what he's like that's a tough position man everything's already been done in pizza like you're doomed you're doomed to fail pizza is a solved problem and he there's a quote from he goes that pissed me off he goes he goes it pissed me off not because the guy was doubting me but because a lot of the world thinks like that they think the world is full of solved problems i don't think like that i think there's always an opportunity so he goes into the research and he's doing research and he's like all right what do consumers care about when it comes to pizza and he's like all right two things are very clear to me after studying how people eat pizza number one cheese is the value driver the more cheese the better the cheese um the better and there's really no limit to the amount of cheese that people are willing to have in their pizza and second the dogs eat the crust he's like the crust is the necessary part because you need a handle to hold the pizza but it's the worst part of the pizza people just give it to the dog and so he's like all right i need to put cheese in the crust and so you know he goes to his team and they're like yeah we'll just put some cheese on top of the crust it'll be great he's like no it doesn't have that wow factor he's like we gotta have a wow factor it's gotta feel different it can't just be that we've added cheese to crust it's gotta like be something that's marketable and so he's like let's figure out how to put cheese inside the crust which was a whole like physics problem because you know he's like the first one he made like that he's like it tasted pretty good but it looked like a like a bike tire like i burnt the whole outer crust it was like this fat you know like burnt thing and so he had to figure out how do you cook the pizza so that you can have gooey cheese in the crust without burning the crust um and so he does some work and they figure it out they get a special dough and a special pan and they get it to work and it becomes this huge hit but then he's also a marketing genius and so he creates he's like you know what we don't need to do something new what we need to do is um have you ever seen this malcolm gladwell talk that he gives his big ted talk about the perfect pastas have you seen this no that sounds great what is it so it's malcolm gladwell's famous ted talk from back in the day when he was you know malcolm gladwell was the man writing uh tipping point and others and he basically talks about this guy another food scientist who got hired by a pasta sauce company ragu or whoever and they were like we need you to figure out how much um like what's the perfect pasta sauce like should it have like chunks in it should it be just smooth should it have like herbs in it or just be plain should have cheese like what what's the perfect pasta sauce and the guy and the big takeaway the spoiler of this ted talk is the guy discovers discovers there's no perfect pasta sauce there's only perfect pasta sauces meaning you cluster people into like four or five categories like if you like chunks then give them way more chunks than you're currently giving them like they want way more if you like spice make it way spicier it's too mild for them today and if you like cheese put you and so you basically like the middle that they're trying to serve everybody wasn't working and they actually needed to like go extreme so this guy discovers the same thing in pizza he creates the meat lovers pizza he creates the pepperoni lovers pizza the cheese lovers pizza and he creates the lovers line of pizzas there and that becomes a huge success so he's crushing it at pizza hut which but all this sounds like silly like i'm laughing this is not silly this is great this is actually this is really hard to do in a corporate setting to convince someone this is true inventions true innovations i'm not yeah like i'm laughing but because it's legit and this is moving billions of dollars of product right and this is like you know hitting millions of customers and this is also by the way we have friends that work at facebook and google and they're like yeah i'm optimizing the like the marketplace banner ads to be like you know whatever it's like you know you were talking about this with i think your wife yeah i was like i was like um like if the like my wife worked on the team of them trying to put stickers on photos and she's like well if the dog's tongue is out of the mouth uh the click the click the rate is five percent versus if it's in the mouth it's only one percent right and there's definitely like a cynical side of this which is like our world's greatest minds are basically just fine-tuning knobs inside of giant slot machines which is really what's happening inside of most big tech companies and most big food companies but hey i'm not a hater let me just see some positive things of this okay so he gets the call he's at pizza he's crushing he creates all the all those products ring ring hello yeah this is tom speaking and then uh on the other side he said ronald is that you and ronald mcdonald calls he gets called up to the biggest of the big leagues he gets called by mcdonald's mcdonald's says we need you is he a kid right now or is he like grown ass man okay um so and he has a great thing by the way one of his frameworks because they're like how do you invent because like honestly he's like one of the more creative inventors of our lifetime and they're like how do you invent and he goes i try to get inside the mind of an ambitious 32 year old and i was like he's like basically when you're 32 you have money you have taste so you kind of know what you like and you don't like but you're still open-minded you're not closed off to the world and um you're not like easily swayed by the latest and latest trend of everything so you're you but you're still like you still with it and like you're still a part of every major trend that like has staying power and so he's like i study the mind of the of an ambitious 32 year old okay and he works for that so to get some call from mcdonald's he goes there and they're like all right where's the opportunity and he's like all right let's look at breakfast they start looking at breakfast and he's like all right you got coffee check and then you have all your like savory foods check he's like no nothing's sweet and he starts thinking about it he's like all right you know casual answer we need french toast we need pancakes and he's like oh this average first level thinking ew get out of my get out of the room and he's um he says no no what are we really going to do and he goes so he he's a master of constraints so he says how do we take the denny's grand slam breakfast and put it in your hand and they're like what and he's like i want an entire grand slam breakfast but that will fit just fit in your hand because that's what mcdonald's does this guy sounds like a salt park character and so he creates the mcgriddle which is exactly that it's a sweet breakfast item that fits in your hand pops off mcgriddle becomes a huge hit mcdonald's breakfast uh surges on the back of this creates billions of dollars in market cap and uh all because and he had to do some invention he's like well we can't have this messy drippy um syrup you know sticky sandwich like yeah i can't put a sticky thing in your hand then your whole day's ruined you're not coming back the next day and i've never had a mcgriddle have you had one hell yeah yeah of course you've never had a mcgriddle i've never had a mcgriddle are you part of al qaeda like this is like the greatest like the greatest american one of those caves where have you i thought the war was still going on yeah what the hell man this is the best they're the best honestly i never even considered it but after this after this i'm i'm so in apparently there's uh you tell me i don't know is it not like covered in syrup and actually there's something called syrup crystals that are inside the pancake little little balls of like sugary like syrup and it's wonderful and it mixes perfectly with the salty sausage okay so that's it that's what he did tom does it so he does that he creates and you don't get a mess on your hand so you get the syrup without a mess on your hand all right so a lot of people will talk about how you need a million dollars and three years of experience to start a business nonsense if you listen to at least one episode on this podcast you know that is completely not true my last company the hustle we grew it to something like 17 or 18 million dollars in revenue i started it with like 300 my current company hampton does over 10 million in revenue started it with actually no money maybe 29 or something like that nothing and so you don't actually need investors to start a company you don't need a fancy business plan but what you do need is systems that actually work and so my old company the hustle they put together five proven business models that you could start right now today with under a thousand dollars these are models that if you do it correctly it can make money this week you can get it right now you can scan the qr code or click the link in the description now back to the show now you might be thinking all right is this guy like you know what's he really about is he just is he just saying this for himself is he an elite is he one of these elites that i should hate or is he a man of the people well he's a man of the people he creates the dollar menu the dollar menu dude what what a iconic what an iconic move is he an employee at mcdonald's right now or is he an entrepreneur no i mean uh in the story in the story at this point of course he did it he's a mercenary he's a hired gun and he drops in like he's like a one-man navy seal who drops in and like nails the target and bounces after a handful of years i don't know why there's no movie about this guy yet right like i don't want to see jason born i want to see tom right the only question that we have at this point is does it come in via parachute or just do they storm the beach on a boat like what's he gonna do yeah the story's been told like a hot dog truck barges in so he creates the dollar menu creates the mcflurry um and then he goes to quiznos quiznos poaches him he does a little bit of work there but the owner of quiznos is like yeah this is the guy so he says forget quiznos let's just create a whole new concept together and they create smash burger together which i don't know if you've paid attention but uh as a former qsr operator myself i have a lot of respect and esteem for smash burger smash burger is just it's just thin it i mean it's a burger that you when you grill it you put the meat you you stick the thing the metal in the meat right so it's kind of like a thin crust pizza but for burgers so they kind of smash the burger which gives it like a more of a char on both sides which is better for them too because it's less meat well i think it's the same it just gets wider uh got it okay but uh but it tastes better yeah i think okay so they create smash burger become successful but what a prolific career for this guy and what what a what a track record like who has dominated their industry the way this man has dominated fast food science right like fast food food science pretty inspiring when i googled his name it came up with joe bully foods corporation is he associated with that yeah i don't know what that is he's got like new stuff that he's doing he did like a like a new like like sports bar type of deal um he's got smash but he was the ceo of smash burger for a while i don't know what all he's doing now but they were like you want to retire he's like retire i wake up every day i wake up every day i'm trying to dominate the palette you think you think i want to go play golf like what do you think this is have you googled him he uh he's got he's a beautiful man he's just got the most beautiful head of hair i've seen in a long time he looks like he's like the british reporter like who's like covers like sports he looks like that guy in the 90s in every rom-com the woman was vying for an editor-in-chief job at vogue or something like that that was like you had to be like well no he looks like the second character now the second character is a british yes or california uh record label executive so they work in ar or they're running the label and they miss the kids baseball game because they have to check out this band right like he he looks like that character he looks like the record label executive uh from every 90s rom-com movie is he like this alpha like get after it type of guy or is he like a kooky forgetful professor who wears two not matching socks okay that i don't know but he's an alpha in my mind he's an alpha to me i'm gladly a beta to him this guy's amazing um did i tell you by the way if we were back in the day when i was doing my sushi restaurant chain we went to a you don't like these industry conferences that you like you just sometimes like you know we went to farm con it's like a farmer's conference well i went to like a food version of this i don't know if you've ever been to any of these quirky like industry trade show conferences but they're so funny dude so i mean like i went to inbound the inbound the hubspot's inbound marketing conference there's a whole talk on converting mqls to sqls yeah like that so i went to this thing um because there's a qsr magazine quick service restaurant so there's a christmas machine we uh we apply we're like hey we really want to go to the conference can you give us free tickets and they're like yeah so we go and uh you know what the icebreaker was we got there the icebreaker when you come in in the lobby they have three tables set up of just like dirty dishes like it's a a restaurant table and it was a speed busing competition so you would go with three other people and you'd have to try to like bust the table as fast as you can and whoever had like that's pretty good the best bus was uh you know like succeeded basically like one that one the contest got like a keychain or something like that it was amazing the guy who organized it his name was literally tom hamburger it was unreal dude this is um this is i've we've done 750 plus i think episodes of mfm and this happens a lot where a lot of people don't realize this but for the majority of episodes you and i don't talk in advance because we like to like surprise each other on air on the topic this is funny what you're saying is very similar to the topic that i had brought okay what you got and so this can all actually be related and i have what i think could be like a nice little bow at the end to like how this could be good for uh entrepreneurs or business owners listening i found a photo of a billboard that i saw recently that stopped me in my tracks and so i want you to look at this billboard and tell me what it says okay so this is boiled cod and it's a picture of a cod slightly more protein per calorie than our bars david the david bar okay have you seen have you seen this no amazing okay so i want to tell you a story about this and i want to explain a little bit like nerdy marketing about why it works so the story behind this uh we had peter uh raha on the podcast i think like six months ago so peter was the guy who started rx bar in his mom's basement and he eventually sold it for something like 650 million dollars only six years after uh starting by the way the episode he did with us was awesome like uh if you if you want to if let's go listen to a fun episode listen to that one it basically he tells a story of how he built rx bar how he's building david bar but also he had like four or five other ideas of like if i was going to go into a category this is the type of category i look at and how i would attack it which is like what you always want from a an entrepreneur who's got like expertise that comes on the pod it's like great tell me how you did it tell me what you're doing now but okay that's great for you what about for me and do you have specific ideas and like a specific approach you take that i can learn from for like white space right now and he actually had a third part of that uh which was he had a beautiful attitude uh and not beautiful in the sense of um fun to be around uh like he was sort of like napoleon like he had this like conquer the world energy that i thought was like actually kind of cool very intense energy yeah um that i thought was interesting and so when he came on he told us the story of rx bar he told us the story about david protein bars i don't think david had launched at that point but the background behind david is when he was and i have to give a shout out to new york times uh daily i'm using them as the source for this uh but when he started um david the idea was with rx bar it was a natural bar it was made out of i think dates and it had a very small amount of protein and he noticed that had i had more protein in this bar i think i would have been able to approach a larger market and i could create something a lot bigger and so david finds this thing called epg it's a delivery mechanism for protein and eventually david actually the company has bought the company that owns the patent for epg and epg is a type of chemical that allows protein to be delivered to you faster so so let me explain let me just ask this question because the doc here says it's a modified fat called epg which delivers the texture of fat but it passes through your body with 92 fewer calories is this remember when paul murlaki came on and he was like diet coke is amazing and he's like i just wanted to make like diet coke for like any food into the equivalent of diet coke so it's just like food that tastes really good but it basically just passes straight through your body and it can't be absorbed and therefore like doesn't make you fat um is that what this is basically it's like some of that tastes good you could put it in a bar but because it can't be absorbed by your body it's uh you know it doesn't have the sort of caloric impact is that what it is so basically it's the it's it's it's one of the most efficient ways to get tons and tons of protein into your body per calorie and the way they do that is via epg which is a incredibly ultra processed food so i don't know if it's what you're describing but the criticisms for david of which we had just amares on the podcast he's one he was a very loud vocal critic of this he has basically said david may get you lots and lots of protein but it's incredibly ultra processed and there's the argument as to why that's not good because this this this chemical or whatever you want to call it epg there's a lot of people who who want to criticize it and say it's bad and i'm not going to place judgment on either side i'm just telling you there's two sides of this argument which is what i'm going to get to but people loved it and so uh david which i think is it even two years old yet yeah i think it's one year old roughly because he was on about a year ago on the podcast and i think it was like just about to launch or had just launched so this year they're going to do close to 200 million dollars in sales in roughly the second year of business they're they're on a they're on a tear they did a million dollars in the first week of sales and if you go to like any store right now i don't know what it's like in california but any store in new york they're everywhere david protein bars are everywhere and they've crushed it on the marketing uh in particular they've crushed it on the product side but they've really killed it on the marketing and so when i saw this sign boil cod it stopped me in my tracks and the reason it stopped me in my tracks is i'm reading this book i'm rereading we had tim ferris on the podcast and he had mentioned this book that he loved it was called the 22 immutable laws of marketing have you ever have you ever read of that i haven't i have it but i haven't read it yet it was one of these things where like i skimmed before when i was younger but when we had him on i he made a comment that it was a great book and i was like you know i should actually sit down and read that it's really short it's only 100 pages you can basically read it in one or two sittings and one of the laws is called the law of the opposite and the reason why this is relevant to the story that you just said is because it goes to like the science and the methodology behind in 22 different ways to stand out and be different and to focus on something that's not better but different and so the law of the opposite states that if you're not the leader of a category your strategy is then dictated by the leader which means it's best to not to be better than the leader but to be the opposite customers already have the leader's position locked in their mind and you win by framing yourself as an alternative and the key is to embrace the differences and often extra uh exaggerate them and the reason this all works is marketing is a battle of perceptions not products the challenger doesn't need to disprove the leader they need to define themselves as the antidote meaning we are not them we're the other choice right and so why is this so interesting because david took the criticisms of them being an ultra processed food and they ran towards the fire so much so that on their website i thought that this was a joke and so what they're doing is they are positioning themselves as an alternative to natural foods they're saying yeah natural frozen cod that's the best that's it's definitely the best but like it's disgusting who the hell wants to eat that eat this other thing that tastes good and it's like it's just a little bit less good in terms of protein per calorie but you're actually going to be able to consume this they're actually selling so that's what i was going to say if you go to their website they sell it they're selling it and so this is a master class on how to handle this situation by the way on the site it's their cod so they're wild got cod and it's like 23 grams of protein 100 calories no sugar you can get it it's four fillets flash frozen add to cart and then there's all their bars like chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter chunk all sold out so here's all the sold out bars here's cod fully available we've got a lot of this stuff still stuck and there's a bunch of examples of the law of opposites do you remember i don't know if you remember this as a kid but you would see commercials for avis do you remember avis yeah the rental car yeah so basically avis was number two in the market and hertz was the biggest company by far and avis had this amazing uh brand campaign where they said we're number two so we try harder and that was their that was their campaign which is like we know we're number two we're going to try harder uh that's another example of the law of opposite but david has executed this flawlessly and this is like an amazing thing to lean into and this is like not something that like dude i'm just kicking myself because when he came on i literally fell in love with the guy i was like i love this guy's intensity love this guy's honesty love his approach he's clearly like an expert in this field in this industry and attacking this it was so obvious that the they had nailed the branding and packaging of the bar so i'm just mad that i didn't push to like try to invest in this thing and be like hey i just i'm so bullish on this and it has played out exactly as i would have guessed i think you go i think we said what's your goal he goes well i actually think we're going to expand the tam and i think that this is going to be a 10 billion company yeah that's crazy i like their copy on their site we thank our predecessors in the protein industry we'll take it from here it's so good right they they they nail it on on branding they nail a bunch of stuff and i saw when i saw this cod billboard i was like oh that's that's so good that's exactly what the book 22 immediate walls of marketing that's exactly what they had mentioned with the law of opposites and they completely nailed it and if you are a small business owner uh very similar to what this guy tom ryan did i would highly recommend reading this book and then downloading it and uploading to chat gpt it's so cool and interesting uh to give you ideas on your product or and or your positioning and what what he just was explaining about with like with the mcriddle and all that stuff it's all very very very similar to this which is it's not the goal is not to be better the goal is to be different because a meat lovers pizza that's not particularly better it's just that's remarkably different than anything else yes um all right let's do another topic okay i have a little stock market thing can i do a stock thing yeah um is there any pretty stupid and dangerous because like most likely just gonna get be wrong and get ripped apart here not entirely so last time we talked about this type of stuff you picked so we're all disclosure we're idiots don't do anything we're saying the last time though you picked ufc and yeah so we did an episode called stockapalooza uh i don't about a year ago i don't know what that was and the idea was that me and sam would go research and we just try to pick a stock so we try to make a call similar to the stone conference where you just try to find a company that you would believe in as a um as an outperformer and then we made our case and i picked tko which is the parent company of uh ufc and wwe and you picked what ferrari ferrari and i think um i believe we did that episode so february 12 2024 uh let's see what the stock price has performed since then okay so the stock at that time was trading at 85 dollars and it's currently at 185 dollars okay right you know up uh what what is that over 100 117 did you put any of your money into it of course not bro you think i'm here to make money uh what's going on um not because not for any particular reason i was just like lazy i didn't i didn't pay attention so anyways that that pick has performed well i don't think ferrari's done well i think ferrari's down like five percent so i'm better than you um so let me let me you just stay quiet for a minute let me just do this segment here you could give a pick that's bad after this i was hanging out with somebody recently who's a guest you know as a guest on the podcast super successful like billionaire type of dude and uh asked him two questions one was what would you be doing right now what would be your ai play if you're just like young and broke but like wanted to do something with ai and he gave a pretty interesting answer to that which is he's like i would go into he's like i would go find a business owner who's um built a successful book of business like let's say it's in insurance or home mortgages or you know some some some nice industry some juicy industry and like the owner kind of knows like oh ai probably could benefit like i probably could probably benefit from ai in my company but who cares i'm 60. but i'm 60 i'm too old to like actually figure this stuff out and go to he's like i would go to them i would go to as many of those guys i can i'd try to build up a list of it and be like hey um i will do all of the work to use ai to cut our costs internally like i can automate a bunch of processes and jobs and whatnot like i can increase our accuracy and decrease our costs and if i do that like can i carve key basically you carve me out 10 of this business if i successfully do it i'll do it totally on contingency but like here's the deal and we can measure the op exchange that i'm going to make in this business if you just give me free reign for you know 12 months he's like it's the fastest way to kind of like own a piece he's like he's like you know and then i would try to in that agreement maybe create an option to buy the majority of the business at a fair value if i can pull that off so he's like i thought that was interesting on this first thing second thing he was talking about he goes he was like yeah um he's like spacex he's like i just think it's unbelievable that people that there's any counter argument to spacex he's like spacex is the most defensible company in the history of humanity like what's the second best spacex like is there anybody you know like there's there's so few companies that can even compete with spacex and think about how monumentally difficult it would be to compete with spacex like yeah you got to literally get into the rocket business and like not just the rocket business the reusable rocket business not only that but to do it and like be competing you know competing for these giant government contracts and you have to you know successfully demonstrate you know safe launches over a period of time he's like at this point spacex is so unbelievably defensible he's like i think it's the safest place to put money and so i thought that was kind of interesting just like generational defensibility and really the question of like who is set up over the next 20 years who just has an incredibly competitive position for the next 20 years so i just took that frame and none of these names are unpopular so i'm not giving you some like obscure pick but i just like this is my honest take and like i you know i'm basically trying to get into all of these companies because i think over a 20-year period i think all these companies have a very uh combination of they have a tailwind behind them so the wind is in their sails of they're in the right place at the right time like clearly the industries they're in and the tech wave that they're surfing is the big tech wave that we're going to see play out over 20 years and two they don't have much competition which was my case for the for the um the tko stock pick also because i was like there's no competition to ufc and there's no competition to wwe like the number two mma you know promotions whether it's pfl like bellator like these were companies that's literally on the brink on the brink of bankruptcy and like they're they're like not just like in second place they're literally like 100 or 1 000 times smaller and behind and they and because of that network effect they have no chance to ever catch up ufc is uh a tens of billions of dollar company and the second best one like they get in trouble for not being able to like make payroll literally yeah it's like a rich guy's hobby typically yeah like it's not even close like it's like it's like it's like lebron versus the freshman the freshman team it's not even in the same category and so when you're in that category of one it's like that's a pretty big deal plus you have growth behind you but like the fact that there's just no competition same thing with wwe there's really no competition to wwe and of course since then they both signed major major like streaming deals way bigger than you know people thought they would sign like billion dollar a year plus streaming deals but what does this have to do with the first part of um ai oh the ai part that was separate all right so now so here's here's five other companies i think are extremely well positioned so the first is a company that i've been i was wrong about i owned the stock very early on and i got so mad during the gamestop thing that i sold out of principle i'm never gonna let those stupid principles in my way again are a bad way they're they give you bad directions like in route to making money yeah my my big moral stand didn't seem to hurt this company so robinhood was the company i owned the stock when it was like i don't know five dollars seven dollars whatever it was like really early on like right when it ipo basically and um it was like actually after the ipo kind of dipped or something and um when the gamestop thing happened and they basically shut off the ability to buy but continue to let people sell gamestop i was like that is the most corrupt thing i've ever seen same and it pissed me off so much that i was like f these guys i don't trust these guys i'm out since then they've just basically proceeded to like build what's clearly like morgan stanley for the next generation so like the tailwind behind robin hood is the following there's some like absurd amount of wealth i don't know what it is like 20 trillion 50 trillion there's like some stupid number like with a trillion behind it of wealth that's just going to get transferred from like the parent you know boomers to millennials or gen z over the next 20 30 years and so the question is as that money gets handed down what will those people do with it and it's pretty clear that like if you're a gen z or you're a millennial the platforms you trust and gravitate towards the financial platforms you're already a user of when you have small check deposits is robin hood and that and then they're like great we have crypto we have 401ks we have home mortgages and we got credit cards it's like what else do you want wait they do they they do all those they have prediction markets which which is a code word for sports betting and gambling so you can gamble on there you can buy crypto on there you can buy stocks on there you can buy fractional stocks of private companies you could buy you could do all the margin trading and options trading if you want to get really degenerate you can do you're free to put a forward you can open up a 401k with them you can get a robin hood gold card and you can use that as your credit card and you get a home mortgage it's like an unbelievable amount of financial products that they've rolled out all in one app and it's basically this financial super app that gen z slash millennials are most comfortable with and as the wealth transfer happens they're going to be the beneficiary of that so i think next 20 years they're extremely well positioned so austin reef uh the founder of morning brew one of my closest buddies he has been texting me for the past six months maybe longer to be honest longer he's been texting me too about this in fact he's the only reason i bought it uh so i did buy it back again like uh maybe six months ago i had i was about to have a call with him and he had been talking about robin hood but he's kicking himself because he doesn't own any but he's been it was like his call he was like it's gonna be great i'm just waiting for a dip the dip never came and he doesn't own any of it and it's basically ripped up like in a 5x 7x since he's been like wanting to buy yeah he's been talking about it constantly i had a call with him so before the call i bought a hundred thousand dollars robin hood stock just so i could get on the call as a robin hood shareholder and be like oh thank you for the tip and since then it's up you know 30 40 also and so he's responsible for my robin hood uh conviction even though he doesn't own any of it now yeah and i think his reasoning i forget what it was exactly or he had more than one point but one of the points was like young people and he owns a company called uh or he did own morning brew which probably had 200 employees which a lot of them were like 23 year old like 100 000 150 000 earning uh people and he was like my staff that's the uh the default they all have 100 of their net worth in robin hood right and that is only going to continue to grow so because they keep their money in there and it's just going to keep on growing this is this company's unstoppable and he's been bragging about it or calling that for for maybe a year and a half and so he's absolutely nailed it i and i agree with you i did not buy into that argument at all i thought robin hood was silly i would i thought on principle i'm not on board with what these guys did more of like a schwab type of guy i feel like you you want you when it comes to money you want boring you want like a bow tie you want like you know got a man with a briefcase is what you well you know the i i i potentially have a lot of money and i didn't want to keep it in an app like to think i'm keeping it in an app was like kind of that's a little nerve-wracking and like the interface is so cute that i thought it was like they cared more about looks i was like i want the ugliest website that's the biggest vault you didn't want to keep it in an app as if it's like a shoebox like where do you think the money's kept in any of these like if it was a website that's better what did you want i wanted the like forgot password button to be like hidden like i didn't want someone to like i don't know i just it was too user friendly yeah if it's too user friendly to me that means it's easily hackable uh that was the issue that it was too good you know it's like uh you find good deals on craigslist because you're finding something like interesting that no one else uses robin hood scared me honestly i get i actually get what you're talking about i actually felt similar i was like i don't want to keep a huge amount of money in this app but i did keep some i i had some money i think i bought like crypto on it before and uh like they for years they did this thing where instead of giving you like uber for your new ride if you referred someone to a new ride they give you ten dollars robin hood had this amazing thing where you could like do a scratch off you could pick option one two or three which obviously it's not actually one two three it's all the same and they would give you stock and so like i owned like dollars in stock yeah i owned like ten dollars a ford and that is now worth more because i did this like you know right when they launched and so i like robin hood though as a company uh i just googled it is it true did they do 1.1 billion dollars of profit on 3 billion in revenue yeah basically when interest rates went up all of the like financial service companies started printing money because now all the money that they hold they're able to they're able to like and money that they lend out at high rates but like the money they hold they're earning like four or five percent on their float which is like pretty crazy so they're you know they're very interest rate dependent right now by the way the criticism for all of these is that these are already is crazy the valuation is crazy look at the fundamentals oh you know tesla you know they need to sell this many crazy amount of cars in order to justify this or like even self-driving and have to be like bigger than uber to um to just be where it's valued at currently right so like your upside is priced in would be the counter argument and by the way i have no argument against that i just think very simply this has actually served me pretty well which is like i told you the story like in 2010 i was kind of like oh like these internet companies seem to be like pretty dominant everybody uses them let me get some of that that's the thing i was like i don't really know how to do discounted cash flows so you know i can't i can't really tell you much about that about the p-e ratios and like the any of that stuff but like i don't know this internet thing that toothpaste is not going back in the bottle and so like similarly it's like pretty obvious that with some of these it's like yeah yeah like i like that partners that's the name of your uh let's say of your firm exactly i like that um all right what's the next one all right let me just run through a couple of uh coinbase is basically the same case except what they have is coinbase has nine product lines that do over 100 million dollars of revenue each i thought that's a stunning stunning statement i can't believe how many different ways that they make a lot of money i think crypto basically it's like i'm bullish on bitcoin in general and crypto and if you're bullish on crypto the the most trusted exchange that basically everybody that takes a fee on everybody's interest everybody's uh enthusiasm around crypto they take a fee of every buy and every sell like that's a business gonna do very well and also like as now like the government's the government's pro crypto they're buying crypto there's etfs it's in people's retirement accounts like same thing you can't can't put the toothpaste back in the bottle on that and that ceo is an animal he's an animal and so i just think they're they're extremely you know well positioned similarly for for you know the future uh when it when it ipo'd uh i never do this i've only done this two or three times or something like that i bought you jumped up and clapped i i i i you clicked the heels right after i purchased like 100 grand worth of stock and i just looked at my um i just looked at it i i just made the money back now that it's like on a tear it looks like i've i've i'm i'm even now after i think four years or three years all right the other two uh again this is this is so cliche i mean i almost didn't even want to do this segment but i do believe in this so like it's not cliche to me because i don't follow all this stuff so i think a lot of people don't find it totally cliche yeah okay all right well unfortunately the youtube comments aren't as as forgiving and kind as you are all right so tesla is the the next one which is basically if you think about what are the next big industries to get unlocked a combination of self-driving cars going to change the world and then the robots now the time scale is obviously the question here uh but again i'm taking if you take a 20-year outlook nobody's better positioned to do self-driving cars and robots than tesla so and then i also think by the way he's going to end up merging xai with tesla like he's going to he's going to put it all together i don't understand that i don't get that i don't get that combo why it would go together well it's basically one is an ai lab and then all the although the future of tesla is as an ai company and if he's able to basically like financially engineer his way into owning more tesla by by having tesla by xai like he's also like done this before with solar city where he like bails out his own companies in a way right i guess i get that the way how uh twitter has basically become ai which is then a tesla owned thing that's a wild journey that's the wild part i wouldn't own any i don't want to own any stock that that elon controls because he's a crazy person and i don't mind being i don't mind him being crazy what i mind is like when he tweets something the stock changes or and so i'm like well what if he gets shot which is definitely not unreasonable like there has to be like a one percent chance that he gets assassinated or a one percent chance that he dies doing something reckless yeah there's crazy key man risk with him yeah it's too crazy like when he tweeted that trump was a pedophile what did it go up or like did it move yeah it went down then went back up yeah i don't have the stomach for that the stock trades in completely crazy ways in the short term like don't be like oh we missed delivery estimates by a lot my bad and the stock's like up 10 it's like what what's going on here it's weird man tesla's too weird for me yeah i'm too old school for that but uh i do i i understand the argument i mean again the idea is like we're gonna have robots doing human labor once you if you disagree with that then you're wrong and we disagree uh but if you realize that robots are gonna do human labor and that human labor is the biggest market in the world is the market for human human labor then the company that makes the robots that do the human labor is gonna sell more it's gonna be like the iphone the iphone was like this product that everybody in the world bought that uh you know sells billions and billions and billions of units as soon as they have robots that can actually do functional work they're gonna sell billions and billions there's gonna be more robots than humans because why would you not i'd be like yeah give me five give me five of those guys to be doing around my house my backyard my factory my warehouse my whatever right like as soon as people as soon as that exists then the question is do you believe it will exist do you believe that tesla can pull it off yes the the it's definitely worth betting that they will so once you go down the logic train of like the biggest market in the world human labor um we now have the technology uh wave happening where robots will be able to do that human labor and that if you had that what would be the demand for that okay pretty much the biggest demand we've ever seen for anything ever uh okay great so let's go to the next one who is going to be able to you know who's going to be able to do who's well positioned to do it tesla okay great so you go down that chain and you realize like okay they're pretty well positioned it's just hard uh because so i have a friend that joined open ai in i forget the exactly what year but at the time i think they're worth 30 billion dollars and he was debating he's like should i do this should i not do this and uh he said we all said the same thing which is wow 30 billion dollars that's a lot of money is there any upside to this well he joined uh i believe he's made about 30 million dollars and as of now the stock that he was granted back then it is grant uh it is now worth 10 million a year so every vest it's something like 10 million dollars right and he sold a little bit to to where he's good but we were talking the other day and we were like this could definitely 10x again like your grants could be 100 million dollars a year and that's that's it's very hard to like overcome that that to get to that conclusion just because not logic because of emotion you know what i mean totally um the smartest investors i know and the reason why i think there's merit to just having a very like simple simpleton uh model of investing is for most of the like i guess if i look back in the last 10 years i look back a couple of smartest investors i know they always had like a very like two sentence two two sentence level of conviction and they sort of pointed out they're like hey like all you needed to do was btc and chill like all you needed to do was bitcoin and chill right you know when we sold to amazon and we got our amazon grant and it was like okay you own this much amazon stock now guess what i did all these side projects i did all this other shit during the meantime i like try i like work got up every day went to work all i needed to do was hold amazon and chill like if you get a big enough lump sum you just can let things compound and so like um one of my friends zach he has this this phrase that basically every year there's one investment that's sort of like the power law like you know windows zempic happened he was like oh i think i just need to own the companies that are like the the oz epic companies and he's like yep like that was the only thing that you needed to do oz epic was the investment theme of the year you just had to recognize it and you had to take action on it it didn't take a g like a literal genius to do it right you don't have to predict as epic you didn't have to like be knee deep in clinical trials six years ago like even if it just like after it happened you just had to like understand what was actually happening and buy and hold and like that was what you needed to do and every he basically has a list of every year what's the one thing that mattered what was the one deal that i said uh i think you said one year it was like only fans yeah one year he was like it's only fans this year and i was like only fans this was like before it was this was actually i think in 2019. we talked about it we sold uh and we sold to twitch and he texted me and he was like only fans i believe is going to make more money than twitch i go bro twitch is making like and i shared him with him you know i was like picture's making a lot of money he's like i said what i said everything else is noise for me this year i just need to figure out if i can get into only did he get it yeah he did and so uh you know he's you know but i i just really respect that level of thinking that that type thing in fact one of my friends who's like this he came to he came over my house and he goes um take two take two what would it take two let's take two dude your friends talk really strangely there's no there's no like no connecting words it sounds like it was a kramer you just knocked out the door and said take two i asked him i'm like what's the thing right now because he was he was the one who early on was just like you need to have 100 of your net worth in bitcoin and he was just like every day he would just tell me this and he would just tell me this every day this is 2014 2015 2016.

every day he just told me the same thing and he would tell me exactly why and he would write it he wrote it down for me and he just kept doing it and because of my own more bitcoin than i would have otherwise so i you know at least i didn't listen to him i didn't do 100 but i i did listen to him he was basically making a case why the company that makes uh grand theft auto he's like grand theft auto is uh coming gta 6 is coming out and when it comes out is it right now the stock is a little depressed because it's the game's been delayed for like multiple years he's like the game is going to come out and when the game comes out it's going to be the biggest selling game ever there's no competition he goes and he's like uses all these like economics where like you know some word for like there are no substitutes like there's no substitute for gta yeah he was using words like elastic elastic or something yeah exactly so he's like rubber bands or stocks bro he's like you know a great investment has these like six properties and like you know here's the six properties and and i'm like and grand theft auto fits all those he's like yes and so that's like you know his big piece this is what he was saying a year ago it's already up like 30 or something since he told me this and he would lay out to whatever there's more to that story i'm like i can't share here but like is that type of thinking that's like i don't know it's very very attractive to me i fall i get seduced by that level of that type of thinking very easily and obviously i'm cherry picking like you know things that worked i'm sure there's if i really thought about it i'm sure i have a bunch of smart friends who you know fell in love with random single securities that didn't didn't do anything i'm not saying this is like a foolproof thing dude when you whenever we talk about this i like um i started thinking i would be like the warren buffett thing where i'm like well i just don't understand it so i'm gonna stick to that thing which is a really novel way of saying uh like you know whatever i'm i'm not doing it and then i started thinking about this recently where i was like well it's been eight years maybe i should learn about it maybe that circle of confidence needs to expand a little bit yeah i'm like it's so like six months ago i went and bought a book on it and like started reading it and i was like oh yeah yeah i wish i would have read this uh a long time ago this book was published like years ago what am i doing uh i'm like well i don't know it i don't understand it so i'm not going to do it but that's been eight years yeah i don't know i should have read ways sooner what's the fourth company um open ai is one of them but i think that's the most controversial one because i think they they you know there's so much competition who knows and i just was thinking like who else is uniquely positioned on a 20-year time scale where they have the winds of technology behind their back so they're they're in the right space where like clearly they're they're sitting in the lane where the the the the highest velocity of like you know of change and sort of upside is but then also that they have a unique defensibility although they will actually capture it i think spaces is uniquely defensible i think coinbase is uniquely dispensable i think tesla is uniquely defensible none of these things are like you know completely foolproof of course like you know there's there there are competitors i'm not saying that but i just think like on the sliding scale of defensibility it's very very hard to compete with any of those companies because they built up these durable durable modes right like whether it's regular regulatory modes whether it's brand whether it's network effect whether it's like heart you know hard technical um you know technical things that are you know take years for other people to catch up to but then by then they're on the next generation dude i wonder um like this is total like the bro science of financial investing but i don't look into like i don't really read about the fundamentals of certain companies and the only few times that i've bought an individual stock it's been mostly because the founder the entrepreneur behind it and so when we hung out with mario the guy who started oscar health he like explained a little bit about oscar and i was like okay it's a health insurance company but i i don't really know anything else but like you you're really inspiring and so i bought a little bit of that and then the first one was atlassian i read an article about atlassian and their office i don't know if you remember this but my office was at um where was it it was in soma and their office was like on the street of my of my office the hustle and i used to like look in their office and i was like wow i love the interior design of your office and i read a a little bit about the founders and they seemed really smart and i bought i think a thousand dollars worth of it because i didn't have any money and i think it turned into 50 50 grand i think it like 50x uh and it was and so both of the times that they have made money it's literally just been because the founder was interesting to me total bro science no i don't even know what it's last seen does to this day like i i i they make software but i i don't know what software i don't know australian software i think yeah yeah like the the they they say words like schedule instead of schedule like like like you know it's a scheduler i don't know what a schedule is uh but uh it's been like that's kind of been like an interesting way it just seems like someone has willed something into existence and the cool factor so for example palantir i'm pretty sure they're trading at like 200 times revenue or something like that and i have to imagine there's got to be some research on what the alex carp like cool factor adds to that multiple yeah these become cults like there's enough like um there's enough sort of like retail energy now where these things become cults like right now they're trying to make it happen for open door i don't know if you've paid attention to this i have i have i've seen open door i don't understand why there's what's who's the cult leader behind like why do people care about open door and it's like this guy eric jackson and others i mean i don't know i'm not too far in it i i stay away from the like the you know everybody's got their um their their vices meme stocks is not not one that does it for me so like fortunately i don't get sucked into that so your buddy was like i should just pick one stock and go all in if there's one skill set that you should go all in honestly like i learned it a little bit with her mosey and we've seen it time and time again but like becoming a very charismatic person that knows how to talk to the masses is obviously the answer that's the skill set that you have to learn like manipulation everything else um uh just learn that i think uh rob the bank who you had on uh a while ago he like talked about some book he's like i don't even want to say the name of this book he like teed it up perfectly and i think you did i think you did the same he's like there's just one book on how to manipulate people i don't even want to say the name it's just too powerful and i don't want the price to go up the dark do you remember what he said that uh maybe maybe i don't like like you said on our podcast or somewhere else yes and or maybe he said it on i started following him after you had him on and uh he said something like that and i went and like read it and i'm like yeah you're right this is like the this is like the skill that everyone should learn screw products screw being smart what is it i want to know now i'm not going to say here we go you did it to me i'll tell you after uh no but i don't even remember robert green they say this about his book right 48 laws of power like i think one of the like marketing sticks which i don't know if he completely made up or is true and then he used it to like to market his book but it was this book is banned from prisons it's because because they don't want the prisons to like the prisoners to be able to like overtake so powerful it's so powerful that it's banned in prisons is ah just perfect marketing yeah you know that's that's like the cod level marketing and i i have it somewhere on my goodreads that i'll say that i'll that i'll find it but it it's uh i don't even remember the title if i'm being honest but it was like okay so you think i should go all in on on uh charlotte manipulation or what yeah i mean you're we're kind of we kind of do that already yeah like i'm just saying like go all in yeah just be better uh just do what you're doing now but better is that it is that the pod yeah that's it you
