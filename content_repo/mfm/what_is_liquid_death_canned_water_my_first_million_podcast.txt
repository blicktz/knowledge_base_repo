Liquid Death. So we tweeted out and we put in the Facebook group, hey, what should we talk about this week? And a bunch of people mentioned, hey, what do you think about Liquid Death?

And so they just raised a round of funding. So what is Liquid Death? It's a canned water.

So not like LaCroix or whatever. It is, the look of it is like heavy metal. So it's basically just a canned water drink, but they went all in on the brand.

It's made by these guys out in L.A., the incubator Science, and they're behind things like Dollar Shave Club and Wishbone, this teen app, and a bunch of other things. They're an incubator studio out there. And the guys who started it, Mike and Peter, are internet veterans.

Mike was like CEO of MySpace and Peter, I think, Photobucket, I think was his kind of claim to fame, Peter Pham. And so anyways, they're an interesting crew and they came up, you know, the sort of bottled water or canned water market is actually pretty huge now. And they just wanted to come out with a different angle.

So they're like, look, you know, how the hell are you going to sell water? Well, you have to create a brand and a story around it and almost a use case. And so the thing they wanted to do was sort of, you know, in many social situations when you grab water, you're opting out of like the fun of the social thing.

You know, if you're at a bar, if you're at a festival or something like that. So they wanted to make a can that looks cool, feels cool, is something worth talking about. And it's just like you, you know, you're having a drink of some kind.
