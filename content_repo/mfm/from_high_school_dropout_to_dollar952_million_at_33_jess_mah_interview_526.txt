all right this is going to be a special episode i think that the best episodes we do are the ones where we highlight a business or a person who is amazing that you've never heard of and that's what today's episode is the person that we have on just ma she has built herself uh i don't know 10 companies that have combined you know they're worth 950 million dollars she um and not only that just has she made a bunch of money or been successful with business but she's just a force of nature uh people that i respect think she's one of the best entrepreneurs in the world and that's kind of amazing for somebody who you don't know her name you've never really seen her do interviews uh you know paul graham when when he met her and she was at yc put her on the very short list of a couple people with sam altman and a few others as the most impressive people the people that he thought 30 years from now will have done done the most and gone the furthest uh i was at a dinner that's how i met her and a friend of mine pointed out he goes that woman over there is the best entrepreneur i've ever met and he's lived in silicon valley for 15 years and to say that that's high praise uh so i had to have her on the podcast to talk about everything from her beginning where she was basically a loser amongst losers in school she talks about like you know not only was she not cool even in the computer club she got bullied and didn't really fit into school didn't get good grades really like was just kind of like school wasn't for her she ended up dropping out of high school because school wasn't for her she's but she started a business and it started off as a very and you know when she was a teenager she ended up making hundreds of thousands of dollars on this little server business that she was creating just paying for her own video games we talk about that all the way to where she is today building these biotech companies that are doing crazy stuff uh and i asked her i was like were you like a science genius how did you know to go with this how did you have the confidence to go into a space like that like i think we all i think there's a part of all of us that wants to go do the big bold crazy change the world thing but we're afraid like who am i to go do that at least that's a thought i've had and uh it was kind of amazing to hear her talk about she felt the same way like she's like i got a c- in biology and now i have like a nine figure you know 100 million dollar plus bio company like that's crazy to do that and and how she approached that how did she meet these scientists how did she get the funding how did she actually talk herself into doing that from rock bottom where she was completely depressed and didn't know what she wanted her to do with her life to now you know living the kind of life she wants the other thing that's in this episode that i think you're gonna like is she talks a lot about the lifestyle and financial stuff that come from people who are already really successful so she you know like i'm gonna give you a trigger warning now uh she talks about like you know yeah i just like i hop on my jet like you know and i bought this jet i bought it for this reason here's the tax write-off that i got she's very open and very um clear about this stuff and and i think for some people who are at the very beginning it's gonna feel unrelatable or it's gonna feel like oh yeah you know the the classic youtube comment guy who's like easy for you to say you're already rich but i think the important thing to figure out is she successful because she always thinks this way she she talks about her mindset and that's why she was able to do this and also i love when people talk about money stuff i love when they're open and honest i hate the billionaire who downplays it and pretends like you know their flying coach and oh you know money's no big deal and i oh yeah i don't i don't really do anything with my taxes no i like to hear what people actually do how they use money to improve their life how they architect their businesses she does that she's very open about it so that's all in this episode i think you're going to enjoy it uh this is an episode with jessica mom all right it's good to see you good to see you again um i want to tell people the story of how we met which is not like this extravagant story but it is one that um i don't know it's like it's this thing that happens that is like i would have bet anything that you're an interesting person just on the way that this meeting went so we got a dinner together so that's like signal one uh you know a friend hosts a dinner and it's like only friends inviting friends to this thing that's going to be like a you know some sort of founder investor type of dinner so already you got filter number one filter number two is i'm sitting at one end of the table you're sitting at the far end of this other table but our mutual friend sieva tells me he's like uh i was like oh what's her name and he's like oh yeah that's jess ma he says uh he's like yes she is um the most impressive entrepreneur i've ever met and i was like okay i didn't even ask and he just says that and he's he basically gives you this extreme compliment and i was like that's extreme and he's like yeah she's extreme and i was like okay i gotta know more so already i got a signal next thing i noticed that you had your dog in the restaurant and i was like okay that's awesome love dogs dogs here and later i was like is this like a service animal because it's kind of like a nice restaurant and you were like yeah uh amazon you could buy this for ten dollars this vest and like look and you flashed me like an fbi badge that was like a um service dog thing and i was like did you buy that and you're like yeah this is great and i was like wow this person is just you know so there's a little signal somebody rolls by their own little rules my friend telling me that you're you know one of the the most baddest people that he's ever met literally in the game of entrepreneurship and uh and then when you did your intro you said something you go uh yeah i'm working on like i started this thing in denaro which i've heard of and you were like uh you know it started that and now i i sit on the board like you know whatever 10 companies and uh we do like bold science bets and you didn't even explain it and i was like okay well you have my interest what's a bold science bet and you're like you know like curing cancer but not like the typical way like this other path to curing cancer you like you like kind of nonchalantly gave me some answer as to what a bold science bet would be and i was like okay say no more i need to meet this person i need to get to know this person and i've gotten to know you a little bit now and uh yeah you are just that impressive so this is my build up um that is my perception and tell me what that feels like to hear because that's people never tell you their actual perception first impressions as they remember it uh you know in their own head that's amazing it was super fun to have that dinner and meet you that night i just had a good feeling that we were gonna have a fun time and normally i don't go out i'm kind of like a loner i like to be at home and you know just take it easy after work and uh you know it's a lot to deal with with 10 companies we're gonna add more companies this next year and i'm trying to figure out like where do i want to spend my time as an entrepreneur and that's an ongoing question i'm sure we'll talk about that but i've heard about you um you know i've i've seen your podcast and you're famous so it's kind of an honor to get to be friends with you too so our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better well the other thing that's cool is you have a hold co and like you know if i was going to say what are some of the themes of like almost like entrepreneurship trends like there's fashion trends but now there's entrepreneurship trends one of the entrepreneurship trends is this whole personal hold co model but what most people are doing with the personal hold co i would say is kind of like small boy stuff it's like we acquired this little sass app or like you know i'm gonna i'm gonna buy this this plumbing business and i'm doing this hold co to roll these up um and you kind of have a hold co but you also have the big venture change the world kind of thing inside of it which i find really fascinating so you're like yes i'm doing a hold co but the hold co is going to be all sort of game changers type of like go big or go home type of bets i find that really interesting i also think that another entrepreneurship trend is doing hard stuff so i think elon really popular you know popularize like yeah you can create the next kind of app and that's cute but i'm gonna make rockets and electric cars and then you know then you have ai and sam altman and that's like you know the kind of cutting edge science do hard stuff movement and i think you're a part of that too and so i really like that you're here because you represent you know some intersection of these trends and there's very few people that really play that game and uh that's what i wanted to to learn from you today is is why do you play that game and how do you do it but let's give people like i guess the quick background um of you so can you give me kind of like your how do you introduce yourself when you're trying to brag a little bit um about you know why anybody should pay attention to what you have to say i'll i'll be honest i'm really shy and it's hard for me to talk about these things because everyone i meet is so impressive so no matter what i feel like the dumbest person in the room and the least successful person in the room and um and so that's really hard for me to talk about still but um just to catch everyone up i'm an entrepreneur i've started so many companies now my first company was called in dinero and in and air is a financial sas company we do accounting tax building management software and services for businesses and our customers were companies like slackstripe pinterest doordash instacart coinbase and i started that straight after college i studied computer science at uc berkeley and when i was a senior at berkeley i was running the computer science club and i brought in these speakers and one of the speakers i brought in was this kid named sam altman he was building a company called looped and i'm like hey sam what should i do after college and he said oh you should do ic and you help review my application and uh and then the rest is history so i did that for 10 years through that to a few hundred people um valuation and the hundreds of millions of dollars but the way i built that business was i didn't raise uh traditional venture funding so i didn't bring in bc capital i only brought in some angel investors i was able to retain most of uh the ownership in the company and uh and it's a cash flowing you know profitable business to this day so so that was kind of my first uh foray into business and uh lots of ups and downs and like you know being weeks away from insolvency multiple times over and i think it's because we were undercapitalized and i always ran things a little too close to the edge there and um and i was pretty public about that i mean if you google search me you'll see that i've survived a bunch of near-death experiences with that business and eventually i i realized i didn't want to be a ceo anymore i grew up with this mindset of you have to be the operator and if you're not the ceo and make a company a unicorn you are a failure and i just didn't that didn't land well with me i i google searched you know the world's billionaires and i'm like how do these people become billionaires and most of them built companies a lot of them were diversified holding companies and they held on to these companies for decades and a lot of them they weren't the ceo or the operator they were more like investment manager and um i mean warren buffett's a great example of this um but there are many many more like that and so that kind of got me thinking am i doing this wrong am i just listening to silicon valley rhetoric that's pointing me in the wrong direction and um and then a few years ago i went through a really tough experience where my boyfriend who i was living with uh died very unexpectedly and i was going through a really dark period after that where i was not able to work i just couldn't i woke up in the morning and i'd be super depressed and i didn't want to do anything and i thought what would i do if if um i was gonna die this year if this was my last year here because i'm so depressed and i have to make myself happy what would i do and running a company was not on the list so i immediately hired a ceo for nanaro i had another company that i had started that i brought in a friend to run it's a litigation fintech company and um that company originates and funds lawsuits so you know like the personal injury billboard you see on the side of the road we do that in a very sophisticated way a lot of details i i really would wish i could talk more about but uh you know i don't want to invite competition there and then i've started a bunch of other interesting businesses like that which also if you go look at my website modway.com i don't go into much detail actually i don't mention any of the detail on these businesses for the same reason um i'd rather build quietly and come up with these really interesting ideas find someone to go build those businesses and a good chunk of them are businesses that would just print cash but a lot of them are more bold and that's why i got interested in the biotech stuff i just thought what would i do if i wasn't scared of failure and after my boyfriend died i thought a lot more about that i thought like i shouldn't be scared of trying and failing because i've seen rock bottom i can't my life can't get any worse than it is today so i might as well try something you know and uh so that's that's where i landed with that that's an amazing story and uh that question of like what would i do if i wasn't afraid of failing is like up there in the pantheon of great questions i asked myself that same question and it changed i wouldn't be doing this podcast if it wasn't because i had three paths that i had written out i remember i made a figma file and i was like drawing like a flow chart of my life and i was like i could start a company and maybe it'll be this maybe it'll be this and that was like you said the silicon valley rhetoric because what gets written about is the visionary ceo founder who creates the next big thing and that's the movies are about social network and uh you know the the tech crunch articles are about that the vcs want you to be that because they're like yeah it's sweet i get to write a check and chill and like you go do the like you go win the lottery and do all the hard work at the same time like do the low odds hardest thing you can do you know over there so i was like i could go start a company i could invest and just kind of like be on the other side of that that's i don't know if that would be the most fun thing that i would do and then i was like and i literally wrote or i could be tim ferris and i was like i think i want to be tim ferris i was like well why don't i just do that i've been thinking about this for like seven years in the back of my mind and i was like well because what if i'm not what if it doesn't work then i'm just a guy with a podcast it's cool to be tim ferris it's not cool to be the guy with a podcast like a podcast just normal podcaster with 100 views or listens per episode or something and i was like all right so am i just gonna not do it because i'm afraid that i might fail at it like what's the worst i could have and i kind of had this whole talk with myself you know the most important talks are not with mentors are the talks with yourself and it sounds like you had one of those two where you were like what would i do if i if i wasn't afraid to fail can you just talk a little bit more about that talk with yourself because i think everybody should have that some version of that talk with themselves yeah i i think just expand on that a big question i asked myself was also um how will i deal with the insecurity of feeling like a beginner and terrible at something despite the fact that for the past 10 years i got pretty good at being a ceo and running a business i'm sure you felt the same way right where you're a great entrepreneur and then now you're getting into you know building content and interviewing great folks and that's the new skill set that you had to become good at but for a while it's awkward and like i'm sure your first videos were not nearly as good as the ones that you posted over the past few months right and so that's a lot of the self-talk it's like oh my god i didn't do a good job i still don't know what i'm doing people don't take me seriously do i even take myself seriously and meditating on that and thinking you know what it doesn't matter because i'm having a great time i'm learning a lot and the outcome will work itself out that's how i deal with it but how about for you like what's what are your other best practices yeah so being a beginner uh at being okay like that mental prep for yourself of i'm going to be a beginner at this i think is also a very important part of that conversation i'm glad you said that because it's one thing to just say um what would i do if i wasn't afraid but then like the fear is still going to be there it's not just going to disappear when you ask that question and the fear is what the fear of being wrong being failing looking dumb all those things and so that beginner conversation is important which is cool if i go into this i'm going to start as a complete beginner i'm going to get better at over time because i'm good at learning and i'll try and um you know if i don't need to become the world expert at this but i need to become competent at this and that might take me six months to a year that's like a reasonable expectation if i really put my mind to this um it reminds me of the story i've told on the pod before of moiz ali who created native deodorant and deodorant it's not curing cancer or whatever but it is uh you know still it's a totally different space and so when he told his friends he's like i think i'm going to create a deodorant brand and they were like cool uh random you know do you do you even wear deodorant like do you know anything about deodorant and he's like today i know nothing about deodorant but in six months i'll know everything i need to know about deodorant and that idea of like writing yourself a blank check i think is really important to uh to starting anything and you told me this when i was like dude you're like working on crazy science stuff i like that idea and i wish i could do that but it feels above my intellectual pay grade uh how are you just a science genius and you were like no i got like you were like i got like a c in biology in school and then like you know you're like i hired a tutor to like as an adult to like learn about this and i watched ted talks and podcasts and and then i flew out and i met the scientists and talked to them you just did all of the like normal blocking and tackling i feel with like just like uh is that how you would describe it like that that was totally different for me i just put you on a pedestal like oh maybe she's doing it because she's just smarter than all of us and that's why she can do this and nobody else can no i still have major insecurities that uh about this in fact last night i dreamt again this is a recurring nightmare where i am getting c's in school and i am very close to flunking and having to repeat a grade and i got c's in by and also in biology when i was in high school so i thought i could do a lot of things with my life but anything related biology is not one of those things and then when i was um so i was on the cover of ink magazine um a bunch of years ago and the there was a woman who who was on the cover a month before me her name's elizabeth holmes and you know obviously we all know what happened and so when she got uh you know when thirdos went under and the whole thing happened i thought wow bio is really hard and i would be so paranoid and scared of doing anything in biotech because i don't want to go to prison now obviously you know there's more to the story there and i don't think i'm going to go to prison but like the thought crossed my mind like should i even risk my life and my career if everything's okay like why do something hard and where the last woman who tried to do something here you know got you know totally destroyed by the media and is now in prison like that's not a really good inspiration for me to try to be the next elizabeth holmes but he didn't up as bad you know that's so that went through my head and i had to overcome that and then eventually i decided you know what it i want to give it a try i wanna you know just learn and so i hired a biology tutor i like digest digested all the information and i brought in people who've been running biotech companies and who had been part of uh big bio so that's that's really how i operate it's just bringing other people smarter than i am another question i would want to ask you and it's something i ask a lot of my best friends is what would you do if you were a billionaire um and if you had like billion in hard cash in the bank account and uh you are not allowed to do what you're doing today how would you devote your life and it's so fascinating to hear the answers that that i get from my friends and i'd say occasionally it's i i'm doing what i'm doing today i would just keep on doing that i hear that from my more successful friends friends but from people who hadn't made it per se it's very thought-provoking that is a great question i can tell a quick story and then i'm gonna answer that question so the quick story version is when we got acquired by twitch i grabbed i was like first day what do i want to do i was like let me go find my people because i went into this all of a sudden i'm in a company of 2 000 people who you know each are doing their little function in this company and i was like where are my entrepreneurs at like where are the people who like to like you know make shit happen and so there was a company that had gotten acquired a few years earlier and uh three years earlier and they got bought for like i don't know i want to say like a hundred million dollars and the founder was one of the founders were still working there and so i we go out to lunch and i was like hey can we meet he's like yeah let's go to the cafeteria i was like no no i just need to leave this building i'm having like big company claustrophobia they need to get out of this building so we go to a lunch and i say um why are you still here and he's like oh what do you mean like it's going great we're working on stuff i'm like yeah but like uh you know is this what you want to do like you're here you're three years in and i'm looking in the mirror thinking uh you know do i want to be here in three years there's no way i want to be here three four years from now you're going on to year four and uh you're drinking this company kool-aid what what happened to you why are you still here and he was like you know slightly offended but he was like uh no it's great i'm having fun i'm learning a bunch i go let me ask you the question differently it sounds like what you're saying is you don't want to be doing anything else right he goes yeah and i go so let's say that i had put a hundred million dollars in your bank account tomorrow would you show up to work and he's like well no like i'd be i'm like okay so you're doing it for the money let's okay now we've established that because if i all i did was i changed the money part of the equation and now your answer is very different he's like well i would buy a ranch and i would you know i have four kids and we'd be outside all day but then on the side i'd be building this type of project i was like okay so that's what you really want to do i'm not saying you have to go do that but let's at least be honest i didn't like the part where you were telling me this is exactly what i want to be doing with my life and i can say today there's things there's a part of my life like this podcast part of my life that is exactly what i would be doing regardless of what the number is in the bank account um and there's a part of my life where like we spin up companies but like we spin up companies like for example we just spun up a company that is i would say it is opportunistic it's not the most fun sexy company in the world i don't want to operate it forever i'm like oh this business will work it'll be successful it'll have a great exit it'll provide a great return it'll you know uh it'll put you know millions of dollars in people's bank accounts in the next three to five years and that is good but if i was totally post-economic there's no way i would spend an ounce of my energy doing that company like just the reality of the situation so i'm like you know partially following that that philosophy but not all the way yet and i'm kind of honest with my at least i'm honest with myself of like yes and no but the my answer to the question if i was totally post-economic you know i have more money than i'll ever be able to spend uh the thing that i would do is i would teach and i would either just teach in the way that i do today like podcast write a book uh you know just basically be curious go learn something and then explain what i learned to people who don't have the 12 hours to go down the bioelectricity rabbit hole um you know you know but that's what i would do or i would extend that if i wanted to be a little more ambitious and i would actually create a campus and a school for people like me and be like cool let me create the ideal school that i wish i had when i was younger and do that um i just don't know how much i don't know how much that would be fun like the kind of reward versus extra effort that that takes versus creating content online and doing the same thing but not having any of the like students and physical campus and stuff that i need to deal with you we should talk about that sometime because i've thought about that as well i wish there was a better school for me and for people like us who are you know we're creative entrepreneurial quirky and the traditional school system does not like satisfy our needs um and what's cool about it is you know if let's say we came up with a concept for how we would do this like i would just put my whole team behind it and then we'll find a way to find the money and then it will just manifest like these things don't have to wait until you have a billion dollars in cash is the point and but i asked you the question because i i found that bio bio was on my list like oh i would do more bio stuff i just fund it and like what but i know people who could fund it so i could just call them and have them fund it and i i don't need to fully fund it and i'll manifest um and i think i think a lot of us um have so many of these things that we want to create in the world and it's dangerous to leave because life priorities change and i think that i see this this with many of my friends who go on to get married have kids they get comfortable they're building their ridiculous house and then life goes by and they never go through this lesson it always stays a dream or an aspiration and i i just couldn't allow that to happen to myself and i'm so glad that you're you know doing most of the things on your list that's a great phrase it's dangerous to wait um because i think most people feel like it it'd be risky to go do it and i think they vastly underestimate the risk of allowing yourself to just wait on the things you really want to do in life because actually what happens is you accrue this like um it's not like by waiting you get closer to the goal by waiting you actually get further away from the goal because you add all this space that gets filled up with other activities other responsibilities thoughts you know you train yourself to not take action on the shit you actually want and to like go down this like long winding path i remember when i was um back to when i was working at twitch there's a guy dan uh who's now the ceo at the time he came in as like i don't know chief product officer or something he was he became my boss so we go into this like one-on-one and um he's like so like what are your like career you know what's your like goals for yourself here you know at the company and i was like um well i have two options here i mean they're gonna lie to this guy and say oh i can't wait to get promoted from l7 to l8 to l10 like you know like that's like the ladder literally it's a ladder and you that's your goal five angles and i was like i'm either gonna lie about this to him because he's you know he's my manager i guess that's what i'm supposed to say or i'll tell the truth and so i told him the truth and i was like uh yeah i can't wait to go build another thing or just go on my own and like i don't see myself being here and uh long term and he was like okay well that's but he didn't he didn't get i thought like that's gonna put him in an awkward position but he was like you know he's an experienced guy he totally you know rolled with it he's like okay great uh now that i know that and i was like you know i don't want you to totally write me off because i said that like i do think i'll be here to earn out this part of the deal i think i can do good work while i'm here like you know i think you'll you'll get value from somebody with my talents being here um so i hope you don't just like you know say oh this guy's not here for the long haul like write me off but that's the truth and he was like done i appreciate that now let's talk about the thing you really want to do what is it that you really want to do and i was like oh i want to do this this this but you know before i do that i need to kind of like you know i'm trying to get you know uh save up you know enough capital because i'm gonna that's gonna require a lot of capital and i'm gonna learn some things i'm gonna build my network and and he's like yeah i'm not really a fan of the like i want to do x so i'm gonna go do a b and c before i do x he's like you're better off usually just going ahead and trying to do x and i was like like all right you're right that's true i don't need like you don't even need to say anymore you're right i was bullshitting myself a little bit um thank you for saying that that's actually a really valuable piece of wisdom and um it reminded me of um there's this tony robbins ted talk have you ever seen the the one time tony robbins went to ted yeah he's like on stage and he's like um what stops you know i've been i spent my whole life basically studying like what stops people from having what they want in life and he's like you know um what do you think it is what holds you back and people are like oh like you know from whatever it is you want you want a better relationship you want a better career you want more money you want better health whatever whatever it is and people are like oh i don't i don't have the time and other people like i don't have the the knowledge the skills i don't and the people in the crowd are saying it and al gore is there and uh this was like right after al gore had lost uh the presidential race to bush i think there was like a runoff like they had to recount the votes in florida or something and like they it went to the supreme court and the supreme court ruled that whatever bush won and so he hears this voice that says i didn't have enough supreme court justices and he's like what the hell what do you mean like who's oh al gore's here and tony robbins gives this like one minute thing that like actually kind of like bit slapped all their answers he's like uh you know everything you guys just said is a resource you lacked money time capital supreme court justices that's a thing you lack same thing for justices yeah that's hilarious he's like the only thing you actually need is resourcefulness he's like that is the master skill the ability to go get the resources you need when you need them for the thing you're trying to manifest and he's like if is it not true that if you are motivated enough charismatic enough playful enough convincing enough um you know like determined enough and and charming enough can you not get everything that you want like is it like is it really anything that is outside of you if you really put your all into acquiring that resource could you not have gotten the time the money the network all of those things like al gore if you were not more passionate when you were on that stage in that debate would it ever ever even come down to that supreme court justices no right like you would have just won in a landslide uh if you had acquired the things that you actually needed to get there and that's kind of what you're saying of your little manifestation studio type of concept i love that because it's like you are completely striking out from the thought process of an entrepreneur the like do i have what it takes either personally or financially or uh you know knowledge and skill wise you're like well if i want to start a bio company i'll go recruit the best bio people and then i'll go raise the funding exactly that'll be that right you say like you don't have enough time or money those are always the excuses but you create the time by hiring other people to do the work who are better experts at whatever that thing is and you manufacture the money by raising the money and in my case i've got a multi-person investor relations team they have connections to tons of billionaires and family offices and we're trying to like place these deals with our family office connections and that's going to be you know within the next year that's going to be a four-person team and a capability i have so instead of creating a hold show let's create manifestation codes that's what i'm talking about right i i mean you coined it it's the manifestation code and uh because now if it could be a profitable endeavor great sometimes it won't be and but the point is all of us have that thing we want to create our our life and we want to have the ability to do that in a way that's painless fun and exciting for us as the ideator what about like um you know crazy science dreams you have you said you have ideas or you're talking to scientists all the time what are some things that are you know in the future that you're excited about that is not just a pipe dream like there might actually be a pathway to do it like you know i don't know if the growth test tube maybe in a vat type of thing like i don't know if that's like just a dream or there's actually people working on the that that might be scientifically possible or practical can you tell me about some parts of the future that i should be excited about or my kids might get to experience i actually think that is very viable the test tube babies um i know of i've talked to several scientists who are doing the portion to like for example let's say you wanted to be the mother of a child not the father and we could take your genetic material and create an egg out of that i think that we're going to see that within the next five years and then the converting you know having a artificial embryo generated avatar style that's a little harder to do i i've met scientists who've been able to um get to maybe six weeks before the whole thing falls apart and that will get better and better over time um but the implications there are huge like for women imagine not having to uh deal with this and uh not having to do egg extraction um if you're you know if you're having trouble conceiving and then what's also realistic i think is extending our lives by 30 percent i think we need to be prepared to live till we're 120 or longer and right now the upper limit our head is oh i'll probably die when i'm 90. we're not thinking about the exponential rate of change here and i am talking to a lot of longevity scientists i'm seeing the data it's compelling i think we're going to live longer and we need a plan for that future what's the short version of how we get that extra 30 percent is it drugs is it uh diet lifestyle changes is it reversing aging is it you know uh getting blood from young uh you know baby seals what are we going to do to make that happen it's probably going to be a combination of multiple factors and you all these projects fall under what you call bold science could you define bold science what does that mean yeah there are just so many uh companies working on very incremental uh you know companies where it might extend your lifespan by three months or six months that's not a great outcome like you're going to be going to the hospital and taking chemo drugs for another six months before you're dead what do you do that's like i'd rather go to go to hospice than prolong my suffering but if you could instead of patching the problem like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound is the analogy um what if you could get to the root cause and reverse cancer for example so right now everything we do within cancer is about um trying to kill the cancer cells through chemo radiation surgery car t therapies are super hot and trendy but that just basically involves using your immune system to target and kill your own cancer cells but what if killing cancer is the wrong approach and actually cancer happens because your cells are trying to protect themselves in some way and if you could train them and coach your cells instead of killing them let's rehabilitate them get them to integrate back in with their surroundings then you could fix cancer and so we're working on a company around that um that's what i mean by bold science that's that's uh that's great so it's basically non non-incremental a big leap in function or leap in quality of life so like you know a step complete step change and usually that's going to come from taking a different approach than like you know or taking a different point of view on the problem looking at it through a different lens and um you've you what you do is you partner with scientists to make that happen one of the things you said that i liked uh when we were talking before was you're like i get on the plane i get on the plane every time yeah and um i don't know exactly what you mean by that but talk about that because i think that's just the entrepreneurial as part of the manifestation studios you gotta just get on the plane sometimes what what do you mean by that i have a real example i have uh there's the successful entrepreneur who i'm sure you've heard of um maybe you even interviewed him he lives in vegas i live in la and i just said hey tell me a time and place on sunday and monday and i will fly to vegas and i will meet you i'll literally take my plane and fly there just for the meeting and then fly home afterwards and then tuesday same thing i have um patrick colson from stripe asked me to hang out with him and have dinner and like all right cool so i'll just get on my jet and go see him and then fly back and be back in my bed after dinner you know and does does that only work if you have a jet no buy a southwest ticket i mean just get creative about it i do it so often though that it is really nice to have my own airplane but like i think that um it doesn't matter like if i have to fly to london and see someone i will i gladly you know book a ticket and do that and uh i think that it really you know i had a billionaire do this for me where he literally flew in from south america and he went straight from the airport to dinner with me and that was the first time i had a one-on-one meeting with this person and it really made an impression on me i'm like wow this guy went out of his way he was planning to go to some other city instead he came to la to meet me just for dinner and and he's more important than i am by by a million miles he's so much more important than i am that made me want to be friends with this person and um you know i have another billionaire who i hit it off with we hung out for drinks um we were part of a bigger group and we had two hours where we just talked about the meaning of life all of his regrets all the things he'd do different he's like this 70 something year old dude and he's like yeah everyone wants me for my money but no one just asked me these questions that you're asking me about life advice i'm like you know what we should continue this where do you live i'll visit you he says i live in the bahamas i'm like great i'm visiting you and we booked the time i'm seeing him for dinner in three weeks and i want to literally go there just to see him and he's so happy about it and i want to get four hours of downloading this man's wisdom and uh it's it's super cool i think it's massively underrated uh well uh my uncle calls it meeting belly to belly he's like you got to be belly to belly in business and he's in the real estate game it's a totally different game but i loved it i was like not face to face we're going belly to belly and i just think that that was like created such a good visual in my head if you were going to score it let's say if i gave you one point of like trust productivity relationship building for a zoom call versus um meeting belly to belly if one is if a one is the is the call how much is the in person well i mean i would think that the other way i mean it's it's just they're totally opposite ends of the spectrum like a belly belly like flying out to see them is the ultimate 10 out of 10 way to engage with someone there is no better way than to say i'm flying five hours out of my way to see you and to spend you know dinner with you and a call is definitely a one and assume call is maybe a two it's like that's how wide the delta is right and uh oh the other thing i want to mention is that even i think a lot of people think oh but jess like you've already like needed a bit so of course people want to hang out with you well i was getting meetings like this when i was 16 and i knew nothing i cold emailed the reddit guys i cold emailed justin and emmet from twitch i guess it was justin.tv back then and i said hey i'm this idiot 16 year old i think you just put it on the table like i'm an idiot and i think you are brilliant and i'm willing to fly to you and i just want to be a um a fly on your shoulder and see you do your work and just like you know just follow you around for a day and so if you pull up the justin.tv archives you will see me driving him around san francisco and going to a poker game with him and like all this random stuff just because i was willing to do that mark benioff replied to me also again i'm an idiot 16 year old this is when you're a teenager you also told me because i asked you because um i think one of the valuable things in life is to study like to become a good evaluator of people like if let's say you're an nba general manager you need to be able to spot talent um i think any business person or investor needs to be able to spot talent and ideally spot the difference between good and great great and the best in the world and um when i met you i really felt like oh this might be somebody who's one of those like elite best in the world at what they do and they're going to do special things that are beyond even what really great smart intelligent people are going to do just because they seem to be operating differently but i need to understand them a little more so i asked you a question when i was getting to know you and i was like if i met you when you were younger like 13 years old what would i have seen and would there have been any signals for uh for this and i i said you know and i will say on my side i was a totally unimpressive 13 year old you know um you know there was no signals that i was going to do anything out of the ordinary um you know forget like being great at something just like out of the ordinary beyond average and um so i wasn't that way but i've met a lot of people who were you know they're like teenagers they're flipping things like you know on ebay or they were building a product of some kind or you know whatever you have an amazing kind of backstory uh can you tell it what were you doing what was like your first you know interesting little business you were doing when you were you were a teenager when i was 13 i started a dedicated server and co-location business because that's what i thought you did in high school that's just i don't know why but i thought it was kind of normal and i grew that set out a few hundred grand in revenue did you know somebody else doing it why would you think that's normal i don't know i was like the internet forums you know there are lots of people who do this so i thought okay this is like a commodity business but i could probably figure out how to do it and make a few bucks and offset my gaming server expenses that was the goal i just wanted to make like ten thousand dollars a year to offset my own costs and buy some clothes and not have to like go work at the shopping mall or like rake leaves or shovel stuff so you're like i'm playing video games i want to scratch my own itch be able to play my own video games and and like you know pay that pay off that buy some clothes were you cool in school were you like a no smart popular kid or who were you total geek loser i was so lame i so i had no friends i went to the computer club at my face school um which is all the nerds who also had no other friends so you have to be friends with each other they were making fun of me and they were bullying me i was literally on the bottom of the bottom football like that's how i knew it was really bad i'm like okay i have to get out of here as soon as possible so i ended up dropping out of high school uh halfway through my sophomore year but i got into this really cool college program called simon's rock college you know simon's rock and going to college really it really saved me because i was born in high school i wasn't doing well i was i was getting terrible grades because i was uninterested and because i had no friends and i felt like i couldn't relate to anyone all other girls um and guys just like were interested in things that i had no interest in so when you said hey i would love to create the school for people like us i just thought holy cow i want to create that school too we can make this happen let's do it let's brainstorm it let's set aside sometime another day or let's just go meet up for dinner i'll come wherever you want any day you want i will i will fly to you and we will put together you know a game plan for what this would look like and how we would manifest this without having to wait till we're you know sitting out a billion in cash yeah okay done i love it belly to belly booked um you tell me about this server business uh did you make the 10 grand off that i was making like hundreds of thousands of dollars a year off of it i was making more money than my teacher i remember in biology class it's 8am and i can't pay attention and i'm like doing like the biology teacher clearly doesn't like me because she knows that i'm high potential but i wasn't doing well because i was up till three in the morning answering customer service and sales emails so of course i only had like five hours of sleep and when you're 13 and you're operating on five hours of sleep you're not going to do well and but to make myself feel better i thought well at least i'm making more money than my biology teacher well i'm falling asleep a moral victory uh so when you were meeting these people because you're like i'm a i'm a dumb 16 year old college kid you're college because you're 16 because you dropped out of high school yeah and like just went to college um you met justin khan you've met mark benioff you met uh you know these different yc founders did you do you learn did you learn anything did anything stick with you was there a story that like you remember uh like what'd you get out of those meetings yeah what i got out of it was that holy cow there are other people like me who are a little crazy who are willing to approach life and entrepreneurship in an unconventional way and who are willing to do uh you know the hard thing so when i saw justin and when i saw steve huffman read it i i realized wow like i don't need to wait till i'm older to start doing this today and i also don't need to have money i don't have to have like a job to demonstrate success first so it was more the mindset i would say it's always mindset and psychology more than tactics um when you're meeting these people that i focus on yeah yeah and you you also told me you had met these other people like when i was like oh what's um i forgot i was like i think i was asking you like what you do with your money and you were like yeah i uh you said one interesting thing you were like you're like you know uh taxes um people i think i was asking you something about taxes and you were like people don't spend enough time on taxes so can you tell me um we'll put this in the bucket of billionaire secrets uh you you said you've met a bunch of successful super rich people and the way they think is a little bit different than the way everybody else thinks and i'm interested in that gap what's different about the way that the most successful the richest people that you know think what is it that they're thinking about differently um one of the things was taxes but you had a few more can you tell me the taxes point and anything else you kind of remember on that yeah top tax optimization is a really big deal because if you think about it if you're spending if if half your money is going to uncle sam it's really going to impact your compounding like do a you know compound interest uh calculator and you'll see the delta is very wide if you're starting at age say 30 and these billionaires employ the best tax strategists in the world so eventually i said hey could you introduce me to your tax person and that person of course works with like 30 other billionaires and has saved them you know collectively 100 billion dollars in taxes and then i i've gotten enough of these tax professional intros where now i have a whole collection of them i call and i combine the advice from multiple tax professionals and merge it all together and i think that's the next level most people just pick one person they say oh i've been working with betty as my tax accountant for the past 10 years well betty doesn't work with billionaires it's time for a new tax accountant i literally had this conversation with someone over lunch last week and he texted me right before we got on this call saying oh my god like this is going to make me millions of dollars more over the next few years like well this is so true uh i feel when i uh like i have like a lawyer and a tax person and if i feel like i if i talk to another tax person or a lawyer i'm like kind of cheating on them it's like that's so silly that's so dumb of a way to think about it like first of all it's your job to get the best opinion possible it is to get the best answer the best answer is not going to come necessarily from the one person you know who you picked one time five years ago without vetting anybody else um they may also not specialize in other stuff you're doing oh now you're doing real estate deals well they don't know anything about real estate deals or you're doing uh you have an exit an m a they don't know anything about m a so you know you should be talking to people who really understand that stuff um a team that multiple opinions is better than one uh specialties matter um also when you said that it reminded me i was like oh yeah the person who i have doing tax strategy stuff they stopped giving me strategy after year one like we you know like the bulk if i've had a pie chart of 90 of the like strategy convos convos we had were at the very beginning and then like now i'm just like the client that they you know stamp the the thing on like every year right like that happens naturally same thing with legal legal stuff and so you kind of need to keep dating in order to have like fresh ideas or advice coming in uh from that perspective exactly you also said like there's a certain amount of time you think people should spend on or like you know maybe not should but like the math tells you you should be spending a certain amount of time on taxes and actually the what people actually do is maybe less than one percent of their time yeah exactly less than one way less than even point one percent because if taxes impact half your income potentially if you invest just even five or ten percent of your time this year to finding five amazing tax strategists get all their advice and figure out how to apply it ten percent of your time as the up or down here and you're making like way more money as a result it pays for itself like a hundredfold it's the highest ir investment you can make and it's way better than like investing in the stock market with the money you're paying these tax people that's so true because your tax is always your biggest expense uh and if you're a business person you have your you know your business tax then you have your personal tax you have like investment tax capital gains tax you have all kinds of taxes every single year you know the same dollar gets taxed a bunch of times um so you're right basically it's the biggest it's the biggest expense even 10 sounds absurd because i'm like oh that's 36 days out of the year it's over till you don't need that much time i mean even five days in the year to do this gets you a lot but you're right on the math like you would be justified spending 36 days out of the year you would be justified spending 10 of your time and intellectual mind share on some on your biggest expense that's going to compound every year for the rest of your life like of course that would make sense so that is a kind of like aha moment for me right what about like um coaching or uh you know some sort of like what is your like basically if the studio the manifestation kind of like vehicle here is an extension of you and your brain and your dreams and your desires and then like getting the brain to be like functioning well seems important do you do anything whether it's therapy nutrition morning routine like do you do anything like that to like make sure you're the psychology that you know the the the little voice in your head is saying the right stuff yeah for sure i have um i have two different coaches i talk with each month and i think of it as like going to the gym or taking a shower even if i think i'm happy or in a good mindset i need to still go see them to make sure that my head is screwed on properly and yeah it costs me a ton of money but it pays for itself right away i also have my ceo group i visit once a month it's kind of like alcoholics and on alcoholics anonymous for ceos i'm in yp a young president's organization but there's also entrepreneur organization and this stage list goes on and on and there yeah you think oh i don't have time for it but i actually think you don't have time not to do that that's a good way of putting it also health stuff we don't think about that what if you could optimize through better nutrition and nootropics and through ivs your not only your longevity but your mental acuity so i work with five pancierge doctors to come up with my own custom plan and i'm actually going to put something together that i could share with all my friends so anyone i love can get on the same program um and includes the supplements custom compounding my own supplements into you know just two pills um so it's a little easier um and then doing the exosome ib's once a quarter which i'm i'm a huge fan of and i don't even what is that what is that word you just said what what are you doing exosome ivs and uh yeah i mean so it's still the science on it still a little um you know up in the air so i just want to be you know good on the disclosure there um so it's not necessarily the fountain of youth but there's the belief that you know if you're if you're doing if you're bringing in stem cells you know through an iv um it will help you uh lower your biological age give you more energy and help you with um with your autophagy so basically your body's ability to get rid of uh old and dying cells if you do that then the thought is you're going to have more energy more energy means more brain power more brain power means more ability to manifest and create great things in the world and so this is another area where let's say you were able to improve your mental function and your energy by 25 by the way if you do all these things you could probably do like better than 25 is that worth fifteen thousand dollars a year which is roughly how much i spend on this maybe i spend 20 or 25 grand on it it's not a lot of money you don't need to pull a brian johnson where you're spending a million dollars a year to get 80 of the results this is the 80 20 rule of brian johnson uh yeah that's what i need uh good i i i'm gonna hit you up for some recommendations i'll send you some referrals and um and then yeah i i'll eventually coalesce all this feedback to make it so that we could share it publicly and for free so you guys don't necessarily need to pay for your own cancerous doctor to do this for you i think it's ridiculous that like all the work i'm doing here i'm spending this money on it like this should be like a public service that's offered yeah because it's not so personalized to you basically no it's not that personalized 90 of what i'm doing like anyone else should just be able to do on their own it's just not this whole longevity optimization arena is so new and in order for other folks to monetize on it has to feel bespoke and unique to you when so uh give me the quick rundown so you spend this money you have this this program that you're doing you said you do this exosome ivs uh okay great what are like if you were going to go from like most impactful to like you know whatever fringe you know stuff what's the most the most impactful stuff you're doing again i'll be super honest it's hard to know where the impact is um like on just what you what you kind of believe in or what you would recommend to your cousin or your your friend who you you know who you're like look we get all the disclaimers you're not a doctor this is not there you're there's not you know bulletproof science cool okay amongst friends you know just tell me what your opinion is yeah i'm a friend of eg1 i'm sure people have talked about that on your pod before um i'm a fan of uh adding in other there's this whole list of supplements and nootropics that i can't even recite the name of for you but i could publish the list for you if you'd like and then having them all again put together and you know a few compact pills that you could take um and then i have a friend who does that you you like go to a compounding pharmacy and you're like hey can you make these pills for me pretty much cool we'll have like 32 pills delivered like how does that work yeah i have a friend who actually has his own so i get it at cost but my plan is to work with him to create it so that he can make some profit and then my friends will have basically what i take and not have it be marked up too much like all these other scumbag internet companies are trying to do shout out to the scumbags out there keep keep doing your thing that's it in a nutshell i know that's just the why i've used something you found of and then there's also um yeah i mean there are a bunch of peptides as well if you want to do the more advanced thing and on the peptides you know some of them are injectable um so you know that i would consult a doctor on but the supplements you could probably just do right and i would benchmark i would take um the true diagnostics um biological you know each test just to see how you're doing before middle and after and um yeah so that's another so taxes health um coaching and mindset what are the other categories for you know billionaire secrets we haven't covered um i think those are big ones the i mean the other one is what you talked about which is um being non-operational non-operational yeah create a vehicle that's going to create all your other vehicles um and and be able to recruit talent that's going to be able to put the pieces together the way i look at it is like every project needs kind of like a vision it needs capital it needs an operator it needs you know what you know what does it need okay i'm going to be able to create those packages and so that's i think that's what a lot of them do is they they get out of i'm going to go every day and work on this one business and toil away like turning the crank myself and you know that's the the higher leverage way that they they operate is like that yeah exactly yeah i think that's great and um i think also billionaires have a different mindset when it comes to buying expensive things so you think oh they have so much money that why would they waste that on the boat or the plane or the exotic cars and the truth is um on a lot of that it's taxes so i have a friend who's buying a 30 million dollar yacht right now and he found a way for it to give him a 30 million dollar write-off he's going to charter it out for a bit but like he saves more money on taxes than what he's spending on the yacht and his bank will finance 80 of the yacht he's only putting 20 down so it's net net cash flow positive for him to buy the yacht ironically and the operational costs are offset largely by the charter and you don't think that but it pays for all his costs and um people do this with airplanes too i did this with my airplane i mean i had a bigger write-off from buying the airplane then when i put down in cash to buy the airplane so can you give the quick math on uh it doesn't have your specific plan but just like just the general math so people know like how does the buy a plane work from a tax perspective yeah well the rules are changing but i i closed on mine about a year ago and um let's say you buy a plane it's five million bucks and your bank's willing to finance most of it so you put a million dollars down um but you get a five million dollar write-off on the plane and it's a year one right off right now that was a accelerated bonus depreciation year one um but now the problem is this year it's only 80 percent you could deduct up front next year it's 60 and then 40 and then 20. um yes it's getting worse and worse but um but the point is you do get a tax benefit for buying these assets they are financed and then also if it enables you to do more what you want then there's that like incapable benefit that you receive right um same with excited cars a lot of people i know who have excited cars their excited cars are worth more than what they pay for them so they buy the car they drive it for a year and then they sell the car at the same cost or a higher cost than what they paid for it because other people can't they want to have access to that car but they don't have a relationship with the manufacturer and they weren't willing to wait four years on the waiting list to get that car yeah i was surprised to learn that that the um there's just a whole class of really expensive cars that you basically get to drive for free it's like putting a deposit down so you go buy this car uh i don't even know if this would classify but like our friend had a mclaren and he's like yeah it's great i've driven it you know for a few years and i'm going to sell it for exactly what i bought it for it doesn't depreciate or it's up you know i'll make 10 20 grand on this thing for the privilege of driving this around and there's a whole bunch of these like rich get richer uh style setups like you know where if you if once you start to play it's like a snowball it's like you use the money to buy something that's going to make you more efficient and have more fun or uh you know do better business and then that also is going to save you on taxes today and then it also going to hold value because it's a rare asset and so you're gonna you know if you ever sell it you didn't lose anything just for holding this so you know you get all these like gains and then they start to accumulate once you start to get there and i think that's a um a real advantage and you know some people who i think are on the other side of that hate that and they feel like that's so unfair and unjust uh you know i don't really give a moral opinion either way it's just that is what it is and uh you know you could choose to either um benefit from that you could choose to ignore it or you could just be upset about it you have many choices on how you're going to react to uh you know a bunch of these things that that come with you know the snowball of of you know wealth yeah i think i think it's easy to heat on it but what's cool is that people could learn about mindset and how to get there and that's what you're doing with your pod like you're very specific about like how to do these things i've noticed and this was not available to people five years ago so yeah um well well it's funny because like money is this uh taboo thing it's like we're all supposed to not share anything we know about money how much we make what we how we invest what the returns are what taxes what do you do with your taxes like everybody plays you know close guarded on that and uh that's a real shame because it means it's very hard to learn uh until that gets cracked open and somebody starts sharing and then more people start sharing then you start to learn faster and there's this great conor mcgregor quote where he talks about like conor mcgregor went from plumber to highest paid athlete in the world in a span of five years and along the way he was higher paid than any ufc guy ever was faster than anybody was and there was a lot of guys who had been paying their dues for 15 years fighting for you know going out there and like fighting in a cage match for twenty thousand dollars and then they have to pay for their flights or hotels the medical bills and they're left with two grand at the end of it and they were very bitter and someone asked him in an interview they go conor you know do you ever think about kind of toning it down because uh you know there's so many people that are you know get upset when you talk about you call your shots you say how much you're making you wear the nice watch you wear the nice clothes and he goes no that says something about them not me he goes some people see this and they take inspiration and that's who i was i saw people doing things and i took inspiration and other people see things and they get bitterness and they will end up bitter it is not my job to figure out you know they get to decide if they're going to go on the bitterness path or the inspiration path um you know the right people will get inspired and uh that actually kind of freed me up in this podcast to do things that i think you know ask questions or talk about things that i think are you're supposed to to downplay everything you're supposed to not talk about you know certain stuff um but fuck that you know that doesn't seem like like you know i yeah i when i was growing up i couldn't wait to get a little more information or an inspiration or hear you know that somebody oh this guy has a private chef damn that'd be awesome i don't feel bad that i don't have one now i now have a new thing that i've decided that would be really awesome fun to work for and a great like a way to improve quality of life that i had never even thought about and um thank you for putting it on my radar thank you for putting it in my in my uh you know in front of me that i now wanted to go do that i love that yeah like i think it is difficult to struggle with the feeling of jealousy and aspiration and another trick that i'm not sure if this came from 20 robbins or someone else but if you're surrounded by people who are more successful than you instead of envying them um maybe you could interpret it as hey this is a great sign because this means more success and more happiness is coming my way now that i'm able to surround myself and attract these people into my life how awesome and um i remember having to deal with that a lot especially when i was a up-and-coming entrepreneur and i knew absolutely nothing and i have you know drew from dropbox and sam altman coming to speak to me and these like cs students right like we didn't know anything and um and the gap felt very wide by just having them there to spend time with us and to say hey we're open to like just email us if you have any questions about what it's like to be a founder we're going to be there for you just feeling like all the more approachable and accessible i think made it easier for me to focus on the education instead of the envy right that's a that's a great way of putting it can i ask you one thing before we go because i know i took too much of your time uh sam altman is now like this extremely interesting public character um very few people actually know him sounds like you've had interactions with him in the past uh can you give me your impressions or any story you remember of sam altman um because i remember reading paul graham's essays like 10 years ago where he's like of the five most impressive people i've met it's like bill gates or whatever you know larry and sergey and sam altman you know and it's like that's when he was doing looped and nobody you know there was no there was no track record he he sort of was it was like it was just very apparent in meeting him at that time that this guy's going to go on to do great things did you get that sense or um i don't know how much interaction you had with him yeah i actually i mean this was probably 13 years ago now but i i had a one-on-one with polygram and i asked him to share like who do you think the most um you know successful people you've ever met like who will who will that end up being 30 years from now if we have another one-on-one like this and sam was on the list i'm not going to share who others were on that list um but they're all also doing extremely well and um what a question by you by the way fantastic question yeah and i asked paul what are the things in common with these people what what did by the way he put me on the list i'm the worst one by far so i'm embarrassed and i felt like i disappointed him but we'll see that for another day um and i asked him for like what are personality traits you find in these people like how you know what do you see and for him it it was less about the intelligence actually it was not about the it it goes back to this common theme you've had throughout the past hour and a half year on like grit and being willing to be unconventional and to try different approaches and to you know to collect ideas from multiple species and merge them together to come up with something even better than what a domain expert in any one field would be able to come up with on their own um and just like how they show up and what they're willing to do to meet the right people was a big part of um what made so that's that also reinforced my wanting to have this policy of just get on the plane because that's a treat that successful people perceive will lead to you know you being destined for greatness so to speak so all right well i don't think i'm destined for greatness but what if i could manufacture making other people think i'm destined for greatness and maybe you'll actually maybe i'll create that reality somehow yeah eventually you know it walks like a duck it talks like a duck hey it became a duck you know by the end of it actually so so those traits you said just now sorry to recap was um grit or resourcefulness you know like you know the the willingness to make things happen you said um uh going into being being able to collect ideas from multiple spaces and synthesize it so that you actually might create something more than any domain than the individual domain experts had been able to reach you get to a new a new ceiling um from that that was like the second thing you said third was uh wanting to meet the right people ask the right questions and being willing to go to certain lengths to kind of meet them right that was that was the third one did i miss one that you said yeah just to build on that third one is that how can you make yourself interesting enough at a dinner party so that they would want to invite you back to spend more time with them how do you broaden your field of knowledge to be able to be an advisor uh you know someone that you know a king or president would want to call upon for feedback and you know you go to polygram sass or this was years ago before you left for the uk he has a huge library of books and he's read most of these books and and he's just fascinated by so many topics and that also left an impression on me okay like we should just learn about random things that have nothing to do with our day-to-day business because they'll help us with category number three on that list right right yeah that's such a good call i went to a farming conference last year like two years ago like for farmers and it was the best conference i had been to in like five years because i'd only been going to tech conferences and you know i'm not learning anything at these tech conferences or you know like i'm adding the same incremental knowledge and it's the same thoughts and philosophies and same types of people in that bubble and there's nothing wrong with that but like there's definitely like you want that 20 percent like total change up that is um completely at a left field that's like wow these guys talk about different things think about different things have a different perspective live in a different i was in kansas city right like it was like uh you know you go to a different place and you have a totally different perspective and i literally started a company while i was there because i was like piecing together like two ideas one from the tech world and one from this like farmer that we had met and like it you know that was you know when we created the milk road and we even the name milk road was like because we're at a freaking farming conference and there's like a dairy farmer next to us uh you know like it all kind of played into to having that if you know we hadn't stirred the pot in that exact way you know maybe you would have come up with a different answer yeah that's super cool that you did that and i i'm curious to download from you what is also on your list of like the next areas you would want to learn about and um i think it's actually a good exercise for me too to think about because for me it's been bio lately but i i would like to broaden it even more so give an example of one of the bio companies that you founded what you know give us the high level of like the problem the solution you guys are trying to do and like you know the rough stage where it's at yeah the high level is i set up a holding company uh for biotech uh venture creation centered around the scientist named mike levin if you search mike levin he has a ted talk he has a three and a half hour interview with lex friedman that i highly recommend you watch and you will get sucked in because he's a scientist who studied he got he has phd in genetics at harvard and then now he's devoted his entire career to basically proving the fact that genetics are actually not that relevant in the whole scheme of things and that it's this other thing bioelectricity that dictates how long we live um whether or not we get cancer um how our limbs and body shape forms it's actually not as much genetics as you think and genetics is like the hardware level of biology whereas he says bioelectricity is like the software so you you told me this you you were like uh we have one company's astonishing labs it's about bioelectricity and i was like what's i've never even heard this word and you said it in a really interesting way you go um you know people think that it's like genetics is kind of like what your genes say or your dna says is kind of like what ends up manifesting and you're like turns out it's not that at all which already i was like oh that's that kind of narrative violation what is what do you mean i that's all i've ever heard so what is the answer um and you were like yeah there's this idea of bioelectricity and i went and i watched his ted talk and he talks about like you know they're able to like you know grow an arm on something's on an animal's back they're able to like to grow third eye right they're able to do all these like show all these amazing like phenotype outputs without any genetic modification and um so can you just like explain that a little bit more about like you know the kind of the layman's version of it yeah well i i'll be honest i don't even fully understand the science of it but that's everything you said is correct like if you manipulate the bioelectricity on an animal um you can create weird outputs like this so when they saw that a tadpole was growing an eyeball the bioelectric signature of the cells in that area changed and so the question was oh what if he created that same bioelectric signature but on another part of the body what will happen will it grow an eyeball not only does it grow an eyeball there but it grows connection to the spinal cord um and so you don't have to micromanage biology if you try to change that through modifying the genome how would you do that there'd be no way to do that is the answer and so if you just think about it logically genetics are therefore not the end-all be-all so anyway i heard of this it blew my mind i said this this is brilliant like is he does he have a commercialization partner what's the status of it and the answer is it's still in the lab and there was no one commercializing this yet and paul allen was funding the whole lab and then paul allen tragically passed away and then the funding dried up so he needed money he needed people to help him make it a real biotech company so i come in and i say i know nothing about biotech i know a lot of rich people who would love the fun crazy stuff like this um and wait wait wait you say i came in that means like i cold emailed him i i called him i i met him what what did you actually do i met him through a friend so i had a friend who was telling me about mike over lunch and i thought this is brilliant this is amazing could we fly out and meet mike like next week like i'll literally clear my calendar and i'll spend a few days and i will get to know him and figure out what we could do with this and so i met mike spent some time with him and realized that this is really compelling and we could do something cool out of it so um so i hired this guy named tom tom had taken a drug called alsonris from lab all the way through fda approval full approval for 16 million dollars which is absolutely crazy in the drug world like normally it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to get something approved by the fda but his drug actually worked it was putting patients in full remission the first eight out of nine patients normally they would be dead within months with his drug they were they were going into remission so i brought him in to go do uh due diligence on all mike levin's science and figure out a strategy for turning these into real biotech companies and so my contribution was i have 18 i have 12 people who work with me at my holding company or whatever you want to call it for me i don't really think of it as a hold co or a venture studio for me it's just an extension of me where if there's something i want to manifest in the world i have a team of brilliant people who will figure out how to help me make that happen that's amazing and so um so you do that what is the like uh you know what's the product or what are you guys actually building we are building uh several companies under this whole show so the first company we created um is called seljabu and it's essentially a company that will help overcome drug resistance and um how do i make this more concrete if you're taking uh drugs for your leukemia or you're taking chemo drugs it might be effective and work for a while you have lots of drugs that are effective and work but then one day they stop working and when they stop working um unfortunately there are sometimes no other viable options for the patient which means they're going to then die but a month late a month earlier the drugs were working and they were fine right so that's one company there's another company that's developing um programmable human biobots and in fact this got you know there's an article about this in nature as of today and that company is called anthrobots wow so i'll send you more info on that if you're curious um that is really cool i think cnn is going to post their interview with mike today about that as well and so is all your all your bio stuff under the this lab with mike levin or is there are there other biobets too because like you've talked to me about uh you know at that dinner we were talking about um i don't know like pregnancy or something like that and you said something kind of in passing you're like yeah like in the next i don't know at 10 years uh you know you know you'll women may not need to birth a baby like you know you'll be able to just essentially grow a baby and i was like what um so like avatar how cool would it be if you could see like a bb growing in like a fish tank and all you have to do is i could swab your mouth and swab my mouth put it in the machine and then a b you will start to grow out of it you know there's just get the genetic material no sperm and egg no sperm no egg just raw genetic material and uh yeah i think that will eventually be in the future i don't think that's going to be the next 10 years probably not even the next 20 years but i i have random ideas like that this and i think how cool it'd be to find who's doing that research and and if if i find people who are then i might support their work and fund it if not then i'll have i'll put together my own team and go try it ourselves and it's likely going to lose money and fail and not work but like this is fun like not everything has to be for the profit i know your your whole pod is all about making money and all the whole shows are about how to like compound tax flow and blah blah blah but like what if we could have fun doing this and by having fun being mission oriented you think bigger you think more grand about what the world could become one day and then you're more likely to end up like elon or whatever like that's kind of the direction i'm going with with my company here um which i realize it's not as sexy it's not as compelling as saying you know we're you know making money well you know maybe i don't know uh like you know when when facebook was uh going public mark zuckerberg wrote this letter to like the potential shareholders that were going to buy the stock and it was like i think it's called the hacker way it's a really great thing i you know i know people are very skeptical of zuck but i think a lot of the stuff he does is pretty awesome including this letter that he wrote and he described the way that they do things and one of the things he said is like you know we don't build products to make money uh you know you know we don't we don't build products to make great money we we make money to build great products like that is the the core of what we're doing i think google had said a similar thing when they went public and you know i don't think it's one or the other but there is a first order bit and second order bit meaning like if the first order bit is we are trying to fund bold science that might change everything um even though it has a high likelihood of failure even though it might take many years and a lot of money to get there uh but we think that advancing the research and ultimately trying to commercialize the research is the way um that to me is the version of like we don't do that to make money we make money so that we can do that uh so i think in a way it's it's a lot more attractive and sexier to to most people i think if they step back for a minute a lot of the like money first comes from the insecurity right like um just the the sort of wanting wanting that success wanting that win under your belt wanting that safety in the bank account um you know that's where a lot of that comes from i don't think anybody really if they looked at their life would say i'm so glad i devoted it to maximizing you know how much money i made that's a very unlikely scenario i think a lot of people would actually be more uh inspired by you know the way you're doing things now which is like what's fun what's interesting what gets me out of bed in the morning that's exciting that will if done well um can like you know change change change the world uh and in the non-cliche way because the stuff you're doing actually is more change the world than like then you know the ended arrows of the world where it's like we're going to change the world one set of books at a time and it's like well maybe maybe you're just doing bookkeeping actually yeah exactly that's how i felt i i literally had this nagging feeling in my soul that i was wasting my capability and i'm sure a lot of people feel that way awesome well sounds like we got another couple conversations to have thank you for coming on thanks for where should people go find you reach out to you where do you want to direct people yeah um i mean i'm on you know my website's maway.com and i've got a twitter at jessica ma um at just my official on uh instagram and if people want to reach out you could uh either guess my email address which is what i've done with mark benioff and everyone else that's a good filter actually you don't want the inbound that's easy you want the inbound of at least you're at least able to guess an email address it's not that hard just like i had like i literally emailed like mark at salesforce mark.benioff and benioff uh you know like every permutation i could come up with and most of them bounced and one of them worked so that's awesome uh thanks for doing this you're awesome and uh yeah that's a great episode yeah great great time hanging out with you thanks for having me
