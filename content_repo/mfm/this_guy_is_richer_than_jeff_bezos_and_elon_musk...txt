all right let's do this what uh what topics you got today i've got a billy of the week million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars all right so i'm going to tell you some facts about this billy of the week and i want you to see if you can guess who this person is all right okay i'm game so steve jobs so one time steve jobs approached him on advice about designing the apple stores and when they discussed each of their products steve said to this guy i'm not sure if the iphone is going to be very popular in 20 years but i'm certain that your products are definitely going to be popular so that's one interesting thing about him intriguing okay he's had multiple tennis matches with with roger federer he lives in 150 year old castle and last year his company did 84 billion in revenue and 22 billion in operating profits and this might give it away this year his company was the fourth largest company in the world and oftentimes he's number one on the richest person in the world the louis vuitton guy the louis vuitton guy what's his name i don't know how to say his name because it's french we're going to call him bernie but uh it's uh it's bernard arnold i don't know if the t's silent sorry but it's usually not a hard t but we're going to go with that yeah is that a hard t or is that a soft t i don't know bernie arnie you are the man uh so so steve jobs really went to this guy huh dude yeah and a lot of people really respect this guy so i'll like give you a little bit about his background but some facts about him so he owns 46 so the louis vuitton empire it's called lvmh so it's a multinational luxury goods conglomerate deal market cap of 430 billion oftentimes him elon and like bezos go back and forth uh but he's kind of the odd man out because he's not like he like dresses really nice and he like looks as like a someone who owns louis vuitton would look he like has this black turtleneck and a nice sports jacket but he's been called the um uh well i believe it's like the the uh the wolf and cashmere sweaters or something like that because he's like he's pretty ruthless but he like dresses nice but um uh yeah i'll tell you a little bit about him so at 21 it's kind of an interesting background they call you the denim fox right the denim fox yeah yeah yeah i wish the jort juggernaut is what they call you the dog and the canadian tux that's what i'm known for uh the denim dog uh so listen at 21 bernie joined his father's construction company after finishing his engineering degree and by 25 he was the ceo of the company the company wasn't small at all at the time it was doing uh something like 10 million in revenue which is the equivalent of 40 million now and had a thousand employees but right when he joined he like he said let's expand so we got into like some he started investing investing the profits in some finance businesses into real estate things like that then in 1981 he goes to the us and he starts expanding the business and eventually he like specializes specializes in townhomes sells a bunch of them makes the equivalent of 75 million dollars now uh which was 25 million back then or that's what he sold his company for i don't know what he made from it but there's an interesting thing that happens so he's in the cab he's in a taxi in new york and he asked the taxi driver if he heard of the president of france and the taxi driver was like nope never but i know all about christian dior who uh you know dior is like a like a luxury uh a luxury brand and he started thinking he's like okay so this guy who's like just a normal guy in new york doesn't know who the president of france is but he knows all about christian dior like maybe i should explore uh like luxury brands and so he buys the holding company eventually of dior and it was like all like he got inspired by that first taxi cab meeting he raises a bunch of money buys it fires a ton of people turns it around sells like the other brands that dior owns and it's a really good success and that's like his first big entry into luxury brands then in 1987 he gets the idea uh uh to buy louis vuitton and he does the same thing where he raises a bunch of money and he buys it and he fires a bunch of people and definitely turns it around a big deal was it doing was it very successful at the time or was it like distressed it was christian dior was like distressed when he bought it they both were distressed but they were both brands and so that kind of brings us to like the big point here which is i mean louis vuitton has been around for hundreds of years um or at least 100 years um i think from that since the 1800s but they they were kind of mismanaged so have you seen that movie with i think it's lady gaga lady gaga where she like is is that how they say it lady gaga where she have you seen that movie where she plays like the wife of like the gucci guy and like murders him i saw part of it yeah yeah you saw the trailer to be honest with you yeah it was only deece but uh you know big gaga fan so uh they uh it's like mismanaged so like a lot of these family businesses they like have great style but it's kind of like you know like a a singer managing their own career like maybe like you know the left part of the brain doesn't actually work well with business but it works well with creating stuff and so it was the same thing where it was definitely mismanaged he raises all this money and he just turns them into an operation powerhouse and then he just starts going on a on a spree where he starts buying all this stuff so he owns all these brands he owns uh you know i don't freaking buy any of this so i'm gonna look like an idiot talking about it but sephora which is like the big makeup thing um fendi which is another popular thing bulgari mark jacobs like if everything that a woman aspires to own he owns like a huge portion of of that market but i want to tell you about a few of the things um that interest or that make me interested in this guy and first have you have you heard about him do you know anything about him uh i'd only seen him because he's at the top of the rich list and he you know lvmh but i didn't know i didn't know this backstory so go on so what interests me about him is i think peter teal has this book what's that book called that zero to one zero to one and it's awesome um i i really like reading that book and it kind of had an impact on me where he talked about like extreme personalities and uh having extreme results and all about like an engineering culture yada yada but there's one part of the book where he lists out all the moats he's like you can have like you can like know like a secret that no one else knows you could have like a patent you could have technology that no one else has whatever but and then he mentions there's this one moat called brand that's a huge moat and i think he's like i never understood brand so i don't know how to invest in this there's one sentence and he says this is definitely a boat not for me i don't get it i don't understand it and i always thought that was funny because when a lot of like tech people discuss moats they talk about like technology networks effects yada yada rarely do they discuss brand well this guy bernie that's truly what he understood where he was like no they're like that's where all my margin is because i can create a brand i'm going to create luxury goods i'm going to get luxury margins and not only that it's going to live for forever so uh louis vuitton by the way was founded in 1854 and he his whole thing was like in 10 years there'll be far fewer luxury brands and the ones that survive will be more important because people are getting richer and richer and richer and if a brand has been around for 50 years he thinks it can be around for another 50 or 150 years so that's like his whole shtick and i thought that was interesting and he um has this rare combo of operational excellence and also like good style and understanding brand because typically this might be an overreaching statement but a lot of times these really rich people are like maybe like uh what's his name um uh warren buffett might be a little bit like that where he like sees like what a good business is and he's like well i don't care this could probably last for a long time let's just do it i can look at the spreadsheets and i can understand it and then other times there's people who are like this is a sick brand and they just totally but they totally mismanage it and they're not numbers oriented but then you got a guy like this guy who like does a pretty good job of like being pretty ruthless that you like you need to be in order to make the business hugely profitable and very successful but also like understands like vision and some of these intangible things basically like how to make cool which is very very very challenging it's hard to have just that let alone both of those features so i thought that guy was interesting um and he has a few interesting quotes and i'll wrap up so luxury goods are the only area which is possible to make luxury margins for me luxury is how do you create desire and then he says i'm optimistic long-term pessimistic short-term so interesting interesting guy he is here's another one i think that's like um something about being rich without uh being famous he has some some quote like that he's not quite a recluse but he like owns this island in the bahamas where he spends most of his time obviously flies private and is somewhat under the radar compared to bezos who's in the news with his you know new girlfriend and things like that this guy's pretty low-key and his business he owns like all the voting shares and all that and he when he dies he always says he's giving 20 to each of his five children and it's run like a family business so in that regard he's pretty low-key and out of out of the out of media uh mostly right uh yeah okay i can't really fully find it but uh he had said some there's some french phrase which is like the only uh something about uh something about being you know being happy uh you know basically it was it was something around the idea of you want to be wealthy but not rich and he had some cool french way of saying it but i can't find it off the top of my head here well it'd be like it'd be a lot cooler if you did but that's all right sure would well that's my that's my billy of the week dude i have another like weird internet culture thing that i was uh kind of related to like your engineers i was thinking about this and i think that what i'm about to say is incredibly not normal but i think for you it's normal and it's incredibly normal for me and it's probably normal for a bunch of our friends so i was thinking about this we got we i have this new researcher that you're trying to steal from me a little bit um and he i met him through a friend of a friend but it all started on twitter and the twitter dms and without talking to this person like whether a phone or or zoom or whatever meeting in person we just like text and we hire them and we do a business exchange and like you put a lot of trust in one another and i've realized i've done this like 20 times where some of like my best co-workers and best uh some of my best friends in fact it just started like through internet culture and we very rarely exchange words and we've done like some relatively big business together where we're like exchanging tens of thousands of dollars a month or we've invested one another companies or whatever so i've done it with the partner of my latest company uh joe we basically were facebook friends have you ever met yeah maybe only like six times um but like we knew each other for like five years before we really uh like talked a lot in person i've done it with this guy diego who uh i'm helping him with his agency business i heard a funny story from about you on this so uh somebody who's worked with you goes yeah sam gave me the login to his instagram or something like that or to linkedin i don't know what it was and what is it that you requested back from this internet stranger sam i asked for his social security number i asked for his girlfriend's social security number i asked for uh a picture id of both him and his girlfriend and a utility bill so i knew exactly where he lived the sampar school of background checks like dude what is your plan okay let's say what is he gonna do all right let's say he posts something or changes the password what are you gonna do with this utility bill and his social security number what is your what is your revenge well i don't know but i know it's scary enough that if someone has that i i don't know sign him up for a credit card i would i would show up to his house for sure i would commit a crime yeah i don't know but uh i don't know maybe it's like scary enough that it worked but have you done this have you like done business with a bunch of it's not anonymous people because you actually get to know them but internet it's like a weird internet totally totally that's like very normal now at this point which is strange it shouldn't almost feels like it shouldn't be normal but it is i don't think it's normal for most people i mean it just seems natural i feel like i know these people i see their writing or i hear their podcasts or they they email me a bunch of times and we go back and forth and then they're in my slack and then sure enough it's like hey you know here's everything yeah here's the keys to the castle and once you get that then once you're working together or you're doing things together that builds even more trust and it just layers on and then you meet them four years later and you're like you see them in person and you're like nice to meet you uh you know you don't know what to say it's like nice to see your nice to see your body that's really the accurate way to say nice to see your face finally yeah like sick legs dude i'm i'm okay not meeting these people i i like it how it is if it ain't broke don't fix it like i i enjoy these types of relationships yeah we have this feature not a bug right for sure and we have this one dev i have this dev working on a project uh that i have and he's in hong kong and he's in high school and he built this amazing thing and i don't really know anything about him other than i want to work with you for a very long time and like i was just he sent me some of his work and it was so awesome and i just realized this is super odd and also amazing and i don't think a lot of people realize that you could like do business like this because i'll tell my family and they'll think i'm crazy but it's become so normal at this point that i don't even i i forget that it's not normal amongst others right right yeah totally i've also a lot of my real life friends i just sort of like shifted more to online i'm like hey let's we can hang out 10 times more through the group chat and through a bunch of a bunch of these little like like you know apps or things like that i feel like i get to know them better that way almost and you know anybody got time to hang out in person anymore and now we know why the birth rate in america is declining rapidly but yeah this basically like is uh a thing that i do and i thought i should bring that up because i don't think most people realize like how some of that stuff happens and it's actually quite random how it happens but if i see like a 19 year old who's like impressive or like a 21 who's impressive and like writes well and is like clever in my dms some this sounds like creepy but i'm like i'm i'm i'm interested in giving them a shot on something and so it's really cool how these like little projects actually turn into like pretty meaningful things after a while right yeah they're iybs interesting young boys and samson on the list isn't that a michael jackson song pretty iob pretty little things all right no disrespect all right i want to tell you about somebody interesting i met recently too so did we talk about chris uh spiraling on the podcast yet yeah so uh we have this great friend named andrew wilkinson who has maybe close to a billion dollar empire and chris is his partner in crime and i had never met him until we went to that event in vancouver for the show and you guys are really similar you guys are very similar me and him you have similar some some similar uh parts of you yeah yeah for sure um a couple of a couple of observations i would say about him um i want to i want you to tell me if you because you've interacted with him right you've met him only a couple times but yeah and we're both very interested in these kind of like high performers especially in this case it's a high performer who went and built their own island and did they won in their signature way i think that that's particularly what's interesting to us like if somebody's just like i don't know some vp at google i'm a lot less interested than somebody like chris who basically made their own path i think he you know andrew met him when he was working at a bank he was like a banker uh not like a cool investment banker but like a go to the bank i need to write a check banker and they started talking about cars because andrew had drove up in a cool car and uh they both nerd out about cars and then they were like okay what's going on you know what do you need for you're getting like a line of credit or whatever for your business what's your business uh chris was like yeah i'm like studying to be like a cpa or like i'm about to get my my license to be an accountant or something like that and um andrew was like hey you want to just leave here with me and like you know work with me and you know chris that actually happened at the bank he didn't say it like that but he you know he offered him a job he's like you should come work with me uh like i need help at the time andrew just had metalab his design agency was doing well and um had gotten to maybe a couple million dollars a year of profit um you know let's call it i don't know four or five years in something like that uh but so so he hadn't started what became tiny which was acquiring a bunch of other internet companies and so chris tells the story here's some of the things i took away from this uh this this meeting so one interesting part of the story he goes so my first day at work i show up uh andrew's not there i'm just like waiting at the door and um 30 minutes go by andrew's not there andrew rolls up in an uber with like you know one airpod hanging out of his ear or whatever and he's got he opens up the trunk he takes up this giant box full of papers and he's like he's like you're here okay fantastic here's uh all of our papers for like you know here's the business finances um i gotta go to a meeting and there's no office space for you so i talked to my neighbor they have room in their basement so just go knock on the door tell them you're with andrew and like there's a desk in their basement and like here's this box of papers and he's like andrew left and chris is like man i made a huge mistake uh who is this guy what is happening here he goes he knocks on the door he's like hey um do you have like a basement desk for me yeah yeah come on in it's like when you see the guy with the hole in his boot you know you're there make it right the oldest boot exactly he's like so that's how i started and then i go okay so then that time he's just doing metal lab so what how did this become tiny and he goes uh well we looked at the business and the business was good business was generating revenues generating profit it's like okay well like what do we do with this profit um what are we supposed to you know should we reinvest this in some way into the business like can we grow can we should we hire people he goes i don't know what do all agencies do he goes agencies hire a bunch of people uh and then buy fancy offices they put a basketball hoop in the office like you know they put a play pit in the office and he's like yeah that doesn't seem like a good idea we should not do that that's kind of the only thing they agreed on let's not do that they go well okay we can't follow agencies to figure out what we should do like you know how should we think about this and they go well look we're a business that has clients and we have you know like a service team and then we have some profits like we are a boring law firm let's just pretend we're a boring law firm uh let's not try to be a cool agency let's be a boring law firm and not get too high on our own supply okay so what what could we do with these profits if we weren't going to like try to just get flashier and flashier with the design agency um and that's where they decided let's buy a better business than our current business so like let's buy a business that has recurring revenues maybe that has less service oriented more product and let's use the profits from the service business to buy increasingly better businesses so i thought i liked that story that frame i enjoyed that and what was the first thing they bought was it dribble no that wasn't the first thing i don't know i don't know exactly what the first thing they bought is but honestly it was probably another agency is my guess but you know regardless now that's kind of the start of their journey so i'd never met chris andrew uh talks a little bit about him but you know you never really know uh what people are like here's my observations chris had the juice and it was very surprising to me that chris had the juice because normally in these partnerships there's like the outgoing uh face of the brand that everybody knows and then there's like the quiet silent but deadly operational partner finance partner whoever partner that's like doesn't really care about the spotlight um and usually is more reserved i would say most of that is true but at this dinner i thought it was remarkable that he was kind of like this like it was shy but he still had the juice and i've never really seen that combo before like i think he would have rather just been at home reading a book but he had this thing which is like i'm at this dinner so the flip is the switch is flipped and he was like super talkative and not with not because he's mr charisma or he's not like dripping with like you know he's like the smooth charm he has wisdom it feels like he was he was just like i would call it honest he was just like he would ask a question and if he said something he'd be like hold on hold on so is it like this or he'd be like but you're saying this is that because you think that or is that because your parents taught you that why did you say that and he was asking that's one of them very pointed that's what reminds that's one of the ways in which you guys are similar is you ask those same questions i do and i so i was eating it up i was loving it i was like oh this guy's right up my alley the other thing he did that was like me but times 10 is he was like mr framework exactly you guys are the exact same way for that reason i called him out the dinner i was like bro you have just named 14 different like cognitive biases in one dinner it's crazy like he'd be like it's like the strike stand effect mixed with the thing that you know the the the the like you know the sucker's bias and it's like what are you talking about he had just like an index he had an index of mental models i was like this i was like did you download twitter threads and you just memorize them like how do you know all this and why are they so top of mind for you and that's really how he thinks he he truly seems to think that way which i thought was really interesting well you know why so andrew told me this i don't know like the what chris's story is but andrew said they basically were like building their own companies and like reinvesting the profits into building their own things and then they read the biography of warren buffett i think it's called snowball or something and then they read like a charlie munger book and they go oh yeah let's do this instead and so they start buying companies at work and they have the you know like i think tiny's website says we buy wonderful companies that's basically i think exactly what buffett said uh at one point tiny is just we buy wonderful internet companies and then yeah but birchard just doesn't have internet in it right and so they basically stole uh you know a lot of buffett's really great ideas and also have you ever read a charlie munger book or anything by charlie munger yeah yeah for sure dude they're all frameworks about everything there's like one's called like poor charlie's almanac i think it's called and it's like 88 different frameworks i started reading it and i'm like dude i need a story here but yeah it was a very strange book people say they love that book and i'm convinced that anybody who says they love that book hasn't actually opened it because when you open it it's not even like a book it's like a have you have you have you actually opened the book yeah i read the whole thing and i found it very hard to even remember it's hard to read dude it's like it's like a list of rules yeah yeah yeah it's like the table of contents except it's long it's a very challenging book to read but i what i remember from the book and then hanging out with chris is like oh you read a lot of munger because you guys are sort of similar in that framework and another thing buffett does is like he'll say things i forget exactly what he phrases but he's like uh you know why kill a mice why kill a mouse when we can go and shoot an elephant like he'll say things like this or he'll like create some analogy picking up pennies in front of a steamroller or you know these things he said that to me we were talking about something he goes so is that like diamikli's sword that slays the beast and i was like i was like what the are you talking about like i was like uh i don't know what that is what are you saying in english and he's like no like you know the story of dio whoever there's some greek guy and i was like no i don't know any of these things what are you talking about yeah it's like dude i need an analogy for your analogy but i've noticed that chris uh the limited time that i've been around him he does the same thing where i can tell who he's read and he's really good at what he does and i think he's also naturally like that he just like thinks in frameworks and analogies and things like that he can take complicated things and make them quite simple totally and he uh i think he's really really like super curious which i really respected about him like i felt like when he was asking questions he wasn't doing it to make conversation he was doing it because he actually really wanted to know the answer he was genuinely interested and i think that comes up comes off and i think that is a huge um like saving grace for i think people overthink how to be in social situations and like you know the easiest hack is just simply genuinely be interested in the other person everything else will work itself out um that's how i felt about chris and i really like that we had a interesting different conversation i'll share one uh one little tidbit that that can take a dinner conversation from surface level to a lot more interesting and um i forgot who was talking it was the ceo of something and um she said something and i go i go let me ask you a question a little bit a little bit of a weird question can i ask you and she's like yeah and i go um growing up i said what you said was really interesting just now and it made me wonder why you why you wanted that so bad growing up whose love did you want more your mom or your dad's oh my god and uh you know she immediately like it's like you know take it taken aback by the question and then kind of answers and then and people open up about their like they open up about their relationship with their parents and also like it's kind of like where'd that chip on your shoulder come from is really what this question is asking and i stole this from tony robbins tony robbins asked this question and i saw that like in most of he does these like uh live kind of coaching sessions or whatever with people during his events and he had asked this question and it immediately found like the actual answer to the to the problem and since then i've like kept this question in my back pocket and i ask it from time to time it's a very revealing question um hard to say without sounding like just like a pretentious prick um yeah did you have like your like glasses like in your mouth like yeah yeah exactly you got it the tip of the frame the tip of the the glass needs to go into the mouth and you have to be wearing a turtleneck but if you do happen to have a turtleneck on it is such a good turtleneck question that's ridiculous and it worked oh it worked and then the whole the whole table kind of shared their answers to it and it went from like all right we can either sit here and we'll go one inch deep or like we ended up 50 feet deep and i felt like everybody actually felt like they knew each other and um and it was like after the fact it was like so what do you do again it's like you know you're trying to it kind of reverse the order of how most of these like kind of networking dinners go and i've been to a lot of these and so like i appreciate something that can break out of that the surface level you know surface level stuff fluff that's not really that interesting dude i was at this one dinner recently and this guy who was a younger guy and he was like a fan of our stuff so he was and he like clearly like was learning how to interact with people like he was like an internet guy who like read how to win friends and influence people and the first thing that he said to me and my wife was like he was trying to do what you did and he asked us like when did you guys first have sex and what was it like uh and i swear to god and i like i i was so frustrated and i was like i'll answer your question but you got to answer mine first how much money is in your checking account how long is your dick and what was it like when you saw your parents having sex for the first time and he was like what i go yeah that's weird right i don't want to talk about that don't be weird and he clearly had like read like a book on how to do this and then he like saw something you said and i thought that would have been a good idea and it wasn't it was a total myth well there's something that you got to do right you can't just ask out of the blue oh he did the only reason this question worked on ours was because when somebody's explaining the chip like they have this chip on the shoulder you're basically it's a natural question to ask where did it come from and then they give you some answer you say all right let me ask you a different question and you dig in that way you can't just go up to somebody be like hello i'm sean nice to meet you hey i'm just curious what's your deepest darkest secret right like it doesn't really work like that yeah it was weird man it was weird it was one of these guys i'm uh it was horrible uh but you pulled it off this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated whoa i can see the client's whole history call support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better all right what else you got um okay oh i'll give you one other uh chris little gem that that came out of the talk uh somebody was telling a story about somebody else and and it was kind of a story that was like uh what do they call it like a romp which is basically like it's a wrong like like it's like a it's like a tale about like your you know you could tell a tale of like your drunken days and this the the crazy thing that happened we almost got arrested then we ended up fine right it's like it's a story that doesn't have a lot of like it's not like a meaningful story it's an entertaining story and um and so person telling the story about like this business romp so somebody was like gonna get rich and then they like went almost unbroke and then now they're okay and like you know whatever happened and he goes and and the the takeaway was you know that you know that person they said you know yeah they could have they could have sold the top and made a bunch of money but they said you know well if i had done that then i wouldn't have blah blah blah blah and he said something that has stuck with me which he goes do you think that's the right lesson to learn out of that and he goes he goes i wonder that sometimes he goes people always talk about like how the lessons that they said this chris and he goes um he goes a question i've often asked he's like is this person somebody who's learning the right lesson out of things and i thought it was so funny uh it was like a blunt thing to say and so i loved it already the second thing was it's so true i look around the people around me in life that i encounter and very rarely like if like a lot of people have experience go through experiences and think they learn a lesson but if i was to measure like the hit rate of are they actually having the correct takeaway out of a situation it's shockingly low and i think that that is one of the greatest indicators of success is are you actually able to learn the correct lesson from your life experiences um nobody's 100 on that because we all have weird things where we'll blame other people or we'll glorify ourselves and not realize that we just got lucky we'll do weird things like that but um i realized oh i want to only be around and work with people and hire people who are high on this score i don't really care how much experience you have but if you don't take away the right lesson from the experiences you're going that you have uh and that you're going to have your rate of learning is just gonna like it it'll be a different rate or you'll just end up in some weird trajectory where you'll just do dumb because you're taking away the wrong lessons from your life experiences and i i just never heard somebody say that out loud and it really stood out to me and it's like now i see it everywhere that's a that's a really good question i wonder if that is something that he came up with or like was inspired by i mean that's a hard thing that's a really unique that's a really unique he said it kind of as an offhand comment this one wasn't one of his like frameworks or like go-to's i could tell it was just like he literally just asked the question because he was because it was he hurt like it was kind of like uh you know when somebody starts a sentence and you kind of your brain is trying to fill in the blank of the last thing they're going to say and then they say something totally different you're like that is not where i thought you were going with that that's what happened in the story it's like 90 of it kind of made sense and then the last 10 of the conclusion was like some other weird conclusion and he was like what is that the way that was the conclusion i feel like the conclusion should have been x but you're saying their takeaway was why what uh and and and so i don't even think he really meant it that way or he really put that much weight into it but that was my my golden nugget of that dinner was that one question and uh and i can't i literally can't stop seeing it everywhere now like my kid does something my wife does something i do something and i i started to think back i was like in what areas did i take away the wrong lesson like i don't know if you think back in your life can you think of an example where if you're honest with yourself it's like yeah actually i kind of learned the wrong i kind of did i even learn the right lesson from that was that the right answer there's a few things like you know how that phrase like fail fast like i used to believe that that was cool and then i'm like i'd rather succeed fast like yeah like i'd rather not fail and like how could i succeed faster than i fail and i remember thinking thinking like for years i was thinking well it's okay i tried something and i'm like but like if i'm a baseball player and i take lots of swings but i don't get any hits like that's bad that's not good that's very bad so the lesson here is i should swing and also have a high batting average and i remember thinking like oh just shots on goal that's all that's all that matters but i'm like no i need a score too and so for years like i thought it was okay to fail because i'm feeling fast i'm moving fast i'm breaking things whatever and i'm like maybe i shouldn't break things and i should actually like succeed fast and i remember like that like it changed like five years ago yeah yeah totally uh yeah i can think of a bunch of examples in my life where i've i think messed that up but now did you um that's not the case did you learn the right lesson when you got roasted by some people for posting your private chef dude you posted this picture of this nice looking food and people are like dude your blood glucose is going to spike and you're going to be so unproductive because you're eating rice uh i thought that was pretty funny all the all some of the hate you got yeah also that wasn't rice whatever it was people were like giving you a hard time i thought it was pretty funny you only clapped back a few of them there's three or four reactions reaction one so what did i do i posted a tweet that was just like a delicious meal i was so happy i was having this meal i said best life decision was hiring a family chef and um there was four reactions there was the uh predictable positive which was oh yum looks good there was predict predictable negative which was uh hey douchebag people are struggling in the world you're posting this like you nice flex you know uh so there's predictable negative there was the predictable um next question which was how much does this actually cost um you know like what goes into this which is a fine question no no problem and then uh and then there was just like you know whatever the sort of like the the random or like the the interesting the i think the person who had the right answer from it which was you either should just move on if it's not interesting to you or if it is interesting to you you should be like yeah that's something i want in my life let me put bring that back to the front of my brain um as something that like you know i kind of want and um i thought that i thought it was very funny i didn't even know i wanted that until i met somebody who had a private chef and i was like wow this is incredible so you're telling me like instead of them having to cook three meals a day and they're you know also they have a wife and kids like you know instead of their whole family have to cook three meals a day do grocery shopping do the dishes to end up with a meal that doesn't taste as good isn't as healthy um and takes up you know probably on average three to five hours you know per day if you average it all out including the the groceries and the cleaning and the cooking and the all of it um and you know but by the way three hours a day out of your like you know people have only have like 16 waking hours right like this is a it's a really significant chunk of time per day i was like well i saw it and i was like oh that's a goal that i didn't even know i should have but i want that and i want that way more than i want uh uh you know a ski home in tahoe or like a fancy car or those types of things and then i for i didn't do anything about it for a while because i assumed oh you got to be like a billionaire to have that no you can get them for as cheap as maybe a thousand a month maybe and then i was like oh let me do the math like how much you actually need to do this and then i did the math i was like oh i think i could do this now and then i just did it and my life got way better and so i posted it because a just whatever it's twitter i didn't really think too much about it but like um you know there is a benefit in seeing somebody's uh like somebody do a decision in life or have something in life that uh is attractive to you and brings it you know to your attention and makes you think about do i want this do i not uh can i have this can i not you know i think there's some value in that too so anyways that's that's my story on the tweet i thought it was pretty funny um i thought it was hilarious i am i was frustrated you didn't like holler at some of these people i almost started replying to them for you yeah i haven't decided if i'm a heel or a face yet so to use wrestling terms like um i'm tempted to just be a heel uh you know like it's way easier in the world i would say like uh what's his name the the dude who loves keith for boy yeah i called him out i i don't like that guy well you don't like him because he's a heel uh which is right uh you know he basically um doesn't mind pissing people off telling people telling people off whatever it is and like that's his brand and he and some people are like man i love it this guy just tells it like it is or he's funny or you know he must be you know he basically has this aura of i'm better than you like like many great wrestling villains and um and he'll tell you how much you suck and so people some people hate that a lot of say majority people hate that and then there's a minority people that love that and find him like interesting and either way you can't ignore him he's like a you have to take a position because it's so um polarizing it's not just like you know vanilla and i would say you actually do a lot of what he does where i don't think you think you're doing it uh because you're like i didn't say anything bad it's like bro you put a period at the end of that line that just you know when you put the period there you're saying like that's a middle finger you know that's not a period um do you know you're doing it when you're doing it or not all the time maybe some of the time but i think i don't like um like i'm kind of a stickler with language like i like using certain words so if someone like says something and they end it in a question mark my reply will be like i don't know if you're asking a question or if you're getting me to agree with you stupid or do you know what i mean like i just like i just like or when people like sensationalize things like well they'll say like well this happens all the time like for example someone replied to you and they go i've been seeing a lot of this lately my example what i want to reply with is like oh okay well what are some other examples right do you like i it's like i just don't like when you say i think i did i was like like what yeah just curious like what what are you talking about i'm a stickler with language i don't like when people say this always happens or this never happens or these people are everywhere like things like that i don't like that phrase or this is so common uh that is becoming an issue i'm like well i i actually don't think that it's any more common than it has ever been uh anyway so i'm an asshole about that um you want to do one more topic yeah uh let's do uh do you have one no i blew my load early oh wow just all in on bernie huh uh and the internet thing why do you think it is that i generate so many more ideas than you let's go let's did your mommy not do you your daddy not love you if we look at the three years that we've done this i think it ebbs and flows i think that each person goes on a chance dude dude each person goes on a three month like run dude 100 i think you talk more but i don't think that i don't think that you necessarily bring more topics right right i think that when i was you believe that but thanks for your permission when i was selling the hustle you carried me when you were selling milk road my shoulders got tired that's all i'm gonna say these delts weren't getting come from nothing these are milk road yeah that's all i'm gonna say so i think it ebbs and flows there was a there's a guy who basically took every idea from the podcast and put it in a database this is how i know i win because he took every idea from the podcast and put in a database and he said it was 75 percent me 25 you but that's specifically on ideas not topics but that's maybe ideas yeah yes like this bernie guy that's not an idea right come on that's that that's that's you're definitely you're definitely the king of the billing of the week i think uh you somehow know a bunch of these old ass in different spaces and uh and you you find these guys i don't know how you find these guys or how you think it's just wikipedia bro yeah but like why do they even get on your radar you'll be like this guy used to own this coal mine and then he bought the shoe factory and then he owns like you know you ever read the st louis post and i'm like nah yeah he owns that so i'm like i don't know how you found this guy but you know more power to you i just books can i give you okay let me give you a couple uh let me do an idea i'm gonna go rapid fire i'm gonna i'm gonna just empty the chamber here on some some things that have been on my list um i have a d2c idea that i'd like to do pass uh by i'd like to do that means i'm not gonna do it but i want to invest and advise somebody who does it who's really good wait do you still ever want to launch an e-com store uh i don't know i'm torn i don't want to operate it myself but i do want to like incubate them i do want to like incubate them and hire a ceo that would run them in theory but uh that might also be difficult um so i have a gut health one so gut health is uh this is nothing new so let me just start this by saying oh bro this that exists yeah i know it exists um almost every d2c idea you've had exists um gut health is a uh a trend that is going up up and up and it fits a sales model that really works with d2c what do i mean by that you mean you could just buy it over and over again you never know if it actually works so what works in d2c uh a d2c pro a great d2c product is one that is going to be high margin so maybe uh can you get to 75 80 gross margins well with supplements you can get to 80 85 gross margin so that's fantastic on the product itself the next thing that works in d2c is that it's a repeat purchase or it's a consumable so something that somebody's going to buy many times they'll shop from you again and again because either they ran out they ate it they drank it or the you know the deodorant stick ran out whatever it is unlike a mattress unlike a mattress um so so you want something that people grow out of or run out of and um so so high review purchase rate well supplements have that as well health and wellness has that um as well you want something that is a uh as a problem solution fit so basically you want something that is not just like a kind of nice to have fashion item um what works better uh in what's sells better is something that you can just say do you have this problem we have the solution and this is why you see if you go scroll down to the bottom of a new york post article you're going to see a toe fungus ad why is a toe fungus ad always there because guess what people have toe fungus it's a very easy problem to point out and people are looking for a solution and willing to buy something that tells that that promises them that it's going to uh go away so uh do you remember um the prompt the best promise solution ever is uh claude hopkins he invented the advertising for toothpaste in the 1920s and he said rub your tongue over the your teeth you feel that film now brush with our toothpaste crest now rub your tongue over your front teeth right that was the best problem that's like an easy to understand like oh i see exactly what you mean well and this this solves it why that one's even better is when you get to be the one diagnosing the problem you have way more authority and you're basically creating a new problem category for people that they weren't fully aware of and so this happened this is why i like gut health a lot five years ago i didn't hear anybody talking about gut microbiome leaky gut i personally got i'm sure there was love that i love that phrase it's beautiful branding i hear beautiful brand i have i have a family member who's just like oh i'm super worried about leaky gut and i'm like what and she's like yeah i bought every book i watch these youtube videos and dude it scares the out of me and like now i drink apple cider vinegar i do this i do that i'm like hmm interesting somebody just like created a problem taught you about it you might or may not have it no way to know it's a beautiful bunch of solutions and it was branded in this way that sounded horrible i don't want a leaky gut it's a it's a it's a it's spooky is what it is it's a spooky phrase just like cleansing it's like i'm gonna do on a juice cleanse like bro i don't think like this juice is like a pipe cleaner and it like is going through pipes i don't know if that's how it works so i um so i bought this domain drink guts.com and i have this idea for this brand called guts and guts is basically a drink that uh that you drink for it's like it's like a protein powder and you drink it for gut health and um it helps with digestion so a lot of people who are either constipated or going to the bathroom all the time uh it helps with weight loss it helps with sugar control it helps with those those sorts of things um so yeah so i think i can incubate this brand and i just need an amazing marketing ceo and so i'm looking for that uh have you uh have you heard of olipop uh i've heard of olipop i've drank an olipop before yeah so olipop is basically it looks like a soda or a seltzer it looks exactly like this i'm drinking spin spin thrift right now it's just like water with a little bit of fruit in it it looks just like that except it says like probiotic on the can yes which always turns me off by the way i'm like nah i don't want that weird stuff turns me on probiotic dude no who's antibiotic you dude i'm anti-biotic i'm not probiotic i'm neutral on the biotics at least but i'm definitely not pro but uh you know how do you feel about oxidants yeah are you pro oxidants dude i'm what's it michael scott say he goes i wouldn't say i'm superstitious but i am a little stitious uh uh olipop do you know how big they are i think they're huge dude i see them in every grocery store 100 million plus and they're doing a very similar thing poopy or poppy you seen this one no but it's like an even more uh it's like a gut health soda or like a probiotic like la croix and uh i see that one popping up at whole foods dude when i think probiotics i think diarrhea like you're gonna do something to my poop like yeah so i think that's where the branding opportunities come in uh to to fix that guts doesn't exactly help your cause here i know but i think it's a loud uh splashy name that can be almost like so bad it's good and uh i don't think it's very trademarkable i think that's the the problem with it but i kind of want to work with a designer just to make a fake pdc like packaging of this i kind of want to crowdsource this idea through mfm so basically i'm like let's find a marketing ceo through this i have i have a guy in mind um let's get somebody who's a design agency like let's make the packaging for fun and uh and see what we could do somebody who's like a supply chain guy let's go find the formulation lab like let's just like crowdsource this idea i think that would be a lot of fun what here's something i want to test so this what you're saying reminds me so we're in the 55th minute or something like that of this pod and you're saying like something where you want to you're saying a call to action i'm curious how many people you're going to get last episode or two episodes ago we were talking about my airbnb and i said marathonranch.com i go yeah if it's airbnb you can see that marathonranch.com and i just kept talking i was curious how many people went to the site um do you have a guess oh i mean i would guess it's low i'm going to give you the homie guess i don't know 100 visits so we set it at minute 38 or something like that like not in the beginning it got like three or four thousand views and not one not one booking by the way not one booking uh not one to be clear yeah one time i shared it on twitter and i got two million impressions not one booking so not one booking so it didn't help me at all but i'm curious i bet you you'll get maybe 15 qualified people messaging you one time you talked about this thing you wanted a woman to holler at you for this woman brand that you were working on and people started hollering at me to get to you and like four of them were like instagram women like models like wearing thawing bikinis and like trying to reach me to talk to you and my sarah was like oh saw my phone i'm like dude this this lady like she's like what are you looking at like check this out this lady just dm'd me try to talk to sean it was it was a pretty funny yeah i also like that you say holler at still uh it's like i still say tight when i think something's cool how about dank i'm trying to bring dank back do you remember dank i'm still watching trl when i get home from school so um you just email me sean at seanpourri.com i'll put it in the show notes of this like in the description of the podcast too um i hired an assistant that just reads all my email and triages it into buckets that's like uh action item needs a reply read this and in case you're interested and then um she filters out a bunch of the crap it's amazing how much is that per month i went from being horrible at email like i i don't see stuff i should i see a bunch of stuff that's trash i forget to reply to things i'll read it on my phone think to reply later never remember to come back and reply later i had a horrible system and now um shout out to my assistant drea who's uh helping me so much with that it's it's like literally overnight game change well i got an email from her saying sean would like to schedule time to speak with you in vancouver and at first i was like what the fuck sean are you kidding me there's some growth yeah i was like really uh and then i was like okay this is awesome and i message you i go who where'd you get this person from very interesting she did a good job also um by the way your call to action thing just reminded me i think we should do two things uh two upcoming shows i'm gonna put it out there now it's time for another drunk ideas episode uh which is where we come up with ideas that only sound good if you're drunk so half-baked kind of bad but maybe good startup ideas so we should like the very long distant girlfriend the best one ever yeah exactly very long distance girlfriend was an old timer um the second one is uh i think we should do our version of the bachelor so i think we should get mfm's most eligible uh guys and gals basically submit your application we need a photo we need we'll put up we should put up like a dating site which is basically like um uh we ask a couple questions and then we take the best and we present them on uh on the show and then people can reach out to them and they will get like a bunch of inbound of people who want to actually date them and let's see if we can get somebody married out here let's see if we can get somebody to fall in love the second time we've done that by the way we had one mfm marriage but did you um and more than one mfm divorce yes more than one and that's not a joke we give it then we take it did you see what i did that on twitter where i like tweeted out like 10 of my friends who were single and yeah that's a great idea we should just do that as a crush it crushed all right i'll uh tweet that out after this uh let's do this by the time this comes out let's let's make a landing text to me he wants to do he wants to call it hot millionaires in your area no we're not going to call it millionaires in your area mfmers mfers um what can we call it so what should we call it it could be uh maybe something with singles maybe something with uh uh let's see what else i don't know we got to get you're a good name no no no don't give up you could do this i don't know we could change the word singles with shingles is there anything there that's the thing that's always at the bottom of the website it's like hot singles in your area so just call it that like it's hot singles in your area too much competition on that name dude that's that's the most competitive term on the internet it's got to be like uh um mfm most wanted and but it's most wanted because you you know they're wanted in a dating sense yeah we get it we get it mfm's most wanted that's fine that's actually great that's actually great we're gonna do that yeah better than shingles i don't know i like i like changing words you know called twitter shitter uh it's classic and then this month sean we probably should do like a merch thing yeah i'm working on it i'm going all in on uh on uh just creating great content i don't understand what content has to do with merch uh it's like merch is content to me okay like we're not gonna get rich selling t-shirts but we can make awesome
