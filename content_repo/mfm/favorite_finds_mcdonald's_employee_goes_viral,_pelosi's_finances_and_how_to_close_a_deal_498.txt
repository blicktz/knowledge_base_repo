and he said this line that i love he goes that sounds silly i understand that that my whole day is just about posting on twitter but everybody's just got a thing that's my thing okay and he's like we've all got one thing that's my thing i love it all right we have a special episode we're going to talk about cool content that we've consumed this might be short 20 25 minutes but you want to kick things off yeah well i want to say why i think this is a good type episode to do we um you know one of the best ways to change your life is to change like your if you want to change your body you'll go change your diet uh or your habits your workout habits or your eating habits uh if you want to change your mind you need to change your info diet and so one of the questions i like asking and i know you do too which is like you're like it's like the dorkiest question ever we probably should find a better way to phrase it no it's a great question but it's the answer is so good that we don't even care how lame the question sounds but i've heard you say this before like so what media are you consuming so what are you like what are you reading nowadays or like what content do you like to consume which is i do that in job interviews and people will be like oh i read like the new york times i'm like no come on like what subreddits are you like consuming do you use reddit what about twitter on instagram who do you follow what where are you getting who who's influencing you that's what i want to know we asked palmer lucky this we were like what reddits what subreddits do you go on because his brain was and it was like he's firing off all these awesome things in all these different areas it's like that doesn't just happen by accident that happens because he's got a set of interesting inputs that leads to a set of interesting outputs we as mfm want to be one of those interesting inputs for you so that you become a more interesting smart uh you know person based off of listening to this but we're just one thing so what we want to share is what are the best of the inputs that we read listened to or watched this week that maybe you should go check out so that's the premise of this um i wish more people did this of people that i find interesting i wish they would be more um i wish they would curate for me like yo here's the one or two best things i read or watched this week or listened to just to get my mind going and show me cool things i should go go do anyways that's the spiel i want you to kick it off um i want you to do the top two uh all three years are good so why why don't you kick it off with the top one so one of the best things i watched this week is bill gurley's talk at all in have you heard his his talk that he did at the all-in conference yeah so he did a talk i believe it was about uber and regulation and like some of the surprising things they found so bill gurley was the like lead investor in uber um and he goes to all in and i expected him to talk about i don't know venture capital uh business investing but he's now retired he's a retired vc so he's like kind of in the no flux given mode which is great like you know when you get a really smart person who now feels like they have nothing to lose they can go off and i feel like that's the best way to describe this it wasn't a talk bill gurley went off and so what he does is the talk is titled i think it's like 2851 or something like that some number and he he's basically the talk is like like that's the number of miles between silicon valley and washington dc and what he does is he talks about regulation and how screwed up it makes business and so he goes through example after example and if it to me it felt almost like a john oliver you know when john oliver does those last week tonight things where he just has a monologue he's like exposing something that's screwed up or like coffee zilla does this on youtube where he'll go in and be like logan paul scam people and let me just expose the whole the grift he exposed the grift of regulation and he's like dude look at this like covid happens so they passed these laws about covid testing and look at this this same test in the uk or germany cost like you know seven times less as it did in the us why because in the us it was mandated that only these two companies tests were going to be allowed and in germany was a free market so the test the cost went way down or he would give an example of um he's like you know here's the guy who passed this law uh and he says that these are the only three vendors that the government can use and so they charge this crazy amount and then guess what here's his linkedin oh what do you know five years later he's on the board as the chief whatever at that same company that he handed this prize to and it's like the grift is real and the thing i loved about this because you're like damn that was a great talk he's like i've been working on this for like 15 years he's like basically for the last 15 years every time i saw something that was just complete grift i was screwed it's just an effed up part of the system i wrote it down i made a note and so he's like this talk is basically 15 years in the making of me kind of uh observing what's screwed up about the way that washington works at the end his mic drop is basically like he's like i called this talk in a 2051 that's the number of miles between san francisco and dc and when i talk to people in dc and they ask you know how does silicon valley you know do so much innovation it's because we're so far away from washington dc like we're just away from the poison of the way that that place works and we're the farthest possible place away on the map in the united states from from dc so i love that talk was there any like promising parts of it where like this is going to change or is it like this is well at the end they're like what do we do about this can this change is like well the first thing is this we have to like expose this right like you know you got to shine light on it you know the bacteria sort of grows in the dark and um the second thing was he was like you know uh it's hard because the incentive is the people who could change the laws that would say hey you know maybe if you write the laws about these companies you can't trade their stocks for example right like we've said this on the pod yeah but the people who need to pass that law they're the ones who are profiting from this so he's like it's almost impossible to change that incentive like it's like they would have to do that they need so much pressure in order to make those changes because uh they're not incentivized to do it in fact the opposite their entire incentive is to keep the system the way it is there's this interesting thing that's going on where i don't know anything about the government i don't remember if it's the senate congress whatever it is but uh it was like one of the few things that both of handful of like hard right republicans and hard left uh democrats were agreeing on where they're like all right we're going to create like a political index fund where you could only have if you're a politician you have to you can you can have money but it must be in this particular index fund and so like you're you can't own individual stocks you know how nancy plosie's accused of like doing whatever and then how i think it was the head of was it the new york stock exchange there's uh one of the companies uh like like two weeks before the government shut down with covid they sold a bunch of stocks and like this all looks suspicious and so they're they're trying to like argue that there needs to be a political index fund it seems like a pretty cool idea actually by the way there's a startup called autopilot i don't know if you've ever heard of them they do like uh like it's like a automated money management or like you know basically it's a way to what you can do is you put your money in the app and then you could be like oh i want to copy the michael bury portfolio and you can just copy their public portfolio yeah it's cool what they did that was really so the business doing okay and then it's like growth took off and i was like dude what happened like incredible chart he's like we made this twitter handler called the pelosi tracker and they have the buries tracker the pelosi tracker and whatever and the pelosi tracker has 339 000 followers and it basically every time she makes a trade they um they post about it and so they just dig through the filings and they saw the things and and her gains that she has and like of course somehow nancy pelosi's like happens to be you know she you know she's uh yeah it happens to be up 30 year to date like she's outperforming warren buffett she's outperforming your favorite hedge fund guy like it's insane how does this government you know official do this it's like well maybe they know some things before some things it's insane um um it's corrupt that was a genius growth hack that they did um all right i'll give you one so this has been going around twitter but i went and watched the whole thing uh it's pretty amazing so deon sanders i'm not i'm not a football guy you're gonna know i'm not a sports guy you're gonna know a lot more about this than i am deon sanders he's now the coach of what is it colorado yeah the buffaloes the buffaloes and he um he was on 60 minutes i think like two weeks ago it was pretty amazing they did like a 12 minute segment on him and it was really fascinating because i remember deon sanders as being like this like cocky like showboat guy and he is still a little bit of that but he's incredibly insightful and so basically uh wasn't he what what university was it was a historical black college was at jackson state where he was yeah i forgot the name of it yeah some not very popular school he gets into coaching he he does a decent job there then he gets recruited to go to colorado which is a big deal but what he does is he um he's doing two interesting things the first interesting things that he's doing is one of his sons is filming the whole thing it's like his gary v thing and so his son is like filming behind the scenes and posting it on youtube and driving uh interest it's really fascinating what he's doing have you seen that it's amazing so one of his sons is the quarterback the starting quarterback i think another son is on the team too the other son is like you know what the cornerback or the yeah i think he's a cornerback which is what deon used to play and then uh the other side the son that's not playing football is basically the gary v vlog guy and he's just in the locker room he's he's documenting the whole thing and sharing it on social as they go and they're just doing a better job of it than like you know anybody's doing following that stuff yeah it's awesome and the second thing is that that he did was his leadership skills are really good and they're kind of shocking because i just thought that he was just like a meathead and he was just this really cocky guy no man the guy's really insightful and so basically they show uh like a clip from one of his first meetings with the team and he basically he goes i'm here to encourage most of you to quit the reason being is you guys are the team's lost so much i think last year you were like one in 11 so you lost most every game you barely won a game and the coaching staff they're all out we got rid of them i'm here i brought a bunch of my guys here who i know are good and look here's the deal uh the coaching staff is to blame but you know who else is to blame the kids because the coaching staff probably recruited a bunch of losers and i'm here to get you losers to quit and he and and the the guy on cnn was like hey man that's a little harsh like these are kids he goes well look if you are willing to quit the team because i said that you're probably weak and you're not an asset to this company and if you're gonna let words scare you i need you out of here and i need the tough guys to stay and i need you to be an asset and not a liability and he re-rammed the roster he brought like 40 players 40 new players in which is half of a football team roster and and 50 left and 50 left they went into the transfer portal portal and he goes uh he's like look truth is good for the kids this is what i'm here to teach you football i'm going to teach you how to how to live life and be a good man and what you guys need is truth i need to tell you the truth and i need to prepare you for the real world and we're gonna i want a winning team and he does this other thing where he goes uh the the interviewer goes so who do you think is the best football uh football coach right now in the ncaa he goes well do you have a mirror that i can hold up so i can see him he's like it's me he goes i'm gonna be the best coach but then he does a good job of being like humble he's like well i learned a lot from nick saban he's forgot more about football than i'll ever know and so i'm looking for little crumbs from him but it was really inspirational because i think that uh this type of like uh pound your chest leadership the way that he delivered it was really good it was very inspiring on how to lead a business yeah you know i'm usually not uh believe it or not that big of a believer in uh like the effect of the pre-game or halftime speech like that seems to be like probably overrated uh in terms of what a coach can do and vastly underrated is the systems and uh like habits and standards that you like enforce and instill um and so what people are seeing a lot because it's super viral you share the halftime speech you share the the the pre-game speech or the post-game speech and they're and dion i don't know if you know between football and uh this uh between playing football and this he like became like a pastor like part-time and so he was like very religious and he was like giving sermons i remember watching him on tv giving sermons in a big white suit um but if you but if you watch one of the other things he does he set a bunch of standards so he's like you know day one and almost in the uh like that book the score takes care of itself by uh bill walsh where it's like okay yeah we want to win but the score will take care of itself if we do these inputs exactly like the famous stories like he makes the people answer the phone in the front desk appropriately yeah and john wooden did the same thing he's like we're gonna learn how to lace up your shoes if you can't if you don't take the time and attention to figure out how to lace up your shoes just to make a point of like what we do out there is a result of how of what we put in let's let's understand that it is a direct result of what we put in and so we're gonna we're gonna monitor that and so uh one of the things that that they show in dion stuff and i saw this when i was at duke with coach k is like it's the little things that they said as the standard so for example he's like you know if you are on the field he's put up right he put up footage from the previous practice he's like look at what's happening here can anyone tell me what's wrong and it's like i don't know it's not even a play what are you talking about like it's nothing this is just us walking in between the drills like he's like exactly you're walking if we're on this field we run we do not walk and he's like basically created a new set of standards and so he's like if you're in a team meeting where do you sit how do you show up do you use your phone do you do and he's just like kind of like instilling new standards so while the speeches are getting a lot of the the the the shine i think the more interesting thing is basically in the how we show up uh the daily standards of the inputs uh that go into it now of course you know they're undefeated right now and they're doing really well and i think it's more because of that yeah it's awesome and he the he did a good job where he was like when the guy was like when he did the whole thing like let me hold up the mirror and he was like well look here's the deal i tell my kids i go i expect you to be the best so i'm going to be the best too and he's like you're good i think you can win the heisman trophy and i think i'm going to be the best coach and so he does a really good job of balancing this like cocky we're going to take over the world and also uh high expectation so i thought that was really inspiring what do you got all right i'll do another one um this is in the nerdy realm so there's a guy who is a twitter account i really like called cfo secrets i love this guy he has a newsletter that um i didn't subscribe to but i just saw one of his posts that was really great it was uh it was called uncovering the mystery of working capital in mna i was like okay that sounds like you know boring has a market size of like three people right now it's just like dude when we when i sold to hubspot it took me a week to under for them to explain what working capital was and i still don't understand it read this post it's really good so one of the things that i look for is like you know you can tell when somebody actually knows their shit and off honestly like sometimes when i go on twitter or i go on youtube i just want to delete my account because i'm like it's so annoying that the most vocal people just don't know what the hell they're talking about um and they're and what happens is some people know what they're talking about they produce content everybody loves it but then some people instead of taking that content and going and executing on it they're like i too will create content about how to be successful although i am not successful yet and then they do it and then there's like a ladder below that and they're like i will tell people how to do sales even though i've never done sales even though i don't know anything about sales even though i've only sold ten thousand dollars in my life right like and it just ladders down in that way and then and those people have the most time on their hands so they're the most like active uh publishing stuff it's crazy so seeing this guy's newsletter i was like oh finally somebody who knows what they're talking about so he has this thing about m a and if you ever sold a company so much of what he says rings true he's like so he's like the post starts like this i'm just gonna read you some of the best parts of it he goes it always starts the same we're tired they're tired um everyone's been sprinting get this over the line and we're sprinting because time kills deals and he's like if you've done deals you know this momentum is what oils the deal wheels and he's like there's always a point where the deal is mostly agreed we've agreed on the headline valuation number and that took a lot of negotiating it's tired us out and now there's only two or three points left to agree in the deal he's like most of these are boring stuff like reps and warranties and the legal documents and we want to leave that to lawyer there's maybe one commercial point left and so the other side picks up the phone and they say hey we just uh we just need to iron out this one detail about working capital peg and he goes i'll say something like oh thanks for the writer been so busy on the on the documents i haven't had much time to give that thought i'll get back to you tonight but i've thought about it i've been thinking about it i've been thinking about the working capital this whole time i'm just setting up my position that way that oh i haven't really brought it you know haven't even put much thought into it and then i'm going to bring them a very well thought through thing that i think is going to make sense and he goes there's one last trade left in the negotiation in my experience this is one to three percent of your total enterprise value is just this last thing and it's a pure win-lose negotiation between both sides you're tired they're tired who's going to feel like ah screw it let's just get the deal done and i'm like and you know we just went through a negotiation so you know this is by the way that's what i learned from you about negotiating your you had a line that actually changed me which was the the person who can be comfortable with the most amount of uncomfortableness will will win exactly yeah this the short version of that i say in every negotiator is the more stubborn party wins always uh people think that the person who wins in negotiation is the one who has the stronger logical case hell no it's the person who is more stubborn who wins always and um how do you be stubborn you need to be comfortable in the un in the discomfort and i would say honestly when we did this negotiation which maybe we should do by say by the way a breakdown on the whole thing one of the one of the things i think we did not do a good job of was this last bit the last point which is that last you know one to five percent of value and we were just so tired we just wanted to get the deal done i don't think we did a good job like four months yeah and i think that the real way to do that is that's when you need to like dig in the most because it's that last deal point that like you can get and you'll thank yourself later for it even though in the moment you're feeling tired it's like any workout it's like do i push here or do i just say i'm tired and i stop and like anybody who knows about workouts is like no push through yes you're tired but you'll feel so satisfied and all the gains will come on that those last two reps of pushing it um so anyways he talks about this and then he gets into the nerdy part where he's like all right here's a spreadsheet like you know you have your enterprise value and then you have your equity your value your actual valuation what's the difference between the two it's like well your enterprise value includes the debt and the capital that's in the business and then your valuation you know your the actual equity value is what's left after that so i think just a very useful doc a very useful newsletter for people who are going to go through that or going through that probably overkill to read this early but if you're going to do uh m a it really really pays to have somebody who's good at m a on your side um when we were doing our negotiation i was basically trying to convince you hey let's have our buddy who's done more m a than both of us like help us think this through at the beginning you did you did good you led that one and you did really good and i would say i'm still like intermediate maybe at the i'm at the early stage of intermediate there's people who are way more advanced and so uh anyways this is a newsletter it's a very nerdy find for m a i'm gonna read this i i went through this i went through a deal that involved networking capital i still don't entirely know what it means um it was this was very challenging and the guy's this guy's writing is really good and he actually sets it up perfectly where like networking capital was thrown in at the last minute and i'm like oh i don't i don't even know what that is i'm dead i i want to get this done it's supposed to close in eight days i just want to get this done yeah our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobbled together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better hey guys really quick so you may know this but my beginning in business was being a copywriter i'm a self-taught copywriter and what that means is i figured out what motivated people and then i figured out how to use the written word to get them to do what i want them to do so that could mean selling them a product that could mean writing a speech or even giving a speech and getting someone to buy into a particular movement it could be recruiting hell you could do it for dating it just basically means figuring out what motivates someone and how to use the written word to take an action get them to take an action or to think a certain way and the way that i learned how to copyright was i did this thing called copywork and copywork is this famous technique that's not really popular anymore but it used to be really really popular and you basically take writing that is great writing that you love and you write it out by hand and you copy it and you make notes of what particular thing that that writer is doing that makes it special this is the exact same way that you learn how to play the piano when you want to learn how to play the piano you learn how to play happy birthday and then you learn how to play like jingle bells and then maybe like a rock and roll song and then maybe like a hip-hop song and eventually you can combine that all together after a few years and you learn how to make music that's your own same thing with writing that's how i learned how to write i locked myself in a room for six months and i just did this for many hours a day uh i created a program to make it easy so you could do that it's called copy that copy that dot com you can go there and you can check it out it's a 10-day exercise to make it really easy to learn how to write if you want you can just go do this on your own you can find great writing just literally copy it by hand i know it sounds crazy but it works really effectively but i made something that makes it a little bit easier so check it out copy that dot com and we will talk soon and back to the pod you want to go to to the last one oh yeah okay so do you know this account cultural tutor on twitter awesome follow awesome follow it's so the story's kind of crazy i didn't really know about it but he he went on david perel's podcast which i think you you were going on too or something i just uh i just recorded an episode with him last week so david perel cool guy lives in i think austin and he's uh he teaches people like about writing online he's got a new podcast so he did an episode and the set itself is beautiful it looks like they're in like you know the royal library in the uk or something beautiful set so he has this guy on i've never heard of this guy and then i was like oh i did see one of his threads go super viral he did a thread about like why all architecture designs all look the same now they're all minimalist and that thing got like a hundred million likes or some like that it was really good insanely viral and it's not even about like a thing you would think goes viral but it hit a nerve and so this guy he does his interview and i've only honestly i've only listened to the first 10 minutes of this so like many books i recommend i got a lot of value out of the first 10 minutes and i was sort of satisfied but he said something at the beginning so he's like this guy was basically working at mcdonald's literally he was like flipping burgers and doing french fries and he's like um they had like a mutual friend this guy harry dry who's cool and uh then david i think david like basically sponsored him he became like his patron he's like you want to write what if i just paid you to write so he quits his job at mcdonald's he just decides okay i'm gonna write every day and david like funds him for whatever reason i don't know exactly how this worked but like i'm sure they explained it in the other 50 minutes of the podcast but the important part is not that the important part is this guy then decides okay i'm gonna write one amazing twitter thread a day and he says this line that's great he's like um he's and then david's like what's your schedule he's like he's like yeah i wake up at like 4 p.m and then i just start thinking about my thread and i smoke cigarettes i go for walks i write i go for another walk smoke some more cigarettes and then i you know i'll eat some food if somewhere in the middle there and then i'll just write and then i publish and then i pass out and i do it again the next day and he's like that's crazy he's like yeah um i don't he's like you know i'm not the guy who's gonna tell you my morning routine don't follow me but like this is what i do and he's like i just my whole day is about publishing one amazing twitter thing he said this line that i love he goes that sounds silly i understand that that my whole day is just about posting on twitter but everybody's just got a thing that's my thing okay and he's like we've all got one thing that's my thing it's like i love it and he's like what are the results have been so far he's got 1.3 million twitter followers he's got an insane twitter following like he's built a map in like a year is it making money i don't know i don't think he makes any money off of it yet but he can right like you know it's not that hard to turn attention into money once you have attention um you know it's harder to turn money into attention than it is attention into money to be honest he has 1.5 and he has a 100 000 person email list yeah he's doing fantastic that's that's incredible right so he's doing doing very very well for himself uh you know but i just love the intensity this guy was going to bring to something and i've actually noticed this is a common trait which is if you bring a level of seriousness to something that everybody else considers not serious you can actually win much bigger than most people realize this is how we felt about newsletters i was like well i'm doing the math i think this could be a legit thing and we sold early but we definitely the business could make 100 million dollars a year you know morning brews close to that and i always say one of the reasons why is people thought this was silly but if you did the math i'm like i don't know i think the math is out there i think this is going to be a real thing um and i think that's the same thing with my latest business as well which is we're just taking something seriously that most use as a hobby yeah i don't know if that's true is that true aren't there like you know does ypo not take this seriously do those guys not take it seriously they do but most uh there's a there's a few that do but many many many others in the space they think that it's just like uh it's like a small thing that you charge a hundred dollars a year for something like that um there's a lot of there's a lot of hobbyists the better frame i think for what you're doing to be honest it's just the is that we joke about it but it is the beautifully done like i am trying to do that your is just more stylish and more cool and more desirable for a variety of intangible factors ranging from design to people feeling fomo to content to um you know the the the the first hundred members that you added to your thing um like i remember getting sales calls to join whatever what a vintage or whatever the hell they missed the mark they missed the mark well what i i love guys like cultural tutor because what i do for a lot of my brands is i follow people like him and i look at like what was cool in the 60s and 70s that i can just reuse today so for example our color for hampton it's uh the color of this really cool jaguar car that was popular in the 70s and then when i made the branding i found old rolex ads because i'm like what was cool then that could still be cool now there's another example have you seen the sunscreen company that's doing that uh vacation where like it looks like an 80s or early 90s like a guy who did vacation this guy jeremy summers he he's amazing did the branding for us for milk road oh he didn't really character but he helped us develop the whole brand and then the last bit was he we didn't love the character and then we had a different guy do the drawing the illustration for it but he did our branding yeah that for milk road jeremy did an amazing job and he's that's specifically his aesthetic um is that kind of like i don't know if i shouldn't say that he's really good at that aesthetic which is the like kind of vintage classy like you know nostalgic um beautifully done uh sort of aesthetic by the way i'll we'll wrap up with a quick story about david perel i went to his apartment so basically he lives in uh austin he has an apartment in the building but then he also rented this other apartment and when you walk in it feels almost like an airbnb or maybe like you're walking into like a restoration hardware store everything is perfectly set up and david is really ocd and so like he's got this two bedroom or it was a three bedroom apartment they knocked down one wall so they went all in on this thing and then one room is like the studio where we sit and then another room is like the guest room where if you're a guest and you want to fly in you could stay there but like there's like a record on the wall or there's books on the shelf and i'm like david all these have a meeting he goes he goes of course you know me you know every single here every single thing here has a purpose and has a story and so he like perfectly like picked everything in the studio and what is that oh would you like to see this cream colored book that's on my bookshelf does it even have pages in it maybe this book says i don't think you can see that uh what's it say tango lessons um tango lessons did i read this book no did i go on etsy because somebody said go buy cream colored books uh to put in your background makes you look classy bet your ass dude everything at david's place is on purpose and it all has a story and i sent you a video and i'm like we have to step it up this guy is so particular it's it's he's the dion sanders uh in my world of podcasting right now he did outrageous come all of his standards were perfect and like i saw his trailer oh my god the
