What's up y'all Sean here I want to do a special episode because the CEO of Twitch resigned today and this is a guy I got to know well because Twitch acquired my last startup and I worked with Emmett for a while he's been there for 16 years he was the founder the creator of Twitch which is basically a you know one of the biggest platforms in the world one of the biggest social networks in the world millions and millions and millions of users I think they have eight million streamers let alone uh viewers that they that they talk about um and it's a multi-billion dollar company so probably somewhere between five and ten billion dollars in terms of what he's built and I got to sit in the room with this guy you know every week for a few hours at least interacting with him and over time you observe what is it about these people I've always wondered like what would it be like to work with Mark Zuckerberg what are they actually like how do they actually work are they any different do they just get lucky are they just am I looking at a lottery ticket winner or is there something different about this individual that led them to do this and uh you know no surprise I think there are some differences some amazing things so I wanted to share with you some stories because at twitch's office there was nine floors and so at the ninth floor the top floor there's this boardroom it's got like 20 chairs and Emmett would just sit at the head of the boardroom at the table uh like you know some emperor or something like that and he would a team after team would come in and they would present whatever's going on in that division of the company ads or marketing or whatever it may be and what he would do is he would sit there he would talk to that team for 45 minutes or one hour and then boom on to the next and so this guy operated at a extremely high pace and I want to share with you eight or nine things that I think were different or special or at least the stories I remember from having worked with this guy so the first story I'm going to call the birds fly story okay so I remember sitting in a meeting with Emmett and uh this team walked in and it was the I think the partnerships team or marketing team or whatever and they were super excited because um they had just they were like hey we had this great meeting with this company they said they wanted to pre-install twitch on all these phones and uh you know this is going to get twitch you know a big head start in this market and uh it's going to be great we're going to we're projecting this much growth this much revenue blah blah blah and they were you know they were so excited they thought they were bringing in you know this trophy and um and they were going to just hold it up and get applause from everybody and and hey it was it was a good deal but Emmett sat quietly for a bit he asked questions and then he um he kind of reminded them something and he said you know I learned this phrase from Paul Graham at Y Combinator birds fly fish swim and deals fall through like that's what they do deals fall through that's just a thing that happens and sure enough over the course of that year I saw so many teams come in and present deals that were on the table verbally agreed being discussed maybe even signed and this is exactly even to say this line and more often than that person was willing to admit the deals fell through and so this is something I took with me which is never to get too high or too low when it comes to deals M&A uh partnerships anything like that just remember this is what deals do they fall through birds fly fish swim deals fall through all right let me give you a second story after we got acquired my first day I go uh up to his office and um I'm gonna have my first one-on-one with him and I don't really know what to do I've never been an employee really like this in my life so I don't really know I've only been the guy on the other side of the table so I go in and I start to tell him you know about what I'm working on and he just kind of like stops me he's like hey uh um what's uh what what's your question and I'm like what do you mean was I uh I haven't gotten to that yet I'm giving you the context he goes he goes uh he goes I think this will help in our one-on-ones there's probably he gave me almost like an instruction manual of here's how you work with me which is really here's how you work with any leader any ceo there's four ways you could frame anything you're going to tell me number one is hey I'm doing this FYI just I'm doing this I just want you to be in the loop number two is I'm doing this but I want your approval or I need your approval so I plan to do this do you approve number three is I'm trying to decide between a and b or a b and c can you help me think that through and then the last one number four the last way we interface with him is to say remember that thing we agreed on here's what happened it's the status update of the closing the loop on what we had talked about and basically anytime I interact with him that was the the sort of like the the base frame that I needed to have which was um I'm doing this FYI I'm doing this do you approve uh can you help me think through which way to go I'm not sure which way which one I want to do or lastly here's what happened here's the learning that we had from it that just simplified so much and it made our communication so much tighter in a very short amount of time we could immediately sync up we could get through that and then we would spend the rest of the time just sharing interesting things or talking about what's going on in our lives uh because we weren't wandering around and he's sitting there waiting to find out like what does this guy want from me and I'm sitting there trying to tell him a full story before I finally get to my point or my question um so that was one great framework that he sent me the second one was I wrote an update once it was a point number three I wrote an update and he just took a pen and he just drew circles and rearranged things and he basically said here's how I want you to write this what why so what so that's a format of communication you tell me what happened why it happened and so what are we going to do about it or if we're planning something what are we going to do why are we going to do it and so what do you need from me in order to make that happen and um that what why so what framework again tightened up my communication it took away so much wasted energy of trying to sit down with a blank piece of paper and figure out how I'm going to communicate something now I sit down with a paper and I just write what why so what and then I fill in the details underneath um so that was a great little uh communication framework that that I got from him okay number four he is a fierce nerd so uh this is a phrase that I took from Paul Graham Paul Graham wrote this essay talking about fierce nerds which is basically his observation of the best YC founders so the most successful YC founders he felt he felt fall into this bucket and he talks about fierce nerds as people who are competitive in fact they're often more competitive than non-nerds right like typically if you think competitive you think of a jock in this case he's saying almost a fierce nerd is almost more competitive because they are all in on this they don't have a bunch of other you know social things to fall back on they don't have the emotional maturity to separate themselves from the competition it is deeply personal to them and they are fully obsessed um he talks about how they tend to be overconfident sometimes especially when they're young because they feel like they can get to the right answer the fastest um he talks about how being a fierce nerd is so advantageous in the world of business today and you know so so uh Emmett falls in this category when I asked him what he does on on Friday nights or for the weekend you know it was like I'm gonna play Settlers of Catan with the Pat you know with the Collison brothers from Stripe and the founders of Reddit this is what they would do they would get together drink beer play Catan like play a competitive board game or um during our first M&A conversation I asked the corp damn guy after we got out of the meeting I said how'd you think that went I thought it was pretty good what'd you think you know is he always like that he goes no he goes half these meetings he's just playing Hearthstone on his phone and he's talking but he's playing Hearthstone he goes he put down his phone he wasn't playing Hearthstone so that was a good sign for you guys and um this guy competes like a beast in fact I one time asked him I said uh can you send me something from the archives can you send me uh an old fossil so basically when you started twitch did you ever make any plans or or pitch decks or anything like that I'd love to see it because I I'm just like a I'm a nerd about that sort of thing I I like seeing what people were thinking at the start because we all know what it looks like today but what were you thinking at the start and he sent me a pit a deck that he had made an investor update that he had made right when they pivoted to twitch and uh there was this one it was a white it was no design it was white slides black text times new roman and uh he just he was saying here's what we're doing you know here's why we're doing it and here's here's what's coming next um and then on one slide he he filled up the entire slide to almost to make a point with every product thing they had shipped and improved that month it was just full like there was no white space on that slide and then on the next slide he wrote we are we are a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers and I thought it was awesome because today he's older he's wiser he's more mature he wouldn't talk like that he's not like pounding his chest or whatever but at the time you could tell like that was that young bravado energy of feeling the momentum of hey look nobody on earth at that point knew really what twitch was it wasn't a big deal but he knew he knew they were onto something he knew that they were making tons of progress and I always remember that we were a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers like what what a picture and uh and I love that and I've I since now write that in my startups I'm like this month I'm gonna be a steamroller plowing through a field of flowers what would that mean what would I need to get done in order for that to be true and I just work backwards from that um I'll give you maybe I think this is number five maybe the most remarkable thing of the whole thing I talked about the early pivot so what people don't know is that twitch before twitch uh him Emmett Justin Kahn Michael Siebel they were working on something called Justin TV a lot of people know this story it was like uh Justin Kahn was wearing a webcam on his head and he was walking around it's like a reality show of his life then it became anybody can broadcast anything which was like mostly people broadcasting illegal sporting events and stuff like that like just bootleg streaming um and so the site was kind of popular but it really wasn't going to be successful because most of their best content was illegal and they had a decision to pivot at the time Instagram had come out Instagram was hot but Instagram only did photos and so the majority of the company including Justin and Michael and Kyle they all wanted to do Instagram for video and they called it social camp and they pivoted to that and they wanted to do that and they you know all the top talent in the company wanted to go do that and Emmett had a different point of view he's like you know on Justin TV I really like watching these video game streams it only made up two percent at the time of of all the content or all the watch time that was happening on the network but he's like I like that content the best it's not illegal to do so it's the only good content that's not illegal I kind of wonder what would happen if we just went all in and made a video game streaming uh platform and he was kind of alone in that so Emmett went that way Justin and the others went the other way and maybe the rejects sort of you know got got put on Emmett's team to do that now social cam went way up and then way down and I had this crazy spike in virality then it crashed and ended up selling for like 60 million dollars but twitch was a slow burn just brick by brick by brick all the way into a multi-billion dollar company and so the reason I bring this up is because to this day Justin Kahn is often referenced as the co-founder of twitch or the founder of twitch and I don't from what I understand I might be wrong from what I understand that wasn't actually true he started just tv which uh and then he went to social cam but like Emmett and his crew built twitch up from there um I don't think Justin really they were in the same office but I don't think he was working on twitch actively at the time I don't think he ever was an employee of twitch I think he was helpful and Emmett and Justin are best friends growing up and you never hear Emmett try to take credit away from Justin or more towards himself I've never once heard him do that which is kind of incredible um and so I give a lot of props to that because a lesser man aka me would have been trying to set the record straight and and say you know no actually it was more me than it was this other guy who's more popular than me but uh Emmett couldn't care less that's his best friend and uh I think that says a lot about somebody so okay that's that's five let me do a couple more so uh okay if you go into a meeting with Emmett you're gonna notice two things the first is that this guy's really really really smart he's smarter than you and uh I always wondered this because I think people like to think that it's actually hard work that separates people or it's um luck or it's one of these other factors but it's it not all not everybody's equally intelligent uh his oven burns hotter like uh twitch uses the amazon method of six minute sorry six page memos before meetings so basically you write a memo about what's going on you write a you basically write down everything you come into the meeting you hand out the printed out copy of that to everybody at the table everybody silently reads for 15 20 minutes and then everybody has all the same information and now they discuss it's an amazing way to build a a very good culture in your company of writing thinking and talking uh so it's a great way to run meetings but the first thing you notice is that seven minutes in Emmett's pens down he's on heartstone because he's read the whole thing faster than everybody else and of course when the discussion starts he lets other people talk but then when he finally raises his hand and says you know here was my question it would always be the most on point thing that would cut to the heart of the matter and it's like oh why have we been wasting our time talking about these other things he's right you know he made it he simplified the six page memo into a really simple question and conversation um and so his his oven just burns hotter he gets to the right answer faster than most people he retains more info uh than most people he's able to connect dots and is more widely read i remember sitting in a meeting where we were talking about some policy you know uh how do we handle this situation uh streamers are doing this should we enforce it should we not enforce it how should we change the policy how should we decide what how do we take into account what the community wants and he would you know be like well you know we could do it like you know the feudal system in northern ireland back in the 1400s like you know you'd say some like that and you'd be like emmett we don't none of us know what you're talking about no nobody knows how the feudal system ran can you can you explain and then he would explain how their court system worked and then he'd be like why don't we do that and he'd connect these dots and all i could think about was like i can't believe this guy even reads about that i can't believe he knows about that uh is he is he's just like sort of insatiably curious very widely read and then you know his brain has uh this ability to connect data points you know in a way that i haven't really seen since then so his oven burns hotter uh i think the people that run these platforms are smarter and hard-working and blah blah blah right they're they're the olympic athletes of uh of business and uh and i think he's no different having said that he's got flaws so my next point let's call it point seven he's flawed and he knows it so when i got there a lot of people would joke almost behind his back like well you know emmett's all iq he's no eq for me it was honestly further you know couldn't be further from the truth but i also met him i don't know 14 years into running this company i bet if i met him at year three or four he probably didn't have the same managerial skills or social skills or eq skills that he has today but he knows what's flawed and he works on it so his favorite book i think was non-violent communication uh because that had helped him so much uh of how can he communicate with people in a way that doesn't put them on the defensive but still gets you know gets things done he uh only cared about getting things right not being right so he would use what i call this the socratic method of of leadership where when you would come in you would say something then he would start to ask you questions and he would break up your whole argument piece by piece assumption by assumption why is this true how do we know that if that's true then what does that imply next and he would just go one by one until we would get to the right answer for most people it was exhausting and they took it as almost a personal attack like he's questioning everything i say he doesn't just take it at face value but the reality was i thought it was a tremendous like approach to getting to the truth and the truth is all he cared about he didn't care if he came up with it or you came up with it he just wanted it to be closer to the truth to the actual answer um he also hired this coach this executive coach uh a woman named flo who's amazing i think she's like 80 years old so she's like you know doesn't know the first thing about gaming or streaming or twitch or any of that stuff but she knew about people and i remember sitting in an egg in one of the exec off sites and emmet has this nervous tick which is that when he's really thinking about something he would grab his neck like where his neck beard was and he would start to like twist it and it was like to anybody who's talking to it's like so obvious you can see this and it's not like a normal mannerism people do but that was his twit that was his tick he would do that anytime he was thinking hard he wasn't sure about something or he was trying to figure out how to say something to you he would do that and i loved that i worked there for maybe nine months at this point he did it all the time you know i'm never going to point that out what am i going to say like uh you know the it's just something he did and everybody just sat there quietly all of his leaders all of his peers sat there quietly letting that happen and flo walked in and she was like emmy what do you do with your neck put your hand down sit up straight say that like a leader and she just told it to him like it is it was amazing she's amazing but also his reaction had zero percent defensiveness he was like oh yeah thanks like thank you that's a gift thank you for reminding me uh about that you know i'm working on that and um i thought that that was you know a good sign as to how do you how do you get better right this guy was there for 16 years how do you get better every year well you're surrounded by people that are kind of afraid to tell you the truth because you're their boss and you're the ceo and you're the smartest guy in the room so i think he did a good job of identifying his weaknesses and hiring people that would literally tell him the truth um so those are some of the things that i picked up from emmet uh you know emmet you had a great run i hope you you don't listen to the pod but i hope you listen to this one because uh yeah working with you was a lot of fun you know i really found it fun because it pushed me to be better i could not walk into a meeting uh or do my job and be able to get away with it just on talent or charisma or some hand wavy that you can say in a meeting that if it wasn't for him pretty much anyone else in the company if i went to the meeting i could kind of just say whatever and uh i could talk my way out of any situation uh or into any situation or whatever i wanted to do but with emmet you know i i kind of felt like a higher bar was there where i really needed to have um the right answer i needed to have the truth uh because he would not uh his standard was there and so you know he made me better i appreciate that and um it was a it was kind of cool to be able to be in the room with somebody who is you know one of these these rare individuals who has built one of these mega mega companies um and i don't know what he's gonna do next i think he's just had a kid uh so you know maybe he's gonna go full dad mode uh i'm not sure what he's gonna do but i will i will watch eagerly to see because i know it's not gonna be it's not gonna be average whatever it is nothing there's nothing nothing just mediocre or average coming from this guy so anyways hope you enjoyed that those are some of the lessons i learned working with uh emmett from twitch and uh all right that's it that's the pod uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
