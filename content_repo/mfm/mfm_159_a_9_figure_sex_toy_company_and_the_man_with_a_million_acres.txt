i i don't think i would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up it would be a big deal oh look at you you're afraid to fail now oh you make it big you sell your company and now now you're like i i gotta i gotta watch my step what's going on i'm not afraid to where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh what would that guy do i feel like i can rule the world i know sean's new studio are you in a garage is that what that is i am in my garage we uh we upgraded we improvised so we did this crazy thing where we had talked about on the podcast we were like we need to like upgrade our setup i think mostly was you just telling me to get a haircut which is fair and wear a shirt wear a shirt and uh i took that as i need a whole new studio uh so so basically these guys who are um from chicago they're like 23 year old guys who love the podcast they were like they heard that and this is like their forte they do like camera audio they have their own podcast they have their own youtube channels they're basically what i realized was i went and watched their youtube channel and his youtube channel has like this guy henry his youtube channel has like i don't know 570 subscribers so it's not like some big youtube channel but if you watch it it's the same level of quality of like video audio and editing as like casey neistat's channel and i showed this to our friend sully and i go i go check these guys out like look at look at their channel these are the guys coming this weekend to make my studio and he goes he goes i remember when i was uh kind of like 21 22 we were coming up and what the kind of 30 and 40 year olds used to say was oh man you guys have this huge advantage because you're like you're you're like digital natives is what they were calling us like we grew up with a computer and the internet like i think we we got the internet and computers when we were like in sixth grade i don't know about you it's probably around the same fifth sixth grade something like that and so you know first for our parents they were getting a computer when they were 35 or 40. so it's just like you know you didn't have that you didn't have it to grow up on and so he goes these guys this is the next the next wave they're video native basically they grew up with a camera in their hand and they just like constantly shoot videos they know how to edit it they're not afraid to be on camera and like it's such a superpower and i think it was so true what he was saying you said one thought line that i think is the real superpower which is um being on camera so for you and i we're kind of like media people so we're maybe a little bit more used to it than the average joe but even i am still very uncomfortable just talking to a camera and like looking at it young people are not when i was at the airport i saw 12 year old kids with like the phone on the ground with a pop socket right and they were like filling and i could see that they were doing tick tock dances and it was like that's like unheard of for me because i'm like oh my god you're gonna do that at the airport with people watching right right yeah the upside is they all look cool they know how to dance and they know how to edit videos the downside is like you know they're like riddled with anxiety and stuff like that so you know it's not all it's not all good but i but and they're not having sex which is a topic we're going to talk about we're going to talk about that um but the other thing i was going to say is let me ask you this when you get us you're on snapchat right you have snapchat uh i have no i have an account all right so all right i'll bring you i'll bring you you got to chime in here i'll bring you how old are you 27 all right so you're more like us than i like the people i'm talking about that are kind of like i'm not going to say gen z yeah but god i think i think those couple he is he's a lot hipper he's a lot hipper than we are all right he's a little bit more into it okay so so basically uh or when you have snapchat right so someone sends you a snap right they send you a picture of something they're doing something they're looking at and you need to reply tell me do you just type the reply like in the text version or do you send back a photo that's so weird yeah see that's crazy to me uh that is wild to me i'm like you say something i comment like it's like it's facebook right i just write like oh looks fun cool that's great you know like i'm like a 90 year old you're talking about young people another interesting thing to do is when you ask a young person or did you show me this when you ask a younger person what what do you do when someone calls if they put their hand for the people listening i have my hand like i'm waving high like high five and they put their hand like a high five to the ear versus they put their pinky and thumb out like this well or or if you say um hey do like a gesture to to take a picture so if i said to you hey sam take a picture yeah you're gonna do this that's an old camera yeah it's not a camera right so so what they do is they they hold up their their hand like this with their thumb like you're holding an iphone right we're like out here with a polaroid trying to trying to demonstrate what a picture is anyway so um i don't even know why i'm talking about that but basically these guys are you know i would say younger people are video native and i think that's gonna be a huge huge win for them because people like us are like self-conscious and like just don't know how to use the tools right i want to bring up a topic that's both related to this and something else so at sean's old office at monkey inferno the guy who owns it michael birch awesome it looked like it was out of a magazine but he had one or two things that really stuck out and one of them was this macintosh computer it was a max mac mac 2 is that what's called apple 2. so i'm gonna look that up i look so the reason i'm bringing this up is i am building my studio to look good like yours um and i was looking thinking of like designs and interesting stuff to put in the back and i also this whole nft has got me uh interested in art and like you know just like beautiful yeah just like valuable or not valuable beautiful interesting cool stuff i've always liked stuff uh just like junk right uh that's what i used to like uh but now i'm gonna try to get some nicer anyway i was looking around how much do you think uh so is an apple 2 is that apple 2 the same as a mac as a macintosh 2.

uh i don't know well wow how much you think an apple 2 that still works costs i don't know a couple thousand i'd say maybe somewhere between two and five it would be my guess two and five thousand you can get one that's in pretty good condition for like five hundred dollars you can get one you can get a mac macintosh 2 which i don't know the difference between the apple 2 and the macintosh 2. you can get a macintosh 2 that is still in the box for like a grand and do you remember the commercials uh when we were younger we were in our teens we were probably in eighth grade or ninth grade where it was like a colored mac so it was like a blue it was called the imac i think right yep you can get those for like 300 now strictly speaking like from like a collectible like just it's interesting it's um it's cool to look at that's incredibly cheap for a machine i tell you what every single person who came to our office was like oh this is awesome now granted it's tech nerds coming to the office but they were like wowed by this thing and there was like expensive art all up on the walls nobody cared about any that people saw this old thing and then we would boot it up and they would turn on and they were like amazed by it so it definitely every single person noted commented on it i think these types of like old computers these vintage computers i think these are going to get really popular and the reason i think that is i was looking up how much uh so for a gift i thought about buying people an ipod that wasn't connected to the internet did i tell you this no um so i was going to buy people uh like our investors i was going to buy them like a small thank you i was like maybe if i spent 200 a head let's see if i can go and buy a bunch of if i can buy like 20 uh ipods that aren't connected to the internet and my plan was ruined because i'm like oh wait you have to have uh itunes itunes and that doesn't even exist so like this is pretty much meaningless but these old ipods by the way itunes exists well but i mean like you who no one buys can you even buy mp3s anymore from it i don't think so yeah yeah you have to like have your own music yeah like that no one does that anymore you we all stream and like these things didn't even have internet i wanted it so you could like download it and then it would only work if you were attached to wi-fi but anyway uh old ipods like old old ones first generation ones are expensive like five six hundred dollars and so anyway i think that both would be cool to have this stuff on your dude if an old ipod is five six hundred dollars and apple 2 in the box or mac 2 in the in the box is also 500 yeah i i definitely know which one i think has more more like long-term value here uh those those those things are collectibles i think you're you're spot on i would scoop up five to ten of those right now and just hold them yeah i'm okay so like here's a vintage working in one in good condition uh macintosh 2 for 250 dollars i'm looking at it on ebay right now here's a macintosh uh in the box for 400 bucks it's pretty interesting right i think this might become pretty popular these old computers and i think that it's kind of a cool idea yeah i like that a lot um those are good and i i actually will go after this on ebay and try to scoop up at least at least two of those just to hold and see what happens um all right you want to get into uh you have two updates and then we have an idea two ideas yeah okay so one update is on the michael jordan thing so last episode we talked about michael jordan's house has been on sale for 10 years it was a it's a 56 000 square foot house and um it was originally listed for 30 million dollars now it's been price cut price cut price cut all the way down to 13 million and it's still not selling and this is after the last dance it's after this giant boom in like trading card collectibles like the michael jordan rookie card is going for almost two million dollars and his 56 000 square foot house can't sell for 13 like something seems off like a little tiny three inch piece of cardboard can sell but not this so uh and he's paying property taxes i think somebody said he's paid about a million dollars in property tax just while it sat on the market and so we threw this out there last time we said hey look why don't we either collect just me and you or we crowdfund uh why don't we buy mj's house and like what can we do with it and we got a bunch of good feedback so i would say like there's a bunch of smart people who immediately pointed out that one of our ideas which was to turn it into some kind of museum the museum of mike um you know the basketball museum wouldn't work because you know the hoa the neighbors would never permit you to let like tens of thousands of people come into their neighborhood and and go to this museum every year right so that's what i thought about i mean i was thinking about i just figured there would have to be a way around something exactly exactly when you start an idea you don't think about all the different like small reasons why it might immediately fail you think you know what if this works and then you try to find a way to make it work um but the more interesting one in my opinion was always the simpler one which was you don't have to turn it into a museum you don't have to get permitting you don't have to have guests coming in and operations folks you just treat it differently you don't treat it like a house you treat it like it's a monument it's a piece of art and there are paintings that sell for 800 you know 85 million dollars and so if a painting itself for 85 million dollars i think michael jordan's house this relic of the greatest basketball player of all time is going to be worth something and so the idea would be you crowd fund it you get i don't know 5 000 people to each pitch in two grand you buy the thing out for 10 million bucks and uh you hold it as a piece of art and then you know what i there was a couple of good suggestions i thought came in through twitter so some of the good suggestions were you could list this on rally road where people go to buy like you know vintage cars or rare first edition lord of the rings book sets for 35 000 that you you know 500 people each buy it a fractional share of it so that was one idea people liked and the rally road guys said hey we're interested let's talk so i'm talking to them they they hollered at you they did they've replied to the tweet and then rob the i think he's the ceo i don't know his co-founder uh he emailed me yesterday and so we're gonna we're gonna do chat and see why does everyone cool reach out to you bro they know they know damn and i didn't get anyone hollered at me well are you are your dms open on twitter my dms are open yes i've also talked to him before through dms because i was just like rally is awesome so i had reached out to him actually and that's actually saying hey rally is awesome can i invest in this thing so he knew i was a fanboy already um but anyway so that was one interesting thing some people in the crypto world were like dude let's turn this into an nft bro and uh so i talked to the the founder of uh of nifty gateway which is just exploding this marketplace that's just exploding for nfts right now so i asked him hey would you like to dabble and then the last thing was that some people were like hey and what did they say uh he was like hey this is cool but he was like you know we're just crushing so hard on the digital stuff i don't know if we want to get into this physical thing uh because there were some cool ideas from from twitter some people were like you know let's say you came in and you bought a 50 000 chunk so you instead of the 2 000 entry you go for 50k that should get you like if you present your your certificate of ownership if you show your app and you show that you're you own a piece of this thing um you should be able to have like a three night stay once a year with you and all your friends we're gonna time share mj's house exactly so so you're not fully doing an airbnb you're treating it like it's art but if you own a big enough share if you're you know a super minority owner of this thing then you can actually stay one weekend a year and i thought that was pretty dope um so anyways there's some cool ideas but then at the same time i ain't got time to do this and neither do you so uh what's gonna happen from here you're asking me i don't know i feel like you're kind of the leader on this one uh nothing if i had a bet nothing i i hear and here's why when i did my deal every smart person i talked to what you know what they said i bet you can guess what they said no no what did they say do nothing for six months right so don't invest sit on your hands yeah yeah don't invest and so many times i've been i i've wanted to change and do something and everyone has said the same thing and i'm going to try my hardest to stick to it so that's one of the reasons why although that's probably a excuse the reality is it's kind of an i i don't think i would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up it would be a big deal oh look at you you're afraid to fail now oh you make it big you sell your company and now now you're like i gotta watch my step what's going on i'm not afraid to where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh what would that guy do dude my first time buying like uh a real estate asset and doing something like this would be like i mean that would be national i mean i guess yeah i'm being okay i'm not i'm not saying you buy it i'm saying clearly the way to go here is to crowdfund this thing because it's just more fun that way and you don't have to put out 10 million dollars of risk capital how many emails did you get so somebody oh yeah that was the other thing so somebody created a website uh jonathan created a website i think it's like by by jordanshouse.com or something like that and i think he said you know pretty early on after the tweet he said he had 200 people dropping their email and i think about the same on twitter said i'm in including a bunch of higher profile people there's a bunch of people who are a bunch of really wealthy people founders of companies uh owners of owners of businesses that were like i'm in for 5k i'm in for 10k type of thing now are they just talking is this real i don't know we'll see but i think it was cool i mean the the little video that we had reached 100 000 people i think uh across a couple of different platforms so it was cool and what we decided the takeaway from this is we got to do viral clips all the time we gotta we gotta be like obama the club isn't the best place to find lovers exactly it's not even a conversation this is now just a collection of clips yeah the clip the clip had 60 000 views too uh your twitter clip of you talking about it really yeah well the shitty part is that it's you talking about it and me looking at just like it kept showing my face and you're talking the whole time and i'm just dude that's the way the world goes you put the white man's face up there the brown guy's just in the back coming up with ideas and and handing them over that's why they get our voices confused because they say i look like a bro but i talk like a nerd and you look like a nerd but talk like a bro dude that was the most spot on i wasn't even i was like i'm not mad at all that is so accurate and um you know i it makes now i understand why people keep saying this thing that they get us confused i get it now um let's talk about sex um you have something on here and you before we get into it i want to tell you a fun fact so we have this list where sean and i list ideas he has one thing and it says um why aren't young people having sex and what are the opportunities here and apparently 31 of men 18 and 24 were sexually inactive before quoted yes inactive um and the tweet was from a guy named matt allison um who does a bunch of cool stuff the tweet's not there anymore for some reason um or at least i can't see it got canceled probably can't say apparently you can't say man anymore so this guy nat is really interesting his name's nat allison uh google him he's got like a cool website he owns uh this agency business did you know that this guy so he's interested in this because he owns this thing called like um i'll have to look up what's called but it's a kegel app do you know what a kegel is i do know what a kegel is it is okay like exercise you do with your private parts yeah so basically it it makes it so you don't premature ejaculate and i think women do it too you know i don't know like this i think women do it because it like it can increase like the pleasure but also i think it's just healthy for you to do like it's just like a it's just like a movement that's good for you i guess i don't know and this guy his name is elison nat elison he has uh an app called uh uh i i'll look it up what it's called but it should be called squeeze because to do it to do a kegel you're basically trying to like you know for a guy you're basically trying to like flex your balls that's the best way i could describe it um and and for a girl i'm sure there's you know the equivalent but i don't know what it's called it's called stamp stamina stamina i don't know what that play on words is anyway it walks you through how to do these kegel exercises and it makes like 100k a year he just made it one time and it just ranks what it's a crazy interesting thing kegel exercise i never i never knew that was a thing uh go ahead um okay so so we've talked about this before and before when we said uh i think you actually were the original person to kind of rant about this you were like dude kids aren't having sex you're like i went to this you know people make funny for the hot dog stand thing they're like we get it you used to own a hot dog stand the other story that i've heard you tell a number of times because it's very entertaining and i think it gets you hyped up is you went to some camp and they had a bunch they had like a gen z like you went to some summit and they had a gen z analyst there and the gen z analyst was like hey all the kids are depressed and not having sex and then you were like dude what's going on and you talked about replica which was this app this messaging app where you message like a virtual girlfriend and i tried it out you've tried it out um after you told me about it i went and downloaded it and it was okay it was interesting there's definitely a bunch of people who are really into this it's like this ai virtual girlfriend but i have a different slant to it that i want to bring up here so and by the way this whole sex thing this has been a problem in japan i think for years right right yeah there's like a you know the sexless generation or something they call it like um okay so i want to actually talk about a company that's based in austin right where you're right right where you are you might be able to see it if you look out the window it's called interactive life forms llc you know these guys uh yeah i i know where their building is i've seen their building do you know what they make no interactive do they make sex styles interactive life forms this is the maker of the fleshlight and so i wanted to tell you about this so i did a little research i got a message from a founder of a tech company i won't say his name because he said no uh he said don't say his name but he messaged me and he goes dude idea modern fleshlights and i was like what he goes fleshlights and he breaks he broke it down for me he goes the um the sex toy market is bigger than you think he goes uh female sex toys like a dildo or a vibrator are on the rise and there's this big like kind of like anti-stigma like people trying to remove the stigma around it uh i don't know if you've seen any of this but it's like kind of the feminist movement um they call it they call it sex positivity which is basically like hey sex doesn't need to be taboo it doesn't need to be stigma um it's okay to have sex that doesn't make you like you know a bad person or something like that and so there's this sex positivity movement and with that has been this big boom in sales of sex toys primarily female sex toys so i started looking at the most popular male sex toy which is the fleshlight and so here's some information about the fleshlight uh it was started by this guy steve schubin and this guy's super interesting he basically he's a he's one of 13 kids he uh go he plays college football then he goes into the army then he comes back and he's a police officer with the swat team in la and then he like retires from swat when he's like 30 something because he's like i love being in the police force but um it doesn't pay well so i'm gonna start a business and his wife is a pro tennis player so this he's got this hot tennis player wife and he's like i'm gonna start a business he doesn't know what he's gonna start and by the way do you know who that hot wife and steve schubin's son is no who aubrey marcus the founder of onnit oh no way i didn't know yeah and he co-founded with joe rogan yes because fleshlight was joe rogan's first sponsor that aubrey secured that's amazing okay so i'll get into that that's actually a part of this so um so so years go by he does nothing then they're in their 40s um steve's wife gets pregnant and the doctor tells him hey you're in your 40s so this is kind of like an at-risk pregnancy um so you can't uh you can't be having sex and he's like okay doc like you know what do you want me to do i'm a 6-3 red-blooded american what what am i supposed to do and so um he starts thinking about it and he goes why isn't there a um why isn't there a a sex toy for men and so he originally plans to make a mannequin and in fact in 1998 he gets a patent for a mannequin with sexual application so it's basically like a doll that he wants to make so he's trying to make this doll and he puts in 50k and he starts working on this doll and he's he's trying to blend all these different polymers how do you get this skin feel of this doll how do you get the flesh to feel like flesh how do you get it to look like a doll feel like a doll feel like a human and um and he makes it a family business so he brings his sons into the to the table they get a whiteboard out and they start uh brainstorming together as a family which i find hilarious uh because you know in my family this is not a this is not a business we could start together so he he keeps going two years go by he's put in a quarter million dollars now he's sold zero uh zero zero product so far and he keeps trying to make this full body doll and he meets a guy one day a friend of his and his friends like hey um i think what you're doing is great there's this weird taboo around this but why not more pleasure in the world what's the problem so he says um will you give me one i'll buy one off you and he says cool what's your address i'll send you the doll and he's like no dude no way i can't bring that doll into my house he's like just take out the part that's like the vagina of the doll and send me that like put it in a little box and i'm like my wife won't see it and uh just send me that and so he's like dude if my friend who wants this won't like can't buy this doll this doll is dead so that's why he pivoted from the doll to just the just the like you know just the the organ part of it just a single piece one component and so he's like okay how do we brand this so him and his sons are brainstorming and they're like what do guys like guys like tools okay this thing's kind of like a flashlight okay we'll call this the fleshlight so that's how it gets its name uh during that process and so he eventually this was like a father-son project father-son project multiple times weird man and so um now years have gone by they've put in over two million dollars and this guy believes so much in this thing he ramps up production he's pumping out 1200 units a day before they've sold anything because he's like the world is gonna love this they are gonna buy this thing and um so he goes all in on this to to meet this you know future demand and turns out they actually did it so the fleshlight now these guys do i believe about a hundred million dollars in revenue uh it's definitely above 50 it's they don't report it but to me i did some sleuthing and i think it's a hundred million dollar a your company over a hundred employees they um basically dominate the market for for male sex toys now and uh you know this guy who went all in on this thing it ended up being a successful family business which i think is you know just a heartwarming story what a crazy story and and i had heard a little bit about it but i didn't realize i didn't know all those details but by the way this is the best part of the whole story so he he opens up a facility in austin so it's manufactured near you um then he has a one in spain and he has one somewhere else in asia i think and he has so much like like manufacturing capacity so what do they do with the excess capacity when they when they have a little extra guess what they make they make prosthetics for elephants who have had their legs blown off in the you know from where there's mines in in southeast asia um so they're they're the top maker of elephant prosthetics in southeast asia that's their backup that's their side business what got you interested in this uh well when this guy said it i was like you know the founder who messaged me he yeah this is we're gonna have to bleep this but he goes dude every guy jacks off there's got to be a market what if you he's like what if this he's like i don't own this product you don't own this product he goes but what if this thing made it 10 times better isn't that crazy that there's still a taboo around this that's gonna change dude the sex positivity thing for women it's gonna affect men i bet you you can make a modern day ddc version of the fleshlight and so i started thinking about it and started looking up okay how big is this how big is this industry and it is a pretty big industry like they do like the sex toy industry itself is about 20 billion dollars a year what percentage is to to men so women so this is kind of i was trying to figure out the sales difference so it's mo it's dominated by female um sales so the fleshlight is the biggest of males but uh the female industry is much bigger about 65 of women say that they have used one um there was a stat that said 50 of male men said that they've used one which i don't believe um i know a lot of dudes i haven't heard one ever talk about this so maybe it's just happening on the download a sex toy yeah like i've never i've never had one conversation with a friend not a single well yeah so so yeah so i don't know if i believe that stat but um basically the european market is bigger than the american market like places like italy it's like super common apparently they're you know free love um places the fastest growing markets right now are india and china where it's the most taboo but what's happened is because it's all gone to e-commerce and the e-commerce companies are using very discrete packaging like they send it to you and it looks like one thing but inside is another and so that's the like that's where this thing is growing and so there's a bunch of startups in this space as well that are um doing like 15 million a year like love honey i like just just check out this traffic so uh the top the top website for this the top sort of amazon for this thing is called adam and eve yeah i was just i was just looking at adam and eve uh because they have stores all over san francisco they they have about 8 million visitors a month to their e-commerce store which is a huge e-commerce store uh love honey is about 4 million to their store and what's interesting is there's all these problems all this friction in trying to build one of these companies because stripe won't let you take payments wait why wouldn't stripe let you take payments for a dill they say they say we don't um we do not do any sexual products so that's so you can use shopify but shopify uses stripe and so you can't do shopify basically because stripe won't allow it so adam and eve love honey these these companies they can't uh they can't process on stripe and so there's an opportunity i think for for you know building stripe for vice products because cannabis can't use stripe and neither can any uh any any sex products uh porn can't use stripe and so if you know just those three industries alone that's like multiple hundreds of billions of dollars of of turnover and so who's building stripe for vice i don't know i want to go i want to go look into that another one of these like opportunities is um is is that you can build a a brand that's figures out a new form of marketing because you can't advertise on facebook or instagram um or any like kind of display network that's uh mainstream for these products and so i was looking into how do they get around this and i was curious how would you get around this if you were trying to market one of these products it's an interesting sort of like job interview question i would ask somebody well i would write articles on like you write articles that are yep yeah so you have to write let me all right so if we're talking about like a vibrator you write an article about like uh sexual health i guess or i don't know whatever uh what i mean i would have to i don't i would have to do research what what a woman who is about to buy this what is she what type of content interests her right and i would write that article and i would display it on outbrain or i would display it on uh i don't know where would i display it it's hard so i looked into how these guys are doing it and i think there's there's three interesting horn hub you gotta go you can do a porn hub so so they use the adult ad networks like traffic junkie and exoclick so they advertise on porn sites basically that's that's a good that's an easy one pretty straightforward um the other thing that they do is they they do heavy like content so so even though you can't advertise on um on facebook and you can you're kind of limited on google you can do it for certain keywords and for just stuff that people searching for so if people are searching for what is the best one i should buy what you know reviews and so you remember how the cat the the mattress company casper was buying up the mattress review websites um and then like promoting casper so that's what these guys will do as well they'll buy up the review sites and then they'll just put their products as the best reviewed product on there and they'll say this is you know i'm an affiliate for this for this company um so that's one way and then the i thought the most innovative one and they also do like kind of direct so like you were saying uh fleshlight was one of the first sponsors on joe rogan they'll do that they'll go direct to podcasts or newsletters that are willing to take them as a sponsor and they'll they'll go for it there but um the last one i thought was interesting was what fleshlight did this is a little bit this whole segment's a little bit x-rated it's a you know um you know apologies if you're listening to this with kids in the car you know i hope you've skipped forward at this point but basically what fleshlight did was they wanted celebrity sponsors um so what they did was you know nike goes to lebron james and says okay we want you to sponsor our stuff um so are they going to get women to be there they got they went to famous models and porn stars and they created molds yeah of them and so it's like you can buy the i forgot the i looked up this chart of who was the top selling skew of that and so there's a woman kayla or shayla or something like that i don't remember her name it was but she's some model she's some porn star i don't know who she is but she's famous and they they they bring them in they do a cast a cast mold of her body and then they turn that into a product and then she can sell that product to her fans and so i was thinking if you were going to do this now you have only fans where you know i think a billion billion plus dollars is being paid out to their creators i would go to only fans uh creators and i would do this i would do that model for them i think that would be probably the strongest distribution tactic you could get dude what a fascinating thing i uh would you ever i would invest in this but i wouldn't i would never work on this i would never work on this i have zero interest in this from from you know like to actually like pursue it but i do think it's one of those things that nobody talks about and so because nobody talks about it it's both interesting and it's surprising when you look into it how this whole system actually works so i like you know just like i love the silk road but i would never go on the silk road and buy drugs but i like to learn about it and see how it worked and how big it was and who was behind it and how how they kept it stealthy like that's fascinating to me just like i like watching prison shows but i'm not trying to go murder anybody i like watching you know bank heists but i'm not planning to rob anybody that's how i am with this these types of products so at the adam and eve store what was it called uh yeah adam and eve stores um i saw the though we had so many locations in san francisco we probably had three or four or five different locations um it's a pretty huge business hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue currently owned by i believe a private equity company um that is also another fascinating business did you research that uh no i didn't research that one but i found one other two other like interesting things about how they how they market these things i thought was pretty clever uh it just shows you know entrepreneurial creativity here all right so uh there's one company that's doing these like uh you know like the the sort of mlm model which which is uh you get one person who's kind of a seller for you and they have a party so this is like the old tupperware parties um they call them passion parties for this and so they have women invite their friends over and they're called passion parties where they show the different toys and what they could do or whatever i don't know how this sounds like the most awkward party to me but apparently it's working the second one that i thought was super interesting was um they basically there's a company called diamond products and they make they make uh some brand of something i have no idea um and they couldn't advertise in any traditional channel so they went and they bought um sir richard's condoms company so they said oh condoms are allowed to be advertised on tv and on on on uh different websites it's more loose to uh to like trojan right we've all seen trojan ads on tv for example so if the restrictions are looser there they went and bought that company and then on their website they just they upsell other products basically and so he he went and bought this company because he goes they're sold in whole foods he's like this makes it so easy for me to advertise because now i own this little thing he's like it's my trojan horse haha like you know this is how i advertise my my sex products company and so i thought that was pretty interesting and you know i think if you did this with instagram models and oldie fans you could basically just copy the um what's that watch brand mvmt you could copy the the the movement movement watches brand uh model and try to you know they they went to 100 million in sales and watches i bet you could do the same uh using their influencer strategy dude how interesting like i i uh i love learning from these types of people i i don't even like i'm i don't even like going to this i went to the fleshlight website i don't even like going to that i think it's close the tab yeah i think it's weird i'm on my work computer just so anyone uh at hubspot yeah this is work related my uh my wife's dad listens to the podcast i i'm just gonna tell him hey don't listen to this one i apologize if you well it was a fairly academic discussion about something well the worst part is now my now i'm getting retargeted like crazy because i was doing research on this for the pod and now all my ads are completely uh messed up well do you want to talk about another interesting person yes or do you want to talk about an idea person make this a p okay we're gonna do a an interesting person okay there's this guy who we're gonna do billy of the week here with this guy and i by the way i think we're gonna do this we've discussed doing this every friday maybe we will but google the way we need like a jingle for the billy of the week it needs to be like you know the billy of the week somebody make us a little jingle for that that would be pretty cool um we do need that google brad kelly and make sure you spell it like b-r-a-d so brad space k-e-l-l-e-y okay if you're on your phone do it brad kelly now you're gonna see a picture of a guy with a red beard you see the red beard i see it okay and then two over you're gonna see a picture of an old guy with a longer like a he looks like uh like mark twain yep see it black and white so that that's the same guy the photos are just he's just older now so this guy he's so interesting to me for a couple different reasons so this guy's name is brad kelly at this point he's probably in his 60s and he's known as uh the man with a million acres that was a headline that was written in the new york times about him and they wrote it about him because he is one of the largest landowners in america at one point he was number three or number four and he's kind of known for being incredibly reclusive so he doesn't do any interviews he doesn't do anything like that but he's bad to the bone he's a really interesting guy and i've read a little bit about him and i've kind of got a feel for this guy and he's so intriguing to me so he was born uh you know he's 65 years older ish he was born in kentucky uh went to college in kentucky but at age 19 dropped out because he started buying warehouses and he started making enough money buying and leasing out warehouses that he goes all right i'm gonna do this i don't need school anymore and eventually he started renting them out to people who were building stuff so creating little miniature factories um he would fix them up and lease them to people and eventually he saw that people were using them to store tobacco and one of his tendons moved out and he got whole he he they left a machine that turned tobacco and like pumped them into cigarettes or you know like a like a rolling machine or something like that and he was like well i got this machine let's try it and so he started making cheap cigarettes and eventually he rolled uh he made it a proper company and he called it commonwealth brands and if you google commonwealth brands i don't smoke cigarettes but i recognize some of the brands they're like uh i think looks like he has like 15 or so cigarette brands yeah it's like i think parliaments that's like uh when i was a kid that was like we would joke like if someone smokes parliament that means they were like a bro kid um uh but he made cheap cigarettes and after 10 years he sold this cigarette company for a billion dollars and i hate smoking and i don't think it's cool to smoke um and he doesn't die there and he did but he didn't hide that he goes i've never defended smoking and i hope that it will be phased out of society but i did it because you know it made i made a living doing you know it made a living for me and using almost all of when billionaires say they they're just trying to make a living it's like no you made you made like a billion livings that's a lot of you made a lot of livings and with all this money he did a couple interesting things the first thing that he did well he didn't do it first but the first interesting thing is he bought lonely planet you know what lonely planet is i've heard that name what is that is that a dating site that's a date i bet you if you look at your uh your book collection you might have a lonely planet book it's a travel website and book company oh okay and it was a big it was a really big deal for many years and then when digital came along it got crushed and he bought lonely planet for 70 million dollars and he had us and they probably had 300 employees and he had a kid that he liked somehow met this young guy who was 24 and he put him as ceo and they never signed a contract they just shook hands and they go all right you're ceo now you know talk to me if you need me such a kentucky thing to do to shake hands and this kid ran it and it didn't do so hot i mean if like it would have been cool if there was a better ending to that part of the story right either through a combination of the 24 year old sucking and covid they sold it uh for like 50 million so he didn't make money on it um but what he did with the rest of his money is he bought ranches and leased them back to the owners and they make a little bit of profit but not a significant amount of profit and at this point he owns um over a million acres in america which is a huge huge huge amount making him in 2012 the fourth largest landowner in america the guy never does interviews he you can't find him if you want to he's really hard to find uh the only reason people really truly know about him is at one point he sold one of his ranches for 400 million dollars uh really interesting guy i like him because he's uh i think that like i get caught in this world on twitter of like oh building building public you know what's your mrr i got to go to executive coaching and it's so nice to hear from a guy this guy actually seems like a pretty thoughtful guy but he definitely gives off the redneck vibe uh obviously he's highly intelligent but they say that like he goes to his ranches and he likes to drink bourbons bourbon and wear a kilt so he's like kind of a wild guy he's into some weird all right yeah but pretty interesting guy and i wanted to bring this guy up because i bet most people have never heard of him uh but so interesting he also owns do you know what kentucky downs is the horse horse track yeah he owns that oh wow and so he just owns all types of real estate and that's what he put all of his money into very interesting person uh yeah this is this is cool so why were you saying the part about people um who have like executive coaches and what was the contrast there so explain that one like i see people who've got like small ass companies who like are not even they're they're like barely just started and they're like tweeting out like leadership quotes or they're talking about like uh how they need to be more inclusive at their company or this and that and i just get sick of this hype thing and i see all the people like oh building public uh and and i'm guilty of all this as well um but like all the and we're part of the hype cycle right we're media but it's cool to see someone who you've never heard of who just is anonymous and shuts the fucks up and just works and does cool stuff and has a cool life and it's entirely like you know everyone's like i got in a fight on twitter about people which uh about buying domain names you think this guy knows how knows how to buy a domain name in one of the interviews he said he he doesn't know how to use email right yeah this guy's not vegan yes this guy no this guy eats vegans right this guy is made of leather uh yeah okay so you just like that he's like kind of like a tough guy rough guy business guy doesn't give a and uh everybody else you know makes such a big deal of little things it's kind of i just think it's cool to see to hear different perspectives and i'm sure that uh he does a lot of bad stuff i mean he owned a cigarette company right like that's kind of pretty shitty but uh it was just cool it's cool to have a different perspective and this guy if you google him i'm pretty sure there's only three pictures that i've i've researched this guy a lot i i've only found three pictures of him and he's worth three or four billion dollars i like it all right he is indeed the billy of the week um i wonder i wonder who i wonder how people will will react to this guy because i think some people are like so anti-cigarettes that they're like you are you know you that you're saying that you you kind of idolizing this guy who is a uh you know who did bad things like a you know like a warlord almost and so i don't know you're you were the one who also said you would not invest in jewel right was that you yeah look i'm not i'm not defending this person's actions i think but i think that no matter how evil or horrible someone is there's you can always find something interesting maybe saying admirable is a bit of a stretch but you can always find something interesting no matter how bad someone is and i don't think this guy is necessarily a bad guy but yeah he i mean he he's so poisoned yeah it's pretty right see i think of it i think i don't know maybe i'm a little disconnected from reality but for me i'm like i don't like movies where everybody is a good guy i would not play a game a video game where you just walk around as a good samaritan like those aren't fun to me and i think that the real world has all kinds of people shapes colors beliefs all all kinds of different things and i'm interested in the variety of ways that people live their life and i'm glad that people live their life doing all these different things even though a lot of them are like villains or a lot of them i'm not saying this guy's a villain but like i think that's just the way the world is and i think it's crazy to believe that the world shouldn't be that way or won't be that way where people are going to live their life doing different things maybe this guy likes to drink bourbon and wear a kilt on a farm that he owns like all right great i'm glad that character exists i'm glad that that that you know i'm glad these characters exist i think that um most people will not feel that way most people will say well if this person's a bad guy um you know he shouldn't exist and i don't know i i find that to be this is not the way i think about it i believe every great man or every great woman is also a bad man so what i mean by that is if you are at all if you're considered great at anything or one of the best inevitably you have many enemies because you can't make everyone happy right now by the way can you tweet that out so i'm doing this thing i'm getting uh behind me one of the things that's going to go behind me is i'm pr i'm getting these laser etched signs that are tweets basically it's called lasertweets.com and so uh you can basically get any tweet turned into a wooden laser etched sign and i'm gonna put i'm gonna hang a couple of my favorite quotes and tweets behind me and one of them one of my favorites is every great man is also a bad man and so i need you to tweet that out so that i can do it but what you can't do is you can't or you can do person um if you if you want to not make it gender specific here but i need you to tweet that out so i can i can get that one made yeah you're gonna get on my wall i don't think i may i think i made up that phrasing but uh i read it in a book and uh i don't remember exactly how they phrased it but that's how i phrased it but i believe it to be true and dude i did so much research on this guy that i went and i went to land forums so a really interesting research tactic that you should do is you type in whatever you're searching for like fleshlight and then you type in forum right and then you are brought to user generated content of message boards and what people are saying or you could do the same thing but you just type in the word reddit it's pretty sick and i went to land forums where this guy bought people's land and they go yeah you know someone's like hey this guy named uh brad kelly offered to buy my land who sold to him and people are like yeah we sold to him uh he's fine enough done but don't bother us and offered us a fair deal and so they're like well and we all and people said well and we read about him doing cigarettes and that kind of sucks but he's never caused us a problem so anyway every great man is also a bad man i like it uh did you want to do any any of these other ones or are we saving them uh i think this one should all they should be saved okay i have one quick one because i don't really have much to say but we talked or we could do the ndvc one okay i'm gonna do one quick plug for these guys that took an idea we talked about and they made it so we talked about levels.fyi which is a salary comparison website we had a whole episode about like open salaries and should you or should you not transparent data how that helps blah blah blah and we said hey levels does this for the tech industry where you can go see all right if i'm a facebook product manager level five what will i make if i live in seattle what will i make if i live in san francisco what's the benchmark what are the what is some data so i know if i'm getting if i'm getting hosed if they gave me a fair job offer or not fair job offer and so we said dude somebody should do this for other industries because this is awesome um why isn't this happening in others so these guys made med levels.fyi and it's basically doctor pay um and so they if you go to it you can see they don't have a ton of data yet but um they're getting some they're getting doctors to to put in how much they're getting paid based on where they live and what type of doctor they are i think it's great super simple it's just basically an air table displayed on a website so really easy to build and uh no it's uh google forms i think yeah yeah i'm just saying like in theory right it's like such a simple simple product to do so med levels.fyi good good job by those guys and if you're a doctor listening go put your shit in there yeah it's pretty cool i was looking at this um all right we'll wrap it up by talking about one more thing and maybe we should put this in the beginning but let me ask you how has your angel investing gone so far i'll tell you in 10 years that's the problem with angel investing but how many deals have you invested in uh i think a little under 20 maybe like 18 something like that 18 companies we've invested in deployed about i don't know million and a half two million dollars something like that and do you feel confident that you have some winners uh yeah definitely there's some winners um now we'll see i think any anything anything can happen but i would say i'd be surprised if out of these 18 if we don't have you know two companies that are worth a billion dollars or more i'd be surprised so wow that's pretty sick so we um a few weeks ago i tweeted out something that andrew chen said basically i asked andrew chen who's a partner at andreessen horowitz what his advice to me for angel investing was and he told me his opinion and i tweeted that out people shit on me even though i was like i'm not saying this i'm just or i'm just like i'm the messenger yeah like i'm just like reporting on someone interesting's opinion but i did tend to agree on a couple of the things and one of them was that there's this narrative that you there's this narrative of people who hate vc and they're like i would rather grow slower and it's like okay that's cool do that but in order and and they also say profits matter you know like and they love to mock silicon valley companies they're like dude these guys you know they don't know anything about profits sorry i'm just over here running a profitable business just growing steady every year and so they they like to get on that kind of high horse which is crazy because like both can exist and be wonderful but there was this guy who i really like and i don't mean to show him at all um it was called ndvc and it was it was kind of it was kind of weird i don't know why it was a venture capital firm because its whole shtick was basically we invest in bootstrap businesses that want to grow slowly um they didn't exactly say slowly but it was for bootstrapped companies which is again a little bit of an oxymoron why is a bootstrap company going to be taking venture capital right but a lot of people really liked it and the guy who ran it i forget his name i met with him awesome guy and they went out of business this week and i think his name bryce i like bryce bryce is a good guy but the model didn't work and i wanted to bring this up because something that andrew said was he said two things he was said uh invest in quantity so just kind of throw money at a bunch of stuff so like anything that seems promising just kind of mindlessly invest in it and second make sure it's growing 3x a year if it's not then it's not good and a lot of people didn't like when i said that and they didn't like it i think because it kind of hurt their feelings of like well you're saying i'm not worthy of venture capital and the answer is is yeah you're not right you're not and but that's okay that doesn't like you shouldn't be offended um right you don't have to shut down your business that just means this type of asset this type of venture you know venture uh capital is chasing a certain profile a company and you may not fit that profile and by the way i think that most people i bet you i mean this sounds so douchey i bet you i've made significantly more money than a lot of people who have raised absolutely and so i was telling somebody this the other day i was like um i was like you know media companies we're talking about media companies and you know you guys just sold your you guys are a media company and it wasn't the biggest exit ever it's not like you know some insane thing but i was like dude he i don't how much did you raise total like a million and a half dollars two million dollars something like that a million a million dollars right so it took so little money and and not so so give the give the profile it was a million dollars and it took you how many years from start to finish um finish but but when we liquidity uh start as in we raised money to finish uh less than five years and i made eight eight figures right exactly and so and you owned you know majority of the business or whatever so like you because you didn't have to raise all this money and dilute yourself over and over and over again from round after round after round and it's like there are if you look at companies that are selling for a billion dollars where the founder owns four percent or two percent or seven percent and um you know it's not like and they and they sweated it for 10 years and every hair on their head is gray because uh because of that path so it doesn't the size of the exit is not not linked really to the to the uh outcome for the for the founder themselves i agree which proves that we're not or i i know i'll for speaking to myself and i i i think you you're not shitting on this this idea of anti-vc whatever but this company went out of business and it goes against this narrative of like if you're gonna give money to venture capital or companies that fit the profile of vc you want them to be what many would just think or describe as reckless right and that's one thing i didn't get why did they go out of business so so basically they couldn't raise more money was the idea yeah right that's how a vc fund goes out of business and he said in his thing he's like we invested in 10 companies or whatever he gave some numbers so so tell me but he goes they were all bootstrapped and profitable and they're all still going and they're 40 you know he said something like we've invested in these they're all still going they're all still profitable but we couldn't raise any more money it's like what what do you i don't understand what what is his reason why did they go out of business he kind of sounded like he was crying a little bit like he was kind of whining because he's like our lps didn't like our model so they pulled the plug because you know whatever i did i didn't read the thing very carefully so you tell me you you into this oh i mean yeah why is he saying they failed i don't think he was whining i think he was just saying the fact that like most people don't like this idea and weren't willing to stick it out and i don't blame them because if you go to nd.bc the website it's a video of a unicorn head on fire as if like they're anti-unicorn and in my head returns are good if his returns are good every people would still be looking to back the fund because people who invest in the returns aren't as good as other stuff like right so that's what he needs to say it's not that people don't like this he needs to say i was wrong my returns weren't as good as i thought they would be and they were not good enough to get more money because people invest i invest in vc funds i also would invest in real estate which has a different profile i'll invest in crypto which has a different return risk return profile i invest in many things and so that's why i thought it was kind of whining because i didn't it didn't just say the honest truth i had this idea that this would be a great way to invest and my but my returns were actually shitty and therefore i couldn't raise more money and either that's true or his returns were actually good and he sucked at going and getting new investors i didn't there's only two ways to go about it right like i didn't understand i didn't i stopped reading because i didn't he didn't he wasn't saying the truth in my opinion no i mean he said the truth he said that uh like our strategy a lot of lps bailed uh it cost us 80 of our lp base they didn't want to come back um and it was just yeah the strategy didn't didn't work in the sense of investors did he post his returns no okay that's the thing he needed to say right he's saying they didn't like our strategy it was so he was kind of just like patting himself on the back i felt he's like they didn't like that we were going against the grain going against the vc thing and they had to pull out because of that it's like well is it that they didn't like what you were doing or is it that it wasn't working and the returns weren't very good and they didn't believe the returns were going to be very good i don't know i i'm being harsh on the guy i don't know the guy but no he's cool and i'm not bringing this up to bringing this up to show them i think it's cool he took a shot it was a bad shot though and that's that's great right you take swings sometimes for sure but uh i think though it's important it's important that we look at what this what's what does this mean here and i think that someone like andrew chen who's this from the outside you think of him as like an elitist like went to uh i don't know he just like give this vibe that he's like an elitist type of guy um but and and so and he kind of represents a lot of people like him right these like vcs who like oh like these tech bros and the reality is though is that that strategy of like doing stuff that appears to be reckless from the outside it is the right strategy it just feels really uncomfortable for a lot of people dude if you if you it's it's a classic don't hate the play i hate the game it's not that the it's not that vcs decided oh you know what i'll do i'm going to invest in a bunch of companies and one or two will return the fund and everything else will go to zero it's not that they want that right that's actually extremely stressful for them um that hey if i get into this company that becomes a 10 billion dollar plus company i'm a hero and i'm the best and if i just miss them and i invest in a bunch of other good companies that didn't quite get there i suck and i can't raise my next fund and i'm out of a job and um and so so it's crazy to me that like they're not picking this that just is the nature of the game and they have to play it if they want to succeed at it it's like in any game theory um the game will the players in the game will eventually find the meta game the strategy that is the optimal strategy and if you just because of your like you know your opinion and your personality and your morals don't want to play it cool that's fine but you're just not going to get you're not going to be playing the optimal strategy you're going to eventually lose the game and so i think it's crazy that people hate the vcs when it's just that's the way that innovation works the innovations that break through become humongous and the innovations that don't become zeros and or close to zeros and the winners are so big that that's they dominate all the returns but then there's this other ground where it's like fvc which me personally i'm on that boat where i want to be a vc but i don't want to take vc money and and that that's this other group of people it's like dude they all can exist like right and that's why that quote is so insightful right don't hate the player hate the game cool you can hate the game that's allowed that's in the quote um you're allowed to hate the game and say i'm going to play a different game no problem you can play games where you bootstrap or you don't raise vc money where you you don't do business at all you go be an employee somewhere no problem that's always an option well i guess we just did a little rant but i wanted to bring that up we'll see if this episode turns out to be anything interesting um i'll break you how we do b plus i want the graphics guys to like slam a big b plus all over the screen all right why b plus you got to give give the people that your explanation why why why are you saying what you're saying i mean it was good research but it just wasn't as juicy as it could be it was good i've never seen sean more animated than when he talks about flashlights by the way yeah i was super into that to be honest i uh it got ruined when i went to the website it's pretty freaking disgusting but did you go to the website no i did all my research i didn't go to their website it's not great it's pretty gross um but no i think it's interesting i think what we'll have to do is um i think like if we did an entire episode on flashlight or an entire episode on this guy brad kelly i think it would be crazy fascinating um more i thought i thought brad was saying i went too much into it no that the the flash that was the best part i'm just saying you're very animated about it yeah like i would do here and i i have i have space but it's cold so i have to talk in an animated way to like not freeze you're passionate about flashlights it's okay so i've been listening i listen to a true crime podcast every night which is weird that i'm in bed like with my wife about to go to sleep hearing about like how this guy just like murdered and raped these people um but it's this one lately called generation y it's really popular and all it is is two guys discussing crimes and mysteries ranging from 9 11 to serial murders to the bermuda triangle all the all that type of thing and all they're doing is talking and retelling a story we should definitely just do that with one interesting person yeah i think that's great um although if it's not true crime i don't know how interesting people how interested people would be in it um if you told a 60 to 70 to 90 minute story in the same way that you told that flashlight story um people would love it i could tell because i mean i could i was enthralled by it what's the first story we could tell how could we try it well um one time we talked about this the french bill gates that that guy was so intriguing to me um uh to do 60 minutes that's like you can really only tell like your own story or like some something you really go or like a you know the american kingpin story you can like retell it retell the book basically as a podcast well that's what you're doing at the end of the day which is you're just reading 15 articles and you're telling the long story about it and what you could do is uh one of us is the more more researched and the other one listens and asks questions okay all right i'm down to try it if you have an idea am i wrong abreyu i mean it could work i'm just i don't know how you can make it that exciting like true crime there's suspense there's mystery you know what's gonna happen i don't i guess business maybe like big business scandals you could do that with no dude you do it exactly like you did the fleshlight origin stories yeah i think origin stories are good right that's what i tried to do with the fleshlight guy i was like basically you tell how this thing came to be um so i think you could do it that way it works i don't i but i agree with john i don't know how you get 60 to 90 minutes out of it i think you basically forget the six families that doesn't matter it could be 20 minutes it's no issue but um it's like just a well-told story a well-researched and therefore well-told story about something that happened i honestly know like for me i started listening to this youtube channel that basically is like it's like book summaries but um actually done good i actually like it and what's it called it's called productivity game as a youtube it's a youtube channel with about half a million i think subscribers or something like that um i might i could be wrong on that but it's a lot of subscribers um but i've listened to probably 10 of their book summaries of just books i've had i bought i just haven't got to i'm like do i really want to go read like made to stick or can i just like watch a seven minute video and like oh those are the four principles of made to stick cool i still might read the book but now i know if it's like interesting or not and so similarly i'm reading like you know whether it's um like for example i read this book uh paypal whatever the paypal origin story or whatever if we just retold that it's like you know just take the book and then turn it into a 20 minute retelling of the story um i think that's pretty that could be pretty well i know that would work american kingpin would be great there's this awesome podcast called we study billionaires which sounds lame but it honestly it's like you guys know it's they're huge and it's really good um and they'll read a book on someone or just a long article and just retell the story right it's really good i love this podcast it's called the investors podcast we've never heard of this that's in pish yeah they're good man i know their thumbnail the red thumbnail they're huge yeah 40 million downloads they have so that would work um i guess we're we should publish us talking right now but speaking of books you know what i'm doing is this isn't the one i'm doing with it i'm just gonna read one book this year but i'm gonna study the out of it i'm sick of reading like two books a month and not remembering anything yeah i'm just for me like youtube is just so much better like i'm just going deep on like you know like uh charlie munger peter lynch youtube stuff and i'm just like watching watching so many of their videos or listening to their videos and uh there's just a lot of wisdom in there and charlie munger said this thing he's like he's like i don't want to read the news he goes i want to read something that it made sense 30 years ago it makes sense today it's going to make sense 30 years from now and i'd rather just read that 10 times than read like whatever the latest thing is and that's kind of what you're saying yeah i i agree um all right well um let's bounce i'm gonna get my set up uh by the next podcast better uh huh i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back like uh
