Basically, I think with the rise of no code tools, virtual assistants, all this sort of stuff, I think the average company, and we do this at my company, could just be 30% more productive. We have basically one virtual assistant hire for every two people that we have that are on the team. And we give them a training that's like, here's how to use virtual assistants, get all of the repetitive stuff off your plate.

And I just wish I could hire someone to do that as a service where he or she sits in product meetings or marketing or logistics team shit. And it's just like, we're going to automate these five pieces and just continually does that across the company. Where did you learn that from?

That's so interesting to give VAs to every two people. Yeah. I just started doing it when we started the company.

I think that's pretty amazing. I feel like I can rule the world. I know I could be what I want to.

I put my all in it like no days off. On the road, less travel, never looking back.
