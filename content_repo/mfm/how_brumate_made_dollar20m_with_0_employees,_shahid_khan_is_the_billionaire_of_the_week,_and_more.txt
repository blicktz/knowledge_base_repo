eco-friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles i've just never done it yeah dude i'm fine i'm they called me hose water was my middle name in high school i'm i'm like i don't i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right do you want to do a recap on rob dyrdek because i've been getting blown up about about that blown up yeah this is i would say definitely the most the biggest reaction we've had to an episode in a long time maybe ever ever i'd probably say ever the the the one thing that i got was basically people said this is not just the best podcast you guys have done but this is maybe the best episode i've ever listened to of any podcast and i don't it's definitely wasn't us that made it great but he was pretty amazing right he he was and i didn't know how it would turn out i remember literally being amazed in the moment like the things he was saying were very surprising to me and very interesting and i wanted to know more and he told he was very open so that was dope as well but i you never know like how the episode turns out and there's all these different factors you know from audio quality to like do people care what this person has to say are they interested what we're interested in well people definitely dug it yeah you're right people were saying like my top three podcast episodes this year was naval on tim ferris rob on your guys's pod and then whatever some reply all podcasts that happened so it was like not just this is y'all's best but this is one of the best i've heard and there was people tweeting like all right this is the fourth person that mentioned this to me i gotta go listen to this today so something definitely happened i'm curious in the numbers what that's going to show uh in a couple they're good they're good i've looked at him he okay so rob dierdick on the podcast mentioned his schedule and i was curious about it and so i actually asked him to email me um what that looked like and he sent me a screenshot i sent it to you sean can you read what it what it's what it is and um basically like at first glance what does it look like when you see his schedule it's a picture of his gmail or his calendar so it looks like well there's a few there's a few views but uh the one i'm looking at it looks like i would say a combination between like a p l like uh you know a business's p l cash flow statement and or like you know just like a research doc put out by uh gartner about you know the trends of an industry this doesn't look like one person's you know weekly schedule and if you look at the view of his calendar every single minute of his day is marked off every minute yeah it's blocked off now some of it is like you know it could be like whatever free time or something like that like family and kids right so it's not saying he's working all the time but every minute is is accounted for every minute has a purpose and uh it says here i track every hour of every day throughout the day and tag each entry i have a script written that pulls and pulls the time and populates into these two spreadsheets one is daily time use and the other is monthly average so should we do the should we look at his monthly average real quick yeah all right so monthly average we'll take um we'll take september okay so september he's got sleep which was 6.9 hours uh health 1.2 hours life which is like kind of like family and things like that 7.8 hours and then work uh 8.1 hours per day and it's pretty consistent like work never in any month in the whole year the lowest month was february 5.8 hours and the highest month was october 9.3 hours right uh sleep almost always 6.8 or 6.9 hours per day so this is a pretty uh meticulous um meticulous thing and by the way in the work category he's got like tv shows right here's my tv shows here's here's how many hours i'm spending on tv shows not watching tv making tv yeah yeah making tv making his tv shows um and then there's like the dudek machine which is kind of like his business that builds businesses and then there's other which is you know random meetings and stuff like that um very cool very cool and health he's got gym meditation personal care other uh for life he's got you know him and his wife kids friends and social and then other right so this is this is sick do you think okay so let's let's let's talk about this just for two seconds do you think that this does this work for you because by the way i'm saying this out loud but i'm gonna package this if it's if he's okay with it i'm gonna package this and post it somewhere it's a visual thing so we should basically like you know on twitter and newsletter i'll put on my newsletter too but like we should post this so people can see it if he's cool with it we'll ask him yeah and do you think that do you roll this way because you and i joke like the best days are when there's nothing on the calendar and when people cancel stuff and and that feels like the best day to me although sometimes i feel lazy and sometimes i feel meaningless but do you do you like to operate this way or do you like to operate with the open calendar or what so i'll tell you some of my uh i'll tell you two things i'll tell you my my calendar philosophy do i want to be scheduled or unscheduled i want to be the opposite of this i want to be completely unscheduled um and you know i don't know why that is the case it used to be the opposite so my calendar used to look a lot like his i used to block out like i used to just do it at high level like work block one lunch work block two gym you know family time you know end of night kind of like hobby you know reading random random bullshit or whatever i used to just kind of like schedule out my day like that and try to keep it um and then i would have like in in a week i would have one day like i still have this i have one day where i do 90 minutes of random meetings meaning people that are just find interesting i just want to meet with no agenda and just kind of like cool people meeting cool people and so i i do schedule time full randomness but for the most part i've gone away from having a highly scheduled day to having an unscheduled day meaning i don't schedule it in advance on the day of i decide what i'm gonna do and i decide how i'm gonna spend today but i don't decide that like two weeks in advance and so when somebody says can we meet i have a simple rule it's like do i want to meet you right if you want to do a call you want to meet me do i want to meet you right now if so i'm gonna say would you like to do it right now if not i'll say i can't do right now but i'll give you a call in an hour or two hours from now and if i don't want to do it right now i say sorry i don't want to meet and i don't schedule it for like three weeks from now which is the what i used to do i used to say i don't want to do this okay yeah i'm free two weeks but then guess what two weeks shows up and then i'm like shit i gotta do this call i didn't want to do then i definitely don't want to do it now it's expired yeah it keeps me up the night before sometimes yeah so i'm i'm much more of an unscheduled person um but the day of i decide how i'm gonna use today's time yeah it uh his his calendar was amazing to me and i think that it's going to be quite popular when you post that maybe uh maybe um we'll have to divvy up who could post what because we could i both give it the gold yeah um all right let me ask you did you ever do this time tracking shit because i also went through like an aggressive time tracking phase and i wanted to share one learning from that um i wouldn't i was never aggressive about it no i i um i prefer open time and uh i prefer working from midnight until like 3 a.m when and that's when i do a lot of my golden stuff so like if i have to copyright what i if i have to do any type of copywriting i i'll hang out all day and read and have fun and sarah's like when are you gonna do work i'm like when you go to bed and so she'll go to bed and then from midnight to three sometimes midnight to four i can get i can do golden golden work around that around that hour i have a theory about this so furcon who was my technical co-founder of a previous company he's been on the pod he was the same way he would i would like he would roll into work at 11 11 30 he'd start his work day with lunch and like you would think this is the laziest guy ever but actually he was he's massively hard working he was just up till five in the morning on average yeah and so you know five in the morning then he sleeps you know six hours he wakes up at 11 and he comes into work and um and even when he was at work like we would take like an hour we just play video games we would just like and i was just like dude like why do you use your time this way and he goes he goes i don't know i just oh i just figured this out for myself early on which is that like the time i act like during the day it's just like i'm basically just trying to exhaust myself like i want to have conversations i kind of manage other people i kind of read shit i'll talk to people i'll eat lunch i'll go work out i'll do all this stuff he's like i'm basically just trying to get myself really like like i need to my brain to slow down and i want to get in this almost like half sleepy state which is not sleepy the way most people think about it most people think sleepy means you can't function but there is a point where you're like kind of tired you know you get kind of loopy yeah yeah and it's like that's when you can do creative work programming is creative work so he's like dude from like midnight to 4 a.m i write the best code and it's basically like only my hands are moving i don't want to get up nobody bothers me nobody talks to me i don't have to meet anybody i just and i just go into flow state and i just work during that time and that's kind of what you're describing is your midnight to 3 a.m i have that same thing and i've i figured out through furcon that there's this thing that happens where if you're trying to do creative work you need to be more relaxed and less kind of like distracted and also like a little loopy is good because it adds a little bit of like serendipity into your brain your brain's willing to play with different ideas and go in different directions maybe and so for copywriting you kind of want something like that also i believe 23andme has a like a line item on one of their attributes uh and it talks about are you a night owl or an early an early person and i so i think that a lot of this stuff of when you're going to get your creative work done i actually think it's genetic and whatever it is you should just go all in on it for example i mean the world's set up for early risers you know if you if you get up at 5 a.m and get stuff done like rob did or like you win you win like it's the world's set up so you actually if you're a night person like i am or you am you kind of got to go against the grain which sucks but uh here's a good example the founder of box the ceo of box what's his name ben levy erin sorry ben levy ben levy's my guy yeah erin levy erin levy uh close to a billionaire maybe hundreds of millions of a millionaire uh founder of a multi-billion dollar company i was friends with his assistant and she would tell me that he has no meetings until 11 a.m and that's typically when he starts at the office because he works until 5 a.m and by the way bezos is the opposite bezos is like um i want all my meetings from 8 a.m to noon all all important decisions i need to make by then because my brain is functioning the best and then after that i don't want to have any important meetings in the day i'll have other meetings but no just no key decisions no heavy topics with important like stuff to digest i want to do other work during that time and so and like you know rob dyrdek on his calendar here it's 4 30 a.m wake up wake up call pretty much every single day one one day he sleeps until 5 a.m uh you know so he's a little bit different cat i think it's you know what works for you and uh and then you want to play to that like i spent many years trying to be like ah i want to wake up at 5 a.m so i can be more productive and it's just like waking up three hours earlier was way harder for me than just staying up three hours later and so it's like why am i fighting what's easy for me what feels like play to me versus what feels like absolute grind to me and it's sort of unsustainable it's all willpower based and so you know i made that shift but i'll give you one thing that's that is worth doing so i tried to like track every hour to see how i'm using it because i kind of want to you know time is your most precious asset so i wanted to see how it gets spent that was a little bit exhausting hopefully someday there's going to be tools that just make this easy so it's like it just happens passively but one thing that is amazing is a calendar audit i don't know if you've ever done one of these it's a calendar audit or some people call it an energy audit it basically means you take for one week you sort of keep track of like roughly how you used each hour and um and then what you do is the next week you just go back you just pull up last week's calendar and you take three colored markers you take a green marker a red marker and a yellow marker and you go back through your week how you spent your time and you say what which block which thing i did gave me energy i marked those green which felt like it sucked all the energy out of me i was drained afterwards and i felt like my soul lived and sucked out of me i let me mark those red and then the neutral things let me mark yellow and you look at the painting you know you look at your color and you're like wow that's a lot of red or hey that's actually pretty good that's a lot of green and then you just audit and so you're all you're doing is just trimming the fat and you just say all right cool this week i'm going to do less of the red stuff i'm going to do less by just literally avoiding it by automating it or delegating it and you just make a decision you just improve it by one week and you just do that every so often and if you do that it's an amazing way to manage not your calendar as in like maximizing efficiency but maximizing your energy so that you feel good and you are um when you feel your best you're going to you know perform your best and work i think i think the best version of you bezos said the stuff that you should eliminate is you you you can answer that by uh asking will this uh work just fine if i don't make this decision or if i if i don't if i don't attend this or do this will will life be okay if yes then uh eliminate it right um do you want to talk about some ideas yeah let's do some other stuff which uh where do you want to go well i've got a lot and you've got a lot yeah we both got a lot so we have we have a couple episodes worth of stuff here give me one off yours that you're really into okay um have you heard of brewmate no and i'm not a coffee drinker is it a coffee drinking thing it doesn't have to be so okay so brewmate it's spelled b-r-u-m-a-t-e their first thing was like a koozie basically their first product was a was a koozie something that interested me about this and now they make tumblers so basically what's a tumbler like just a coffee drink thermos like a thermos thing they make a koozie they make a water bottle they just make cups for cold stuff and hot stuff and uh the reason why this interested me is trends my company trends trends.co we did a story on brewmate and they interviewed the founder and they did a good job and i think julia wrote it and they got a picture of the revenue so check this out jacob who's the founder jacob grew brewmate to 20 million in revenue without a single employee and so this company launched in 2016 their revenue was basically uh uh 2016 nothing 2017 it looks uh single digit hundreds of thousands maybe close to a million 2018 uh getting close to 20 million in revenue 2019 over 25 million in revenue 2020 100 million in revenue and he did most everything with agencies and contractors and not a single full-time employee until after 20 million in revenue and it got me thinking one that's amazing that's like the greatest thing ever if you ask me i think that's like the the ideal business and number two these water bottle and cup businesses this is something that like if you told me you're gonna start that i'm gonna be like dude that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard of what are you doing i there are so many example examples of some of these things that are huge for example there's a business called swell you know swell water bottles no i by the way i'm i since college i've been the type of person that just never uses water bottles me neither i'm like but i buy them i go to water fountains and i just like put my mouth on the fucking thing and i drink from a water fountain that's what i do and everybody else has these like amazing elaborate water bottles always eco-friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles i've just never done it yeah dude i'm fine i'm they called me hose water was my middle name in high school i'm i'm like i don't i wish i had made that up as a dig on you calling you hose water but that's so perfect i thought i was going low bar like my low class thing was a water fountain and you like showed me yeah like if there was like a new coke product that was hose water flavor like from missouri i'd be drinking that shit because that's what i grew up on so i'm not like by the way by the way can we share this we uh so the interview we did with brian halligan the ceo of hubspot they're playing it at inbound which is the huge marketing conference i think that's the ad for these podcasts or something is inbound go to inbound great so uh they're playing the the the recording there as an interview and so for weeks uh for weeks our guy has been our producer the pod the old producer of the pod was badgering us like hey guys they need this intake form and like you know i'm just like allergic to words like that so you know what's that jeff bezos thing can what happens if i don't do this that was my my take and it was yours too um it was like hey guys i need you to fill this out i need you to sign this waiver saying you're okay with the content being on there i'm like dude i'm okay with it like obviously it's a public free podcast you can just use it wherever you want um and they're like no no you gotta sign this thing i'm like oh my god i gotta download a pdf and figure out how to sign this so weeks go by me and sam both do nothing at one point he goes hey sam uh that intake form you know they're really asking me for it sam goes oh you could tell and he's just joking but we we basically we didn't do it right and so another week goes by he goes all right guys i really need this intake form so we're like fine all right we signed the thing and he's like oh i also need a bio for you um and it's like what's your what's your job title what's your bio it's like i don't know dude i host a podcast and i like build random businesses that like it's not i don't have like a job title and i don't have like a bio for you and so i just wrote future owner of the la lakers and then uh future owner of a lake it's true man it's true i think that's the difference between us i embodied the difference between us so perfectly uh it was amazing all right that back to that you can cut you can cut that part out if you're gonna get fired for that thing no you could keep that uh keep it we don't delete anything so this is stupid it's not stupid yeah and so there's this thing called swell look up swell look up swell it's a water bottle i'm not a water bottle guy either it looks like the dumbest thing ever i mean it's not dumb it just looks like the most normal thing ever then there's corksicle which is basically a cork water bottle over 80 million in revenue and then there's one called bkr i actually don't know how to say that beaker but but i don't know they didn't they sell water bottle for 185 dollars it's glass and this was actually cool because i hate metal water bottles and i hate plastic it's glass but it has like plastic or like rubber around it so you don't shatter it anyway um who would have thought who would have thought yeah crazy uh and did he say how he scaled because this is one of the most aggressive scaling business i've ever heard of so to go from basically sub 1 million to 18 million in one year and then to go from like i don't know it looks like maybe 30 million to 100 million you know these are huge jumps um facebook ads and so basically he said that so he didn't spend a dime so or sorry he didn't build anything so he created a landing page and then he drove facebook ads to it uh and he got a pre-launch email list of 6 000 people and then he sent those folks an email to buy it and they bought it and he used that money to go and build the product it's classic wow yeah classic way so kind of interesting um and so that's not an idea but i just wanted to bring that up no that's cool i like that one um yeah do we have anything to rip off that or just like you know props to this guy no props to that guy but uh that's it and it looks like he used a bunch of like um like working capital is always very hard for e-commerce businesses and so it looks like you know he couldn't get a line of credit early so he did pre-sales and then okay he did pre-sales then he threw the pre-sales now he got an expensive line of credit so um you know he got he got an sba loan he got shopify capital paypal working capital amazon lending he would use one to pay the next and that just like let him roll over one from one line of credit to the next dude in a way after doing an audit he got a two million dollar line of credit and now raised 20 million dollars in a way i think that these people are so audacious and here's why if you told me if this guy i don't know what his name is uh if you told me that you're gonna launch a water bottle i'm like jacob you're an idiot this is the stupidest thing ever and you know who else i would have said that to movement watches so this guy also named jacob jay kasan spoke at hustle con this was like pre-d2c even being a word okay so jacob kasan he launched his company called movement or kasan sorry launched this company called movement they were shitty watches from china uh they ordered a bunch and they start selling them on movement.com or whatever then they kind of make them a little bit better but they're still like not the most high quality watches and his company he sold that thing for 200 million dollars and again if you would have showed me this watch i'd be like you are crazy no one's gonna buy this this is just ridiculous and i've talked to him and he's like well why not like people buy watches why won't they buy mine i think that confidence is awesome and i love it i don't know if i have it but i love it yeah it takes it definitely takes guts and i think you know one thing i've learned is that these spaces uh so there's like there's there's the niche spaces which we love and then there's also the everybody everyday problems and that's what like keeping beverages hot and cold is and i think you want to go on one end of the spectrum or the other you need to go hyper niche where it's like yeah i'm you know for a specific type of toe fungus this is the uh this is the best cream and i'm just going to target that and on the other side you go everybody everyday problems and i'm just going to try to sell this thing because my ads will apply to everybody and so there's basically like um you know like i've been looking at a different water brands so what's the one in austin so there's like la croix or whatever is like kind of like a larger topo chico baby just gonna like it well topo chico has been around for a while what's the one that's like the startup that lance armstrong invested in that's yeah guys in austin uh let me look it up i know what you're talking about water or something like waterloo waterloo is that it yeah that's it i think it's waterloo okay so there's waterloo they got huge they're like oh yeah we're at 50 million in sales there's a brand called ugly water founder sent me a case of that thank you for that uh ugly water again cool sparkling water crushing it doing millions and millions of dollars in sales and i'm like dude how many more of these can there liquid death we had liquid death on probably 100 million in sales yeah exactly so you know you know just bottled water again like you know canned water sparkling water uh like my trainer was talking to me yesterday and he's like bro let's start a coconut water brand i was like yeah we should because you know what like uh coconut water is a massive market and like you could just go in and do more he's from hawaii so he's like bro like i grew up on this stuff we can we can brand it right we can get it out there and i was like okay cool let me find an operator so if somebody wants to start a coconut water brand with me just email me sean at seanperu.com because i want to start one and by start what i mean i want you to do most of the work and i'll do uh virtually nothing um so so let's let's do that split can you can you talk about this guy uh con the nfl owner yes oh by the way can i do two quick updates yeah one um uh there's a guy you know you talked about like just buying a giant ranch buying giant farmland or whatever there's a guy who hit me up he's very credible who's like i'll do this for you guys like i will go find it i'll i'll find the right thing i'll acquire i'll get the permits i'll build it out um and like you know let's just partner on it and so uh i love this podcast because it basically matches dude well you get all like ideas why is it the ugly water guy why is it ugly water guy sending me water why is it ranch guy sitting i asked for it that's what i was into yeah you're into it i think my email is easier to find i don't know and people people just guess my email easier like i often dude my email is the same as yours sam at sam par.com it's literally the exact same thing let me tell you this let me tell you this so a youtuber reached out so shout out to rebecca who's a youtuber who reached out she's got 10 million youtube subscribers amazing she's a big star channel's awesome and um she's a fan of the pod and she had emailed reached out and said hey i listened to the pod or her i think her husband reached out or her brother or business manager somebody reached out said hey it's her birthday tomorrow she'd love to like meet you guys as like a birthday present no she didn't say you guys okay she said whatever she said but she put both of our email they had both of our emails on there but for you what they had like holler at the hustle.com which i don't know if that's a real email or not i went back and looked and it's holler maybe it's even spelled wrong i don't know is holler your email address no that's not my email address maybe that's why i didn't get it fuck i don't know i don't even know what that is i i can tell by the the word holler at the hustle i guarantee you made that up one day yeah years ago that that was supposed to be our our help email yeah exactly i guarantee that like just holler at me like we'll fix it just holler at me exactly all right anyways um what was i gonna tell you the other one the other update is um this guy sent me a screenshot he's like ten thousand dollars he goes thank you for that idea i don't know if you remember we had done an idea either here or on twitter about uh moving bins this is very simple idea which is like when you move you need these like packing bins just like these plastic heavy duty bins so you don't have to do boxes so you pack all your stuff you move to your other place you unpack you unpack it you just return the bins you just rent these bins for the day while you move and i had like done done the numbers i was like this thing is kind of great it's like okay maybe you can't buy a property and rent it out but you can buy 50 of these bins and rent them out and you can make good money and so he emailed he's like hey it's been a long sweat like i'm not saying it was easy but you know i'm at ten thousand dollars made from these bins and uh you know thanks for the idea i just really appreciate that that's you know uh it's kind of been a great side income for me in my city and i'm like oh this is cool like that's that's the best feeling of this whole podcast is basically if we throw the ideas out there and then people actually run with them and make something happen out of it so let me tell you something about that first of all that's amazing so have you ever been to the grocery store and seen one of those carpet cleaners carpet cleaners like uh what do you mean like a vacuum or something else yeah so it looks like a vacuum but it's it's meant for um it looks like a vacuum no it's like you push it you've never seen one of these so like people like the heavy duty carpet cleaning like like more like a deep clean yes and people rent those for like 200 a day you know i'm talking about uh yeah i know like it's kind of like the equivalent of power washing or something like that before your carpet yes okay so i was thinking i was like looking at this and they a lot of them have a meter on there and they and that's like the hours uh the hours that uh it can go for it have been logged so like they it's like a dirt bike or like a boat where it's like instead of saying how many miles does it have on it's how many hours and so a lot of these things a lot of these carpet cleaners they can last for something like um five years so let's i i i don't know if this is a make up a number yeah long time yeah so i don't know if this is exactly how it would work but let's say 365 or there's 52 weeks in a year 52 times uh 40 let's see i'm just doing it really quick 260 okay public math are you no i'm doing it on my computer okay so we don't do public math so a lot of these things will last like 10 to 15 000 hours and they rent out for like 200 a day which comes out to be like you know 20 an hour i think buying and renting carpet cleaners is one of the greatest like banks for your money when i went i went to the grocery store and i just looked i was like how much does this cost and i looked at how much they cost to buy they cost like 800 to buy so this thing at the grocery store that i keep seeing all i would see it all the time and then i i once i saw those i would say to the people i'm like how often do those rent for uh do people rent them a lot and they're like yeah all the time they're always being rented out it's like one of the greatest things i've ever seen when i was like doing the math i'm like this is brilliant the carpet goes back to our teenage side hustle like if you're a teenager you have a teenager just get one of these and then teach your teenager how to make like kind of like one page sales letters and yelp ads and basically just drop the sales letters in uh you know under everyone's door uh every month so you're gonna print out 100 of these put them in your neighborhood and just say hey hey y'all i live over here at 37 terrace wood way and i bought this cleaner it's amazing here's the before and after of my carpet but you know i'm not going to use this you know i only needed to use it once and it made such a big difference but i still got the thing if you want it i'll rent it out to you for 40 bucks just text me here i'll bring it to your house if you want your carpet clean and if you want me to do it for you i'll do it for 150 and uh and you know just do that and like that's such a good teenage side hustle because you know you'll learn sales you'll learn marketing you'll learn a little bit of like unit economics it's just a little way to get kind of make your first dollar i think making your first dollar is massively underrated like i didn't make my first dollar my first hustle dollar where like not like a job where i was you know sitting at a cash register all day but like me creating a product and selling it to somebody i didn't do that till i was like 19 i'm sure you did it earlier because i think you were flipping stuff on ebay or something i think you were more of a hustler early on than me well yeah but ebay ebay doesn't feel like the first dollar though uh maybe it does it's kind of like you had the scheme it's not a job basically like you're kind of like first dollar out of business yeah and in high school but by the way 19 is very young dude uh actually maybe it was maybe it was later i thought you were gonna say like 30 it was 21 or 22 right when right after i graduated and um so it's probably 22 actually and so like you know i wish that that 22 was 12 i think that it's like learning languages or you know like working out like the earlier you learn these core skills the better and so uh you know if you if you're sitting there and you even if you're 29 right now 39 whatever it is and you're at a job you've just never done this i really encourage you to go make your first dollar as a side hustle as a business uh make a product or find a product and sell it and um you know it's it's surprising how it'll kind of like change the way you look at things yeah i agree that's what i told sarah when she was doing her course i'm like if you just get make one dollar and it's gonna change your life um can you tell me about this con guy i love this guy okay yeah all right this is the billy of the week and by the way uh by the way we should have ben pop on ben ben come on here real quick we got a new producer and one of the things i'm gonna ask him to do is for our little segments make sure we do our segments like billy of the week people love that segment we should do it and two uh we gotta have like a little sound a little jingle a little something whenever we go to this segment i think and ben ben's the host of the how to take for the world podcast if you're not subscribed to that do it he did this those edison episodes that we released about thomas edison he has almost uh of our show now he has almost 100 000 listens a month all right ben okay big dog i'm surprised you're even still here with that big number uh not not for long sean if you keep pumping me up like this then you're not your head's not even gonna fit in the zoom window um we'll try out a sound we'll play something on this episode a little like billy of the week jingle and see how people feel about it all right sounds good and you got to replace a breyu at the end when we used to ask about you how we did and he gave us the straight talk of what was good a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars anyway back to the billy of the week so this guy his name is shaheed khan he's from pakistan and he his story is kind of insane so here's the guy who moved to america at age 16 first job is a dishwasher for i think a dollar 60 an hour and um you know so he starts making a dollar 60 an hour and today he's worth nine billion dollars personally and uh how the heck did he do that so do you know this guy's story um a little bit i know him because he's incredibly recognizable he's like he's kind of beautiful like if he he looks he looks like a badass a little bit he looks like a badass like a peacock well he looks like someone who's i both respect and fear because they seem formidable and also they look like they like to party yeah he's got a fucking sick mustache basically that's his like iconic thing he's got one of the mustaches that's like almost a twirled at the end it's amazing so he looks really special is the way i would describe him in a good way um okay so what is his story so he he starts off dishwasher he's like sleeping at the ymca um and like you know now that he's super rich he like donates millions of dollars to the ymca because he's like dude i used to sleep in here i used to hide in the ymca and sleep because it was so cold outside and i didn't i couldn't afford like you know where i was supposed to live and so he um so he got rich by he made his millions by or billions really by building custom bumpers for cars so car bumpers truck bumpers car bumpers that sort of thing so here's like how it all worked so he he graduates as an engineering student and he gets a job at this company that does manufacturing for uh for bumper for car bumpers and he kind of like works his way up first few years i think he's there for maybe five seven years something like that he's eventually he's like kind of like leading the engineering operations and he's sort of like man this is so inefficient the way we do this we get all these different parts and we try to like jam them together to make this car bumper it's real heavy it's really clunky it's kind of ugly and um and i think the company was called flexingate or later it was called flexingate but uh he's he's working at this company and then he along the way he's sort of like he's trying to convince the company like hey we should change the design but they're not really listening to him so he's like all right screw it i'm gonna spin out my own company and i'm gonna design my own bumpers and so he quits he takes uh i think he has sixteen thousand dollars in personal savings he takes like a fifty thousand dollar sba loan and he goes and he creates his own uh bumper company right and so he he starts uh trying to go get clients they're trying to go get customers and he's getting you know some small customers and along the way as he's making progress he gets sued by his previous employer they're like hey you stole trade secrets and uh your compet your competition now so like screw you we're gonna we're gonna sue you and he's like shit like um they're way bigger than me i can't afford you know i can't afford a lawyer basically so i'm like how am i gonna fight this in court and i know their strategy their strategy is gonna be like they just um they just bleed me out right like they're bigger than me this is gonna cost both of us money but they're they have deeper pockets so he comes up with a strategy where he hires the cheapest lawyer he could find just to sort of like stall the case and then like so it's costing him almost nothing to continue it's costing them a lot of money they're losing a lot of money on this lawsuit and then he starts studying every night like after the business operations are done he goes to the library and he starts studying law so that he can defend himself in court um because he hires this kind of like soul goodman you know type of character and just you know wants to defend himself so he starts educating himself and um so he ends up winning the case and along the way that company flexing gate was losing like fifty thousand dollars a month and so they were their business wasn't very healthy so by the end he wins the case and he just ends up it takes the money and he has the money from his business and he buys out flexing gate so he buys out the company that was suing him as like a kind of like a fuck you plus a consolidation of like how much did he pay for it do you know i don't know the exact number that he ended up uh buying them for but you know sort of like baller move uh going back there and he had designed this bumper that was like a slick kind of like one continuous piece so it wasn't a bunch of pieces put together and it was way more lightweight and so all of a sudden the car companies were like oh this is great we want to have a lighter weight thing it's better for fuel efficiency it's easier for manufacturing it's cheaper fantastic so they start going to him and so he starts getting like these contracts and there's like all these little sub stories in here that like i don't want to dive too far into but like he wants to get the like suzuki contract and so he like hires a bunch of people who know to speak japanese he starts learning all about the culture he like goes there because he's like i have to go further than anyone else is going to go to win this deal because i'm a no-name brand but i have a great product and if i can make these guys trust me and believe in me this will work so he lands suzuki shortly after that he gets the big toyota contract now like as of today i think he's basically making like every automaker's bumpers like i think you know there's like 20 million plus cars that are have his bumper something some ridiculous number like 30 of all cars use his bumpers and so you know the company um does billions and billions of dollars his personal net worth has ballooned to where he um he owns nine billion dollars or he's worth nine billion dollars i believe as his personal net worth and then he's done a bunch of other things so he bought the jacksonville jaguars so he wanted to own an nfl team and he tries to buy the denver broncos but at the last minute the guy who was the minority owner had a right of first refusal and like exercised it and bought the broncos out from under him staying cranky and so he's like ah shit but he became friends with the guys the people who own the jaguars he buys the jaguars and he starts doing some pretty interesting things so the jaguars are kind of like one of the bottom of the barrel teams and they're still not great right they're not great they've never they've had like very small windows of time where the team was good but it's never like a high profile franchise really it's like one of the small markets and so he's like okay how do i play the game to like how do i use this to my advantage so he's like all right ticket sales are low and he starts to dig into why it's like ah it's just so expensive to come to a game the average fan is priced out so he does something like pretty radical like he um he uh he made it where any fan can bring their own food to the games which is like the opposite of what every other stadium tries to do where they're like ah you know low ticket but then we'll charge you like 30 for a hot dog yeah he was like bring your own food and what ends up happening is ticket sales go up and i think food revenue went up when they got to the stadium like you know some counterintuitive result like that and um you know he started doing a bunch of other things like he uh he put a fantasy football tracker in the stadium on the scoreboard he's like oh fans you know they're not just here to watch the game they're here for entertainment and part of their entertainment is their fantasy team so he like would show your points while you're while you're there and people got a kick out of that and he like pimped out the locker room for the players he's like i want to have like the best locker room very similar things to what mark cuban did with the with the uh dallas maps by the way so similar sort of playbook he now owns awe which is like a head-to-head competitor with wwe like vince mcmahon's thing so it's like a wrestling wrestling thing he's got this crazy yacht called kismet which is like uh i don't know it's like a i don't know how much this yacht costs but to rent it costs 1.2 million per week and that excludes food fuel and dockage costs and so like you know beyonce and jay-z rented this thing out for their italy vacation uh i think it's like a 200 million dollar yacht that he rents out for a million dollars a week dude that's nuts what do you uh what's your biggest takeaway from him um i just love this sort of like i mean this rags to rich a story is kind of like amazing and i think it's uh it's inspiring and so i think there's a lot of people who who could do this you're in a company you see things done inefficiently and if you had the guts you would basically be able to spin out and like you know your own competitor inside and out because you were there as a leader and so you know where their weaknesses are you know what the customer needs are and you know if you start to chip away like you can make a lot more than you would ever make climbing the corporate ladder there and then i love some of the like atypical bets that he was making or moves that he's making like going into wrestling i think is super interesting most people don't think about that or there's no way that will work by the way there's no way well i think it's already made made quite a bit because he bought he bought this i think he bought the thing for dirt cheap and there's just like there's always a perpetual number two to wwe so he doesn't need to become wwe right like yes there is a long shot bull case where you know he ends up overtaking it but there's always been a number two like wcw back in the day or like you know the local uh local shows and whatnot and so i think that there's a lot of money in even being the like a really strong credible number two and i think wwe ends up buying all their competition and so he might end up flipping it to them someday um but it takes like some deep pockets so it might fail like you know that's okay though i think but i like these types of bets it's inspiring to me like a guy like this yeah i think it's really cool i'm reading there's an awesome article about him in the new york times it's an old one it's about from 2011 and basically it says jaguar's buyer has eyes on had his eyes on owner ownership franchise and the dream has come true and he talks about like how it's been his dream to do that and the whole like immigrant uh you know like this was like the the to me this is an american thing is to own a team and i think that's really great so anyway i think it's cool i love it's a lot of racism stuff too by the way i was reading about that like in jacksonville there's a bunch of ticket holders who canceled it because they an american didn't own the team now and he's like dude like we are americans but uh you know so i think he's even even even still you know still fighting certain battles yeah i did of course um and i dig this this is a good one i feel like every billy of the week that we've ever done is like basically an immigrant there's definitely a recurring theme here we got to do an american billy a born and bred american billy of the week no i like the immigrant stories i prefer those um let me tell you about a cool app that i found um well it's a web app so a website it's called fuck you pay me and so the you are the url is f y p m dot vip it's kind of confusing but i just sent it to you and it's in the doc actually as well and i just sent it on riverside and so fuck you pay me so basically what it is it's the it's kind of glass door slash yelp for influencers and so if you are an influencer you can log on and you can see which brands are easy to work with and how much they pay and people want to work with them again and i think this is interesting for a couple reasons the biggest one is well like this is cool but the second reason why i like this is because these types of businesses i actually think are incredibly easy to set up and if you could start getting reviews and if you could start getting people to use it very valuable so basically this website if i don't know what it's built with but i bet you that there's some just like it's probably a wordpress uh like a login or something like that like very very very simple stuff you could you could build this in like two or three days and there's another good example of this and that that's called um uh vcguide.co so we're talking about influencers and venture capitalists because that's in our world but have you ever been a vcguide.co yeah i've been to it yeah okay so it's it's a the most basic looking website you've ever seen and it's just a list of names and people vote on and or leave reviews on different venture capitalists but i anyway i think that this is a really really cool business and i love this idea there's another one that i was looking at called niche niche.com which is not small but they like it's the same type of thing but just they do it for schools and so i think that there's a lot of really cool businesses that could be built with this model another one that i think could exist and similar to influencers is like basically all the publishers out there like bustle um who else i don't i mean whatever just all they pay freelancers by the article or by the word and i think that you could if you wanted to you could do a price per article for publishers you could do how much anyone pays for anything basically in terms of freelance work and so anyway i think this is a cool business it's called fuck you pay me i think it's awesome yeah i think this is cool as like a i think it was started by a couple influencers right yeah but i don't i don't remember their name yeah so i think it's a good um like solving scratching their own itch right like at some point they get tired of working with clients that don't pay up on time or or try to renege on the deal and they say look if we band together we could do this and they already have a network of other friends who do this they have trust they know the problem so i think that's a great uh niche business niche uh business to start and if you're in a world like in an industry i think these are actually easier to build like for example if you are in the automotive world automotive manufacturing and you have 50 friends who work in that business you could pretty like easily kind of get this going and it becomes addicting i i remember i'm not on vc guy thank god i'm not a vc but i do invest but like let's see are you on it sean like you start checking your name all the time yeah exactly you want to know what are people saying about me yeah you check it all the time and so anyway i think like they're i think these are really interesting and uh this is kind of a cool one i have a super quick idea i'll just do that's related to this i saw this company i should give them a shout out i think it's called pump um and what they're doing is actually pretty cool it's um you know like investor so you wrote great investor updates i used to be on your i wasn't an investor in the hustle but you used to send me the updates uh i don't know why just it was cool like i could see it um and you wrote really great investor updates like it was clear it was like just the right mix of like the info you need not too much and not too little and you had like a clear ask if you needed something dude i see a lot i see a lot of companies using that same template i don't know if i stole that if i took that from someone or like you like kevin lee from uh the ramen company his updates look exactly the same i don't know what it is but that that style i feel like is everywhere now yeah i don't know where you got it from but it's great i wish more of the founders i invest in would do it because mine don't do that that's how i left it they're either like ultra detailed it's like we hired this engineer and this person and they used to work here it's like all right i really just okay i'm glad you did that but like what does that matter to me like it's too in the weeds for where i'm at to help your business and then they'll leave out like here's how many customers we have and here's how much money's in the bank here's much here's what we need here's where our goals are like they'll leave that out but they'll go into like ultra detail about other stuff so um anyways i think in general investor updates take a lot of time they're really healthy practice but they're sort of like writing books right now it's like you do this thing once a month or every couple months um and you write it take some time to read take some time to to to write and i saw this company pump that was basically just saying take your cap table and it lets you do like twitter sized updates about your company so you can just like post a photo of something cool that's going on or a chart what's the url i don't know the url i think the brand i think the app or the company's called pump i think it's my name would be public i might have to bleep it out um but i was looking at it as a potential investment uh because i really like this idea i think that um updates that are more frequent will actually be more transparent will actually be more useful it'll be more easy to read be easier to write it'll get more interaction between the investors and the founder because i can just hit the like button or i can just write a quick reply like looks awesome or have you talked to this person they're doing something cool check out this and um i think this is actually a way better way to do investor updates it's basically like a private twitter feed for just you and your investors and that expectation of a bite-sized bit of content is great and it's on the uh play play store i don't even know what what the fuck is the play store is that like uh that's google you know no i don't know anything about that uh i'm looking at it now you use the craziest thing i've ever heard dude yeah i've never been on the play store in my life i didn't even know what that was this like blue collar everyday sam and it's like what is android i i i i'm sorry i i don't know one person that uses android do you of course like developers use it i don't i'm out of the android is great it has a great camera the pixels got an amazing camera it's amazing dude i don't know one person like closely i just saw everyone just an iphone except if you have android and you're in my group chat you're out of my group chat bro like you're killing the group chat with your inability to like send pictures and and all that it's horrible well i'm looking at pump it's also in the app store i actually think this is cool there was this other company that people were were were saying was going to be really cool i forget the name of it you might remember it though and it was like how to collaborate with your investors better what was that called started with a c cup cabal i think that's the one i saw cabal it seemed okay this seems way way interesting i think this is better that cabal has a bunch of like cool people using it and invested in it so it might have like the important people doing that but uh how did you find this i like this product better uh how did you find this out found this dude i have a lot of help but zach found this one uh for uh for oz found the billy of the week and sent it to me because he had been on the guy's yacht and sent me a picture of it and was like you got to feature this guy uh it's a lot of my ideas don't come from me wow no that's amazing um i would i would invest in that company yeah i think that's really cool um if you're the founder hit us up we want to we want to invest in that all right you want to do one more thing or you want to save it we should save it this episode is going to be a little crazy we'll see if it's interesting okay oh um you want to talk about my influencer update yeah you're like let's save it but i want to talk about this well because this that's actually not important so we could hide it at the end this is actually what i was going to start with because i found this hilarious uh and awesome and i wanted to know what you're actually doing because like you said it as a joke so sam text the other day he goes i think i think you were joking but you're like half serious no i was not maybe you were not serious or not joking i think i was serious yes you're more serious than joking so sam text i'm thinking about stopping trying to be a business influencer and just go to be a fitness influencer i don't know if my face is good enough though and so then i'm like okay just some kind of random funny text didn't think much of it and then you sent me this link to this reddit post where you're like my fitness journey you're like here i'm at you know 12 body fat and here's my photos and here's what i'm doing i'm like oh shit he's actually trying to do it so what is this what are you doing so did you see my instagram thing the video yeah i saw your video yeah so here's why i think it's cool um i love exercise i love to work out and i'm a little bored of just business content and i look up so you want to know what i we're going to talk about this next episode but here's what i do late at night late at night i go to instagram and i love watching videos of ripped guys stretch do you ever watch like no no i never do that i go on i go on it never done something like dude there's these guys this is like getting really popular right now there's these dudes who they do calisthenics and they're like sitting on like these bars and they like move their legs above their head or they uh they like do the splits or and they're not like jacked like dudes but they're like skinny ish very flexible and i'm like this is the way to live life 100% to be skinny and flexible and there's just i just in my head i'm like they're just stretching all day and filming it that seems awesome i can do that and so that's kind of like how i want to live my life right now is i like watch these guys do like the you know what your thoracic thoracic spine is yes so like it's upper back so because like we sit hunched over like everyone's got like a hunchback kind of and so the thoracic it's like i think it's really good to stretch and so i just watch videos of guys stretch your thoracic spine i love nick bear nick bear was this huge beast of a guy who came on our podcast and he has this like pretty cool business and he just like runs marathon and lifts weights all day and i see this and i'm like that sounds awesome i totally want to do that also additionally i'm a little i got a little once like we sold the company i got a little depressed because i was like i live such a soft pussy life like i don't have any real threats in my life i never have to fight i never have to get like i never got to go hunt for my food i never am like afraid of getting eaten by a lion like i need some action and adventure yeah i'm too comfortable and so i was like this fitness thing seems cool like let's just learn how to box or let's just do something like interesting and just document it and i and i've loved it and so i am not joking i think i might do this but when you say might do this what does that actually mean you're going to try to literally become a fitness influencer meaning like you want to be sam uh you know sammy hamstrings who's got like amazingly amazing hamstring stretches or like what what do you actually want what is the goal i think i could build a large following i don't i i besides like checking like other people's pictures i don't post on instagram at all and for some reason i have like 5 000 followers so i think that's a good base i think i could build up this like reputation as this like fitness slash business type of guy okay fitness slash business but you're talking specifically about stretching or no any any fitness is fine uh i'm gonna focus on boxing and weight lifting right now because that's what i love but i think stretching is like the way to go yes i like there's so many people who google uh different stretching stuff dude i'm telling you this this whole mobility movement it's huge and how committed are you to this i mean i work out constantly like so like to the influencer part i know you're committed to doing the fitness stuff i haven't decided how uh committed i am because well what was the reaction to your reddit and instagram thing because that probably just gave you a bunch of jet fuel of motivation to keep going well the it was good i mean the reddit the thing that reddit was interesting i just posted on a subreddit called guess my body fat and like people but then i wasn't caring about that when i told you what i was caring about is that someone said your body fat is probably this i don't know about sean purry's and i was like oh my god that's crazy someone like recognizes us and so but the instagram thing that i posted it got popular but the thing is is that i actually think that like getting famous on social media is really cool and also it will make you very unhappy and so that's my biggest thing the biggest thing i'm nervous about is like do i actually want to spend time on this and go down this like hedonistic uh like uh you know dedicating my life to something that maybe isn't actually that cool or important but it does seem kind of neat so anyway that's my rant i'm becoming a fitness influencer i think i could do it i think i'd like have girl next door like a girl next door body you know what i mean like not like that's so true it's like not intimidating you're not on it you're not unachievable but you're also impressive so it's like yeah i'm into it but i feel like with enough work i too could be there yeah i got like he's just a regular guy i got girl next door uh abs like you know like you can do it too and you have been doing it by the way you look great well i'm trying but i'm i'm far behind where you're at and so yeah but i had a head start it would have been fun if uh like when i saw you post that thing i was like oh damn okay so i'm gonna do this for one year now uh so i have to do this for a while okay let me see you know it sort of put into perspective like actually the girl the guy next door thing you said is so true because that's actually the feeling i had which was i was like you know when i look at random people on instagram that are really ripped it doesn't do anything for me because i'm like well i'm not trying to do that i'm not trying to be a gorilla like i'm not trying to like have 19 you know 19 abs but like four four nice abs that seems like both achievable and desirable to me so i actually think you're on to something with this guy next door vibe that's what i'm saying it's like everything our podcast people say oh you guys make everything seem so easy and achievable and i'm like and what do we say we're like it kind of is you got to put in the work but like it's not that hard intellectually because we're not that smart nor are we that successful nor are we that nor do we do that much research so there's there's a uh a relatability to us we're not smarter than you we're not that much more successful than you and we definitely don't do a ton of research on each individual topic so we're not that much more of an expert than you on any so this is my this is my thing i might just translate that to like getting shredded and being fit and like living a long healthy life that's why it's interesting to me also the same way that whenever you post stuff uh like people send you free shit like that drink company or like you know you have you have a lot of like people who email you with amazing opportunities um it would be cool to get that for workout related stuff so that's one of the reasons why i want to do it did i show you this have i shown you this it's an axe i'm holding up an axe for those who are just listening not on the youtube channel and it's called chop fit so this guy sent me this dude what the fuck i don't get shit i don't get anything bro there's a method to the madness uh i think we asked for it or we told him like i saw this thing and we messaged him be like hey this is awesome he's like oh i'd love to send you one uh it's really but what i do i basically just have a bunch of dms that are for products i think are cool and i just say yo chop fit looks dope congrats you know like something like that and they're like oh thank you that's amazing and i'm like yeah i would love to try it or yeah i'm excited to try it oh my god i just let them fill it in with like yeah here you go anyway so he sent me this i'm looking at the website this is a weighted axe so it's basically peloton the reason i'm showing you this dude isn't this just a sledgehammer it's yeah but it's like more there's two of these so you get two of these so you have two of these to work out with one in each hand and it's sort of like a peloton but like okay like i like the idea of peloton i like the idea of guided classes but i'm not into biking like i don't love biking i don't love running on a treadmill so like i have the aqua bag boxing bag in my garage because i love hitting the aqua bag it's like super fun to me i love aqua bags too so that's really cool and then this is the new toy i'm starting to play with which is like i like swinging this thing around there's something that feels fun about this it feels like i'm about to like kill somebody and uh you can get a pretty sick core workout with this thing and like kind of it also works the uh forearms really well too because you're holding an axe which is like dude ever seen like a lumberjack those guys arms are their forearms are insane do me a favor tonight or tomorrow whenever you're going to go work out again just do it shirtless do it outside in the sun and take a video of you doing this and post it on twitter and i promise you it'll get at least 25 000 views people are going to like comment to you and it's going to a comment about you and it's going to feel awesome you're going to become a fitness influencer too i work out with no shirt every day in the sun every day it feels amazing right you is record the whole thing i take snippets because i'm i'm you're going from fit to really fit i'm going from fat to fit and so there's a big difference you got to strategize you got to be strategic right like you don't want to just post a before it's got to be like slightly impressive yeah yeah yeah you got like a montage that goes from shitty to like oh that's really good no in your case it's like okay so i'm storing up my ammo for the epic montage you're like right now you're like there's like before and way before yeah exactly and so i i'm i'm i'm a good before photo now but i had a way before that i've been i had been working towards i'm not after yet so i'm i'm waiting for the after maybe that's a bad move maybe i should be posting everything but i think it has a bigger impact if i do the before and after because it should be impressive when you do it okay well this is the episode where we've just decided we're both going to become fitness influencers i think you should post a picture of that i think i don't want to be a fitness influencer but i do want uh to like do it myself i've never done this i've never been somebody who's like ripped um and so i want to do it just to have done it if you start posting the reason why one of the reasons another reason why i'm doing it is i said out there i'm gonna so right now i weigh 203 pounds i and i'm probably i'm 12 maybe 14 body fat which is okay that's pretty good um i said i put it on there i want to weigh 185 in three months and a lot of people saw that and now if they see me out there eating like an idiot they're gonna like confront me and i think that that accountability is actually really good no like like like my in-laws saw you know saw me and they're like oh we you know we're not gonna eat we're not gonna we can't go to this place for dinner anymore uh right you know what i mean like that type of thing yeah that's funny all right uh ben how did we do um this one was weird it was weird but i think people are really gonna like it i think people like weird uh i actually think the uh body influencer stuff was really good 8.5 out of 10 overall okay all right i'll take that for a weird what was the uh what was the weakest part um the weakest part might have just been forgettable was um i would say probably the middle talking about like water bottles and stuff like that that was interesting but just the weakest the strongest was like the energy audit uh stuff time tracking sleep talk like when you guys work i think that was super strong started super strong ended super strong when talking about your like fitness journeys all right good well let's see how it goes the sam hose water thing was by far my favorite part of the whole episode is that a real thing people used to call you hose water or that was no but i used i was joking but i i used to drink out of a hose hose like i love hose water you don't drink out of hoses bro dude are you are you considered funny because i find you really really funny but you're funny in a surprising way and i feel like you think you're funny but almost that other people don't give you credit for being really funny i think that i'm not that funny and i think most people don't think i'm funny really oh i don't think you know you're funny i think people most people do not find my humor to be i got like a norm mcdonald humor you're either into it or you're not uh just so everyone has like the background that that joke that sean told of sam saying i'm gonna own a lake someday he posted it in slack and then like badgered us like five times afterwards like did you guys see that did you ask my joke was it a good joke anybody read that it's pretty good i thought fuck and then and then we were like yeah it was good and then ben comes in he's like sean it was really funny when you said this thing and sam was like what the hell dude my lake joke was way better than that oh my god this makes our lifestyle cooler than it really is future owner of the lakers future owner of a lake all right we're out of here
