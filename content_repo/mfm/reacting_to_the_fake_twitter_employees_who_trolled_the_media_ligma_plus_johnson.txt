somebody in our group chat knows this guy who did this and he shared a text message that the guy sent before he did it so he goes um he goes yo bro and the person says sup he goes are you doing anything in the next hour want to help me pull off a stunt i'm at the gym and i need a box lol i'm gonna walk out in front of the twitter office with a box in my hand there's hella tv cruise outside so elon takes over twitter i guess the purchase went through i feel like there was never like confirmation like he actually wired the money he just literally showed up at the office and like yeah there there hasn't been like a proper river ribbing ribbing ribbon cutting moment like it's not like it was more like a squatter he just like went into the office and they're like i guess you own it now you seem to be here yeah it's mine like playground rules like wow that's all it took to have twitter have you ever heard of uh like a coup like a coup d'etat like with governments uh you know i was i i read a lot of yeah they're pretty cool yeah i read a lot of history history jokes or history i read a lot of history books about uh whatever and they talk about like a coup and i'm like so you literally just like walked into the white house and you just said like you know this is mine and like the general has promised me that he's going to convince these soldiers to attack you know what i mean it's like an interesting concept you're like so it's all just made up i guess like these rules that we're we we live by this is just this is fiction and that's kind of like what i felt like he did he just walked he's like well i i own this now thank you have you seen uh you know derek lewis the ufc fighter have you seen that compilation of his thing where he says just get up no so they're like derek uh you're big like knockout artist but like you know the the knock on you has always been like what if you get a wrestling thing you know how's your jiu-jitsu are you training jiu-jitsu ain't real man and they're like what he's like man you don't need jiu-jitsu just get up and they're like what he's like why i don't want to stay on the ground with another man between my legs no i'm not into that like i'm not gonna do jiu-jitsu i'm just gonna get up they're like but you you need jiu-jitsu to get up he's like no i'm just gonna get up and so then there's this and so there's a clip of him saying that and then there's a it's like a six minute compilation of literally somebody takes him down he doesn't do jiu-jitsu he just stands back up so powerful that's how i feel that's what elon musk did he's like no just walk in yeah take it what do you mean he's like well i'm just gonna walk in with a sink and take it so anyway he does this thing where he just he says this is mine and there's all these reporters outside of twitter's office and something for a story they're waiting for the story about something going wrong elon comes here oh there's a protest there's a walk and so what happens is the first big story that happens is there's a picture of these two guys and uh kind of like you know kind of like nerdy sort of engineering looking guys and they're holding giant cardboard boxes and it says these two data scientists the data engineers data scientists were fired today from twitter here they're seen walking out with their possessions in their boxes and um and i saw and immediately something looked a little off because i was like this guy just looks so goofy but i was like well that's pretty believable you know that's much of goofy looking people that work in tech but okay oh my god he looks wow man they really found the perfect character he looks pretty goofy and then i read the name and he says but he but he but he had a box in his hand so they each had a brown box like which is just foreign because like if you work at a tech company like you you don't even probably own anything you own enough just to put in a book bag put your laptop in your backpack yeah and like if you do get fired do they even like is that a thing where you like hand people a box anymore i don't know you know what i mean they played it perfectly so then it says rahul ligma and something johnson uh daniel johnson were fired today blah blah blah and then and i saw that and i was like oh my god this guy executed a ligman like for those who don't know ligma is a is a little joke that people play on the internet where it's like like you say something blah blah blah ligma and then someone's like ligma what's like i'm not familiar ligma nuts right so that's the joke and they did this to basically i think cnbc was the first one who like reported it and then it just kept getting the same photo kept getting spread everywhere because everybody wanted this story about and the lady who tweeted it she was this cnbc reporter and i i the original tweet said something like uh we're at the scene of twitter these two engineers just came out who said they're the first to be laid off and it's just so clear how defeated they are and like there's like an audible or what does she say she's like there's just a visible uh there's just visibly defeated and totally broken and rahul ligma says now he has no idea how he's going to be able to afford his tesla payments and and then he's sitting there holding a michelle obama book and so it's like him with his box just holding this michelle obama book i don't know why and he just said and she tweeted out like you know this is just they say the first of many that's going to happen it was just like a crazy crazy scene so people are um people are are have heard this part of the story but now we got that my first million exclusive juice on top of it so somebody in our group chat knows this guy who did this and he shared a text message that the guy sent before he did it so he goes um he goes yo bro and the person says sup he goes are you doing anything in the next hour want to help me pull off a stunt i'm at the gym and i need a box lol i'm gonna walk out in front of the twitter office with a box in my hand there's hella tv crews outside and then this is literally how he pulled this up and he just goes he gets an empty box in a michelle obama book there's nothing else in the box and he walks out and the tv crews go for it and so that so that was i thought amazing and then he so that was like i mean what kind of genius is this person then he goes uh there's hella tv crews let's go get him he goes he goes bro the media is so dumb i literally put five minutes of planning into this even my uncle in india has seen the picture now he goes he goes the first thing goes did you just see the cameras and just walk out there he goes yeah basically i got to the gym it's near twitter's headquarters i saw all these cameras and so i just went to it amazing that is so funny the better who is this guy he's like a founder of like a tech startup basically he just did this oh my god yeah i'm i am ready to invest and his thing says i stealth startup so i'm like i'm ready to invest in whatever he's doing any value tv there's hella tv cameras name name your price ligma so so he goes okay so that was him did you see the interview with the other guy daniel johnson no he also had a little gem so that his was on videos that they're like you know um how do you feel about this today he's like i don't know i just gotta like i gotta go home i gotta talk to my husband and wife and regroup wait what he goes i don't know i just i just really want to go home i just really want to go home talk to my husband and wife and just the most san francisco thing ever did anyone comment on that the news didn't even like they just played the clip and then i saw that i was like wow that is the funniest thing i've ever heard perfect timing these guys are like you know comedic geniuses basically so yeah this is pretty gold amazingly well played um yeah do you want to talk about the elon war room like what he's actually doing in there like do you want to talk about that or not really have you followed not really i mean like i i read that he said like hey guys you have a week to get this one thing done and i think that that's cool that's that's a good way to run things i'm nervous he's gonna screw it all up and because i make money from twitter so like i don't want it to go away uh but uh i don't know i don't know shill bro yeah yeah like i got consulting calls to take uh so um i don't really care though like when he talks about this shit i'm like it doesn't impact me that much i don't i don't care what you're going to do well i just i don't care it's not going to impact me but i do find it interesting how he's going about this so basically the report is he goes in and the first report i thought again was another troll but i guess this is real you see this he's like he told every engineer to print out all the code that they've committed and they've written in the last three or six months and have it ready for review did you see this why print so you could just see the the page and then they changed their mind like i guess they realized how bad of an idea that was and like you know an hour later they're like uh shred the papers actually we're going to review on the computer just be prepared to review and so people are like all these engineers like i printed out like you know 300 pages of code i guess i'll just shred this i don't know what's going on here dude and what's crazy is like if you go to businessinsider.com the headline is like you know i think it says like the toil of working at twitter and it's like painting it like these people here's they're in a cold line yeah it's like this is what it's like to toil at elon musk's twitter the expectation is literally to work 24 7. and does it really say that that's what i got straight clown behavior i can't believe they're doing that i can believe it uh and it and it says this is it one of the people familiar said describing the feeling of the company under musk your job is on the line it's like dude your job's always on the line uh like is it you know like this isn't like it's not your right to work at twitter you dumb ass uh but i i i i thought it was funny because like come on man like you're you're coding this is it yeah you're gonna have to work 50 hours maybe for a little while but also i think a lot of employees at twitter are probably like this is awesome we've been sitting on our ass let's let's do it and that side doesn't seem to be getting covered a lot yeah and so he created i guess a war room so he basically brought in a bunch of people he trusts so he brought in people from his other companies like he brought in his chief legal person that guy's now like the general counsel basically he brought in he created a war room and here's who's reported to be in the war room it's uh elon his uh his his chief counsel then it's jason calicanis oh i think jason's jason's amazing but like what the hell does he know yeah i guess it is uh sriram from a16z so just a venture capitalist who's a former pm used to work at twitter is also you know had to run at twitter um and clubhouse and snapchat yeah and then also um i guess like some other people some engineers or people from like boring company or neural link or whatever like some people he trusts like his cousin is there like and they basically just set up shop and they were like all right what we're gonna do with this thing and they're like change change the logged out page it forces you to sign up no you should be able to read tweets before you sign in you know you sign up and then which is like an experiment's been tried many times before and it's like um you know we need to have this verification program you have you know five days to deliver this i guess and so they're just like sort of uh trying to figure this out of you know who stays who goes what are we building how are we going to turn this thing around and um fascinating i wish i could be a fly on the wall in this uh in this war room i think that would be like probably the most interesting thing to do right now i think it would be awesome um i hope they don't screw it up though because i got some courses i gotta sell so don't screw it up for me my point of view has always been very simple which is all the things he complains about are things that like power users would be annoyed at on twitter like the bots problem or um you know verification or the algorithm you know like not serving me the tweets i want like the problem is that just only i don't know whether like 300 million people use twitter and it's like you know five times smaller than like the other big social services and it doesn't really grow that much and like it's not like you know my mom doesn't use twitter because she's like oh there's too many bots if i tweet about crypto that will tell me to buy crypto like that's not her problem she just doesn't see value in it and like you know she just says i don't get it yeah i don't get it i don't know why i would need this like you know i don't i don't need to check this whereas instagram and whatsapp and like snapchat have all given her a reason that she needs to have it like she needs to have snapchat if she wants to see more pictures of her kids she needs to have instagram if she wants to keep up with what's going on with like bollywood or whatever right like you know everybody finds a need in the service and like that's the core problem with twitter is that the core need it addresses is only for like people like us and like it doesn't address the need for a whole bunch of other people on the planet and if they wanted it to be more valuable then they would need to do that
