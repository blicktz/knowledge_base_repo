George thanks for taking the time you're an incredible guy fascinating guy George and I got a chance to catch up earlier and I think you guys are really gonna enjoy what he has to say so George one of the things that we talked about was just how you got started in business and I found it fascinating because you know when you were starting that business in 1973 it's just very very different from the way that businesses are kind of started in San Francisco Silicon Valley these days so you can you tell us about a little bit about kind of the founding of men's warehouse and how basically you started with seven thousand dollars and the business plan well sure Tom I had seven grand which went for first and last month's rent so that left us with a zero balance and that's why the very first commercial that men's warehouse ever ran I was not the spokesperson the tagline was the only thing better than a friend in the business is a father in the business and I had a father who was able to arrange a hundred thousand dollars of credit so that I could actually have inventory when I started yeah that's awesome so so you got started seven thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars of inventory how did you make that first step towards finding customers and starting to build the mega brand that you know men's warehouse became well of course the advertising originally was just newspaper and then it morphed into television and radio and this was before there were PCs and social media so this was the way to develop a business and it was very different than the business I'm starting now in which you have to lay out the entire business spend all the money upfront and then hope that you were right and you get customers yeah and and the TV side of things is amazing because you know I think I heard a stat that six billion dollars went into kind of promoting your face TV which is just incredible how did you how did that first TV by come into existence can you tell that story because I thought it was just amazing well my I had a friend who a new friend I met him at a wedding in 1974 and he was in the advertising business in New York and talked to me about my startup and and said you know maybe I ought to look at putting the entire thirty five thousand dollar advertising budget on television I said okay we'll do that we made some commercials and he flew down from New York and walked into our store and said you don't have enough inventory I'm gonna delay the commercials by 30 days so so you immediately after taking your thirty five thousand dollar marketing budget he says you have to spend that much more on on inventory to actually even be able to run the thirty five thousand dollar TV by exactly yeah that's incredible so first TV ad goes out did it instantly work was it where it was it the the boon to your business that you were hoping it would be well back in the mid 70s when when this began there were in most cities in the United States between three and five television stations so when you ran a television commercial you were getting a huge audience so I would say within three weeks of starting on television the business started to pick up and it basically continued that way with a couple of minor interruptions for the entire 40 years I was there and and how did you evolve the brand from you know nothing better than than that there the only thing better than having a friend in the business as a father in business to you're gonna like the way you look I guarantee it well the you may recall that there was a movie in the 80s with Bill Murray named stripes and he has this famous line in the movie where he says when asked if he's part of the United States Army he says that's the fact Jack and I wanted to say that in an ad lib at the end of an early commercial I did and realized that was inappropriate for commercial TV so I quickly self edited it to I guarantee it and then in the late 90s a very smart television director inserted the words you're gonna like the way you look in front of I guarantee it and we thought that made it even more powerful and how much of that do you credit to your voice well the way I look at advertising today is that advertising is more about repetition and consistency than it is creativity now that may be changing as we move away from TV and radio and into social media but my voice became what we used to say was is that if somebody is in the kitchen getting a snack and the commercial comes on they're still gonna know it's a men's warehouse commercial even if they can't see it yeah absolutely I mean that was the voice that sold me my first suit so I appreciate that so so so you mentioned kind of creative how do you how do you see creatives role now that you're running generation tux and you're relying a little bit more on social media as opposed to the TV buys that you had built men's warehouse on well you know looking at for instance your creative it's it's it's fantastic and it presents for relatively small dollars the opportunity to create a very positive brand image so I think there's a fantastic opportunity today for young creatives in in startups but I still stick to that if you're looking for scalability in business it's hard to get away from television and it's hard to get away from repetition and advertising yeah I'm curious so so in terms of like spikes in men's warehouse did you notice any big spikes along the way I think there's that that initial one but that were associated with the branding or the content that you were developing or just merely you know repetition and expansion well I hadn't actually thought about that I'm sure there were spikes but for the most part it was a fairly steady upward slope that men's warehouse enjoyed for a long time I mean up until 2013 certainly there was a downturn during the 08 09 recession there was a short down glitch after 9 11 for those that are old enough to remember when Wall Street dropped 500 points in one day in 1987 there are those types of one-off problems but for the most part it was really just running the same story over and over until much like some of the other iconic campaigns whether it's mr. Whipple or Tony the tiger or the Alka-Seltzer man you you're not sure if you're getting sick of the commercial or actually starting to fall in love with it but one or the other I think it works equally well and and so you know we talk about creating a brand were you you know was the brand that the men men's warehouse was building was that very concerted was that premeditated and you thought this is the exact sentiment I want this customer to have or did it kind of naturally happen because you're a charismatic guy and have that you know illustrious voice that we can hear so well well I'm not sure how to answer that question I mean when I started men's warehouse I really was was was going into business not to get rich but because I wanted to be the architect of my own life and I didn't want to have a boss telling me what I had to do every day or every week I think as the company unfolded one of the things that made the company successful was that it did follow my own personality and and and persona and and so we never had to change our corporate culture our corporate culture was from basically day one the same until the day I was fired I believe in the three years since the culture is probably diminished yeah and you mentioned something interesting when we were talking is is the mission that you had in your advertising was not to sway someone with emotion but rather present the information and let the customer make their own decision based on the information that you presented you know I'm not sure I'll tell this story but I'm not sure that it's actually right and the evidence would be what you're doing now in your company is is not about the rational side of life it's about the emotional side that's what your marketing is and most marketing is thought to be better if it speaks to the emotions and not to reason but when I was becoming the spokesperson for men's warehouse for men's warehouse I wanted it to be based on reason and and not on emotion and so for instance we never use sexuality or scantily clad women as other clothing stores did to sell merchandise we tried to make it about facts and value and do you think that that has something to do with the product because you know business and and kind of you know business attires probably a little bit more rational a little bit more concrete and it's not just the fact that you've got to be better at the time and you're going to be better at the time. What we're selling is a little bit more out there a little bit more oriented towards the weekend which maybe is a more emotional time.

You know I think that it's more about the difference between your generation and mine I think that baby boomers like to pride themselves on the fact that they're going to be better at the time. You know I think that your generation understands that it doesn't have to be an either or proposition and that it's probably a little bit more of an emotional time. You know I think that it's more about the difference between your generation and mine I think that baby boomers like to pride themselves on a surplus of reason and a shortage of emotion.

And I think that your generation understands that it doesn't have to be an either or proposition and that it's probably more powerful to market with emotion. Yeah absolutely. So that kind of takes us to this generation.

So you said kind of when you started Men's Warehouse it was to get that freedom you wanted to be your own boss. Now with Generation Tux is that the same drive or is it something different? No it's totally different.

When you have had a successful career for 40 years you don't have to worry about being your own boss in your second act. This is really about as it's evolved about my legacy because I really would like to number one be successful. But I'd also like to send the message to my friends and family and to the general community that just because you're on Medicare doesn't mean that you're not capable of doing a start up.

And so it's actually I wouldn't say it's as much fun the second time around but it's close. So you started one business in 73, one business in 2015 is when you guys went publicly launched. How different are these worlds of trying to build a brand?

Well you know since this is a mostly younger audience I think one of the biggest differences is that when I started Men's Warehouse there were no computers to speak of. So we had a manual inventory control system that we created which was with circles and an X through the circle when the garment was sold. If you can imagine I ran the company for close to a decade with that inventory control system.

Today obviously with big data there is so much information available that it really is not even like talking about the same thing anymore. And how about like with the advent of the internet and branding and marketing how is that changed? Well you know we never had to be aware of where on our website we were losing traffic.

Right? That didn't exist even when Men's Warehouse developed a website in the 90s. Back then you were not able to look at page views and determine where people were dropping out.

Now with big data you can get this incredibly microscopic look at what your customers are interested in and where you're losing their interest. Yeah absolutely. So speaking of customers one of the things that you talk a lot about is this notion of conscious capitalism of thinking about both the shareholders and the stakeholders.

Having an eye towards your customers and your employees kind of first and foremost. And that's something that I think is kind of tantamount to or is just very important to success in kind of today's companies. Can you explain a little bit about kind of conscious capitalism and how you view its role in business?

Well in 1992 when Men's Warehouse went public and I went to Wall Street to set it up and explain my ideas on, I actually call it stakeholder capitalism. Apparently this one's biggest jokes in these concepts and what happened Your Millionaire is there and you look at it. So you see the complexity as you've opened and you've done and how many other developers will stop you.
