what up what's going on um did we ask people to subscribe and unsubscribe did that work i don't think it worked uh we got a bunch of videos people doing it thank you for doing it in my opinion that experiment doesn't like uh it doesn't move the needle too much i don't i don't know if that technique is a is a big technique let's answer the podcast keeps growing organically but we didn't see a spike because we asked people to do it let's uh answer all their questions um you want to answer them today or i think next uh thursday because i didn't have them i don't i got a lot of them yeah the problem and i apologize to people who send me things on instagram i don't check that ever oh yeah you know there's two inboxes on instagram facebook always does that with their so i didn't know that that was even a thing and i had all these nice people sending me reviews you find it like a year later yeah and i didn't even know that so apologies um i listened back to one of the episodes which is uh the most uber uncomfortable thing you can do i've not listened to one ever yeah and i don't blame you i listened back and um you know you were saying you're very self-conscious now because we do the video and that's how i am about the audio because i listen to it and i'm like what the fuck is wrong with me why am i talking this fast why am i breathing like that i think no i think you have you got actually have a great voice i think you have good cadence and someone at one of the meetups asked me he goes do you guys cut out silence and i was like on the audio we do you do sean does that yeah oh i thought we didn't and he was like you guys are talking so fast yeah so he he cuts out ums oz or big repetitions like if i say the same thing two different ways for no reason um and then i think he cuts a little bit of the gap between us when he doesn't like it he's like a perfectionist i told him not to do it because it takes him like six hours to do every time he's like it makes a difference and i was like i don't know if this shit makes a difference i got compliments from it okay all right well he's gonna justify it now that's crazy i just thought we were talking fast no people like the we do talk fast but it's the in-between where he speeds it up and then he cuts out any like extraneous bullshit people like it you know i also got tons of compliments from stew a few episodes back people liked him people like stew yeah high approval rating people like he doesn't have to drop out of the presidential race like everybody else all right what do we got today uh speaking of presidential did you want to talk about bernie is that your first thing up here i have a thing up there but i didn't research enough but i'll talk about it just quickly so a bunch of people on twitter were freaking out because bernie's proposing this tax on vested shares that you haven't actually cashed in yet okay and tech people were like oh okay there goes the startup scene like well you know if you're gonna tax people on vested shares that they haven't actually received the prop like this company's not liquid and so but there are some nuances like it's written here it's tax on non-qualified stock options of at least 100 000 you know if you have over 100 000 in stock uh stock options that are vested and you're an employee who's making at least 130k so it's not everybody and it's not all types of things so it's not rsu's it's isos i believe okay so i'm not an expert in this stuff at all i'm not an expert in politics i know what i believe but i don't know the technical details well let's agree to talk out of our ass for two minutes i'm not going to talk about that actually but here's what i am going to talk about is starting a company and how it worked with us and this will a lot because i do know that a lot of people think like oh the rich are doing this they don't understand things so when we started the hustle i saved up 25 000 to start it with that 25 000 i made 60 grand in profit in six weeks which is pretty good and the first year in business was roughly 380 000 in revenue and most of it was profit because i paid myself uh we were in i think we were in llc i withdrew two thousand dollars a month in salary salary um and that's how i paid my bills my rent was cheap very cheap hundreds of hundreds of dollars a month um and i lived off twelve hundred dollars um beyond that beyond that it was very i lived very very very frugally um and then we decided to raise a little bit of money i raised i think three hundred thousand dollars from people at a three and a half million dollar valuation and you had to change from being an llc at this point right yep changed to become uh an s corp i think it was an s corp probably a c corp i don't remember i see this is i'm not an expert in this yeah um you want to be a c corp if you're going to take investment that's just like if you don't have to study all the differences between them but if you're going to take like traditional investment they're going to want you to be a c corp so we converted it cost five granted to do that at this point we probably had half a million dollars in the three hundred thousand dollars in the bank account i don't i don't remember between 300 and 500 000 by the end of our first year uh and we raised money at a three and a half million dollar valuation and then once we started doing stock options and stuff like that we signed up to carta and they gave us a uh what's it called a 409 a yep where we got um so that 409 a just values your company at some number so you guys had revenue so they probably took some standard multiple yeah so they valued us and you want it to be low at this stage yeah so they valued us in the millions of dollars of range i don't remember it could have been three and a half it could have been six i don't remember the number whatever these types of businesses are that's what they value and you want it to be low because that's what your share price is get that's what your stock options are going to be if you're an employee uh you want to get in at the sort of low valuation so when it sells at a high valuation you get this sort of uh increase in value but if they if the 409a comes back high then um you're not going to get you know as much of a lift on your share price and so at this point our 409a is many tens of millions um which is nice that's cool we have a valuable business um but when we started it was single digit millions which was still a lot i was 24 at the time i i said i started with 25 000 and i was taking 2 000 a month i was not saving any money right okay um i'm not complaining because it worked out but so on paper i was a millionaire multiple millionaire if i had to pay um i think there i forget what this i don't want to like act like i know i'm talking about let's say if i if i had to pay 20 in taxes on that multiple millions of dollars you wouldn't have had i literally wouldn't have had any money to do it right even if i wanted to withdraw money from our business account i would have had to lay people off or right i i like so when people say certain people are hoarding money or something like that a lot of times it's not true and i have a lot of founder friends that have businesses that are on paper worth hundreds of millions of dollars right and they have tens of thousands of dollars saved that's a bank account yeah so they're not liquid yeah i think people need to and this also happens if you're an employee um you leave a company you usually have what they call an exercise window which might be 30 days 60 days 90 days um i think that i think the normal is 90 days um so that gives you three months to come up with the money to buy your options or you lose them yeah and a lot of people don't have that money because like you know they leave one company it's a startup and now their shares are worth 80 grand or 180 grand and they need to go they want to go do a different job and um now they need to come up with 80 or 180 grand to buy out their options that's not still a guarantee that that money's coming back and often people don't have that money sitting in the bank so they'll forfeit their options which is a true bummer some companies are being cool about it pinterest uh a couple others i don't remember maybe stripe they increase their exercise window to seven years or six years that's crazy so they're like look cool we know this practice a little bit crazy uh it's hard to come up with that cash and you worked here you earned your shares so we're not going to try to take those back you have the longer window because we might be private for longer which is kind of a cool trend so my company should do that my w2 income so at this point i make money in eight or ten different ways i got loads of things that just it just has added up over time and that's great and i still pay myself a salary i pay myself um not that much i'm not the highest paid person here yeah and i um but my w2 salary we're going to be four years old uh i've been working on this as a project since 2014 we're going to be four years old as officially in april i uh oh next month i uh my w2 salary in year one i think was 24 000 year two maybe 36 and then year three then i started going higher right because the business was established yeah but my w2 income historically has been low right quite low and so when i saw this and i saw people getting mad at rich people i'm like i bet people thought i was rich but i wasn't you know what i mean yeah and you wouldn't have qualified for this because it says you have to be making at least 130k but uh like but if i had to pay 30 tax on my stock now it would be painful fucking hard yeah you'd be in a really tough spot so you know bernie i like bernie but this is a little bit crazy this will really screw up uh the way the startup ecosystem works but they can also adapt i'm not even gonna take a stand if i think it's crazy or not i just am giving a perspective of my business and i bet and and i think i i now i think i have a lot more cash than even most people who have companies that are huge what's your biggest regret in the way you set up or organized or structured the company i wish i wouldn't have raised money and i would have just owned it all and why's that because i would be greedier and richer um you didn't end up needing that capital it's hard to say because it worked it worked um if i wanted to start fresh again i would have been able to do it i can start now what about advice a lot of people think oh this person's so successful right you raise money from a bunch of cool smart successful people either in media or not in media yeah so that was helpful was that truly like so did you get your sort of values worth on the advice component yes because i don't i'm not sure that that typically plays out that way but i think yeah it works okay so look our network is so fucking powerful me and you our network is so powerful i have i think 35 investors ranging from tim ferris the founders of nerd wallet which is who knows what that's worth billions of dollars um um the founder of the chive founders of bleacher report um who else um just look it up a lot of people and i text them i just write them i'll say you get a lot out of them and i'll tell you two things that you do that gets a lot first your investor updates which you send you used to send more frequently now i send quarterly but before i for monthly right 36 months i send them every single month every single month and the it was so well organized it was basically like um hey here's all the key metrics you don't beat around the bush it's like this is how much cash we got in the bank this is how much we made this month this is how much the email list grew this is how much our open rate was boom that's number one number two and what was your second sort of so i would i the way that i set it up i was like numbers i go just here's the numbers there's no interpretation right all right let's get into it numbers boom okay then i go uh and then i do things that are going well things are not going well i need your help yeah yes or no yeah it was great and um you sent that to so you did the work to keep them engaged and stay top of mind do not under underestimate this if you're doing your business if there's people who are willing to help you out you got to find a way to stay top of mind um and and part of it is you you share frequent updates and there's a very good sign if you're an investor if you're one of your companies stop sending their updates for a bit uh that company is about to die or they're on their way to dying and they go into a shell and paul graham has this great post which is just like um as an investor when you see that you know it's time to go check in and as a founder ironically that's when you need the help the most yeah so don't go quiet when you need the help the most that's when you need to be talking and asking and uh maybe you actually won't die if you if you could keep that going what other mistakes have we made um so i always regretted the um i think that the the normal way that people give out equity is a little too founder greedy um so i wish i'd given more equity to my team um and so like you know basically i wish i just negotiated it better between what do i get what do the investors get and what does my team get i think it was imbalanced i think some of what the investors got the team should have got some of what i had the team should have got uh because really like the people who are there as person four five six really they're taking just as much risk as you are in a way uh like they were there when it wasn't obvious that this was going to work and so for the all-stars i wish i had given more and next time my next company i'll do just that i will make sure the core four core five people i'll make sure it's not like like typically in a company would the pool be so i don't know exactly what the pool will be but let's say let's go what's typical so typical company two co-founders you start 50 50 you're going to raise some money they might end up taking 25 to 30 percent of the company um depending on how it goes let's call it 25 percent and so you know as the founders you you've diluted down you're at i don't know my math's bad but let's say you're both at uh what is that 30 something 35 percent each now and um and so you you know that's where you're at and then your team the option pool they typically say is like 10 to 15 percent is your sort of option pool yeah so the first few employees might have like you know the key person might get like one to three percent and then everybody else is below that is below one percent essentially and i just think that's like a pretty hard skew so i would try to get multiple people in the sort of one uh one to four percent range i would try to have like my core my core team all be in the over one percent range for sure and whether that means i take the haircut or investors take the haircut that's what i would do if it's a tech company i think this is very different if you're not a high growth tech company would you start it in san francisco again though i'd start it wherever i live and so if i'm if i wanted to live here yeah i'd start it here um if i wanted to live somewhere else i'd start it somewhere else now you can start it definitely anywhere so it's just about your preferences i if i was going to start again another thing that i would do is i would go and get a job somewhere and just make like when i started i hadn't i didn't i was always self-employed mostly um i wish i would have worked somewhere maybe for a little while before you did it or you mean as a do something as a side hustle before oh you just get the experience yeah i think it would have been nice and to save money that's interesting i wouldn't have thought you'd say that i think it would be helpful um to to understand how things i think if you did it for three months you'd be like okay i'm done it would have been i got it stack some money away yeah that's fair but hey it all worked out you want to talk about some stuff yeah let's talk about some ideas okay um run the world i'll start there so cool perfect timing perfect timing so these guys have been working on this obviously before this uh two i think female founders and what this is is it's a digital conference so especially with coronavirus and you've had major major conferences shutting down so facebook's f8 conference done um i believe canceled i believe gdc is done um you know like i predict south by southwest but this episode will air in a couple days i bet you they're going to cancel yeah so tons of these conferences are closing and i've always this is a great experiment because i've always wondered why aren't there more digital conferences now we built a product called blab that was sort of like this people used it this way a bunch of podcasters through a conference on our platform and i just thought hey this is cool because you could be remote you could be anywhere in the world you can attend this thing and what does the conference have it has speakers cool you can stream that online no problem it has like exhibitors cool you could do that online if you want to do and it has the networking and that's a little bit harder to do online but you could do that as well it's missing the biggest component though which is what serendipity yeah you have to engineer that serendipity into the product that's the biggest part so these guys claim that they sort of have recreated all of that i don't know i haven't used it yet but the cool thing is we're now going to find out because with all these conferences canceling run the world is taking advantage and they're going to all the conferences as they're saying um hey host it on our platform we make this really easy for you they have a cool model where basically it's no money in uh they just take 25 of the ticket sales who whose computer is up here can you google run the world yeah pull it up and so they've raised a bunch of money from andreys and horowitz this week a lot of money they announced it and um it's funny henry just googled around the world and the beyonce song came up which is hilarious my friend had a company called little things which is the is that another song it's what's the boy band with harry styles that oh it's a what are they called five something like that uh you could talk alan yeah run the world today run the world dot today is the url so live events worldwide anyways i think this is cool and we're gonna find out if this is like they've been dealt the best hand for their product right now and we'll see if they can pull this off that's interesting do you think that um like i think we should do one of these for the listeners like just like you do the new york meetup i think we should just try just to take this for a test drive i think we should just do an impromptu one and uh hang out with people get let everyone meet each other i'm down i uh okay if we had to make predictions if this is gonna work so i would say the safe bet the safe bets always know the safe bets always know okay but if you had a hundred million dollars would you invest two million into this business uh i don't know who these people are and i haven't played with the product so that's the caveat let's say i met the people and i played with the product and i felt like they did the thing you said which is it wasn't just a live stream of content or a chat room like there was some way to engineer the serendipity of a network of the networking in a conference or the discovery of new products right like so if i felt like they did something different besides just a teleconference like live stream then i would buy in but i gotta feel the magic that's a stock photo so there's a henry's pulling up a photo right now of a mug that says hustle we use that photo that's from splash that he was looking at it he thought that they stole it henry was writing up a cease and desist like during the podcast that's great okay run the world uh internet conferences uh hmm you're in or out i am going to say 51 percent in okay all right we'll take it so well here's what we'll do by the time this airs i'm going to have set up the run the world conference the link to it is going to be in the show notes and we'll figure it out so go in the show notes right now if you're listening to this well let's uh and get a ticket to attend our conference and we'll try this out well and then we'll let everyone decide is this cool or is this like one of those ideas that sounds good in theory but it misses the magic and never works uh henry go to godaddy.com real quick pick a url and we'll send them to that url as well uh i mean i hate going to the show notes okay uh either way uh let's we i mean we could just put it on our my first million podcast my first million dot com my first million podcast dot com okay my first million podcast dot com it will be a redirect to this you want to charge for it yeah yeah tickets will be whatever i don't know we'll pick a number okay uh we'll make it cheap uh 20 bucks 20 bucks and what it will be is uh what will it be we'll invite our friends so we'll invite some of the people that we think are the most interesting we'll do a talk on hey how do we build you know we'll get we'll do the things you do in the conference right so a couple speakers up fireside chat and then networking where people can meet each other okay and we'll limit it to 100 people yeah okay 100 people that some amount of money my first million podcast dot com yeah there you go try it out all right sweet what else we got on the on the agenda um oh i have one scroll down you want to talk about some book club stuff yeah okay so uh scroll down more keep on going if y'all can see the notes we use for this is hilarious one long-running google doc with just bullet points for every possible thing we might talk about yeah it's great okay so we were going to talk i was going to talk about this a few weeks ago okay so um when i moved to san francisco i started a book club called the anti-mba and i did it because i didn't go to an uh an elite ivy league school but i was always envious of those people because when i moved here i didn't know a single soul and i felt i always like stereotyped people as like tall beautiful white teeth with patagonias and they had like lovely networks that's what you saw all around yeah just like these like rich white people who that's how i was like right that's how i imagined it and it kind of was that um and i was always envious of that so what i did was i created a book club meeting where we would meet every week and we would read one book a month and i would convince an expert how did you convince people to join this where did you throw it up on your blog or what i'm just a cold email guy i just learned how to cold email people and i i did it online so each week we would have 30 people show up and i probably had an email list of 5 000 people who would this was not in person this is all online 30 people in person see eva yeah um all a lot of my best friends i met this way 30 people um my friend had an office and he let me use it and um we would just meet up and i would and i would read a week ahead of time and just make notes and lead the discussion and sometimes we would have an expert okay and then i would send show notes or meeting notes to the list and people loved it i made close to no money off of it or i don't think i made any money off of it i just did it for fun and it was very success successful and a lot of people said that we should make it a thing i think it's a stupid i thought it was a stupid idea but book clubs are actually kind of interesting so there's this uh business called book of the month club it was started in i believe it was started in the 1930s at this point it's owned by uh it was owned by bertelsman which is a large publisher a multi-billion dollar publisher and then recently a private individual bought it for single digit millions of dollars um and in the 40s 50s and 60s this was massive i mean it was uh millions of people paid for it so it's quite a large business hundreds of millions of dollars probably in the 60s and 70s uh it's gone away once amazon came around um a guy bought it a couple years ago and it's quite large still and what they do is uh score down a little bit this is 90 million users what the hell no that's good reads oh that's good reads and so book of the month club now has a hundred thousand active paying customers wow which means they're in the revenue range of 10 to 15 million a year in recurring revenue and they the founder said in an interview he uh uh what his goal is to grow five x a year for five x a year nice for the next year not consistently i don't know if that's i think that's bogus but uh book of the month is kind of an interesting thing i suspect i've always thought that it would would not work now my opinion has changed so goodreads has a hundred million users there's this thing called the wattpad have you heard of wattpad i've heard of it yeah wattpad a lot of people don't know about it wattpad it's owned by a guy in canada and they have 400 employees it's a multiple hundred million dollar a year business i believe they it's a book club for it's not a book club it's more right on it you you write original stories yeah but it's the category is romance middle middle america romance novels so if you're a 40 year old woman you probably have heard of wattpad you're saying that's the most popular category or yeah but that's pretty much all they do oh really okay it's basically for women who it's like men do video porn romance novels is woman porn i mean that's basically what it is um and so a huge business and now i'm quite bullish now on these book clubs yeah yeah reese witherspoon has a book club my wife uses it my sister so many people have you heard of this no i haven't heard about sunshine some fucking thing but oprah had hers but hers wasn't a paid membership but this is really smart like what you're describing i'm like oh this is good and i think you gotta have um probably not gotta have but it's advantageous here to have a brand like a reese witherspoon or whoever jennifer aniston or gwyneth paltrow or whoever or like the hustle could do a book club you could do a book club like i think that you have to have a a bit of cachet to organize people around to get the energy going that initial energy you need so here's one angle you buy the rights to the book which is expensive yeah why would you do that well because i think the margins in books are quite small i've talked to tim ferris about this he told me that he earns um i he didn't say that he didn't tell me this but he told me i mean i think that he does about a million a month in revenue off his podcast and he told me that he this is what he did tell me he has made 10 times more money off the podcast than all of his books combined right so i i don't think people get paid a lot of money for books the margins are so might be a cheap asset you're saying yeah i think it's quite cheap um so i would one up my goal would be to buy the rights to the book and make it popular you know who um have you heard of um there's this company that owns uh the company that owns proactive it's called uh got um i know what you're talking about it's the skincare it's a direct marketing company they the guy who owns it it's a quite large business he got his start because he bought the rights to think and grow rich oh really and he helped make it popular again oh wow through infomercials so that's what i would do is i would want to buy the rights to all the books um and there's another company called mentor box that does this and tai lopez is one of the owners so it's incredibly scammy i mean like you sign up for like 20 and then it rolls into like a 400 a month thing it's like stupid um but book clubs are super interesting to me so would you do this uh like if you were going to do this now how would you attack it what would you do so you buy the rights so you buy the rest of which books if i wanted to bootstrap it no you can't how would you do it so what i would do is i would look at what vinyl me please vinyl me please is my friend's business it's a uh probably a couple million bucks a month subscription thing so what you do is you give them fifty dollars a month and they send you a vinyl once a month right and so i would do that but for a particular type of category so what i would do is i would create a facebook group and i would say it's thirty dollars or fifty dollars a month and we're going to read one book a month i'm going to get one expert to come and talk about the book uh each week or each month we're going to do in a facebook group and i'm going to send you notes about the whole and what uh category do you think you choose would you do the romance novel or would you do business or would you do well just because i have such a network and business that i could just crush it right off the bat yeah but romance novels i know this from experience because i've invested in these types of things romance novels have the have the highest liquidity uh p as in people consume them the most right so i would like voracious readers five five times the number of books the romance category is probably one of the most it's probably the most popular category on kindle yeah i bet you it is so okay me personally i would start here but if i even slightly was interested in romance novels i would and i like what this guy did uh buying the rights to the book of the month club for you know some a popular asset that's sort of decayed over the last 30 years and uh see if you can revitalize it on the cheap i think these are interesting businesses there's so many books that i love that are written in the 60s and 70s and you try to buy them on amazon and they're hundreds of dollars because they've just been forgotten and they don't reprint them right um i just tried to buy a book the other day for that that someone mentioned on twitter and it was 900 what book it was so i just tweeted about agora that the scammy um company um uh which we can talk about if we want but the it was all about copywriting it was 900 bucks wow um okay yeah let's talk about agora okay you want to hear about agora okay so agora is is what it's a b2b paid newsletter company uh yeah that has absurd revenue go to my twitter account okay so here's another interesting company i know this because i'm in this world and it's directly related to us yeah just yeah that's the empire yeah whatever that's fine um okay so agora crazy interesting background so agora was started by this guy named bill bonner in the 1970s he was a publisher he had a a magazine um about money and investing and things like that and then he decided to start uh changing how he did his marketing and he created a newsletter that became quite popular um at this point uh it you'll see it it's the most popular one no up higher at this point they make it's rumored to be one and a half to two billion dollars a year and the way that they do this there it is they own 20 to 40 different newsletter publishers and what they do is is they buy a ton of traffic to their funnels their marketing funnels and right off the bat they'll sell you a 50 product right and once you buy that 50 product they now have a large database and email list of qualified buyers who are interested in a particular topic and they typically lose money on this first purchase so let's say that they have a book that's 50 bucks they'll spend up to 200 to acquire you meaning they'll buy a ton of ads and they'll lose money on you but they'll make it up because on the they call it a back end on the back end they sell you a two thousand dollar paid newsletter and this company in particular they even sell supplements and now some people think that they some people love them and when you own 20 or 40 different brands you're going to have some legitimately great products right so what's their best product um money matt press dot com or yeah money matt press so this is for hedge funds for financial traders no um yes some financial traders their their typical audience is white men between 50 and 70 who who who are conservative and believe in like the government's going to come and like take your money um i mean that goes like so i signed up some of their funnels and there was shit like if you go to brightbart.com you'll see an ad that says like nancy pelosi's coming for your money and things like that and you sign up takes you through one of the agora funnels and it's a five dollar book and then yeah and then you'll you'll go through these funnels if now let's just get rid of the whole unethical part because you can learn from everyone who cares if it's unethical or ethical it's fascinating regardless and you can learn from it what they're experts at is copywriting and everyone in silicon valley not everyone but you know you get the point it's all about design it's got to look good it's got to be aesthetic their websites are a blank page with text right not just text but like 5 000 words and a buy now button at the very bottom it's crazy fascinating that is fascinating and i think you're you know you know that peter teal quote where it's like what's something you believe to be true that few would agree with you on yeah i feel like you know you might have many but one of them would be copywriting over design any day copywriting over design 100 and most people i remember when i learned the word copywriting because i was like what is what is everyone talking what is copy why does everyone keep saying this and like i literally was at work and people like hey can you give me some copy i was like coffee what did she just ask me to go get a coffee for her like i had no idea what the fuck she was talking about and uh and then i sort of learned oh copy means text that's going to go on the website and then through you i realized hey wait a minute the text that's on your website is essentially your salesman and sales gives you the money i should probably learn how to do this and then i went deep on it it's the most important skill you can learn because i've spent years learning it if you just give me a blank page i will i will make money until i die right i will always have a job because i can do that right now what i could do is do really unethical and scam a lot of people really easily but if you know how to copyright do or you know how to persuade via the written word yeah i would say persuasion is the most important skill whether it's through the written word verbally um you know i don't know if there's some other you have a copywriting variation copywriting just the form in which you learn it now the way that i describe it is if you're a good copywriter you understand what motivates people and if you understand what motivates people you can create products that they'll want that will appeal to people yeah and then if you are that is that's the when you do copywriting you just learn what motivates people and then you just happen to use the written word to right communicate yeah uh when when you mentioned the boron letters and then i just went deep on that that was like my foray into this so we'll do a whole section on did you read the copyright yes and then i started like doing all the things in it uh because i got obsessed so the boron letters if anyone's curious gary halbert is his name he's dead now he died of a heart it's actually kind of hard to find it's hard to find but there's there's one link and if you get to it it's like chapter one two three and it goes to 19 or whatever it's this copywriter who's one of the best copywriters of all time and what he would do is he was such a good copywriter that he kind of turned into a crook and so he would write these sales letters to buy like encyclopedias or and buy like fucking anything just so the boron letters are the way it starts it's like he's writing to his son he's in jail he's in jail writing to his son and he doesn't start off by being like here's how you copyright he's just writing to his son and it's one by one and each one's a teaser every sentence teases the next sentence and every letter teases the next letter and then by the time you get 20 deep you're like this guy's a master it is awesome so read that um all right what do you got sean um a couple others okay so here's an idea so i was uh talking to my cousin and um so we were talking about like one of my cousins he's young he goes on dates uses the apps boom boom boom and then like our aunts and uncles are always like oh my god look at him he's just swiping left and right he goes on dates it's like really foreign concept to them and uh so that was one data point okay just kind of noticed wow my aunts and uncles they really don't get it when it comes to this online dating thing data point two i'm watching the debate and um it was i watched so much online that when i watch traditional tv first of all it's so slow and secondly i start to see the commercials and i'm like oh this is what's being advertised to mainstream america like cars it's very fascinating so like noom was on there which is like the diet like nutrition plan thing yeah they do really really well noom um we should break them down later they advertise but the other one was some uh it was this gray-haired woman comes on the on the screen and she's like oh online dating where do i start and then it's like well open up your browser type www.nmd url it's like and then start clicking around like that was literally that was the ad was like how do i even get started like here's how you get started online dating i don't remember the name oh come on it wasn't like a match or you know i had never heard of it before so i started thinking and i was like um you know there's so many people that are sort of in my sort of uh extended family and whatnot that are divorced and they're alone and so i was thinking about them i was like you know it'd be great if they found someone but the reality is they don't do a lot of online dating because it's so scary and foreign and it's not the online part that's scary it's the expectation that you then need to go meet somebody and so like let's take my uncle for example my uncle's i don't know 65 years old he is divorced he gets lonely his kids are all grown up everyone left the house and um you know he doesn't want to actually like it'd be great if he met somebody who was awesome and they could just like be companions for the rest of their life but he's sort of like dude i don't want to get out there like last time i went on a date was 40 years ago like uh i think i'm just out of the game it's easier to be lonely than it is to put yourself out there so anyway long preamble for the idea the idea is a service that's for older people let's make it just 50 and up as a as a rule and it's called just talking and the expectation is you're gonna go on here with other people who are like you are sort of single might be alone looking for companionship but it's just talking you can't meet it's not their real names it's nothing it's just somebody you could log on to the computer and just talk to either through audio or text and you could talk to them continuously or you could switch and pick somebody else and talk to them but it's just companionship as a service um for and it's not dating you're not going to start going out with this person you're not trying to get remarried you're just getting the reps in you just don't want to be lonely at home anymore and honestly you can have a virtual relationship you know through this and it's because i was also watching love is blind so and i was like dude somebody should make an app that's just this now off the back of this idea and so anyways these are sort of some ideas let's learn about it by i love it i love it winter that's a winner um what i would do is i would go and do research on the sex hotlines that used to exist that probably don't exist anymore right and i would want to learn how they work i bet they crushed so i'll shout out some like tangentially related so sex hotline related but obviously master p used to own one that for sex that killed it then there's one a startup out here in san francisco called papa have you heard of this papa yeah no papa is uh grandkids as a service so it's just young people uh that you that will just come over to your grandparents house and just do stuff for them um and like talk to them but like also do their laundry and like take out that trash i don't know if they're doing well or not they just launched they raised a bunch of money and um because there's this huge aging population of the baby boomers and so there's this wealth of opportunities that are for this the largest generation of people ever in america is now getting old and uh i forgot this woman was calling it the um the the gray new world and you know for gray hair and so she's like you know the gray new world opens up all these possibilities so one is papa which is grandkids as a service one is honor because uh i know honor there's a huge shortage of caretakers uh for for the elderly and so honor is a on-demand caretaker platform that you know is but you're getting off track here are you going with caring for old people or helping people get laid i'm talking about just talking that's my idea but i was just tangentially saying there's some other businesses that are trying to help the relationship hero what did they do never heard of that no jack invested in it and he says it's going well it's called relationship hero relationshiphero.com and they teach you how to do online dating oh okay just coaching for online dating go can you go to really just pull that out that's how it started as it might be a little bit different for you this would be for younger people though it'd be for whoever i i think it could be i think if you did just talking and you ran a bunch of facebook ads you could get a lot of people to pay to be a part of a community of people where they can have these online relationships i love expectation is you do not go offline i think it's great you know why i think it's great is because the way the way the way that you're positioning it is as a marketplace those are notoriously hard to make but once you have them they're great yeah the reason why i like this is you can kind of fake it at first yeah so you can just hire people you can have some operators yeah that are that are providing that campaign i think it's a great idea you could seed the marketplace with the operators yeah i think it's awesome we talked about only fans yeah um that's trending today on twitter is it yeah worldwide because of what some must have gone down i didn't get the joke i clicked on it and tried to understand it and i didn't right i didn't get it one out of three twitter trends yeah it was a top only fans which we talked about only fans great business but i love just talking i think i think that's a great idea thank you thank you thank you very much no i think that's that's a winner all right i have a question for you now so before last week i think maybe it was when i was with stew but i i shared this anecdote or this this sort of uh advice which was if you're offered a seat on a rocket ship um you know don't ask which seat just sit down and buckle up and this is just career advice which is if you're not going to start your own company you got flackport did i yeah oh i thought people loved it what do you mean well what was the criticism nice-sized audience not everyone's gonna be happy but what was what was the criticism based on it wasn't even controversial just stuff like um titles it was just comments like people saying titles are important how much you get paid is more important things like that that's crazy disagree hard disagree um okay so anyways the question was sort of that led to a different question which is what are the rocket ships of today and so somebody by the way took that idea and made a rocket ship newsletter for jobs or whatever johnson um but beyond that i was just sort of thinking just my thought experiment um what companies that today are worth one to five billion do i believe will be multi-hundred billion so what's just as a way of phrasing it simpler what five billion dollar company today could become a 500 billion dollar company in the future i say this because we have friends who bought facebook secondary stock uh back in 2006 and 2007 when facebook was valued at over a billion dollars and today facebook's like whatever 500 billion dollar company and um that you know it was clear it wasn't going to zero it was clear it was a thing and the question but you could have invested then and got a phenomenal return and i have several friends who did i had a friend uh alex uh oh no sorry josh buckley who's a good guy founder and british guy uh yeah he's a british guy he's and so he um he was telling me we were just hanging out one day and he's like yeah i'm buying secondary stock of stripe as much as i can get and i was like oh like what do you mean like i'm not doing that why are you doing that i should do that and he was like yeah i just think stripes a great company and there's secondary stock available and i'm just buying it i'm like well what's the valuation it's already like a two billion dollar company he's like yeah but it's like stripes gonna be big he's like i think stripes gonna be huge so i'm just buying up secondary and now so stripes value now like 20 billion dollars uh so he took essentially like a no risk bet in my opinion and 10x his money on a private company that was it was already a unicorn but wasn't yet on the stock market wasn't doing like 10 10 a year you know that's a 10x appreciation so long story short what companies do you think have that potential that are in the single digit billions today or less that that you think could be a facebook google amazon of our generation so a few years ago i answered this question and i thought it was at lastian and i went in on that and i and it worked okay tell me about that what do you mean it worked back then it was can you just look at look go ahead and relook go to last in stock we were busy today i i invested in atlassian stock i mean it's not like i like yeah at lat uh atlassian it's spelled with an a t a t there it is yeah and then go to all time i bought at last max on the far right i bought it when it when it went public so what did it go up by it so that's like a 3x already so i 3x my money so i bought atlassian because i read their annual report and i was like oh these guys are great right so their market cap's now 35 billion yeah so i bought it right when it went out so that worked out well what do you think could get to the over 100 billion it's very hard to get over 100 billion how many companies are worth over 100 billion like very very few uh especially if you think about tech companies so some of the tech companies that made it amazon made it google made it microsoft made it facebook made it um uber did not quite make it yet uh but it's getting there tesla made it um like i think i invested in tesla when it was at about this number five five to eight billion oh really and um now it's almost 100 billion and so like that's a that's a big lift of a company that it's out there it's not a seed saved startup you're taking a bet on right it's a company that's out there and the other way to take the bet on it even if you're not an investor is to go work at one of these companies right so like airbnb was a good candidate uh now it's value too high to qualify for this airbnb is like at i don't know 35 billion or something like that we'll see what happens with this but it's not in the single digit billions anymore but when we when we moved to san francisco we could have done that right when i moved to san francisco you applied had a job offer at airbnb when it was worth a billion one billion maybe less i don't know there was only no it was less it was 2012. right so so let's just say it was at a billion which it wasn't but let's say it was uh yeah i would have made 10 million dollars i don't know it's 35x so even if you had just gotten a sort of standard stock package which was like over four years you're gonna get 200 grand i would have made five or ten million dollars yeah that's insane and i got fired before i even showed up to work uh so some other candidates that i put up here flexport i think is a candidate maybe oh you got some inside intel that sounded like a juicy maybe well ryan told me he thinks it's going to be massive or it's going to go bankrupt okay which is like how you're going to be when you're yeah that's how you're gonna be that's how you got some other some this was harder than i thought i also tweeted this out so the most popular answers i got was air table and carta and i pretty much disagree with both of those i don't know i and i asked these are smart people replying and i was like carta why carta we should get card to sponsor this podcast by the way yeah why are they not i don't know you guys need a sponsor and i'm gonna i i don't give a fuck if people sponsor i'm gonna tell you the truth carta it's the best option out there but it still needs a lot to improve right i use it i give you guys five grand a year i'm happy that i give you the money um but it can improve yeah so air table air table it would have to basically replace excel in the corporate world for it to do this otherwise it will not be a hundred billion dollar company how about gusto gusto is a good one so i think there's a lot that are in the sort of either hr tech just you need to be in huge space like gusto and rippling yeah gusto rippling i think i would be a hundred billion it's a high bar but yeah so other ones that i that i put up here so stripe but it's past this point so coinbase only if the bit if bitcoin actually becomes like if bitcoin actually is the thing it becomes the global reserve currency then well it doesn't have to be the largest bitcoin sort of company the largest bitcoin brand would be i think it just has to become bank of america can it become wells fargo yeah but i think bitcoin has to become that relevant for coinbase to be yeah i buy that open door is another one just because residential real estate is so big so if they actually have a working model they could become a hundred billion dollar company i don't buy that because what because zillow and truly aren't that huge uh they don't do what these guys do though zillow and truly they sell leads to brokers they're now trying to copy open doors and now they offer what open door offers but open doors literally buying and selling the houses they're flipping houses at scale which is pretty crazy what else this was tough i don't know that's all i had but i put this on here i wasn't going to talk about it initially but i'm like i want to bring this up i want people to tell me what i'm wrong about well what what companies i should be considering in this but i think it's a really important question because for me i'm going to go try to buy secondary stock in all these companies okay so i don't and if you're working you should go work at one of these companies a hundred billion is that's impossible i won't even i'm not even going to try to predict that because like only like a few hundred people a few a few hundred businesses have ever probably done that i don't know the number but um that's really hard to say but if i had to make a prediction i i do think that there will be some new search engines uh and i also think that some of the new chrome replacements could be quite large so brave is one of them um what's another one um replacing the browser yeah anything that are replacing browsers i think are kind of cool and could potentially be that big i think there's gonna be a lot of browser i think if any company uh nails ar they will they will be able to do this but that's a ways away i believe how about uh zoosk that was the self-driving car company yeah yeah so that was the other i i considered all the self-driving car companies because i'm like if if one of them becomes a success a self a successful self-driving car company the market leader will be worth over 100 billion it's just more likely i believe it's more likely to be tesla or one of the incumbents rather they'll buy one of these companies rather than that company independently going from where it is today which is 1 billion to 100 billion how about this what companies are public now that could grow that much so i was talking to moise the other day and we were looking at stamps.com they're crazy undervalued and the next day we were like let's buy this the next day we didn't buy in time it went up 50 percent went up 50 percent yeah i love that it was coincidental just i saw an interesting stat over the last 10 years um if you had just brought bought the fang companies so facebook amazon apple google uh in the 10 years it outperformed all vcs uh or sorry it outperformed even this sort of top um uh like expected returns of venture capital so the public market if you just bought the five most popular tech stocks you did better it was a 20 24 irr over 10 years okay well what what's public now that could i don't know that's a great question um it's that's hard you got to really bet on industries what do you got sports betting good that's a good that's a good and if the legislation keeps opening up that's a good call i would do sports betting i would bet on that industry that's a great call um okay we ventured off into stock tips so i want to get back because we don't know about the stock market that's not our that's not our promise uh let's tell them something else that we find interesting what else you got you want to do one more i'll mention one of the cool company that's related to stocks actually public comps.com so public comps yeah i saw guys show this and he's just breaking down um s1s for companies which like a lot of people like to do nowadays but it's just a good you don't have to do the research this guy does the research for you and he publishes it i like it let's do uh let's do let's wrap up with made renovation you talked about this in one of our very first podcasts yeah exactly so one of our very first ones i was like hey i saw this ad i think this is awesome idea what it is if you don't remember because you're not a diehard um the what it was is it's a turnkey bathroom renovation so if you want your bath so the ad was just a dope looking bathroom and it was like if you want this bathroom it's like five grand and you don't have to like because what what happens today you have to hire a contractor you have to come up with the vision board of what you want to be you have to choose all these different materials then he sources it and then it turns out and then it's like that's a one-off so they have like four designs of bathrooms you just pick which one you want you want the old victorian cool looking one you want the modern one or you want the middle of the road one yeah i always said i wish barbers and here's the price and you just push the button yeah it's like actually some barbers do this you go up on the hair number three yeah i'll take the number three large you know you know no problem so that's what these guys are doing for bathrooms i thought that was really smart so it turns out this was not just like some random startup this is roger dickey was starting this and he's a he started gigster um he's done some cool stuff in silicon valley before so he's not a sort of a joker and um they raised nine million bucks and they came out of stealth and i was like i gave myself a little pat on the back that's a good one that's a good call that's a pretty good call i still think it's a very cool idea and i also think that anybody could compete with them because this will not be winner take all because you have to be doing local renovations in different cities uh they announced it this week good job yeah uh can i give myself a pat on the back yeah um one of my first angel investments uh lucy uh lucy nicotine.com i think or i don't even know what the url is to be honest um you explain what it is people don't know yeah so i invested in all your what all your friends are buying lucy oh yeah money the bank okay so one of my first angel investments uh i don't remember when this was three years ago the founder of soylent dave um who's my friend dave rentown uh renten he started this thing and um it was based it's basically a nicorette so it's right new age nicorette nicotine gum and um he told me about it and i was like all right well dave you started soylent so you're pretty smart you scaled that thing up yeah i knew him well he's a good guy and it's a it's a big market it's nicotine so i'm like okay well i mean this is retention is gonna be good yeah i'm uh i'm a nicotine user i like the gum i i chew the gum and i like to chew nicorette uh yeah i like to i prefer lozenges so i'll put them in my mouth okay uh and um but you don't smoke so you just do this just nicotine i like nicotine it's i don't drink and i don't smoke it's it's it's my that's my vice and uh and it's a monthly subscription yeah i was like yeah of course you'll fucking knock that one off the park really smart and they just raised a lot more money and uh so on paper which is completely useless on paper they're not going to buy me a house or pay my rent but the valuation went up significantly so i got a little my corner store guy has it at the front by the register and i said okay whatever's at the front by the register that's what's selling that's what this guy does will make him money is it really i really i did i sent dave a picture i was like no shit uh henry although the guy the guy at the i asked him i said how well does this sell he's like it's pretty good it's not jewel but it's pretty good of course it's not jewel are are the kids are buying nick uh lucy yeah oh yeah money congratulations yeah pay the taxes on it oh fuck money in the bag i think that's a five or six x so far i'm proud that uh that would be a that's a good investment i like that one that will be a good one i think we're uh one of the first folks in on that one uh uh fucking a i hope it works um and just for the while it is awesome i uh it's totally luck so i'm not gonna take that much credit but awesome um all right you want to talk about anything else uh no i think we're good i think we're good let's save it we're gonna do another one in two days i got i got some other stuff for that all right thank you give us a review and uh share with your friends yeah tell your friends see ya
