## Notes

#### Preface
1. It’s worth trying to understand why, since the publication of Influence, I haven’t had to confront
any of the indignant condescension Boyle (2008) forecast, including from the most hawkish of my
academic colleagues. I think there are two main reasons. First, unlike the popularized forms of social
science seen in the “human interest” articles of daily newspapers, I made a concerted effort to cite the
individual publications (hundreds of them) on which I based my statements and conclusions. Second,
rather than seek to elevate my own investigations or any particular grouping of investigations, I
sought to elevate a particular _approach to investigating human responding—the approach of_
experimental behavioral science. I didn’t intend it at the time, but the disarming effect on my fellow
experimental behavioral scientists may affirm a belief I’ve long held: people don’t sink the boats they
are riding in.
2. Alas, a bit of Internet research revealed that I can’t attribute the origin of the insightful quote to
my grandfather. It comes from his famous countryman Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa.

#### Introduction
1. It is worth noting that I have not included among the seven principles the simple rule of material
self-interest: that people want to get the most and pay the least for their choices. This omission does
not stem from any perception on my part that the desire to maximize benefits and minimize costs is
unimportant in driving our decisions. Nor does it come from any evidence I have that compliance
professionals ignore the power of this rule. Quite the opposite; in my investigations, I frequently saw
practitioners use (sometimes honestly, sometimes not) the compelling “I can give you a good deal”
approach. I chose not to treat the material self-interest rule separately in this book because I see it as
a motivational given, as a goes-without-saying factor that deserves acknowledgment, but not
extensive description.

#### Chapter 1: Levers of Influence
1. The energy-drinks experiment was conducted by Shiv, Carmon, & Ariely (2005). At the time I
read their article (and thought to myself, What?), I was purchasing energy drinks to help me finish a
big writing project with a fast-approaching deadline. Before seeing the study’s results, I would never
have guessed that getting the drinks on sale, which I tried to do whenever possible, would make them
_less effective for me._
2. A complete description of the mother-turkey experiment is provided in a monograph by M. W.
Fox (1974)—honest, this animal researcher’s name is Fox. Sources for the robin and bluethroat
information are Lack (1943) and Peiponen (1960), respectively.
3. Perhaps the common “because . . . just because” response of children asked to explain their
actions comes from their shrewd recognition of the unusual amount of power adults assign the word
_because—because it implies a reason, and people want reasons to act (Bastardi & Shafir, 2000). In an_

-----

instructive chapter, Langer (1989) explores the larger implications of the Xerox study (Langer,
Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978) and makes the case for the widespread presence of automatic responding
in human behavior—a position shared by Bargh & Williams (2006).

Although several important similarities exist between this kind of automaticity in humans and
lower animals, there are important differences as well. The automatic behavior patterns of humans
tend to be learned rather than inborn, more flexible than the lockstep patterns of the lower animals,
and responsive to a larger number of triggers.
4. Cronley et al. (2005) and Rao & Monroe (1989) have shown that when people are unfamiliar
with a product or service, they become particularly likely to employ the expensive = good rule. In
marketing lore, the classic case of this phenomenon is that of Chivas Regal Scotch Whiskey, which
had been a little-known, struggling brand until its managers decided to raise its price to a level far
above that of its competitors. Sales skyrocketed, even though nothing was changed in the product
itself (Aaker, 1991).

Besides the energy-drink (Shiv, Carmon, & Ariely, 2005) and pain-reliever (Waber et al., 2008)
studies, others have found that people see a higher-than-warranted connection between an item’s
price and its quality and then allow this misguided connection to influence their responses (Kardes,
Posavac, & Cronley, 2004). A brain-scan study helps explain why the expensive = good stereotype is
so powerful. When tasting the same wine, tasters not only rated themselves as experiencing more
pleasure if they thought it cost $45 versus $5, their brains’ pleasure centers actually did become more
activated by the taste of the presumed “$45” wine (Plassmann et al., 2008).
5. For evidence of the need for and value of automaticity in our lives and of how the automaticity
reveals itself in judgmental heuristics, see Collins (2018); Fennis, Janssen, & Vohs (2008); Fiske &
Neuberg (1990); Gigerenzer & Goldstein (1996); Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky (1982); Raue &
Scholl (2018); Shah & Oppenheimer (2008); and Todd & Gigerenzer (2007). Petty et al. (2019) offer
multiple examples of how, unless they have both the motivation and ability to examine incoming
information carefully, people rely on heuristics in responding to the information. The comprehensiveexams study (Petty, Cacioppo, & Goldman (1981) is one of those examples; see Epley & Gilovich
(2006) for yet another.

It’s instructive that even though we often don’t take a complex, deliberative approach to
personally important topics (Anderson & Simester, 2003; Klein & O’Brien, 2018; Milgram, 1970;
Miller & Krosnick, 1998), we want our advisers—our physicians, accountants, lawyers, and brokers
—to do precisely that for us (Kahn & Baron, 1995). When feeling overwhelmed by a complicated
and consequential choice, we still want a fully considered, point-by-point analysis of it—an analysis
we may not be able to achieve except, ironically enough, through a shortcut: reliance on an expert.
An account by Thomas Watson, Jr., the former chairman of IBM, offers graphic evidence of the
phenomenon in another example of Captainitis. During World War II, he was assigned to investigate
plane crashes in which high-ranking officers were killed or injured. One case involved a famous airforce general named Uzal Girard Ent, whose copilot got sick before a flight. Ent was assigned a
replacement who felt honored to be flying alongside the legendary general. During takeoff, Ent began
singing to himself, nodding in time to a song in his head. The new copilot interpreted the gesture as a
signal to him to lift the wheels. Even though they were going much too slowly to fly, he raised the
landing gear, causing the plane to drop immediately onto its belly. In the wreck, a propeller blade
sliced into Ent’s back, severing his spine and rendering him a paraplegic. Watson described the
copilot’s explanation for his action:

_When I took the copilot’s testimony, I asked him, “If you knew the plane wasn’t going to fly, why_
_did you put the gear up?”_

_He said, “I thought the general wanted me to. He was stupid.” (1990, p. 117)_

-----

Stupid? I’d say, in that singular set of circumstances, yes. Understandable? In the shortcutdemanding maze of modern life, I’d also say yes.
6. Apparently, the tendency of males to be bamboozled by powerful mating signals extends beyond
fireflies (Lloyd, 1965) to humans. Two University of Vienna biologists, Astrid Jütte and Karl
Grammer secretly exposed young men to airborne chemicals (called copulins) that mimic human
vaginal scents. The men then rated the attractiveness of women’s faces. Exposure to the copulins
increased the judged attractiveness of all the women and masked the genuine physical-attractiveness
differences among them (Arizona Republic, 1999). Although romance is not at issue, certain
primitive pathogens also mimic chemical substances to render healthy bodies (cells) receptive to
them (Goodenough, 1991).
