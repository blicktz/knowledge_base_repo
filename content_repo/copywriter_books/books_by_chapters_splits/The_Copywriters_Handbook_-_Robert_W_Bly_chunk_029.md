### against “phishing” attacks on your brand. You should know that some ISPs, such as AOL, require SPF to be implemented to be considered for their whitelists.
 3. Make only one connection. When connecting to an e-mail server, send only one message per connection. Some systems still try to shovel as many messages through one connection as possible, which can be likened to throwing five hundred e-mail addresses into the “BCC” field. ISPs frown on this technique, as spammers who want to get as many messages in before being blocked typically use this approach.
 4. Limit sending rate. Though the ideal send volume depends on the list’s nature, a good rule is to limit your transmission to 100,000 or so messages per hour. Keep in mind that you will also need to accept feedback in the form of bounced messages—your outgoing speed shouldn’t affect your ability to receive bounces.
 5. Accept bounces. Some e-mail systems, especially older ones, have a nasty habit of rejecting bounce messages. These “bounced bounces” arrive at the receiving ISP and can raise red flags. Nothing irks an ISP more than sending a response that a recipient doesn’t exist, only to have the notification rejected and the mailings continue.
 6. Validate HTML content. One of the dirtiest tricks in a spammer’s arsenal is invalid, broken, and malicious HTML code. If you use HTML in your messages, make sure your code is error-free and follows W3C HTML guidelines, as discussed earlier.
 7. Avoid scripting. Security risks due to script vulnerabilities in e-mail browsers have increased over the years. The result is that most scripts are stripped out of messages. Some e-mail systems reject messages outright if scripting is detected. For greatest delivery success, avoid using any scripts in messages. Instead, direct your readers to your Web site, where use of dynamic scripting can be fully implemented.
 8. Understand content filtering basics. Ignorance of filtering approaches is no excuse for not getting messages delivered. Read bounce messages, track which messages had high bounce rates and low open rates, and see if you can reverse-engineer offending content.

### 9. Monitor delivery and bounce rates by ISP/domain. After every delivery, run reports by major domain and ISP on your messages. Look for unusual bounce, unsubscribe, spam complaint, and open rates at specific domains.
 10. Monitor spam complaints. Even the best permission marketers with world-class practices receive spam complaints.Monitor the number of spam complaints for each mailing and establish a benchmark average. Look for mailings with spam complaint percentages that vary from the norm. See if you can determine what may have caused the problem. Was it the subject line? Too many messages in too short a time? Remember, a high number of spam complaints may result in an ISP blocking current, or even future, messages.

 Some resources you can use to monitor complaints are:

 Diagnosing the root causes of deliverability problems will help you prevent them. You must monitor your delivery rates religiously because the rules around delivery change every day! Don’t make the mistake of understaffing or underfunding around this issue, as it undermines the overall effectiveness of your e-mail marketing program (and your company image at the same time).
 Remember, to reach full delivery you must:

 • Monitor: Use a seed list–based monitoring system that tracks your true delivery rates across all major ISPs. Know when a problem occurs, and don’t rely on your bounce-backs to give you all the information you need. Some mail just never gets delivered, or is put directly into “junk” folders or trash bins—and you’ll never know without such a system in place.

 • Analyze: When you’re at less than 100 percent delivery, it’s high time to find out why. You should look closely at the individual e-mail, as well as

### the e-mail program as a whole. There are lots of reasons for failed delivery —and early detection ensures smooth future deliveries.

 • Resolve: Create strong relationships with ISP tech-support people to have a valuable resource to troubleshoot alongside your staff members. ISP relations should be a high priority.

 • Optimize: Use information from all sources to solve your e-mail delivery problems. Small changes in creative copy, list, or server configuration can make a world of difference in your delivery rates.

 Make sure you are tracking your deliveries, testing for ISP blocking and spam filtering before a large mailing, and reacting quickly to problems when they arise. Although complicated, it’s imperative in the creation and maintenance of a truly successful e-mail marketing program.

 LONG VS. SHORT E-MAIL COPY

 “What works best in e-mail marketing?” I am often asked. “Long copy or short copy?”
 It’s a quandary for direct marketers much more so than for general marketers. Here’s why. There’s a widely held viewpoint that, on the Internet, the less copy the better. Web marketing experts tell us that the Internet is faster paced than the “snail mail” world, that attention spans are shorter, and long messages get zapped into oblivion with the click of the mouse. “Keep it short!” they extol in countless advisory e-zines.
 General advertisers, for the most part, also believe that when it comes to copy the shorter the better. Often their print ads have large pictures and only a handful of words. So they have no trouble embracing the “people don’t read” mentality that the Web marketing gurus say works best.
 But traditional direct marketers whose products are typically sold with long-copy direct-mail packages and self-mailers—newsletter publishers, seminar promoters, magazines, book clubs, insurance, audiocassettes, nutritional supplements—have a problem. It goes something like this:
 “In print, I have to use long copy to make the sale … or I just don’t get the order. We’ve tested short copy many times—who doesn’t want a

### cheaper mailing piece with less ink and paper? But it has never worked for our product. Now my Web marketing consultant says the e-mail should be just a few paragraphs. If a few paragraphs won’t convince people to buy offline, why should things be any different online?”
 And they are right. Just because a person buys online doesn’t change the persuasion process. If she needs the facts to make a decision, she needs them regardless of whether she is ordering from a paper mailing or from a Web site.
 Yet we also have a sense that the Web marketing gurus have at least a clue as to what they are talking about. We sense that our four-page sales letter, if sent word for word as a lengthy e-mail, wouldn’t work. People would click away long before they got to the end.
 I think I have some sensible guidelines to answer this puzzle. First, we need to quantify what we mean by “short” versus “long.”
 When a Web marketing guru talks about “short” e-mail, he probably means only three or four paragraphs. So when he says that long copy doesn’t work, by “long” he means e-mails of more than a few paragraphs.
 If I say “long copy does work,” I mean long compared to the typical e- mail—not compared to the typical direct-mail letter on paper. A “long” e- mail, which may fill several screens, is closer in length to a one-page letter —short by direct-mail standards—than to a four-page letter. And it doesn’t even come close to an eight-page letter.
 Second, we need to quantify how much shorter online copy is than offline. Should you translate your entire package, word for word? Should you compress it to half its length? Less?
 Kathy Henning, who writes extensively about online communication, says, “In general, online text should be half as long as printed text, maybe even shorter.” Not a precise formula, but a good starting point for estimation.
 Third, and most important, we need to remember that the copy for e- mail marketing campaigns is not wholly contained within the e-mail itself. It is really in two parts.
 The first half of the message is in the actual e-mail. The e-mail contains a link to a page on a Web site or server. When you click on that link, you

### jump to the page, where the remainder of the message is presented, along with the online order mechanism.
 In a traditional direct-mail package, the message is unevenly split. Consistently, 98 percent of the copy is in the letter and brochure, with the remaining 2 percent on the order form. In e-mail marketing campaigns, the division is less balanced and more varied.
 The diagram of an e-mail marketing mode on the next page shows the various ways the total copy can be divided between the e-mail and the response page. There are four options, as shown in fig. 13.1.

 1. Short e-mail, landing page (left upper quadrant)—Many marketers with simple lead-generating offers use short e-mails (the traditional three or four paragraphs) with a link to a “landing page.” A lead-generating landing page is a Web-based form, usually with a headline, a couple of paragraphs explaining the offer, and a mechanism for the recipient to fill in his information and submit his response. This format is similar in length and style to the traditional one-page sales letter and business reply card used in lead-generating paper direct mail.

### 2. Long e-mail, landing page (lower left quadrant)—This is similar except the e-mail, by Internet marketing standards, is “long.” For convenience, define a short e-mail as any e-mail that, when printed out, takes half a page or less. By comparison, any e-mail that takes more than a page when printed out is “long.” This format is similar in length and style to a one- to two-page letter.
 3. Long e-mail, microsite (lower right quadrant)—This format has a long e-mail and a long landing page. The microsite is a custom URL designed specifically for the offer. Unlike a landing page, which is usually a single screen, the microsite’s lengthier copy requires many screens. The microsite can be broken into distinct pages or it can be one continuous document through which the reader must scroll (see www.surefirecustomerservicetechniques.com). This long e-mail/microsite format allows for maximum copy and is ideal for translating lengthy mailings, such as magalogs (long-copy self-mailers that look like magazines), to the Web.

-----

### 4. Short e-mail, microsite (upper right quadrant)—This format combines a short e-mail up front with a long-copy microsite on the back end. It is ideal for offers that require a lot of copy but are being transmitted to prospects who might not read a lengthy e-mail.

 The bottom line: e-mail marketing can work without having e-mails competing with War and Peace in word count. By strategically splitting your copy between the front-end e-mail and back-end response page, you can get your message across without having time-pressured e-mail recipients fleeing in terror.

 WRITING AN ONLINE CONVERSION E-MAIL SERIES

 “Online conversion” is a proven model for building an e-list of prospects and profitably marketing products on the Internet. Here’s an oversimplified version of how online conversion works:

 1. You create some free content. 2. You offer people the free content online. 3. When they accept, you then sell them products and services they have
 to pay for—again, online.

 Let’s break down each step, starting with the creation of free content. This is the easiest step. Just repackage some of your content as an information premium. The content does not have to be long. Repurposing existing articles works fine for this purpose. So do special reports specifically written for the online conversion campaign. Or the same reports you offer as premiums in postal direct marketing.
 The premium is typically offered as a “free special report.” It is usually available as a downloadable PDF file. Some marketers prefer to post the report as a multipage HTML document on the Web.
 The second step is to collect e-mail addresses of prospects by offering them the free content online. There are many ways to attract potential

-----

### customers to a Web page where they can download your free content. One way is to send e-mails to lists of prospects. The e-mail offers the content as a “free special report.” To get the free report, the recipient clicks on an embedded URL in the message text.
 If the content is a downloadable PDF file, the recipient is brought to a short transaction page. She enters her e-mail address, and is then allowed to download and print the PDF file.
 If the content is a series of sequential HTML pages, the recipient is again brought to a short transaction page. She enters her e-mail address, clicks SUBMIT, and is brought to the first page of the microsite where the report is available to read as a posted HTML document.
 Within the HTML report, put a number of links to a landing page or transaction page for your paid product. Many readers may click on these links and order your paid product while they are in the middle of reading your free bonus report online.
 Either way, the reader must give us her e-mail address to read the free report, which is the key to the online conversion method.
 There are many other methods you can use to generate leads for your online conversion campaign. Some marketers have had great success with postcards. Others have used banners or online ads in e-zines.
 Finally, you need to convert the leads to paid customers. So far, two things have happened. First, we have captured the prospect’s e-mail address, so we can market to her as often as we like at virtually no cost. And second, we know that the prospect is interested in the topic of our content, because she at least requested a free article or report on it.
 Since the content was free, we do not know at this point whether she will pay for products related to this topic. But she is a qualified lead in the sense that she is (a) interested in the topic and (b) responds to online marketing.
 The next step is to send her a series of e-mails, known as the online conversion series, with the objective of converting her from a requester of free content to a buyer of our paid product.
 Experience so far shows that our online conversion series works best with between three and seven efforts.

### Some marketers want every e-mail in the series to attempt to make a sale. That is, they all have a URL the reader can click to reach a page from which the product may be ordered.
 Others like the first two e-mails to be simply goodwill, promoting the value of the information and encouraging the reader to actually read the free content—and in some cases even giving her more free content. These are called “free touch” e-mails, because they touch the reader without asking her to purchase.
 Subsequent e-mails in the series ask for the order; these are called “conversion e-mails.” In a seven-effort series, the first one or two e-mails might be free touch; the remainder, conversion e-mails.
 When the reader clicks on the URL link in your e-mail, she may go to either a landing page or a transaction page. A landing page has a fair amount of descriptive copy about the product you are selling and your offer. It does a strong job of selling the reader on the value of the product. A transaction page has minimal description of the product. It is basically an online order form.
 Some marketers always send the e-mail recipient who clicks on the link in the e-mail to the landing page, on the theory that the more sales copy, the more sales made. Other marketers believe that if the conversion e-mail is long and has a lot of sales copy, there is no need to repeat this in a landing page, and so they just send the prospect to a short transaction page.
 The best offer for an online conversion effort is a free 30-day trial of the product. If you can set up your site so that the recipient’s credit card is not billed until after the 30-day trial period, that’s the best choice. Then you are truly offering a free trial.
 By comparison, if you charge recipients’ credit cards as soon as they submit their orders, it is not really a free 30-day trial; it is a risk-free 30-day trial. The recipients are paying, but if they cancel within 30 days they get a refund.
 You can experiment with timing, number of efforts, and mix of efforts (free touch and online conversion) in your online conversion series. A typical series might go like this:

-----

_Day 1—e-mail #1, free touch. Thank the prospect for requesting your free content and_
reinforce its value.

_Day 2—e-mail #2, free touch. Encourage the prospect to read the free content and highlight its_
value. Point out some especially good ideas, tips, or strategies it contains.

_Day 4—e-mail #3, online conversion. Tell the prospect he can get of a free 30-day trial of your_
product. Sell him on the product and its value.

_Day 7—e-mail #4. Remind the prospect that he can still solve his problem by getting your_
product and accepting your free trial offer.

_Day 14—e-mail #5. Tell the prospect the free 30-day trial is expiring, resell him on the product_
you are offering, and urge him to act today. Tell him after that, it’s too late.
