##### Many magazines use a variation of this technique in their articles. They start an article not with a very short sentence but maybe with very large type. Once they have you sucked into reading the copy and you turn the page to read the rest of the article, you notice that the typeface has gotten smaller. But that’s okay. The purpose of the large type was to get you into the article and it worked. Now it’s up to the author to keep you reading and turning the pages.
 In an advertisement, you’ve got a lot going against you unless the readers are genuinely interested in your product. And if they are, then you’ve got to really grab and keep them. So your first sentence should be very compelling by virtue of its short length and ease of reading. No long multisyllabic words. Keep it short, sweet and almost incomplete so that the reader has to read the next sentence.
 If all the elements are designed to get you to read the first sentence in an ad, then what is the purpose of the first sentence? If you guessed that it is to “convey a benefit or explain a feature,” that would be impossible. How could a short first sentence do anything more than get you to read it? The correct answer is, of course, “The purpose of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence.” Nothing more, nothing less. You probably figured this one out already anyway.

# The Purpose of the Next Sentence

##### Now if you’re starting to get a feel for my approach to copywriting and I asked you what the purpose of the second sentence is and you answered, “To get you to read the third sentence,” you would be absolutely correct. And for those of you who missed that last answer and I asked you what the purpose of the third sentence was and you answered, “To get you to read the fourth sentence,” congratulations. I think you’ve got it.
 Was there any mention of benefits? Or product description? Or unique features? Of course not. The only purpose of those first few sentences in an advertisement is to get you to read the following sentences. True, you may at one point have to start talking about product features or benefits, but if you lose sight of the fact that your sole purpose at the beginning of an ad is to hold that reader’s attention at almost any cost, then you may lose your reader for lack of interest. Therefore we have the third axiom:

 Axiom 3

**_The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second_**
**_sentence._**

##### Just compare the situation in our ad example with a salesperson selling somebody face-to-face. If the first few minutes of the sales presentation put the prospective customer to sleep or if the customer stops hearing the presentation and walks away, that salesperson has lost everything. So in copywriting as in selling, if your reader is not riveted to every word you write in the first few sentences, then your chances of having that reader get to the real sales pitch are very remote.
 My most successful ads have followed this format, with very few exceptions. What about making the sales pitch at the beginning of an ad? This is certainly possible, of course, but then it is often not very effective. I’ve tried putting the sales message at the beginning of an ad. I’ve tried using every trick in the book to prove my theory wrong and have failed at each attempt. Just remember that the sole purpose of all the elements of an ad is to get you to read the first sentence. Make that first sentence so easy to read that your reader is almost compelled to read it. If you grasp this,

 Creating the Perfect Buying
 Environment

##### Besides holding the reader’s attention, there is another important function we are trying to accomplish in the first paragraphs of an advertisement and that is to create a buying environment. Let me cite an example.
 Picture this. You’re a salesperson and you need to sell a prospect. You’ve been given a choice of five environments in which to meet the prospect, and you must pick one.
 The product you are selling is very expensive and you’ll need at least one hour to explain and properly sell the product. The choices you have are:
 1. At noon at a very fancy restaurant near the prospect’s office. 2. After lunch in the boardroom at the offices of the prospect. 3. After work at the prospect’s health club while working out with him. 4. In the evening with the prospect at his home while the prospect babysits his three children. 5. Any of the four above might be an acceptable choice. The correct answer is 5. Why? Because the correct answer to the question “Which is the best location?” is simply “in the best selling environment for what you have to sell.”
 If the product is a piece of exercise equipment, the health club might be perfect. If the product has something to do with parents and children, at home with the prospect and his children in the evening might be the perfect environment.
 Now if the correct answer for the salesperson is “in the environment best suited for the selling activity,” is it true in print advertising, too? Yes, but let me cite another example before we discuss print advertising environments.

# The Honolulu Experience

##### I was in Honolulu after a trip to the Far East. I usually stop at Honolulu to recover after traveling so long and so far and over so many time zones. As I was walking down one of the main streets in Waikiki, I stopped to look into an art gallery and saw a painting of scenes from outer space.
 Since JS&A was known for selling space-age products, I thought that the painting would fit very nicely in my office. I walked into the gallery noticing how very elegant it looked and saw the paintings neatly displayed on the wall. The gallery looked like it sold expensive paintings. In short, I expected the prices to be high.
 It didn’t take too long before a well-dressed saleswoman noticed me, walked over and asked if I needed assistance. “Beautiful painting, isn’t it?” she asked.
 “Very nice,” I nodded. “It really looks great.” At that point the lady said, “Please follow me,” as she lifted the painting off the wall and walked toward the back of the large gallery. I followed.
 We entered a large room, carpeted from floor to ceiling. In the middle of the room were three very comfortable easy chairs all facing the front of the room where the saleslady mounted the painting on the wall. She then went back to the entrance of the room, turned up the classical music being piped in through loudspeakers and dimmed the lights, leaving two spotlights focused on the painting.

# Painting Looked Incredible

##### I must admit that the painting looked incredible. The vibrant colors, the quality of the art, and the nice feeling I experienced from hearing the classical music put me in such a buying mood that I was ready to reach into my pocket and pull out my credit card and buy the $2,000 painting.
 That lady and that gallery had put me in such a focused buying mood by creating the perfect environment for selling me that painting that I almost bought it right then and there. By the way, I eventually sponsored the artist, Mark Rickerson, and sold his paintings and prints through JS&A. I personally ended up with 50 of his paintings.
 Once you realize the importance of setting up a buying environment, you’ll know that it must be done in the early stages of an advertisement. When you establish the reading momentum at the start of an ad, you also want to start establishing the buying environment as well. The saleslady first had to get me into the store and then slowly get me in that room to put me in the ideal buying mood. If this all sounds hard to do in print, it really isn’t. You’ll see examples later of how to establish the buying environment as you establish the momentum.

 Your copy has to put the prospect into a relaxed buying environment.

 Since you are creating your own environment in a print ad, you have total control over its appearance. Common sense will dictate the rest.
 For example, if I was selling products at a discount, I would use big type for my prices and lots of busy graphic elements. In short, I would make the ad look like a typical discount ad. And conversely, if I was selling

##### something expensive, I would present myself in an environment that showed class and refinement—that exuded confidence and trust.
 Unlike the salesperson who may or may not be able to create the ideal selling environment, you can create your own. And unlike the salesperson who sometimes can’t control the environment, you can.
 So for selling products through Battram Galleries, the collectibles company I formed, my graphic and copy approach was upscale and conservative—just what you’d expect from an expensive gallery. However, when I presented my Consumers Hero concept, a club that sold refurbished bargains, it had a totally different environment—one that was clearly bargain-oriented.
 The JS&A ads all had a uniform, well-organized format that seemed to be the perfect environment for all my space-age electronic products. I rarely deviated from it, but when I did, it was to create a better environment for a specific product I was selling.
 You wouldn’t expect to buy an expensive painting from an Army surplus store and you wouldn’t expect to find much of a bargain at Tiffany’s.

# You Control the Environment

##### As a writer of direct marketing, you have control over the environment. The environment you choose is created in both the graphic elements and the copy, but especially the copy—by the way you phrase your words, the choice of words and the level of integrity you convey.
 Unlike a store where you spend thousands of dollars to create an environment, you can do it all simply in the copy of your ad or the look of your web site.
 The environment is critical in getting a prospective customer into the buying mood. And to create that environment, you attract the customer’s attention (the headline, photos, logo, etc.) and then you’ve got to get the person to read the first sentence by making it so simple and so compelling that the reader cannot help but read it. And the next sentence and then the next.
 And while the reader is reading, you are creating an environment just as surely as that art gallery was drawing me into that back room. So now we are ready for the fourth axiom.

 Axiom 4

**_Your ad layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying_**
**_environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service._**

##### Creating the ideal buying environment comes from experience and the specific knowledge you get from studying your product and potential customer. It comes from understanding the nature of your product or service. Greater understanding will come as you read this book. But for now, realize how important creating the buying environment is to eventually selling your product.
 To understand how we get the reader not only to read, but to feel comfortable and be in a buying mood in that environment, let’s take time out for a little lesson on personal sales ability in general, in the next chapter.

 Resonating with the Reader

##### When I was only 20 years old, my father sent me to New York City to run the branch office of his printing equipment company, Consolidated International. He was having financial difficulties and I was happy to help him out after my first two years in college. I dropped out of college, and while in New York I took an interest in salesmanship. I knew that he expected me to eventually help him sell his equipment, so I set out to prepare myself.
 I went to bookstores and bought everything I could on selling. I read every book available at the public library—all to become an expert in salesmanship. And during that year in New York I would stroll down Broadway and visit small auction shops located right on Times Square.

# Wonderful Sales Technique

##### These small auction shops would prey on unsuspecting observers by appealing to their greed. The shop’s proprietor would auction off what appeared to be terrific bargains, hook one of the prospective bidders in the audience and create a buying frenzy that plenty of the onlookers would get sucked into. The bidders ended up buying junk that wasn’t much of a bargain. The sales techniques were wonderful to watch and I spent hours just observing them and human nature.
 Then I would go back to my small apartment and read more books on selling. It wasn’t easy for a young, inexperienced 20-year-old to sell expensive and complicated printing equipment. I thought that if I could become an expert on selling in general and printing equipment in particular and then, through experience, pick up specific knowledge about selling the equipment, I could be an effective salesman for my dad.
 Selling was something I was suited for. In the preference tests I took in high school, my highest score was in a category called “persuasion” and another high score was in “literary.” My career in advertising could have been predicted even back in high school, for when you think about it, print advertising is nothing more than “literary persuasion.”
 Some of the significant lessons I learned in New York were the steps in selling a prospect, which also apply to selling in print advertising. Let me review the procedure.
 The first thing you do in selling is to set up the selling environment. Whether it be a private room in a gallery or a car dealer’s showroom, you configure the physical environment to be your selling environment.
 Next, you have to get the attention of the prospect. That certainly makes sense and is related to the headline of a print ad.
 Once you have the prospect’s attention, the next step is to introduce yourself and say something that will keep the attention of the prospect. This is similar to the subheadline and the photos and captions. Then comes the sales pitch or the copy in a print ad.
 During this activity, the seller has two thoughts in mind. The first is that the buyer must like and develop confidence in the seller. The buyer must believe that the seller knows the product. Second, the seller must somehow

##### relate the product to the buyer and the buyer’s needs. That’s clear. But the buyer and the seller must vibrate together. There must be a harmony struck between the buyer and seller, or the persuasive sales message won’t come through.
 There are many methods for creating this harmony and two of the most important apply very directly to space advertising. First, you’ve got to get the prospective reader to start saying yes. Second, you’ve got to make statements that are both honest and believable. Let’s cite an example. A car salesman says, “Nice day, Mr. Jones.” Mr. Jones then answers, “Yes.” (It is a nice day, the statement is truthful and the customer answers in the affirmative.) “I see, Mr. Jones, that you keep your car very clean.” “Yes, I do.” (At this point, the salesman has Mr. Jones saying yes and nodding his head.)

 Get the customer to nod in the affirmative and agree with you.

 “I see, Mr. Jones, that since you now own a Buick and we sell Buicks, you probably could use a new one?” “Yes.” (The salesman asks a rather obvious question and Mr. Jones, nodding, replies in the affirmative.)
 “May I show you one of our latest models with improvements over the model you currently own?” “Yes.” (The salesman once again says the obvious to get a yes answer, and the harmony continues.)

 Get your reader to say “Yes.”

-----

##### In short, you try to get the customer to nod his or her head in the affirmative and agree with you, or at least you make truthful statements that the prospect knows are correct and would concur with. Make sure that the prospect does not disagree with something you’re saying. If for example the salesman said, “Could you use a new Buick?” and the customer said “No,” the sale would have taken a bad turn right there and the harmony would have been lost. In a print ad, the reader would have stopped reading and turned the page.
