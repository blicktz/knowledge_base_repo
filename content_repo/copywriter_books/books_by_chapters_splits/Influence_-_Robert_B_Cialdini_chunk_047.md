**Figure 7.3: Just sign on the plotted line.**
**Author’s note: Have you ever wondered what the groups that ask you to sign their petitions do with**
all the signatures they obtain? Most of the time, the groups use them for genuinely stated purposes,
but often they don’t do anything with them, as the principal purpose of the petition may simply be to
get the signers committed to the group’s position and, consequently, more willing to take future steps
that are aligned with it.

Psychology professor Sue Frantz described witnessing a sinister version of the tactic on the
streets of Paris, where tourists are approached by a scammer and asked to sign a petition “to support
people who are deaf and mute.” Those who sign are then immediately asked to make a donation,
which many do to stay consistent with the cause they’ve just endorsed. Because the operation is a
scam, no donation goes to charity—only to the scammer. Worse, an accomplice of the petitioner
observes where, in their pockets or bags, the tourists reach for their wallets and targets them for
subsequent pickpocket theft.

#### Freedman and Fraser’s findings tell us to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests because that agreement can influence our self-concepts. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests but also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little favor we did earlier. It’s this second kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me.
 It scares me enough that I am rarely willing to sign a petition anymore, even for a position I support. The action has the potential to influence not only my future behavior but also my self-image in ways I may not want. Further, once a person’s self-image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit the new image.
 Who among Freedman and Fraser’s homeowners would have thought the “volunteer worker” who asked them to sign a state-beautification petition was really interested in having them display a safe-driving billboard two weeks later? Who among them could have suspected their decision to display the billboard was largely a result of signing that petition? No one, I’d guess. If there were any regrets after the billboard went up, who could they conceivably hold responsible but themselves and their own damnably strong civic spirits? They probably never considered the guy with the “keeping California beautiful” petition and all that knowledge of social jujitsu.[4]
