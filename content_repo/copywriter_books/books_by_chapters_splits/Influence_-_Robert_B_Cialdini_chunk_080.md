Other kinds of cognitive confusions also seem to be due to the brain’s use of the same structures
and mechanisms for distinct undertakings (Anderson, 2014). For example, the tendency of
individuals who repeatedly imagine doing something then coming to believe that they have actually
done it can be partially explained by research showing that performing an action and imagining
performing it involve some of the same brain components (Jabbi, Bastiaansen, & Keysers, 2008;
Oosterhof, Tipper, & Downing, 2012). In another illustration, the hurt of social rejection is
experienced in the same brain regions as physical pain, which allows Tylenol to reduce the
discomfort of both (DeWall et al., 2010).
3. Shayo (2020) provides a thoroughgoing presentation of the evidence that shared identities
within in-groups are consistently linked to favorability toward and conformity with fellow members.
The study showing team members’ outsized favorability toward the robots on their team was done by
Fraune (2020). Clark et al. (2019) offer strong support for their claim that “Tribalism is human
nature,” as does Greene (2014); and, along with Greene, Tomasello (2020) argues that human groups
have sought to fortify such tribalism by making it a moral duty.
4. Not surprisingly, supporters of Joe Girard have challenged Ali Reda’s claim to superior sales
production. However, Mr. Reda’s sales manager, who has access to dealership records, stands by the
claims. Informative articles on the similarities and differences between Girard and Reda can be found
at www.autonews.com/article/20180225/RETAIL/180229862/who-s-the-world-s-best-car-salesman
and www.foxnews.com/auto/the-worlds-best-car-salesman-broke-a-44-year-old-record-andsomeones-not-too-pleased. Scientific research confirms the favorable impact of shared “we”-ness on
sales outcomes: prospects were significantly more willing to accept a sales appeal to join a personaltraining program if they and their future trainer had been born in the same community. Similarly, a
sales appeal for a package of dental services was more successful if prospects learned that they had
the same birthplace as the dentist they would see (Jiang et al., 2010).
5. Dimmock, Gerken, & Graham (2018) did the work demonstrating that financial advisors
became more likely to commit financial misconduct if, in their offices, they had contact with a fellow
advisor of the same ethnicity who had done so. The study of auditors’ financial misstatements was
done by Du (2019). Fisman, Paravisini, & Vig (2017) analyzed the effects of Indian loan officeapplicant religious similarities on loan approvals, terms, and repayments. Customers’ greater
willingness to forgive a service error if they shared the service provider’s last name was observed by
Wan & Wyer (2019). In the Polish study using “lost” letters (Dolińska, Jarząbek, & Doliński, 2020),
the letters were dropped around a mid-sized city at one hundred sites, including bus stops, shopping
malls, cash machines, and sidewalks that were at least 250 meters from the nearest visible mailbox.
Kristin Michelitch (2015) performed the taxi fare–bargaining study in locations around a centrally
located market in the city of Accra.

6. The report summarizing the science of “blue” lies (Smith, 2017) appeared in Scientific American
_Online:_ https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/how-the-science-of-blue-lies-may-explaintrumps-support; in a similar finding, people were willing to follow the norms of a group, even when
they knew the norms to be unconnected to reality, provided they felt a strong shared identity with the
group (Pryor, Perfors, & Howe, 2019). The research showing that highly identified political-party
members are willing to hide the tax fraud of a fellow member (Ashokkumar, Galaif, & Swann, 2019),
delude themselves regarding their party’s superior contributions to community welfare (Blanco,
Gómez-Fortes, & Matute, 2018), prioritize the medical treatment of same-party individuals (Furn
ham, 1966), and accept the judgments of poorly skilled same-party followers (Marks et al., 2019) fits
with emerging scholarship indicating that political-party adherents base many of their political
decisions less on ideology than on loyalties to such identity-defining parties and their members
(Achen & Bartels, 2017; Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012; Jenke & Huettel, 2020; Kalmoe, 2019;
Schmitt et al., 2019). This view of mornality as based in in-group loyalties has become a central
feature of modern political persuasion efforts (Buttrick, Molder, & Oishi, 2020). Ellemers & van
Nunspeet (2020) provide an instructive summary of the neuropsychological mechanisms through
which such in-group biases emerge.

Political parties are hardly the only “we”-based frameworks in which members are willing to
conceal the wrongdoings of their partners. When questioned, people (1) expressed a strong bias
against reporting to police the harmful action of a close other, such as a good friend or family
member; (2) were particularly unwilling to make such a report when the harmful action was severe
versus minor (e.g., burglary or physical sexual harassment versus illegal music downloading or
staring-based sexual harassment); and (3) admitted the reason for this reluctance was to protect their
_own reputations (Weidman et al., 2020; see also Hildreth & Anderson, 2018, and Waytz, Dungan, &_
Young, 2013). Once again, we see that the “we” implicates the “me.”
7. Biased calls by international football (soccer), Major League Baseball, and National Basketball
Association officiators were uncovered in research by, in turn, Pope & Pope (2015), Parsons et al.
(2011), and Price & Wolfers (2010). The Asimov (1975) quote appeared in a _TV Guide magazine_
article, in which he commented on the over-the-top bias of each US state for its candidate in the Miss
America pageant of that year.
8. For research documenting declines in the health of romantic partners if ongoing problems are
not resolved, see Shrout et al. (2019). Women’s health complications stemmed mainly from the
amount of time that relationship disagreements remained unresolved; whereas, for men, it was the
sheer number of unsettled disagreements. For both sexes, the impact on health could be seen for as
long as sixteen years. The partnership-raising study, one of my all-time favorites, was done by Oriña,
Wood, & Simpson (2002). For a full examination of the grounds for my assertion that “the thing most
likely to guide a person’s behavioral decisions . . . is the one most prominent in consciousness at the
time of decision,” see Cialdini (2016).
9. The study showing the link between friends’ levels of physical activity (Priebe & Spink, 2011)
also found that participants underestimated their friends’ influence on their activity production,
mistakenly assigning greater influence to factors associated with health and personal appearance.
Bond et al. (2012) conducted the Facebook voter-mobilization study. The study of best friends’
potent impact on college student’s drinking demonstrated this effect for both White students and
Native American students (Hagler et al., 2017). In general, friends see and actually possess higher
levels of genetic overlap with one another than with nonfriends (Cunningham, 1986; Christakis &
Fowler, 2014; Daly, Salmon, & Wilson, 1997).
10. Norscia & Palagi (2011) collected the data revealing the proportional relationship between
human contagious yawning and the degree of personal connection between the yawners; they found
the same relationship when the yawns were transmitted only acoustically (Norscia et al., 2020).
Demonstrations of contagious yawning intensified by social bonds in chimpanzees, baboons,
bonobos, and wolves are provided by Campbell & de Waal (2011), Palagi et al. (2009), Demuru &

-----

Palagi (2012), and Romero et al. (2014), respectively. Romero, Konno, & Hasegawa (2013)
performed the experiment on cross-species contagious yawning.

Cat lovers, don’t despair. That I haven’t provided data showing contagious yawning between
feline pets and their owners may not mean the effect doesn’t exist. The lack of evidence might just
come from the fact that researchers haven’t yet tested the possibility—probably because it’s difficult
to get cats to stay still and focused long enough. Nonetheless, anyone who really wants to believe can
take heart from this article: https://docandphoebe.com/blogs/the-catvocate-blog/why-do-animalsyawn.
11. Aside from business, politics, sports, and personal relationships, other important domains of
human interaction show prejudicial effects of “we”-group identity, with equally striking levels of
bias. In health, infant mortality at birth drops significantly when the attending physician is of the
same race as that of the newborn (Greenwood et al., 2020). Within law enforcement, traffic stops by
Boston police were less likely to result in a search of the driver’s vehicle if the officer and the driver
were of similar race (Antonovics & Knight, 2009). In Israeli small-claims courts, Arab and Israeli
judges’ decisions robustly favored members of their own ethnic group (Shayo & Zussman, 2011).
Within education, teachers’ grading practices show comparable effects: a teacher–student match on
race, religion, gender, ethnicity, or nationality increases student class evaluations and examination
grades (Dee, 2005). Particularly plain evidence of the favoritism comes from a study at a Dutch
university (Maastricht) located near the border with Germany, which possesses large populations of
students and teachers from both the Netherlands and Germany. When students’ examination papers
were randomly assigned to be graded by teachers with similar or dissimilar nationalities, higher
scores were assigned to students with names that matched the grader’s nationality (Feld, Salamanca,
& Hamermesh, 2015).
12. The mainstay of evolutionary thinking—that individuals do not so much attempt to ensure their
own survival as the survival of copies of their genes—flows from the concept of “inclusive fitness,”
initially specified by W. D. Hamilton (1964), which has continued to receive support against multiple
challengers (Kay, Keller, & Lehmann, 2020). Evidence for the particularly strong pull of kinship in
life-or-death situations is available in Borgida, Conner, & Mamteufal (1992), Burnstein, Crandall, &
Kitayama (1994), and Chagnon & Bugos (1979). Furthermore, the closer the relative is in terms of
genetic overlap (e.g., parent or sibling versus uncle or cousin), the greater the feelings of self–other
overlap (Tan et al., 2015). Telzer et al. (2010) obtained the finding that teenagers experience brainsystem rewards after helping family. Reviews of the impressively wrought “fictive families” research
can be found in Swann & Buhrmester (2015) and Fredman et al. (2015); additional research offers an
explanation for these group-advancing effects: making a group identity prominent in consciousness
causes individuals to focus their attention intently on information that fits with that identity (Coleman
& Williams, 2015), which causes them, in turn, to see that information as more important. A study by
Elliot & Thrash (2004) showed that the almost-total amount of parents’ support of their kids in my
class was no fluke. These researchers offered a point of extra credit in a psychology class to students
whose parents answered a questionnaire with forty-seven items; 96 percent of the questionnaires
were returned completed. Joel Stein’s “Mama Ann” column can be read it its entirety at
http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1830395,00.html. Preston (2013) provides a
detailed analysis of offspring nurturance as the basis for much wider forms of helping.

Although biologists, economists, anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists know it from
their studies, one doesn’t have to be a scientist to recognize the enormous pull that offspring have on
their parents. For example, novelists have frequently depicted the strong emotional force of the pull.
A story is told of a bet made by the novelist Ernest Hemingway, who was renowned for the emotive
power his prose was able to create despite its spareness. While drinking in a bar with one of his
editors, Hemingway wagered that in just six words, he could write an entire dramatic story that
anyone would understand completely and experience deeply. If, after reading the story, the editor
agreed, he would buy drinks for the house; if not, Hemingway would pay. With the terms set,

-----

Hemingway wrote the six words on the back of a drink napkin and showed them to the man, who
then quietly rose, went to the bar, and bought a round of drinks for all present. The words were “For
sale. Baby shoes. Never used.”
13. A copy of Buffett’s fiftieth-anniversary letter is available online at
www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf as part of Berkshire Hathaway’s 2014 Annual
Report, which appeared in February of 2015. For an instructive treatment of how the messenger can
become the message, see Martin and Marks’s (2019) highly readable book on the topic. Both inside
and outside family boundaries, people use similarities to judge genetic overlap and to favor those
high on the dimension (DeBruine, 2002, 2004; Hehman, Flake, & Freeman, 2018; Kaminski et al.,
2010). Data supporting the phenomena of family members being more helpful toward and feeling
more close to those who resemble them come from research by Leek & Smith (1989, 1991) and
Heijkoop, Dubas, & van Aken (2009), respectively. The evidence that manipulated physical
similarity influences votes was collected by Bailenson et al. (2008).
14. People use attitudinal similarities as a basis for assessing genetic relatedness and, consequently,
as a basis for forming in-groups, which in turn affects their decisions about whom to help (Grey et
al., 2014; Park & Schaller, 2005). That political and religious attitudes are most likely to be passed on
through heredity and, therefore, to reflect the genetic “we” is well documented (Bouchard et al.,
2003; Chambers, Schlenker, & Collisson, 2013; Hatemi & McDermott, 2012; Hufer et al., 2020;
Kandler, Bleidorn, & Riemann, 2012; Lewis & Bates, 2010). These types of attitudes are also highly
resistant to change (Bourgeois, 2002; Tesser, 1993).
15. A good review of the cues humans (and nonhumans) use to identify kinship was done by Park,
Schaller, & Van Vugt (2008); one of those cues is commonality of residence (Lieberman & Smith,
2012). Strong evidence for the impact of coresidence and parents’ observed care on their children’s
subsequent altruism can be found in Cosmides & Tooby (2013) and Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides
(2007). As regards Chiune Sugihara, it is always risky to generalize from a single case to a broader
conclusion, even one bolstered by Mother Teresa’s account of her home environment. In this
instance, however, we know he was not the only notable rescuer of the era whose early home life
incorporated human diversity. Oliner & Oliner (1988) found such a history in a sizable sample of
European Gentiles who harbored Jews from the Nazis. And as would be expected, while growing up,
rescuers in Oliner & Oliner’s sample felt a sense of commonality with a more varied group of people
than did an otherwise comparable sample of nonrescuers at the time. Not only was this expanded
sense of “we”-ness related to their subsequent decisions to aid people different from themselves
during the Holocaust; when interviewed a half-century later, rescuers were still helping a greater
variety of people and causes (Midlarsky & Nemeroff, 1995; Oliner & Oliner, 1988).

More recently, researchers have developed a personality scale assessing the degree to which an
individual spontaneously identifies with all humanity. This important scale, which includes measures
of the frequency of use of the pronoun _we, the conception of others as_ _family, and the perceived_
extent of self–other overlap with people in general, predicts willingness to help the needy in other
countries by contributing to international humanitarian relief efforts (McFarland, Webb, & Brown,
2012; McFarland, 2017). Information on the situational and personal factors leading to Sugihara’s
helping action in the pre–World War II environment comes from histories of the circumstances in
Japan and Europe at the time (Kranzler, 1976; Levine, 1997; Tokayer & Swartz, 1979) and from
interviews with Sugihara (Craig, 1985; Watanabe, 1994).
16. Cohen’s (1972) description of the concentration-camp incident came from a conversation with a
former Nazi guard there who, in a bizarre association, was Cohen’s roommate at the time he relayed
the story. It’s estimated that the people of Le Chambon, led by André Trocmé and his wife, Magda,
saved the lives of 3,500 people. As to the question of why he decided to help the first of those
individuals—a Jewish woman he found freezing outside his home in December of 1940—it is
difficult to answer with certainty. But when in custody near the end of the war and Vichy officials
demanded the names of Jews he and his fellow residents had assisted, his response could easily have

-----

come straight from the mouth (but, more fundamentally, the heart and worldview) of Chiune
Sugihara: “We do not know what a Jew is. We only know human beings” (Trocmé, 2007/1971). As
regards the question of whether his relatives or neighbors were the more likely to accede to Trocmé’s
requests, evidence from other sources indicates that it would have been the former—individuals for
whom certainty of kinship would be stronger (Curry, Roberts, & Dunbar, 2013; Rachlin & Jones,
2008). For example, when, during the Rwandan genocide of the mid-1990s, attacks against Tutsis by
Hutus included neighbors, those agitating for the attacks did so on the basis of tribal membership;
“Hutu Power” was both a rallying cry and a justification for the slaughter.

The statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the Obama local-field-office plan was performed by
Masket (2009). For an overview of how Obama strategists employed other insights from behavioral
science throughout the campaign, see Issenberg (2012). The finding that people are especially
susceptible to local voices (e.g., Agerström et al., 2016) has been termed “the local dominance
effect” (Zell & Alike, 2010) that, when translated into electoral politics, means citizens are more
likely to comply with the voter-turnout requests of members of their own communities (Nickerson &
Feller, 2008). By the way, this last recognition didn’t emerge from an arm’s-length reading of the
behavioral-science literature; David Nickerson was embedded as a behavioral-science advisor within
the Obama campaign.
