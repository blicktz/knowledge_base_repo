“We often got a great deal of confusion when we tried to answer the question, ‘So what do you do?’
We were regularly frustrated by the fact that we had a huge body of organizational knowledge about
our own work, and it required at least an hour to convey it to people. As a start-up, nonprofit
organization, our revenue (donations) were barely enough to keep us afloat. We knew a big reason for
this was that our model was a bit complex and it didn’t get communicated with clarity, leaving
potential donors confused. We took a big risk and chose to send our entire US team (three people) to
StoryBrand—a risk that ate up a significant cut of our cash on hand. StoryBrand was indispensable
for us. In the days following StoryBrand, we made a hard pivot on our communications strategy.
Over the course of a couple of months, we went from an organization on the verge of collapse to an
organization that was thriving. In Q4 alone (post-StoryBrand), we literally tripled our annual
revenue. Now Mavuno has expanded its reach by 400 percent in eastern Congo, and we are ending
extreme poverty for thousands of Congolese. We are making dramatic change for some of the most
vulnerable people in one of the world’s most war-torn environments. We are postured for enormous
scale, and that is due in large part to StoryBrand. Thank you for helping us change the world.”
