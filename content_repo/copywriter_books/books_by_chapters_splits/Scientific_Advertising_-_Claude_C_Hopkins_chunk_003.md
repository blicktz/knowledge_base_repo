A department store advertised at one Easter time a $1,000 hat, and the floor
could not hold the women who came to see it. We often employ this factor in
psychology. Perhaps we are advertising a valuable formula. To merely say that would not
be impressive. So we state — as a fact — that we paid $100,000 for that formula. That
statement when tried has won a wealth of respect.

Many articles are sold under guarantee — so commonly sold that guarantees have
ceased to be impressive. But one concern made a fortune by offering a dealers signed
warrant. The dealer to whom one paid his money agreed in writing to pay it back if
asked. Instead of a far-away stranger, a neighbor gave the warrant. The results have led
many to try that plan, and it has always proved effective.

Many have advertised, “Try it for a week. If you don’t like it we’ll return your
money. Then someone conceived the idea of sending goods without any money down,
and saying, “Pay in a week if you like them.” That proved many times more impressive.

-----

One great advertising man stated the difference this way: “Two men came to me,
each offering me a horse. Both made equal claims. They were good horses, kind and
gentle. A child could drive them. One man said, “Try the horse for a week. If my claims
are not true, come back for your money.” The other man also said, “Try the horse for a
week.” But he added, “Come and pay me then.” I naturally bought the second man’s
horse.”

Now countless things — cigars, typewriters, washing machines, books, etc. — are
sent out in this way on approval. And we find that people are honest. The losses are very
small.

An advertiser offered a set of books to business men. The advertising was
unprofitable, so he consulted another expert. The ads were impressive. The offer seemed
attractive, “But,” said the second man, “let us add one little touch which I have found
effective. Let us offer to put the buyers name in gilt lettering on each book.” That was
done, and with scarcely another change in the ads they sold some hundreds of thousands
of books. Through some peculiar kink in human psychology it was found that names in
gilt gave much added value to the books.

Many send out small gifts, like memorandum books, to customers and prospects.
They get very small results. One man sent out a letter to the effect that he had a leathercovered book with a man’s name on it. It was waiting on him and would be sent on
request. The form of request was enclosed, and it also asked for certain information.
That information indicated lines on which a man might be sold.

Nearly all men, it was found, filled out that request and supplied the information.
When a man knows that something belongs to them — something with his name on —
he will make an effort to get it, even though the thing is a trifle.

In the same way it is found that an offer limited to a certain class of people is far
more effective than a general offer. For instance, an offer limited to veterans of the war.
Or to members of a lodge or sect. Or to executives. Those who are entitled to any
seeming advantage will go a long way not to lose that advantage.

An advertiser suffered much from substitution. He said, “Look out for
substitutes,” “Be sure you get this brand,” etc., with no effect. Those were selfish
appeals. Then he said, “Try our rivals’ too” — said it in his headlines. He invited
comparisons and showed that he did not fear them. That corrected the situation. Buyers
were careful to get the brand so conspicuously superior that its maker could court a trial
of the rest.

-----

Two advertisers offered food products nearly identical. Both offered a full-size
package as an introduction. But one gave his package free. The other bought the
package. A coupon was good at any store for a package, for which the maker paid retail
price.

The first advertiser failed and the second succeeded. The first even lost a large
part of the trade he had. He cheapened his product by giving a 15-cent package away. It
is hard to pay for an article which has once been free. It is like paying railroad fare after
traveling on a pass. The other gained added respect for his article by paying retail price to
let the user try it. An article good enough for the maker to buy is good enough for the
user to buy. It is vastly different to pay 15 cents to let you try an article than to simply say
“It’s free.”

So with sampling. Hand an unwanted product to a housewife and she pays it slight
respect. She is no mood to see its virtues. But get her to ask for a sample after reading your
story, and she is in a very different position. She knows your claims. She is interested in
them, else she would not act. And she expects to find the qualities you told.

There is a great deal in mental impression. Submit five articles exactly alike and
five people may choose one of them. But point out in one some qualities to notice and
everyone will find them. The five people then will all choose the same article.

If people can be made sick or well by mental impressions, they can be made to
favor a certain brand in that way. And that, on some lines, is the only way to win them.

Two concerns, side by side, sold women’s clothing on installments. The appeal,
of course, was to poor girls who desire to dress better. One treated them like poor girls
and made the bare business offer. The other put a woman in charge — a motherly,
dignified, capable woman. They did business in her name. They used her picture. She
signed all ads and letters. She wrote to these girls like a friend. She knew herself what it
meant to a girl not to be able to dress her best. She had long sought a chance to supply
women good clothes and give them all season to pay. Now she was able to do so, with
the aid of men behind her. There was no comparison in those two appeals. It was not
long before this womans’ long established next door rival had to quit.

The backers of this business sold house furnishings on installments. Sending out
catalogs promiscuously did not pay. Offering long-time credit often seems like a reflection.

But when a married woman bought garments from Mrs. ________, and paid as
agreed, they wrote to her something like this: “Mrs. ________, whom we know, tells us
that you are one of her good customers. She has dealt with you, she says, and you do just
as you agree. So we have opened with you a credit account on our books, good any time

-----

you wish. When you want anything in furnishings, just order it. Pay nothing in advance.
We are very glad to send it without any investigation to a person recommended as you
are.” That was flattering. Naturally those people, when they wanted some furniture,
would order from that house.

There are endless phases to psychology. Some people know them by instinct.
Many of them are taught by experience. But we learn most of them from others. When
we see one winning method we note it down for use when occasion offers.

These things are very important. An identical offer made in a different way may
bring multiplied returns. Somewhere in the mines of business experience we must find
the best method somehow.

 Being Specific

Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a
duck. They leave no impression whatever. To say, “Best in the world,” “Lowest price in
existence,” etc. are at best simply claiming the expected. But superlatives of that sort are
usually damaging. They suggest looseness of expression, a tendency to exaggerate, a
careless truth. They lead readers to discount all the statements that you make.

People recognize a certain license in selling talk as they do poetry. A man may
say, “Supreme in quality” without seeming a liar, though one may know that the other
brands are equally as good. One expects a salesman to put his best foot forward and
excuses some exaggeration born of enthusiasm. But just for that reason general
statements count for little. And a man inclined to superlatives must expect that his every
statement will be taken with some caution.

But a man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or a lie. People do
not expect an advertiser to lie. They know that he can’t lie in the best mediums. The
growing respect in advertising has largely come through a growing regard for its truth. So
a definite statement is usually accepted. Actual figures are not generally discounted.
Specific facts, when stated, have their full weight and effect.

This is very important to consider in written or personal salesmanship. The
weight of an argument may often be multiplied by making it specific. Say that a tungsten
lamp gives more light than a carbon and you leave some doubt. Say it gives three and
one-third times the light and people realize that you have made tests and comparisons.

A dealer may say, “Our prices have been reduced” without creating any marked
impression. But when he says “Our prices have been reduced 25 percent” he gets the full
value of his announcement.

A mail order advertiser sold women’s clothing to people of the poorer classes.
For years he used the slogan, “Lowest prices in America.” His rivals all copied that. Then
he guaranteed to undersell any other dealer. His rivals did likewise. Soon those claims
became common to every advertiser in his line, and they became commonplace. Then
under able advice, he changed his statement to “Our net profit is 3 percent.” That was a
definite statement and it proved very impressive. With their volume of business it was
evident that their prices must be minimum. No one could be expected to do business on
less than 3 percent. The next year their business made a sensational increase.

-----

At one time in the automobile business there was a general impression that
profits were excessive. One well-advised advertiser came out with this statement, “Our
profit is 9 percent.” Then he cited actual costs on the hidden costs of a $1,500 car. They
amounted to $735, without including anything one could easily see. This advertiser made
a great success along those lines at that time.

Shaving soaps have long been advertised “Abundant lather,” “Does not dry on
the face,” “Acts quickly,” etc. One advertiser had as good a chance as the other to
impress those claims. Then a new maker came into the field. It was a tremendously
difficult field, for every customer had to taken from someone else. He stated specific
facts. He said, “Softens the beard in one minute.” “Maintains its creamy fullness for ten
minutes on the face.” “The final result of testing and comparing 130 formulas.” Perhaps
never in advertising has there been a quicker and greater success in an equally difficult
field.

Makers of safety razors have long advertised quick shaves. One maker advertised
a 78-second shave. That was definite. It indicated actual tests. That man at once made a
sensational advance in his sales.

In the old days all beers were advertised as “Pure.” The claim made no
impression. The bigger the type used, the bigger the folly. After millions had been spent
to impress a platitude, one brewer pictured a plate glass room where beer was cooled in
filtered air. He pictured a filter of white wood pulp through which every drop was
cleared. He told how bottles were washed four times by machinery. How he went down
4,000 feet for pure water. How 1,018 experiments had been made to attain a yeast to give
beer that matchless flavor. And how all the yeast was forever made from that adopted
mother cell.

All claims were such as any brewer might have made. They were mere essentials
in ordinary brewing. But he was the first to tell the people about them, while others cried
merely “pure beer.” He made the greatest success that was ever made in beer advertising.
“Used the world over” is a very elastic claim. Then one advertiser said, “Used by the
peoples of 52 nations,” and many others followed.

One statement may take as much room as another, yet a definite statement may
be many times as effective. The difference is vast. If a claim is worth making, make it in
the most impressive way. All these effects must be studied. Salesmanship-in-print is very
expensive. A salesman’s loose talk matters little. But when you are talking to millions at
enormous cost, the weight of your claims is important.

-----

No generality has any weight whatever. It is like saying “How do you do?” When
you have no intention of inquiring about ones health. But specific claims when made in
print are taken at their value.

#### Chapter 8

 Tell Your Full Story

Whatever claim you use to gain attention, the advertisement should tell a story
reasonably complete. If you watch returns, you will find that certain claims appeal far
more than others. But in usual lines a number of claims appeal to a large percentage.
Then present those claims in every ad for their effect on that percentage.

Some advertisers, for sake of brevity, present one claim at a time. Or they write a
serial ad, continued in another issue. There is no greater folly. Those serials almost never
connect.

When you once get a person’s attention, then is the time to accomplish all you
can ever hope with him. Bring all your good arguments to bear. Cover every phase of
your subject. One fact appeals to some, one to another. Omit any one and a certain
percentage will lose the fact which might convince.

People are not apt to read successive advertisements on any single line. No more
than you read a news item twice, or a story. In one reading of an advertisement one
decides for or against a proposition. And that operates against a second reading. So
present to the reader, when once you get him, every important claim you have. The best
advertisers do that. They learn their appealing claims by tests — by comparing results
from various headlines. Gradually they accumulate a list of claims important enough to
use. All those claims appear in every ad thereafter.

The advertisements seem monotonous to the men who read them all. A complete
story is always the same. But one must consider that the average reader is only once a
reader, probably. And what you fail to tell him in that ad is something he may never
know. Some advertisers go so far as to never change their ads. Single mail order ads
often run year after year without diminishing returns. So with some general ads. They are
perfected ads, embodying in the best way known all that one has to say. Advertisers do
not expect a second reading. Their constant returns come from getting new readers.

In every ad consider only new customers. People using your product are not
going to read your ads. They have already read and decided. You might advertise month
after month to present users that the product they use is poison, and they would never
know it. So never waste one line of your space to say something to present users, unless
you can say it in your headlines. Bear in mind always that you can address an
unconverted prospect.

-----

Any reader of your ad is interested, else he would not be a reader. You are dealing
with someone willing to listen. Then do your level best. That reader, if you lose him now,
may never again be a reader.

You are like a salesman in a busy man’s office. He may have tried again and again
to get entree. He may never be admitted again. This is his one chance to get action, and
he must employ it to the full.

This brings up the question of brevity. The most common expression you hear
about advertising is that people will not read much. Yet a vast amount of the best paying
advertising shows that people do read much. Then they write for a book, perhaps — for
added information. There is a fixed rule on this subject of brevity. One sentence may tell
a complete story on a line like chewing gum. It may on an article like Cream of Wheat.
But, whether long or short, an advertising story should be reasonably complete.

A certain man desired a personal car. He cared little about the price. He wanted a
car to take pride in, else he felt he would never drive it. But, being a good business man,
he wanted value for his money. His inclination was towards a Rolls-Royce. He also
considered a Pierce-Arrow, a Locomobile and others. But these famous cars offered no
information. Their advertisements were very short. Evidently the makers considered it
undignified to argue comparative merits.

The Marmon, on the contrary, told a complete story. He read columns and books
about it. So he bought a Marmon, and was never sorry. But he afterwards learned facts
about another car at nearly three times the price which would have sold him the car had
he known them.
