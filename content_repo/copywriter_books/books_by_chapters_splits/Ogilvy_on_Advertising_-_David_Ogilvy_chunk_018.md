Albert Lasker made more money than anyone in the history of the advertising business. And spent more. And got his money’s worth.
 The son of a prosperous German immigrant, he started his career as a reporter on the Galveston Morning News, covering sports, crime, religious services, theater, business and politics. When he was 18 his father got him a job at the Lord & Thomas agency in Chicago. At �rst he had to clean out the spittoons, but quickly became a champion canvasser for new business, criss-crossing the Midwest by train, buggy and sleigh. When he was 20 he bought Lord & Thomas, and remained its head until he retired 44 years later.
 Lasker was more than an advertising man. In 1918 he came under the in�uence of Theodore Roosevelt, and this led to his taking four

In those days he was a militant isolationist, but he lived to become one of Wendell Wilkie’s strongest supporters in the One World movement, and did everything he could to advance the foreign policy of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.

_Albert Lasker made more money, spent more and gave more away than anybody in the history of advertising. And he got his_

_money’s worth._

###### At the age of 65 he started collecting pictures, and died owning nine Matisses, seventeen Picassos and a hundred other pictures of the �rst rank. He once bought half a dozen Marie Laurencins to give away as Christmas presents.
 He was a brilliant philanthropist, and gave a large part of his fortune to medical research.
 But it was as an advertising man that Lasker excelled. When he �rst joined Lord & Thomas, then the third biggest agency in the country, they employed only one half-time copywriter and paid him $15 a week. Then John E. Kennedy, a Canadian policeman turned

-----

###### copywriter, came into his life and persuaded him that advertising was ‘salesmanship in print’, a de�nition that has never been improved. Lasker said later, ‘The history of advertising could never be written without �rst place being given to John E. Kennedy, for every copywriter throughout the length and breadth of this land is today being guided by the principles he laid down.’
 Lasker held that if an agency could write copy which sold the product, nothing else was needed. For years he refused to employ an art director, and when he �nally gave in it was only because he had observed that illustrated advertisements were easier to sell to clients. His attitude to research was equally contemptuous. He used to say that he was perfectly able to give his clients advice ‘without having to lose six months going out to do research, only to come back and tell us that a jackass has two ears’. He never had what is called today a ‘marketing’ department. His intuitive genius for marketing can be illustrated in a story he told about the early days of women’s sanitary napkins.

 ‘When the Kotex people came to us, the business wasn’t growing as fast as they thought it should. We didn’t have to make investigations among millions of women. Just a few of us talked to our wives and asked them if they used Kotex, and we found they didn’t, and in almost every case it was because they didn’t like to ask the druggist for it. So we developed the simple idea of putting plain wrapped packages on the dealer’s counter so that you could walk into your dealer and walk away with a wrapped package without embarrassment. The business boomed by leaps and bounds.’

 By dispensing with marketers, art directors and researchers, Lasker saved so much money that he was able to make a pro�t of 7 per cent – probably the world’s record. If an agency makes more than 1 per cent today, it is exceptional.
 He ran Lord & Thomas as a dictatorship. ‘As you all know,’ he told his sta�, ‘I am the owner of this business and therefore I decide the policies. Lord & Thomas is the trade name for Albert D. Lasker

###### practicing advertising.’ He owned 95 per cent of the shares. After he retired he said that he had never attended a directors’ meeting and did not think that one had ever been held.
 He hired able men, paid them well and trained them well. He used to say, ‘I can get more out of people than they have in them.’ But the turnover was ferocious. At one point the heads of nine major agencies were Lasker alumni. He used to say, ’I make my men so good that I can’t keep ‘em.’ Before writing his biography of Lasker,[1] John Gunther asked some of his people what they thought had been his greatest qualities. The consensus was that he combined a sense of detail with a gift for grasping the big picture, and that he had a genius for predicting the reactions of consumers. In addition, his vitality and magnetism were irresistible, and he worked �fteen hours a day. No wonder he made Lord & Thomas the biggest agency in the world – for a time.
 He loathed talking on the telephone, and abominated committees. He never belonged to an advertising club, and avoided his competitors. He resigned several huge accounts out of pique, including General Electric, Quaker Oats and RCA, and after his retirement encouraged his successors to resign Lucky Strike.
 He had himself driven about in a yellow Rolls-Royce. And, like me, he hated reverse type – ‘if it was natural to read that way, the New York Times would be printed that way.’
 He was not shy about conspicuous consumption. His weekend estate outside Chicago had a sta� of �fty. The gardens covered 97 acres, with six miles of clipped hedges – compared with only one mile in my garden today. And there was an 18-hole golf course.
 He once de�ned an administrator as ‘somebody without brains’, but as an administrator himself, he could be ruthless. In the Depression he cut all salaries by 25 per cent when he was taking $3,000,000 a year for himself, and then, at one fell swoop, �red 50 men and women many of whom had been with him for years.
 For all his �nancial acumen, he made at least one major blunder. When his father died, Lasker inherited a lot of Texas real estate. He promptly sold what was to become some of the richest oil land in the world, and a quarter of downtown Houston. That, plus his

-----

###### philanthropies and his extravagance, is why he left only $11,500,000 instead of a billion. He once said, ‘I didn’t want to make a great fortune. I wanted to show what I could do with my brains.’
 His emotional make-up was uncomfortable. Gunther, who knew him well, says that he was sensitive and perceptive, and that he had a bubbling sense of humor. But he could be overbearing, intolerant and arrogant, once being heard to say, ‘There is no advertising man in the world but me.’ I don’t think he was joking. His �rst wife said that he gave her everything except himself He could be bad- tempered, demanding and inconsiderate. And he had three prolonged nervous breakdowns.
 The best advertisement for Albert Lasker is his widow Mary. She has administered his medical foundation with superb ability, and is one of New York’s most constructive citizens. On the one occasion I met her, she told me the story of her husband’s abdication. One afternoon, late in 1942, he suddenly said to her, ‘Mary, I have decided to get out of the advertising business.’ Two days later he gave Lord & Thomas to three of his bright young men (Foote, Cone and Belding), for a token payment of $100,000 – on condition that the name Lord & Thomas should be taken o� the masthead. He lived another ten years.

 STANLEY RESOR 1879-1962

 Stanley Resor was the Brahmin of the advertising business. Austere, digni�ed, cultured, beautifully mannered and rather donnish.
 When he became head of J. Walter Thompson, the agency was billing $3,000,000 a year. When he retired 45 years later, it was the biggest in the world, with billings of $500,000,000.
 The secret of his success was his ability to attract exceptionally able men, and to treat them with so much respect that they never left. They included Sam Meek, James Webb Young, Henry Stanton, Ken Hinks and Gilbert Kinney. No other agency has ever had a team of such caliber, or kept it together so long.

-----

###### Resor was never overbearing like Lasker. He managed by consensus, distrusting what he called Individual Opinion, and thought that brilliance was dangerous.
 His agency was structured in the loosest possible way. He detested hierarchies. There were no department heads, and no job descriptions. The agency operated as a partnership, like a big law �rm. When he o�ered me a job, he gave me no inkling what work he had in mind for me. O�ce boy? Copywriter? His successor? He did not say, and I did not ask him.
 Resor worked his way through Yale tutoring other students and selling books, but he also had time to win the James Gordon Bennett prize for economics. He retained a life-long admiration for professors and hired at least three to work at J. Walter Thompson – a psychologist, an economist and a historian. He used to say that his agency was the ‘university’ of advertising.
 Unlike Lasker, he was a fervent believer in research. The economist Arno Johnson was one of his researchers, and another was Virgil Reed, a former Director of the Census. He set up a panel of 5,000 consumers and had them report once a month on everything they purchased. He had a test kitchen in the agency, to invent new recipes for his clients, and he started experiments on television long before it was available for advertising. He also shared my interest in factor-analysis and had a team studying techniques which work and techniques which don’t work.
 A man of rigid principles, he threw away an opportunity to get the huge Camel account because he would not show speculative advertisements. He never took liquor accounts or patent medicines.
 Perhaps his most valuable innovation was to be the �rst to employ women as copywriters, starting with his wife. They were housed in a separate department and had to wear hats in the o�ce.
 Like all the giants, Resor worked long hours. I used to see him on the train that left Grand Central Station shortly before midnight. He was usually reading the Wall Street prices in the evening paper, 20 years before I had any reason to do so.
 A few years after I hung out my shingle, I lost my biggest account to J. Walter Thompson, and telephoned Resor to congratulate him.

-----

###### ‘David’, he said, ‘you are a gentleman and a scholar but you are trying to break into the ranks of the big agencies, and that is no longer possible. The investment is too big. I suggest you give up and join J. Walter Thompson.’
 I replied, ‘Mr. Resor, I would love to join you, but I couldn’t �re a hundred men and women.’
 ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘times are good. They wouldn’t have any di�culty �nding other jobs.’
 Two years later he repeated the invitation, this time o�ering to buy my whole agency, like buying a library to get one book. That was the day I met his wife. He had hired her to write copy on the Cincinnati agency where he worked before joining Thompson, and she had become one of the best copywriters in the country. Their partnership, both in business and as a couple, was formidable.
 It was Helen Resor who insisted that the agency’s o�ces should be decorated with antique furniture, each executive being allowed to choose the period he liked the best. She was said to believe that if their o�ces were more attractive than their homes, they would work longer hours.[2]
 In some ways, Helen Resor was more than Stanley. She was one of the founders of the planned parenthood movement, and she made use of her experience as a Trustee of the Museum of Modern Art to form an admirable collection of pictures.

_Stanley Resor, the Brahmin of the advertising business. He and his copywriter wife made J. Walter Thompson the biggest_

_agency in the world._

###### Despite the fact that he was married to a copywriter, Resor had a tendency to regard copywriters as idiots. His agency was dominated by its account executives, or ‘representatives’ as he called them.
 Unlike the author, he believed strongly in the selling power of celebrity testimonials. For Lux Toilet Soap he used Hollywood movie stars, and for Ponds he used titled English women; my friend Erskine Childers, who was later to become President of Ireland, had the job of signing them up.
 Resor was the �rst agency chief to start a network of o�ces outside the United States. This he did in the twenties, at the behest of General Motors.
 He looked like Woodrow Wilson, but he was a Republican. He lived in an unostentatious house in Connecticut, where he worked in the garden, and had a ranch in Wyoming. None of Lasker’s extravagance.
 But Resor made one mistake. He stayed too long. By the time he was 80, his ideas for advertising campaigns had become

 RAYMOND RUBICAM 1892-1978

 The day after I arrived in the United States, I called Raymond Rubicam for an appointment, armed with an introduction from Caroline Ruutz-Rees, the famous headmistress of Rosemary Hall.
 ‘State your business,’ he barked. ‘I want to pick your brains,’ I replied.

_The two best agencies in the world are the lengthened shadows of Raymond Rubicam. He was my conscience for 40 years,_

_teaching me that advertising has a responsibility to behave._

###### The following year, he and George Gallup, who was then his Research Director, hired me to run the Audience Research Institute at Princeton. Rubicam took great interest in our work and treated me with uncommon kindness.
 After the war I decided to try my luck in advertising, but I stood in such awe of Young & Rubicam that I did not dare apply to them for a job. As I thought they were the only agency where I would like to work, I had no choice but to start my own. In one of his last

-----

###### letters before he died, Rubicam wrote, ‘We knew you before you started your agency. How come we missed you?’
 By that time we had become great friends. ‘Friends’ is not the right word. He was my patron, inspiration, counselor, critic and conscience. I was his hero-worshipping disciple. At one stage, long after he retired from Young & Rubicam, he o�ered to become chairman of Ogilvy & Mather.
 If all institutions are ‘the lengthened shadow of one man’, it can be said that the two best agencies in the world today are the lengthened shadows of Raymond Rubicam.
 Next to my grandfather, whom he resembled physically and in many other ways, Rubicam was the most outspoken man I have ever known. He blurted out whatever was on his mind, without considering what e�ect it might have. One day he would praise one of my campaigns in language which made me blush, and a few weeks later criticize another campaign with a candor which made me wince.
 The youngest of eight children in a poor family, he left school when he was 15 and spent the next nine years bumming around the country as a shipping clerk, bellhop, chaperone of cattle, movie projectionist, door-to-door salesman, automobile salesman, and newspaper reporter (at $12 a week). When he was 24 he applied for a job as a copywriter at the now defunct F. Wallis Armstrong agency in Philadelphia. ‘I sat in that lobby – on a bench so hard that I can still feel it,’ he later recalled. ‘At the end of the ninth day, I exploded … I wrote the boss a letter calculated to produce an immediate interview or a couple of black eyes.’ The boss stormed into the lobby, waving the letter, and said, ‘Those ads you wrote didn’t amount to much, but this letter has some stu� in it.’
 He stayed with Armstrong for three years, but did not enjoy it. ‘Armstrong said that a copywriter was a necessary evil, but an art director was just a goddamned luxury. He lived to outfox everybody.’ In 1919 Rubicam moved to N.W. Ayer, then the largest agency in the country. There he wrote campaigns which have been included in every anthology of great advertisements, including ‘The Instrument of the Immortals’ for Steinway and ‘The Priceless

-----

###### Ingredient’ for Squibb. Then, after four years with Ayer, he teamed up with an account executive called John Orr Young to start Young & Rubicam, on a shoe-string. Their capital was $5,000 and their �rst account was a shoe-string. Today their agency is either the biggest or second biggest in the world, with billings of about three billion dollars a year.[3]

_Raymond Rubicam assembled the best team of copywriters and art directors in the history of advertising – like Jack_
_Rosebrook, Roy Whittier, Vaughn Flannery, Henry Lent, George Gribbin, Sid Ward and Norman Robbins. Under Rubicam’s_
_inspiration they created advertisements which were read by more people than any other agency’s – including this ad for Life_

_Savers._
