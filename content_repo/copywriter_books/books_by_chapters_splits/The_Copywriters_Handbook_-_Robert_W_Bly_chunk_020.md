### The average brochure contains a lot of words. Certainly more than you read in most ads or hear in TV commercials.
 But remember that the brochure is a medium of information. Ads, commercials, and direct mail may be an unwanted interruption in the reader’s life. But the reader has asked for the brochure, and he is interested in the information it contains.
 Don’t be afraid to make the brochure as long as it has to be. Include all the necessary information—prices, product specifications, ordering information, guarantees, descriptions.
 The reader who represents a serious potential customer will read the copy as long as it is interesting and engaging. The minute you write boring copy, or copy that doesn’t give useful information, you’ll turn the reader off.
 There is a ridiculous tendency among brochure designers to use a large amount of white space on the page and very little copy. I’ve seen 8½ x 11– inch brochures where each page had only one or two paragraphs in small type in the upper corner. The rest of the page was mostly blank and decorated by some graphic design: stripes, color patterns, lines, shapes.
 This is a waste of space and printing costs. Your customer doesn’t send for your brochure to look at fancy designs; she sends for it because she wants information. If you want proof that this myth is untrue, take a look at your daily newspaper: pages and pages of sold text and photos. No white space, no graphic “design elements.” Just information that the reader wants and has paid for.
 Of course, not every page in your brochure should be solid type to the edges. Margins and space between paragraphs help increase readability. Photos, illustrations, captions, and subheads break up the text and help tell the story. But to think your brochure should be largely blank space is folly. Don’t be afraid to write and print all the words it takes to make your sales pitch. Give the reader complete information.

 6. Organize your selling points.

 People read brochures in much the same order they read paperback novels. They look at the cover first, maybe take a quick peek at the back cover, and

 Your brochure, like a novel, should have a logical structure to it. A good brochure tells a story—a product story—with a beginning, a middle, and an end. The organization of a brochure is dictated both by the product story you want to tell and by the informational needs of the reader.
 For example, my in-laws had a business in which they bought books from publishers and resold them to corporations. This is a rather unusual service, one the corporate librarian may not have thought about before, so my in-laws began their brochure with a summary of the service they offered and why corporate librarians would find it useful.
 Next, they presented six major benefits of using the service. These benefits were listed in simple 1-2-3 fashion so the reader could quickly see how she could come out ahead by doing business with the book-buying service.
 Finally, the brochure told the reader the technical details of how the service worked and gave instructions for placing orders.
 Let the organization of your brochure be dictated by what your customer wants to know about your product. If you own a computer store, and you find that customers coming in off the street seem to ask the same questions over and over, you might write a booklet titled “Six Important Questions to Ask Before You Buy a Computer.” The booklet would present computer shopping tips in a simple question-and-answer format.
 If your company designs and decorates offices, your brochure could be organized as a walking tour of the modern office. At each point of the tour, from the copier to the water cooler, the copy could point out how redesigning that section of the office can make the office a better place to work and improve productivity.
 There are many ways to organize a brochure: alphabetical order, chronological order, by size of product, by importance of customer benefit, question and answer, list of customer benefits, by product line, by price, by application, by market, by steps in the ordering process. Choose the approach that best fits your product, your audience, and your sales pitch.

### 7. Divide the brochure into short, easy-to-read sections.

 As you organize your brochure, devise a way to organize your material: an outline that breaks the topic into a number of sections and subsections.
 You should keep this organizational scheme in the final copy. Write the brochure as a series of short sections and subsections, each with its own headline or subhead.
 There are a number of benefits to this approach. First, the use of headings and subheads allows readers to get the message even if they only scan the brochure. Many people won’t read all the copy, but a series of heads and subheads gives them the gist of the sales pitch at a glance.
 Be sure to write headings and subheads that tell a story. Avoid headings that are just clever plays on words. Instead of “Hitachi plays it cool,” write, “Hitachi chiller-heaters cut cooling costs in half.”
 Second, breaking the copy into short sections makes the brochure easier to read. People are intimidated and tired by long chunks of text; they prefer to read a short section of copy, stop, take a rest, and absorb the information before going on to the next section. (This is why novels are divided into chapters.)
 Third, short sections make the brochure easier to write. You just follow your outline and put the information in your notes under the appropriate section. If you uncover new facts that don’t fit anywhere in the outline, you can simply add a new section to the brochure. And, like your reader, you can rest after writing one section before you go on to the next.
 When you write your brochure, think about how the sections will appear on the pages of the published brochure. For example, you might like the clean look and feel of having a six-page brochure with four sections (one on each page), a headline on the front cover, and the company logo and address on the back cover.
 Some brochure writers design their brochures so that each page contains a complete section or two. Other writers claim that a good way of getting the reader to turn the page is to have the sections run off one page and continue on the next. Both techniques have their merits, and the choice is really a matter of taste. But you should be aware of how organization and layout work together.

-----

### If your brochure is folded or designed in an unusual format, make a mock-up out of scrap paper. Use the mock-up (called a “dummy”) to show the layout and how the copy flows from page to page. Make sure that the reader will see the various sections of text in the same order you wrote them in the manuscript.

 8. Use hardworking visuals.

 Photos in brochures are not ornaments. They are included to help sell the product by showing what it looks like, how it works, and what it can do for the reader.
 The best brochure photos demonstrate the product’s usefulness by showing it in action. Putting people in these photos usually adds to the visual’s appeal (people like looking at pictures of people).
 Photos make the best visuals because they offer proof that a product exists and works. But artwork is also useful for many purposes.
 A drawing can illustrate a product or process that is not easily photographed (such as the inner workings of an automobile engine).
 A map can show where something is located. A diagram can show how something works or how it is organized. An organizational diagram, for example, uses arrows and boxes to show how the divisions and branches of a company are organized.
 A graph is used to tell how one quantity changes as another quantity changes. In a brochure on air-conditioning, a graph could show how your electric bill goes up as you lower the temperature setting on your air conditioner.
 Pie charts show proportions and percentages (for example, the percentage of your company’s annual income spent on research and development). Bar charts demonstrate comparisons among quantities (this year’s sales versus last year’s). And tables are a handy way of listing a body of data too large to include in the text of the brochure.
 Use visuals when they can express or illustrate a concept better than words can. If the visual doesn’t improve on the written description, don’t use it.
 Popular brochure visuals include:

-----

### Product photographs Pictures of the product photographed next to other objects to give a sense of the size of the product. (A brochure on semiconductors might show a photo of a microchip on a postage stamp to dramatically convey the smallness of the integrated circuit.) Photos of actual installations of the product Photos of the product in use Photos of the product being manufactured Tables of product specifications Tables summarizing product features and benefits Photos of items made with (or from) the product Photos of the company headquarters, manufacturing plant, or research laboratories Photos of the product packed and ready for shipping Photos of the product being tested by company scientists or inspected for quality control Photos of people who are enjoying the use of the product Photos of people who attest to the product’s superiority Tables listing the various models and versions of the product Graphs presenting scientific proof of the product’s performance (heat tests, ability to stand up under pressure, longevity of operation, etc.) Photos of available parts and accessories A series of photos demonstrating the product’s performance or how to use it Diagrams explaining how the product works or how it is put together Sketches of planned product improvements, forthcoming new products, or more applications

 Always use visuals that illustrate your key selling points. In an automobile brochure that extols the benefits of rack-and-pinion steering, it would be helpful to have a diagram that shows how rack-and-pinion steering works. But if rack-and-pinion steering is not a selling point, there would be no reason to include a picture of it.

-----

### Label all visuals with captions. Studies show that brochure captions get twice the readership of body copy. Use captions to reinforce the body copy or make an additional sales point not covered in the copy.
 Make captions interesting and informative. Instead of labeling a photo “Automatic wiring device,” write “A microprocessor-controlled, fully automatic wiring device (above left) makes approximately 1,000 wire-wrap connections an hour, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.”

 9. Find the next step in the buying process—and tell the reader to take it.

 Do you want your reader to buy pasta from your gourmet shop? Enroll for membership in your health spa? Visit your factory? Or test-drive a new luxury sedan?
 A brochure moves the customer from one step in the buying process to the next.
 To do this successfully, the brochure must identify this next step and tell the reader to take it.
 Typically, this “call for action” appears at the end of the brochure. The copy urges the reader to call or go online for more information, or to take some other action. Make it easy for the reader to respond by using such devices as reply cards, self-addressed stamped envelopes, order forms, toll- free numbers, URLs, and listings of local dealerships and distributors.
 End the brochure with copy designed to generate an immediate response. Use action words and phrases: “Give us a call today.” “For more information, write for our FREE catalog.” “Please complete and mail the enclosed reply card.” “Visit our store nearest you.” “Order today—supplies limited.” “Download your free selection guide now.”
 Here’s an effective closing from a brochure for an advertising agency:

**THE NEXT STEP**
Now that you know something about us, we’d like to know a little bit more about you.

Send us your current ads, sales literature, and press releases for a free, no-obligation
evaluation of your marketing communications program.

If you’d like to meet with us, give us a call. We’ll be glad to show you some of the work
we’ve done for our clients, and take a look at what we can do for you.

-----

### This closing is effective for three reasons: 1) it’s personal; 2) it asks for specific action (“Send us your current ads,” “Give us a call”); and 3) it offers the reader something for free (“a no-obligation evaluation of your marketing communications program”).
 Always ask for the order in your brochure. Or at least for action that will lead to an eventual sale.

 10. Don’t overlook the obvious.

 Sometimes you get so wrapped up in the creative aspects of copywriting that you forget to include basic information—phone numbers, directions, street addresses, store hours, zip codes, and guarantees.
 When you write a brochure, don’t forget the obvious. Often, seemingly minor details can mean the difference between a sale and a no-sale.
 For instance, one company forgot to include its second telephone number in a direct-mail brochure. As a result, the phone was frequently busy when prospects called in to order the product, and many sales were lost.
 When you’re proofreading your brochure copy, be sure you’ve checked the following items:

 Company logo, name, and address Phone numbers E-mail address Street address in addition to box number Directions (“located on the corner of Fifth and Main off I-95”) Prices, store hours, branch locations List of distributors, dealers, or sales reps Instructions for placing orders by phone, mail, online, or text Credit cards accepted Product guarantees and warranties Shipping and service information Trademarks, registration marks, disclaimers, and other legal information

-----

### Form numbers, dates, codes, copyright lines Web site URL

 Also, be sure to proofread for errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
 These details are important. For instance, mail-order firms know their sales increase when they add a toll-free number and “major credit cards accepted” to their brochures.

 11. Make the brochure worth keeping.

 When the customer receives your brochure, he can do one of three things:

 1. Respond to it by placing an order or asking for more information. 2. File it for future reference. 3. Throw it away.

 You want the first two things to happen. You want the customer to respond to your brochure. And you want her to save it for when she needs the product again in the future.
 To get someone to save your brochure, you must write a brochure that is worth keeping. Brochures that are worth keeping are valuable because of the information they contain. This information may be directly related to the product. Or it may be service information of a general nature that is indirectly related to the product.
 For example, a brochure for a resort hotel in Montauk might print a detailed map of the town on the back cover. Travelers will save the brochure because of the map.
 The literature package I mail to potential clients for my freelance copywriting services includes a reprint of an article I wrote (“Ten Tips for Writing More Effective Industrial Copy”). The reprint includes my picture, name, address, and phone number. Even if prospects throw away the promotional part of my package, they are likely to keep the article because it contains information that may be useful to them in their work.

### Most people don’t have a good idea of how the stock market works. So if a broker published a booklet titled, “A Layperson’s Introduction to the Stock Market … and How to Play It,” people would be likely to save this booklet. Later, when they accumulate enough money to invest in stocks, they would find the brochure in their files and call the broker or open an online account.
 So if you want your brochure to keep selling for you, make your brochure worth keeping. Another example: a casino added value to its promotional brochure by printing the rules of blackjack on the back cover.

 HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR BROCHURE COPY

 This is an oversimplification, but basically there are only three types of brochures:

 1. Brochures about a product 2. Brochures about a service 3. Brochures about a company (known as “corporate” brochures or
 “capabilities” brochures)

 The content and organization of every brochure is unique, because every selling situation and product, service, or company is unique. However, many brochures share common characteristics. Most brochures describing consulting services, for example, include a list of the consultant’s clients.
 Below are three outlines for “typical” product, service, and company brochures. These will give you a rough idea of what to include in the sales literature you write for your clients.

 For a Product Brochure

 • Introduction—a capsule description of what the product is and why the reader of the brochure should be interested in it.

 • Benefits—a list of reasons why the customer should buy the product.

-----

### • Features—highlights of important product features that set the product apart from the competition.

 • “How it works”—a description of how the product works and what it can do. This section can include the results of any tests that demonstrate the product’s superiority.

 • Types of users (markets)—this section describes the special markets the product is designed for. A wastewater plant, for example, might be sold to municipalities, utilities, and industrial plants: three separate and distinct markets, each with its own special set of requirements. This section might also include an actual list of names of well-known people or organizations that use and endorse the product.

 • Applications—descriptions of the various applications in which the product can be used.
