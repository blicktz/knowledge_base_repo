## PEOPLE WANT YOUR BRAND TO
 PARTICIPATE IN THEIR
 TRANSFORMATION

### Even though you’ve filled out the principal elements of your StoryBrand
###### BrandScript, you’ve likely noticed there’s one element left. This final element will serve as an overall character arc for your customer’s journey. In fact, as we’ve discussed what your hero wants, what their challenges are, and what positive resolution your brand can provide, we’ve only danced around the greatest motivation your customer has to place an order. This single motivating factor is the secret driving force behind nearly every decision we make as human beings. Whether we’re buying lawn furniture or choosing a mate, we can’t escape a certain deep desire.
 I’m talking about the human desire to transform. Everybody wants to change. Everybody wants to be somebody different, somebody better, or, perhaps, somebody who simply becomes more self-accepting. This desire for transformation is by design. Humans start as tiny babies, learning color and smell and sound and attachment. As we grow, we begin playing games in which we are animals or warriors or princesses or wizards. From the beginning, we long to grow and change and adapt and develop. This desire, by the way, never stops, all the way to our final days. And while we can’t become wizards, we do want to become better and better versions of ourselves. Brands who offer to participate in this universal and deep-rooted desire and who are successful in delivering an aspirational identity often create brand evangelists.
 Ever wonder how Taylor Swift created such raving fans? Her music is only part of the story. Mostly, young women identified with her strength, her ease, her willingness to share, her generosity, and, well, her identity. In

-----

###### short, she stands as a person many young women would like to become, and that isn’t a bad thing. The same could be said for many of our sports heroes, our favorite actors and comics, and even many world leaders. Our subconscious minds are always looking for examples of who we want to be, and when we find one of those examples, our primitive brains, in small ways, have trouble differentiating themselves from ourselves. Why else do people get so defensive when you diminish their heroes? In their minds, you aren’t just diminishing a public figure; you’re diminishing the part of them that has attached their identity to that public figure. You’re not just insulting Taylor Swift; you’re insulting millions of people who want to be (and perhaps are) like Taylor Swift. If you don’t believe me, just open your favorite social media app and comment about how you aren’t sure Taylor made the right choice in shoes today. You will quickly be hung in the town square and your body will be dragged through the streets by teens leading teams of rhinestone-clad show horses.
 Changing the subject in the name of personal safety, when you look closely at your StoryBrand BrandScript, you’ll see the character arc already taking shape. Your brand really is helping people become better versions of themselves, which is a beautiful thing. You are helping your customers become wiser, more equipped, more physically fit, more accepted, and more at peace. Like it or not (and we hope you like it), we are all participating in our customers’ transformation, which is exactly what they want us to do.
 Again, brands that participate in the transformation of their customers’ identity create passionate brand evangelists. Want critics to be hung in the town square and dragged through the street by teams of My Little Ponies when people disparage your brand? Keep reading.

##### THE DESIRE TO TRANSFORM RUNS DEEP

###### At the beginning of a story, the hero is usually flawed, filled with self- doubt, and ill-equipped for the task set before them. Faced with unbounded conflict, they meet a mysterious but competent guide who aids them on their journey. The conflict then begins to strengthen the character. Forced into action, the hero develops skills and accrues the experience needed to

-----

###### defeat their foe. Though the hero is still filled with doubt, they summon the courage to engage the fight and, in the climactic scene, defeat the villain, proving once and for all that they have changed and that they are now competent to face challenges as better versions of themselves, revealing that all along the story was about character transformation.
 This same character arc, by the way, appears in The Old Man and the Sea, Pride and Prejudice, Pinocchio, Hamlet, Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, Tommy Boy, and thousands of other popular stories. Why? Because it’s our story. Feelings of self-doubt are universal, as is the desire to become somebody competent and courageous. And all of this matters when it comes to the messages we create to brand our products and services.
 As it relates to creating identify-transformation sound bites, a few important questions can prompt effective answers: Who does our customer want to become? What kind of person do they need to be to resolve their conflict? What characteristics would effectively describe our customer’s aspirational identity?

##### SMART BRANDS DEFINE AN ASPIRATIONAL IDENTITY

###### Recently I ran down to Home Depot to get a stud finder so I could install shelving in the garage. Next to the stud finders in the tool section was a selection of Gerber knives. Gerber is a knife company out of Portland, Oregon, that makes a range of multipurpose pocketknives. Their commercial campaign, however, offers the buyer a lot more than a knife. They sell something intangible. They sell an identity, and by that I mean they sell an association with a kind of person you and I can become. I’d been noticing Gerber commercials for a long time, and even though I knew exactly what they were doing to my subconscious, I wanted one anyway. But why? I thought to myself as I stood there staring at the knives. I’m a writer. The only thing I need a knife for is to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
 Still, the pull was palpable. What if I had to swim under a boat to cut away a tangled rope from the propeller? Or slice a pant leg off my bloody jeans to make a tourniquet for my injured arm? What if Taylor Swift fans

-----

###### stuffed me into a burlap sack and threw me off a pier? Couldn’t I use the knife to cut my way out?
 Thankfully, my executive brain overpowered my primitive brain, and I walked away with just the stud finder. But why was it so hard? Why did I want the knife so badly? And why did I change my mind and go back to buy the knife anyway? Certainly they make great knives, but there are many other companies making great knives and I’d never really cared or noticed.
 The reason I wanted the knife is simple. Gerber defined an aspirational identity for their customers and then associated their product with that identity. The aspirational identity of a Gerber knife customer is tough, adventurous, fearless, action-oriented, and competent to do a hard job. Epitomized in their advertising campaign Hello Trouble, a Gerber customer is positioned as the kind of person who sails boats into storms, rides bulls, rescues people from floods, and yes, cuts tangled ropes from boat propellers. In their television commercials they present images of these aspirational, heroic figures cast over anthemic music and a narrator reciting the lines:

 Hello, Trouble. It’s been a while since we last met. But I know you’re still out there. And I have a feeling you’re looking for me. You wish I’d forget you, don’t you, Trouble? Perhaps it’s you that has forgotten me. Perhaps I need to come find you, remind you who I am.[1]

 The commercial is terrific. One day, to my surprise, a StoryBrand alumnus, who happens to be one of the Army Rangers about whom the movie Black Hawk Down was made, stopped by the house. We caught up for a moment, and then he gave me a little thank-you present, a Gerber knife. He even had my name engraved on the blade. He knew I liked the commercial and so offered it as a gift. To this day I keep that knife clipped to the dashboard of my 1978 FJ40 Land Cruiser. Occasionally I’ll take the knife into the house, stare at a jar of peanut butter, and say, “Hello, Trouble.”
 I may be just a writer, but I love that knife.

###### But let me ask you a question. Was the knife I bought a waste of money? I mean, let’s say I did pay forty dollars for the knife and never used it. Did I get ripped off?
 I’ve asked that question to hundreds of people who are familiar with the StoryBrand messaging framework, and the answer has always come back the same: no. It was not a waste of money. It was well worth the forty dollars. I can’t help but agree. The truth is when I buy a Gerber knife I get something more than a knife. In a way, Gerber helped me become a better person. They defined an aspirational identity and invited me to step into that identity. The knife made me feel more tough and adventurous, and they even created a moment between two friends. And that’s worth a great deal more than forty dollars.

##### HOW DOES YOUR CUSTOMER WANT TO BE DESCRIBED
 BY OTHERS?

###### The best way to define an aspirational identity that our customers may be attracted to is to consider how they want their friends to talk about them. Think about it. When others talk about you, what do you want them to say? How we answer that question reveals who it is we’d like to be.
 It’s the same for our customers. As it relates to your brand, how does your customer want to be perceived by their friends and family? And can you help them become that kind of person? Can some aspect of your product participate in your customer’s identity transformation? If you offer executive coaching, your clients may want to be seen as competent, generous, and disciplined. If you sell sports equipment, your customers likely want to be perceived as active, fit, and successful in their athletic pursuits.
 Once we know who our customers want to be, we will have language to use in emails, blog posts, and all manner of messaging collateral.

##### A GUIDE OFFERS MORE THAN A PRODUCT AND A PLAN

-----

###### Playing the guide is more than a marketing strategy; it’s a position of the heart. When a brand commits itself to helping customers define their heroic ambition; resolve their external, internal, and philosophical problems; and inspire them with an aspirational identity, they do more than sell products— they change lives. And leaders who care more about changing lives than they do about selling products tend to do a good bit of both.
 Last year StoryBrand consulted with Dave Ramsey and his team. Ramsey Solutions may be the best example of a narrative-based company I know, and Dave himself is a terrific example of a guide. Over a series of workshops, dinners, and speeches, we introduced the Ramsey team to the SB7 framework, less as a way of educating them than as a way of giving vocabulary to what they were already doing.
 Dave Ramsey hosts one of the largest radio shows in America with more than eight million daily listeners. On the show he offers financial advice and strategies that revolve around tackling and conquering personal debt. Unlike many advisers, though, Ramsey offers more than wisdom; he offers a narrative map his customers can enter into. He comes back from every break on his radio show with the same line: “Welcome back to The Dave Ramsey Show, where debt is dumb, cash is king, and the paid-off home mortgage has taken the place of the BMW as the status symbol of choice.” There they are, the elements of story, complete with an identity to step into and a new status symbol to go along with that new identity.
 Though Dave’s face is prominent on book covers and billboards promoting his show, he never positions himself as the hero. Instead, Ramsey has a near obsession with his listeners’ stories. Dave’s understanding of his listeners’ external problems (consumer debt and financial illiteracy), internal problems (confusion and a feeling of hopelessness), and their philosophical problem (credit card companies don’t care about your financial well-being and will gladly sell you debt you can’t afford) engages listeners in a living story. Always entertaining, Dave never misses an opportunity to embolden his listeners with an aspirational identity, encourage their progress, and remind them that tackling their financial challenges offers them a leap toward personal transformation.
 To cap it off, Dave offers a brilliantly placed climactic scene in his customers’ story. After listeners execute a plan he offers through his Financial Peace University, they are invited on his show to perform a “Debt-Free Scream.” People travel from thousands of miles away to be

###### featured on the show, and when they arrive, dozens of the Ramsey team surround the accomplished heroes with applause as the heroes shout, “We’re debt-free!”
 Once a listener has completed the journey, Dave lets them know they’ve changed, that they are different now, and that there is nothing they can’t accomplish if they apply themselves.

##### GREAT BRANDS OBSESS ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION
 OF THEIR CUSTOMERS

###### When we first met with Dave, I was surprised to learn he didn’t know that affirming the hero’s transformation was an oft-included scene at the end of many stories. I mean, he knew it intuitively but had never noticed it as a plot point in hundreds of stories. After the climactic scene (the debt-free scream), the guide often comes back to affirm the transformation of the hero, telling them that they are now a different and better person.
 At the end of Star Wars: A New Hope, the ghost of Obi-Wan stands next to Luke Skywalker as he’s rewarded for bravery. In The King’s Speech, Lionel tells King George he will be a great king. Peter Brand sits Billy Beane down in the movie Moneyball and lets him know he’s hit the equivalent of a home run as the manager of the A’s.
 The main purpose these scenes serve is to mark the transformation the hero has experienced so the audience has a point of reference that contrasts the hero’s character from the story’s beginning. The audience needs to be told very clearly how far the hero has come, especially since the hero usually struggles with crippling doubt right up until the end and they don’t even realize how much they have changed.
 The principle here is this: A hero needs somebody else to step into the story to tell them they’ve transformed. Heroes do not realize their transformation intuitively. They must be told by somebody else, and that somebody is the guide. That somebody is you.
 There are hundreds of thousands of financial advisers, and thousands of them have written books. Hundreds of those who’ve written books have podcasts or radio shows, and yet Dave Ramsey enjoys a wider popularity. Why? Well, certainly his advice is good. Nobody is attracted to

###### incompetence. But I’m convinced it is the way he frames the customer’s journey as a narrative and participates in and then affirms their transformation that sets him apart. Also, his messaging is clear: short, simple sound bites. And he has been repeating those sound bites for years.

##### IDENTITY TRANSFORMATION

###### In the final module of your StoryBrand BrandScript, we’ve included a section that will allow you to define an identity transformation your customer may experience as they relate to your brand.
 Who does your customer want to become as they engage your products and services?
 At StoryBrand, we want our customers to become clear and precise communicators. When customers finish this book or conclude their time with one of our StoryBrand certified coaches, we want them to return to the office and have people wondering what happened to them. How did they become so messaging savvy? How did they become so clear in their thinking? Why are their messaging ideas so good? Did they suddenly get a PhD in persuasion?
 Similar to the success module of your StoryBrand BrandScript, the aspirational identity section answers a question about how the story ends, except instead of telling us where the story is going, it tells us who the hero has become.
 Brands that realize their customers are human, filled with emotion, driven to transform, and in need of help truly do more than sell products; they change people. Dave Ramsey changes people. Apple changes people. TOMS Shoes changes people. Gerber knives changes people. It’s no wonder brands like these have such passionate fans and do so well in the marketplace.
 The statement you want to finish in order to define an identity transformation for your customer is this: We help our customers go from “X” to “Y.” Let me explain.

##### EXAMPLES OF IDENTITY TRANSFORMATION

-----

###### Thousands of StoryBrand clients have defined an aspirational identity for their customers and begun to participate in their transformation. Because of this, more and more companies are not just improving the world through their products and services; they’re actually improving the way their customers see themselves. Offering an aspirational identity adds enormous value to everything else that we offer.
 Here are some examples of aspirational identities from StoryBrand clients like you:

**PET FOOD BRAND**
###### From: Passive dog owner To: Every dog’s hero

**FINANCIAL ADVISER**
###### From: Confused and ill-equipped To: Competent and smart

**SHAMPOO BRAND**
###### From: Anxious and glum To: Carefree and radiant
