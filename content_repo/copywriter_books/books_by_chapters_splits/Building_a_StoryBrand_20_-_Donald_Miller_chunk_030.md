###### Offer a Reward
 If you really want to prime the pump, offer a reward to existing clients who refer their friends. As I mentioned earlier, my wife has invited dozens of friends to try out Blue Apron, a company that sends ready-to-cook meals right to people’s doors. Plenty of Betsy’s friends have enjoyed the service and signed on for themselves. Betsy receives a reward from Blue Apron every time somebody signs up.
 Another way to offer a reward is to start an affiliate program. You can offer your customers a 10 percent commission on the orders they bring to you. This system has generated millions of dollars for thousands of companies. A good affiliate program can do the work of an expensive salesforce if you structure the percentages well.

 AUTOMATE THE WORK The easiest, fastest referral system can be automated using Keap or any other CRM. Simply include any customer who places one or two orders in an automated campaign that offers them an educational video or PDF they can pass on, an added reward for telling their friends about you, or even a commission.

 Some Real-World Referral Systems
 Implementing a referral system takes work, but it’s effective. Take some inspiration from these samples:

 A 100 Percent Refund for Three New Referrals Within a Semester.
 This was the brainchild of an after-school test-prep academy that prepared high school students for the SAT and ACT college admissions test, but it could just as well have been an eye doctor or a massage therapist. Parents were given a referral card to hand out to friends, many of whom had kids around the same age. Each time one of the cards came back, the referrer was credited hundreds of dollars because these courses were expensive! When they referred

-----

###### three new registrants, the referrer was given a 100 percent refund. Sure, the kids were competing with test scores, but the parents ended up competing for referrals, and business skyrocketed. The business also offered special seminars for parents and students of the 100 Percent Referral Club. Invite-a-Friend Coupons. When students signed up for golf lessons,
 the range offered each new student several coupons for a free bucket of golf balls for a friend. While it’s an individual game, golf is a social sport since people enjoy playing together. The course experienced a 40 percent increase in students signing up for lessons because word of mouth spread so effectively. Open-House Party. Whenever a home contractor finished a large scale decking or remodel project, he asked the homeowners if they would be willing to throw an open-house party in exchange for a slight discount. Friends, family, and neighbors were invited to a cookout on the newly built deck. The contractor used this opportunity to explain how the work was done and pass out cards. With only a few open-house parties, the contractor filled his schedule for the following twelve months. Free Follow-Up Photos. A wedding photographer in Syracuse, New
 York, offered couples a free follow-up portrait on their one-year anniversary if the couple provided three referrals at the time of the wedding. She also followed up with cards to the entire bridal party, expressing how much of a pleasure it was to photograph them. Needless to say, business boomed because people who are in wedding parties often end up getting married soon themselves, especially if they catch the bouquet!

##### WHAT’S YOUR MARKETING PLAN?

###### In my twenties I spent an entire year playing chess. Nearly every day I met a friend at a coffee shop and we’d go at it for a couple of hours. My skills improved, and I ended up winning more than half my matches until another friend started showing up. He beat me every time, usually within twenty moves.

-----

###### The reason? I knew a lot about the philosophy of chess, but I didn’t have what’s referred to as an opening. Before sitting down to play, my more skilled opponent already knew his first five moves. This opening strategy was critical to his success. Once I memorized a few openings of my own, I started to win again.
 If the StoryBrand BrandScript is a foundation, the seven marketing pieces (or strategies) that make up the StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign should serve as your opening moves. These seven simple yet powerful tools have been used by countless businesses to increase their revenue.
 Consider the messaging and marketing campaign a checklist. After you’ve created your StoryBrand BrandScript, get to work on each aspect of this playbook and watch as your customers engage and your company grows. If you want help creating your StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign or if you want a marketing coach to help you create several of them, perhaps one for each division or product you sell, you can find a directory of the marketing coaches I have personally certified at MarketingMadeSimple.com.
 If you’re serious about creating a StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign, spend an hour at StoryBrand.AI and have the StoryBrand Brain create your campaign. When you do, you will get a robust report including a tagline, one-liner, wireframed website, lead generator, follow-up emails, sales script, narrative scripts for YouTube videos and social media, podcast prompts and topics, bonus ideas to create urgency, upsell product ideas, plug-and-play social media posts plus industry trends specific to your industry.

#### AFTERWORD

### I’ve lost count of how many StoryBrand clients we’ve helped in the last
###### decade, but it’s certainly tens of thousands. My hope is that this book has been the best marketing investment you’ve ever made because it’s helped you improve your existing marketing so much and also because it has inspired you to create even more marketing and messaging that works.
 You probably have a much more interesting product or service than you realize. You’ve likely just not found your audience yet. Do not be disheartened. When you clarify your message, your audience will find you.
 If you really want to internalize the framework or introduce the framework to friends and coworkers, listen to and share StoryBrand Radio Theater Presents: Pete and Joe Save Their Mother’s Company on Audible or Youtube.com/@storybrand. We had a lot of fun recording that story, and I even get to play a bit role as the ghost of myself. You will have to listen to find out what I’m talking about. By the way, that’s called a cliff-hanger, and you should incorporate a few of those into your marketing too!

#### PRAISE FOR THE STORYBRAND
 FRAMEWORK

“Before StoryBrand, customers weren’t seeing themselves in our offering. We’re a staffing agency
that specializes in helping companies find and hire the right people. We help companies post job
applications, we test candidates, and we provide software for applicant tracking. Sadly, our message,
though, was all about us. We were talking about our strengths rather than the customer’s needs. Also,
our marketing material was too complex and hard to understand. After bringing in a StoryBrand
facilitator, we clarified our message and made it about our customer. We revised our sales process
and started listening to our customers’ needs, asking them about their external problems and how
those problems were making them feel in their daily work. The results were immediate. We created
our BrandScript in December and spent the next couple of months executing our new messaging
across every part of the customer journey. Within seven months we’d seen a 118 percent increase in
overall revenue. Yes, that means we more than doubled sales. We also saw a 276 percent increase in
the number of paying customers during that same time period. And we’re still growing. In the last six
months, we’ve been increasing revenue 9 percent month over month, which really adds up!”

—EDWIN JANSEN, HEAD OF MARKETING, FITZII

“Lipscomb University is one of the fastest-growing universities in the Southeast, so it was no small
task to get all the stories of our school clear and on mission. We knew it was important, and so we
brought in StoryBrand to deliver a workshop to our entire faculty. Without question, it helped us
understand who we were, who we were serving, and what we needed to communicate to offer value.
After StoryBrand, each department felt like they were a subplot in the greater story of Lipscomb. The
most tangible way we saw results was through our outreach to the community. We stopped
positioning ourselves as the hero and instead began to serve the greater collective vision of Nashville.
All of this culminated in a series called Imagine, in which we brought in the mayor of Nashville,
Governor Bill Haslam, and former president George W. Bush to speak about how Nashville and
Lipscomb could positively contribute to the world. We stopped talking about us and we started
serving as a guide to the community around us. Since this dramatic pivot, the renewed energy around
a greater vision in which Lipscomb would play a part has resulted in more than $50 million in
donations that will go toward development. I’d say the results have been fantastic.”

—JOHN LOWRY, VICE PRESIDENT OF DEVELOPMENT, LIPSCOMB

UNIVERSITY

“I was asked to give a TED Talk about the work I do advocating for proton therapy as a treatment for
cancer. As I reviewed the enormous binder of material I wanted to cover, I realized the task was epic.
There was no way I could boil down all I wanted to say into an eighteen-minute talk. After spending
a single day with a StoryBrand facilitator, I had hope. We mapped out my talk on a whiteboard, and I
agreed to leave most of the things I wanted to talk about on the editing room floor. The talk was easy
to memorize, flowed like a short story, and engaged the audience from beginning to end. StoryBrand

-----

didn’t just help me prepare my TED Talk, they helped me understand how to better approach the
advocacy I’d been doing. It all comes down to simple, repeatable messages that grab the audience.
Without StoryBrand, I’d have never been able to clarify my message and inform the audience about a
cause I care so deeply about. With the help of StoryBrand, I hit a home run, or more appropriately, I
landed a triple luxe.”

“These Numbers Have Faces is a nonprofit working to provide educational equality in sub-Saharan
Africa, where only five percent of the population will attend university. Before StoryBrand, our
biggest problem was we were playing the hero. We talked more about our nonprofit than we did
about our students or our donors. When we did talk about our students’ problems, we talked about
their external problems rather than their internal problems, which we now know is a limited way of
approaching our messaging. After attending the StoryBrand workshop, we overhauled our messaging.
In our emails, we began to connect donors with the narrative of the mission, and on social media, we
told the stories of our heroic students. We used our StoryBrand BrandScript to draft our end-of-year
report that got significant attention. As of today, we are on track to raise more money this year than
ever before. We blew our fundraising goal out of the water. We will go into next year with the largest
cash advantage we’ve ever had. Team, donor, and student morale is at an all-time high.”

—JUSTIN ZORADI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THESE NUMBERS HAVE

FACES

“When EntreLeadership grew from a brand that basically just offered live events into a full-fledged
coaching service for small business owners, we started experiencing challenges in how to explain
what we did and how we did it. Even though we’d been writing copy and updating our website for
years, the reality was that most of the time we were just guessing at the best way to say things. As a
result, people didn’t understand our coaching service the way we thought they did. This was
frustrating because the value of our program was so obvious to us. The mistake we made was
assuming it was obvious to our customers too. We were clear . . . they were confused. That doesn’t
sell. I knew we were capable of more conversions and more effective connection with our audience,
but I wasn’t sure how to get there. It wasn’t until we brought in a StoryBrand facilitator and sat down
as a team to overhaul our entire world through the lens of the StoryBrand framework that we became
crystal clear on how to explain our coaching service. EntreLeadership has grown significantly, and
we are tracking to more than double membership in the next two years. The StoryBrand framework is
an invaluable resource, and I now expect our marketers to use it in everything we create.”

—DANIEL TARDY, VICE PRESIDENT OF ENTRELEADERSHIP, RAMSEY

SOLUTIONS

“At Marie Mae we sell beautiful paper products and office supplies. Before StoryBrand, our
marketing efforts were a jumbled mess. I once overheard a close friend talking about Marie Mae
Company . . . and it was nothing close to what we were doing. I attended a StoryBrand Marketing
Workshop and learned we were talking about the wrong things in our marketing copy. This was life
changing for our start-up. We used the framework to simplify our message down to a single tagline.
We started focusing more on the meaningful work our customers were doing and showing how they
could make an even bigger impact around the world just by choosing office products that also make
an impact. We simplified our website using the SB7 framework, and all of our marketing emails are
now run through the SB7 filter as well. In the year since we implemented the StoryBrand framework,
we have increased our revenue by 20x and gotten our products into the hands of 250,000 people. We
attribute this success largely to the clarity in our story and the shift in our marketing messages. We
are grateful.”

“Before StoryBrand, I felt like my marketing was falling flat. I felt like my business had hit a ceiling.
Going through the framework taught me I was talking about my programs all wrong. I used the
StoryBrand framework to recreate my sales material from scratch. It took quite a bit of effort to
rethink the whole thing. I dipped my toes in the water by making a few changes to key pieces of
marketing material, being sure they spoke directly to my clients’ needs. I relaunched my program
with my new sales materials and saw a massive response. A campaign that would have typically
brought in $6,000 to $9,000 brought in more than $40,000. StoryBrand is the most practical,
applicable, implementable, logical, simple, useful marketing program I’ve ever experienced. It’s
going to change everything in my business, and I’m just getting started.”
