## A CHARACTER

#### StoryBrand Principle One: The customer is the
 hero, not your brand.

### A story doesn’t begin until the hero wants something. To engage the
###### audience, the hero will need to disarm a bomb, win someone’s heart, defeat a villain, or fight for their emotional or physical survival. Until it is clear what the hero wants, the audience is left waiting for “the story to get started.” Once the storyteller defines what the hero wants, the question becomes, Will the hero get what she wants? And it’s this single question that drives what I call narrative traction.
 Positing the overall story question is why screenwriters have to define the character’s ambition within the first nine or so minutes of a film. Will the underdog get the promotion? Will the runner finish the marathon? Will the team win the championship? These are the questions that can keep an audience engaged for hours on end.
 If we want customers to engage our brand the way they engage their favorite movie, we, too, must define something the customer wants and must become known for delivering that thing and delivering it well. As soon as we define something our customer wants, we posit a series of story questions in the mind of the customer: Can this brand really help me get what I want? If so, how much does it cost, where do I get it, and how soon can they ship it to me? And what do they need to do to answer those questions? They need to buy our product.
 Recently a high-end resort hired us to help them clarify their message. Like many companies, they were experiencing an identity crisis. Their marketing collateral featured images of their restaurant, front desk, and

###### staff. It all looked nice, but unless they were trying to sell their buildings and their desk and their team, they weren’t exactly inviting customers into a story.
 What their customers wanted most, actually, was a luxurious, restful experience. After StoryBranding their resort, they changed the text on their website from long stories about themselves (which positioned them as the hero rather than the customer) to images of a warm bath, plush towels and robes, someone getting a massage in the spa, and a looping clip of a back porch rocking chair against the backdrop of trees blowing in the wind along a golf course.
 They replaced the text on their main page with short and powerful copy: “Find the luxury and rest you’ve been looking for.” That became the controlling idea that defined the culture for the entire staff too. This phrase was posted on their office walls, and to this day you can stop any team member, from the sous chef to the groundskeeper, and they will tell you their customers are looking for two things: luxury and rest. Defining exactly what their customer wanted brought clarity and camaraderie to the team because they understood their mission. Each member of the staff then understood his or her role in the story they were inviting their customers to engage in.
 One university we worked with defined their customer’s desire as “a hassle-free MBA you can complete after work.” That may sound overly simple, but don’t be fooled. Your brand will grow when people can easily remember what you offer, and people don’t remember complexity. A landscaping company humorously defined their customers’ ambition as “a yard that looks better than your neighbor’s.” A caterer we worked with in Los Angeles defined his customers’ desire as “a mobile fine-dining experience in the environment of your choice.”
 When we identify something our customer wants and communicate it simply, the story we are inviting them into is given definition and direction.
 Here are some more examples from companies we’ve worked with:

 Financial Adviser: “A Plan for Your Retirement” College Alumni Association: “Leave a Meaningful Legacy” Fine-Dining Restaurant: “A Meal Everybody Will Remember” Real Estate Agent: “The Home You’ve Dreamed About” Bookstore: “A Story to Get Lost In”

###### Breakfast Bars: “A Healthy Start to Your Day”

 When you define something your customers want, they are invited to direct their story in your direction. And if they see your brand as a trustworthy and reliable guide and believe you can deliver on your promise, they are likely to engage.

##### OPEN A STORY GAP

###### Identifying a potential desire your customer can fulfill opens what, in storyteller terms, is called a story gap. The idea is you place a gap between your hero and what they want. Moviegoers pay attention when there’s a story gap because they wonder if and how the gap is going to be closed.
 Jason Bourne is a spy who has amnesia, and we wonder if he’ll ever discover his true identity. He then finds out who he really is, which closes the gap, only for another gap to open when he wants to escape the agency that is trying to kill him. While that story gap is open, another story gap opens when he meets a young woman named Marie (enter love story subplot), and as they get together, that gap closes, only for yet another to open. Bourne and Marie have to flee the country. When they escape, that gap closes as yet another one opens. The cycle goes on and on, maintaining a taut grip on the audience’s attention up until the finale.
 Here’s a storytelling rule that you can immediately apply to your business: attention rises and lowers with the opening and closing of a story gap.
 For instance, recently I spoke to an audience of gift retailers. Because Mother’s Day was coming up, I advised the audience to open and close a story gap to drive sales. First, I told them to place a sign on the sidewalk outside the store that said, “Looking for something Mom will love for Mother’s Day? We’ve got 20 ideas under $100.” Then, in the store itself, I instructed them to place respectively numbered cards on twenty items around the store with the language: “#17 Mom Is Going to Love This.” The result? The stores reported significant increase in sales on all the numbered items. Why? Because the sign on the sidewalk opened a story gap and the numbered cards inside the store offered to close that gap. This simple

###### strategy could be repeated for Valentine’s Day, Christmas, Father’s Day, the Fourth of July, Easter, anniversaries, and on and on and on. In fact, a simple-to-produce promotion like this could be orchestrated nearly every month.
 To understand the power of a story gap is to understand what compels a human brain toward a desire. And it’s not just cinematic or literary stories. Even classical music follows the formula of the opening and closing of story gaps. Many classical sonatas can be broken into three sections: exposition, development, and recapitulation. The final section, recapitulation, is simply an altered version of the exposition that brings a sense of resolve. If that doesn’t make sense, try singing “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” without singing the final note on the word are. It will bother you to no end.
 We also see this at work in poetry. When our ears hear Lord Byron’s first line “She walks in beauty, like the night,” a story gap has been opened. We are waiting to hear a word that rhymes with night and closes the open gap in our minds. Once we hear “Of cloudless climes and starry skies,” our minds find a bit of resolution. Until the next line, that is.
 Even a good dad joke follows the opening and closing of a story gap. Opening the gap: A man accidentally ran over his neighbor’s cat and agonizingly apologized, saying he would certainly replace the cat if the neighbor wished. Closing the gap: The neighbor replied: “I’m not so sure about that. How good are you at catching mice?”
 It is my view that story gaps explain a lot more than how and why we pay attention. They also explain all of human behavior. The opening of a story gap works a magnetic force that drives every action we take and certainly every dollar we spend. Hunger is the opening of a story gap, and lunch is how we close that gap. A headache is the opening of a story gap, and aspirin is what we take to make it go away. Arousal is the opening of a story gap, ambition
 and sexual fulfillment brings its closing. There is little action in life that can’t be explained by the opening and closing of various story gaps.
 The business lesson here is that when we fail to define something our customer wants, we fail to open a story gap in their mind. When we fail to open a story gap in our customer’s mind, we give them no motivation to engage our brand because they are not left with a story question that demands resolution.

##### PARE DOWN THE CUSTOMER’S AMBITION TO A SINGLE
 FOCUS

###### A critical mistake many organizations make in defining something their customers want is not paring down that desire to a single focus. I’ve had countless conversations with frustrated business leaders who push back at this point and say, “Wait, we provide about twenty-seven things our customers want, and we talk about all of them, but sales remain flat.”
 My answer to them is this: You’re off to a good start, but listing too many benefits often backfires. Human beings cannot hold large amounts of new information in their heads at once. If you want to grow your brand (or write a good screenplay), define a single desire you are able to fulfill and then add to that desire in subsequent marketing and messaging. The objective is this: Define a specific desire your customers have and become known for helping people achieve that specific desire. If you try to open too many story gaps at once, your audience will become confused about what, exactly, you offer.
 Paring down your offering can be frustrating if your products and services fulfill many desires. The reality of a diverse brand, though, brings the same challenge many amateur screenwriters succumb to: they clutter the story by diluting their hero’s desire with too many ambitions. If Jason Bourne wants to know who he is and also lose thirty pounds and marry his high school sweetheart and finish a marathon and perhaps adopt a cat, we’ve ruined the story because the audience will have to burn too many mental calories trying to figure out what this story is about.
 As you create a BrandScript for your overall brand, focus on one simple desire your customer has and then, as you create campaigns for each division and maybe even each product, you can identify more things your customer wants in the subplots of your overall StoryBrand.
 In the following grid, you’ll get a picture of what a diverse brand might look like using the tool of various StoryBrand BrandScripts.

###### At the highest level, the most important challenge for business leaders is to define something simple and relevant their customers want and to become known for delivering on the promise. Everything else is a subplot that, after having delivered on the customer’s basic desire, will only serve to delight and surprise them all the more.

##### CHOOSE A DESIRE RELEVANT TO THE CUSTOMER’S
 SURVIVAL

-----

###### Once a brand defines what their customer wants, they are often guilty of making the second mistake: what they’ve defined isn’t related to the customer’s survival. In their desire to cast a wide net, brands define a blob of a desire that is so vague, potential customers can’t figure out why they need it in the first place.
 A leadership expert recently asked for feedback on his brand. As I reviewed his marketing material, I noticed he was making a critical mistake: he was vague when defining what his customer wanted.
 The idea behind his brand is that he imparts knowledge to potential leaders. He saw himself as a storehouse of leadership resources and wanted to be the go-to guy for achieving excellence. In fact, his tagline was “Inhale Knowledge, Exhale Success.”
 Seems clear enough, but is it? What does exhaling success even mean? He was making potential customers burn too many mental calories to figure out how he was going to help them survive and thrive.
 I recommended he make an edit to his message. Instead of saying, “Inhale Knowledge, Exhale Success,” simply say, “Helping You Become Everyone’s Favorite Leader.”
 Becoming everyone’s favorite leader means the customer would be more respected and better connected to a tribe, they’d have greater social and career opportunities, and much more. Exhaling success sounded nice, but thriving as the leader of a tribe is directly connected to survival. People will always choose a story that helps them survive and thrive.
 Fortunately, he liked the idea, mostly because that’s what he was already doing. Defining something the customer wants (to be a respected leader) and connecting it with the customer’s desire for survival (respect within a tribe) opened an enticing story gap for potential clients and, of course, coaching inquiries went up.

 What Does Survival Mean?
 When I say survival, I’m talking about that primitive desire we all have to be safe, healthy, happy, and strong. Survival simply means we have the physical, economic, and social resources to eat, drink, reproduce, and fend off foes.
 So what kinds of desires fit under this definition? Well, too many to count, but consider these examples:

-----

###### Conserving financial resources. In order to survive and thrive, your
 customers may need to conserve resources. In simple terms, this means they may need to save money. If your brand can help them save money, you’ve tapped into a survival mechanism. Walmart has built their brand on the promise of everyday low prices. Their tagline “Save Money. Live Better” further communicates savings and value and thus taps into a basic function of survival, the conservation of resources. Does it work? Even with terrifyingly low profit margins, Walmart remains one of the largest companies in the world. Conserving time. In developed countries, most of our customers have
 thankfully moved beyond the hunter-gatherer stage of survival. They are familiar, then, with the notion of opportunity costs. Can your housecleaning service give your customers more time to work on other things or more time to spend with family? Then they might be interested. Michael Hyatt’s Full Focus Planner, one of the most successful day planning systems of all time, has earned the respect of millions by offering users the invaluable gift of time. Building social networks. If our brand can help people find
 community, we’ve tapped into yet another survival mechanism. We think we’re only being nice when we bring our coworkers coffee, but what if we’re actually being nice because our primitive brains want to make connections in an effort to build a tribe in case the bad guys come knocking at the door? Add this to the fact human beings have a strong desire to nurture and be nurtured, and we’ve tapped into yet another survival mechanism. The Coach Builder Community has flourished by offering coaches the chance to build community with each other, sharing best practices and encouragement. So has every church, every sports league, every Alcoholics Anonymous chapter, every Girl Scout troop, and countless other examples of organizations and institutions that lead with the offer of community. Gaining status. Luxury brands like Mercedes and Rolex don’t make
 much practical sense in terms of survival, right? In fact, spending lots of money buying a luxury car when a more common brand would do the trick seems counter to our survival, doesn’t it? Not when you consider the importance of status. Gaining status, in any
