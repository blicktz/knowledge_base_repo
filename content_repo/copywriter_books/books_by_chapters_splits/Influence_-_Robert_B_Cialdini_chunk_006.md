While waiting to board a flight at O’Hare, I heard a desk agent announce that the flight was
overbooked and, if passengers were willing to take a later plane, they would be
compensated with a voucher worth $10,000! Of course, this exaggerated amount was a
joke. It was supposed to make people laugh. It did. But I noticed that when he then
revealed the actual offer (a $200 voucher), there were no takers. In fact, he had to raise the
offer twice to $300 and then $500 before he got any volunteers. I was reading your book at

the time and I realized that, although he got his laugh, according to the contrast principle he
screwed up. He arranged things so that, compared to $10,000, a couple hundred bucks
seemed like a pittance. That was an expensive laugh. It cost his airline an extra $300 per
volunteer.

**Author’s note: Any ideas on how the desk agent could have used the contrast principle**
to his advantage rather than his detriment? Perhaps he could have started with a $2 joke
offer and then revealed the true—and now much more attractive sounding—$200 amount.
Under those circumstances, I’m pretty sure he would have secured his laugh _and his_
volunteers.

## SUMMARY

#### Ethologists, researchers who study animal behavior in the natural environment, have noticed that among many animal species, behavior often occurs in rigid and mechanical patterns. Called fixed-action patterns, these mechanical sequences are noteworthy in their similarity to certain automatic (click, run) responses by humans. For both humans and subhumans, the automatic-behavior patterns tend to be triggered by a single feature of the relevant information in the situation. This single feature, or trigger feature, can often prove valuable by allowing an individual to decide on a correct course of action without having to analyze carefully and completely each of the other pieces of information in the situation.

 The advantage of such shortcut responding lies in its efficiency and economy; by reacting automatically to a normally informative trigger feature, an individual preserves crucial time, energy, and mental capacity. The disadvantage of such responding lies in its vulnerability to silly and costly mistakes; by reacting to only a piece of the available information (even a usually predictive piece), an individual increases the chances of error, especially when responding in an automatic, mindless fashion. The chances of error increase even further when other individuals seek to profit by arranging (through manipulation of trigger features) to stimulate a desired behavior at inappropriate times.

#### Much of the compliance process (wherein one person is spurred to comply with another person’s request) can be understood in terms of a human tendency for automatic, shortcut responding. Most of us have developed a set of trigger features for compliance—that is, specific pieces of information that normally tell us when compliance with a request is likely to be correct and beneficial. Each of these trigger features for compliance can be used like a lever (of influence) to move people to agree with requests.

 Perceptual contrast—the tendency to see two things that are different from one another as being more different than they actually are—is a lever of influence used by some compliance practitioners. For example, real-estate agents may show prospective home buyers one or two unattractive options before showing them a more attractive home, which then seems more attractive than it would have if shown first. An advantage of employing this lever of influence is that its tactical use typically goes unrecognized.
