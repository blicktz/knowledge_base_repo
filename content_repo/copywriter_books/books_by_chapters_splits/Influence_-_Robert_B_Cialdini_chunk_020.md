### Truths Are Us

#### When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate one another.

**—Eric Hoffer**

#### A few years ago, the managers of a chain of restaurants in Beijing, China, partnered with researchers to accomplish something decidedly profitable— increasing the purchase of certain menu items in a way that was effective yet costless. They wanted to see if they could get customers to choose them more frequently without lowering the items’ prices or using more expensive ingredients or hiring a chef who had more experience with the dishes or paying a consultant to write more enticing descriptions of them on the menu. They wanted to see if, instead, they could just give the dishes a label that would do the trick. Although they found a label that worked particularly well, they were surprised it wasn’t one they’d thought to use previously for this purpose, such as “Specialty of the house” or “Our chef’s recommendation for tonight.” Rather, the label merely described the menu items as the restaurant’s “most popular.”
 The outcome was impressive. Sales of each dish jumped by an average of 13 to 20 percent. Quite simply, the dishes became more popular because of their popularity. Notably, the increase occurred through a persuasive practice that was costless, completely ethical (the items were indeed the most popular), easy to implement, and yet never before employed by the managers. Something similar happened in London when a local brewery with a pub on its premises agreed to try an experiment. The pub placed a sign on the bar stating, truthfully, that the brewery’s most popular beer that week was its porter. Porter sales doubled immediately. Click, run.

#### Results such as these make me wonder why other retailers don’t provide similar information. In ice-cream or frozen-yogurt shops, customers can often choose from an array of toppings for their order—chocolate bits or coconut flakes or cookie crumbles, and so on. Owing to the pull of the popular, you’d think managers would know to post signs describing the most frequently chosen topping or topping combination that month. But, they don’t. Too bad for them. Especially for customers who wouldn’t order a topping or who would order just one, true popularity information should result in more selections. For example, many McDonald’s restaurants offer a “McFlurry” dessert. When customers in one set of McDonald’s were told, “How about a dessert? The McFlurry is our visitors’ favorite,” McFlurry sales jumped 55 percent. Then, after a customer ordered a McFlurry, if the clerk said, “The [x] flavor is our visitors’ favorite McFlurry topping,” customers increased their extra topping purchases by an additional 48 percent.

Although not all retailers understand how to harness popularity profitably, media giant
Netflix learned that lesson from its own data and began operating on it immediately.
According to technology and entertainment reporter Nicole LaPorte (2018), the company
had “long prided itself on being highly secretive about things like watch-time and ratings,
gleefully reveling in the fact that because Netflix doesn’t have to answer to advertisers, it
doesn’t need to reveal any numbers.” But in an unexpected 2018 policy reversal, it began
off-loading reams of information about its most successful offerings. As LaPorte put it, “In
its letter to shareholders, Netflix rattled off titles and how many people had streamed them
in a way that felt like a drunken sailor had taken over the normally heavily fortified
battleship and was spilling trade secrets.”

Why? By then, company officials had seen that popularity precipitates popularity. Chief
Product Officer Greg Peters disclosed the results of internal tests in which Netflix members
who were told which shows were popular, then made them more so. Other company
executives were quick on the uptake. Content head Ted Sarandros declared that going
forward, Netflix would be more forthcoming “about what people are watching around the
world.” Chairman and CEO Reed Hastings affirmed this promise, stating, “We’re just
beginning to share that data. We’ll be leaning into that more quarter by quarter.”

**Author’s note: These statements from Netflix executives tell us there are no dummies**
in leadership there. But one additional statement by Sarandros was most impressive to me:
“Popularity is a data point that people can choose to use . . . We don’t want to suppress it if
it’s helpful to members.” The key insight is that suppressing true popularity, as the
company had done in the past, was unhelpful not only to its immediate profits but also to
