### The headline for an ad for an industrial mixing device reads, “Ten Million to One, We Can Mix It.” At first, this sounds like a wager; the company is betting ten million to one that its mixer can handle your mixing applications. But when you read the copy, you discover that the real significance of “ten million to one” is the mixer’s ability to mix two fluids where one fluid is as much as ten million times thicker than the other. The headline has a double meaning, and you have to read the copy to get the real message.

 3. News Headlines

 If you have news about your product, announce it in the headline. This news can be the introduction of a new product, an improvement of an existing product (“new, improved Bounty”), or a new application for an old product. Some examples of headlines that contain news:

“Trump’s Tougher Immigration Policies Has Democrats
Political
Seething.”

“Finally, a Caribbean Cruise as Good as Its Brochure” Norwegian Cruise Line

Commodities trading
“The Greatest Market Discovery Ever Made”
newsletter

### The Norwegian Cruise Line headline, in addition to containing news, has added appeal because it empathizes with the reader’s situation. We’ve all been disappointed by fancy travel brochures that promise better than they deliver. Norwegian gains credibility in our eyes by calling attention to this well-known fact.

 4. How-to Headlines

 The words how to can be pure magic in advertising headlines, magazine articles, and book titles. There are more than seven thousand books in print with how to in their titles. Many advertising writers claim if you begin with how to, you can’t write a bad headline. They may be right.

-----

### How-to headlines offer the promise of solid information, sound advice, and solutions to problems: “How to Turn a Simple Party into a Royal Ball.” “How to Write Better and Faster.” “How to Stop Smoking in 30 Days … Or Your Money Back.” “How to Use Webinars to Drive the Buying Cycle.”
 Whenever I’m stuck for a headline, I type “How to” on the page, and what follows those words is always a decent, hardworking headline: good enough to use until something better comes along.

 5. Question Headlines

 To be effective, the question headline must ask a question that the reader can empathize with or would like to see answered. Some examples:

“What in the World Is Wrong with Me?” Health magazine

“When an Employee Gets Sick, How Long Does It Take Your Company
Life insurance
to Recover?”

Gorman-Rupp
“Is Your Pump Costing You More to Operate Than It Should?”
pumps

“Do You Close the Bathroom Door Even When You’re the Only One
_Psychology Today_
Home?”

“Have You Have Any of These Decorating Problems?” Carpet store

“What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes
Lack?”

Business
magazine

### Question headlines should always focus on the reader’s self-interest, curiosity, and needs, and not on the advertiser’s. A typical self-serving question headline used by many companies reads something like, “Do You Know What the XYZ Company Is Up to These Days?” The reader’s response is “Who cares?” and turns the page or exits from the Web page.

 6. Command Headlines

 Command headlines generate sales by telling your prospects what to do. Here are a few command headlines:

-----

“Try Burning This Coupon” Harshaw Chemical

“Subscribe Today and get a FREE Special Issue Instantly.” _Prevention_

“Aim High. Reach for New Horizons.” U.S. Air Force

### Note that the first word in the command headline is a strong verb demanding action on the part of the reader.

 7. Reason-Why Headlines

 One easy and effective way of writing body copy is to list the sales features of your product in simple 1-2-3 fashion. If you write your ad this way, you can use a reason-why headline to introduce the list.
 Examples of reason-why headlines include “Five Reasons Why You Can’t Afford to Miss the MoneyShow Toronto” and “120 to 4,000 Reasons Why You Should Buy Your Fur During the Next Four Days.”
 Reason-why headlines need not contain the phrase “reason why.” Other introductory phrases such as “6 ways,” “7 steps,” and “here’s how” can do just as well.

 8. Testimonial Headlines

 In a testimonial advertisement, your customers do your selling for you. An example of a testimonial are the Publishers Clearinghouse commercials in which past winners tell us how they won big prize money in the sweepstakes. Testimonials work because they offer proof that a business satisfies its customers.
 In print ad testimonials, the copy is written as if spoken by the customer, who is usually pictured in the ad. Quotation marks around the headline and the body copy signal the reader that the ad is a testimonial.
 When writing testimonial copy, use the customer’s own words as much as possible. Don’t polish his statements; a natural, conversational tone adds believability to the testimonial.

-----

### THE “UNATTRIBUTED TESTIMONIAL”

Even if the words are not a testimonial or quotation, put quotation marks around your
headline, if it is strong. Quotation marks catch the reader’s eye and create the impression
that the words are a quotation or at least factual, even though they are not attributed to any
particular speaker or source.

### 38 MODEL HEADLINES FOR YOUR “SWIPE FILE”

 A “swipe file” is a collection of promotions that you turn to for reference when creating your own marketing materials. The best way to get ideas for headlines when you are stuck is to keep a swipe file and consult it for inspiration when you sit down to write a new ad or mailing.
 The best swipe samples are those that keep running. You know they are being repeated—because they are profitable. Put a red X on any swipe samples you see multiple times, so you can identify winners at a glance.
 As a shortcut, here’s a partial collection of such headlines from my vast swipe file, organized by category so as to make clear the approach being used:

 1. Ask a question in the headline.
 “What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?” 2. Tie-in to current events.
 “Stay One Step Ahead of the Stock Market Just Like Martha Stewart —But Without Her Legal Liability!” 3. Create a new terminology.
 “New ‘Polarized Oil’ Magnetically Adheres to Wear Parts in Machine Tools, Making Them Last Up to 6 Times Longer.” 4. Give news using the words “new,” “introduction,” or
 “announcing.” “Announcing a Painless Cut in Defense Spending.” 5. Give the reader a command—tell him to do something.
 “Try Burning This Coupon.”

-----

### 6. Use numbers and statistics.
 “Who Ever Heard of 17,000 Blooms from a Single Plant?” 7. Promise the reader useful information.
 “How to Avoid the Biggest Mistake You Can Make in Building or Buying a Home.” 8. Highlight your offer.
 “You Can Now Subscribe to the Best New Books—Just as You Do to a Magazine.” 9. Tell a story.
 “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano, But When I Started to Play…” 10. Make a recommendation.
 “The 5 High-Yield Stocks You Must Own NOW.” 11. State a benefit.
 “Managing UNIX Data Centers—Once Difficult, Now Easy.” 12. Make a comparison.
 “How to Solve Your Emissions Problems—at Half the Energy Cost of Conventional Venturi Scrubbers.” 13. Use words that help the reader visualize.
 “Why Some Foods ‘Explode’ in Your Stomach.” 14. Use a testimonial.

 “The One Internet Stock You MUST Own Now. Hint: It’s NOT What You Think!” 18. Promise to reveal a secret.
 “Unlock Wall Street’s Secret Logic.”

### 19. Be specific.
 “At 60 Miles an Hour, the Loudest Noise in This New Rolls-Royce Comes from the Electric Clock.” 20. Target a particular type of reader.
 “We’re Looking for People Who Want a Higher-Paying Career.” 21. Add a time element.
 “Instant Incorporation While U-Wait.” 22. Stress cost savings, discounts, or value.

 “You’re Never Too Old to Hear Better.” 24. Offer an alternative to other products and services.

### 33. Show ROI (return on investment) for purchase of your product.
 “Hiring the Wrong Person Costs You Three Times Their Annual Salary.” 34. Use a reasons-why headline.

 “7 Questions to Ask Before You Hire a Collection Agency … and One Good Answer to Each.” 36. Stress the value of your premiums.
 “Yours Free—Order Now and Receive $280 in Free Gifts with Your Paid Subscription.” 37. Help the reader achieve a goal.
 “Now You Can Create a Breakthrough Marketing Plan Within the Next 30 Days … for FREE!” 38. Make a seemingly contradictory statement or promise.
 “Cool Any Room in Your House Fast—Without Air Conditioning!”

 Notice that many of these headline use numbers. Numbers attract the reader’s eye. They should always be written as numerals. If you say “7 reasons why,” prospects want to know the seven reasons and will read the ad to learn them. Also ads and content written as lists, or “listicles,” which look more like editorial content, are easy to write and easy to read.

 THE 4 U’S FORMULA FOR WRITING EFFECTIVE HEADLINES

 When prospects see your ad, they make a quick decision, usually in a couple of seconds, to read it or turn the page, based largely on the subject line. But given the flood of commercial messages today, how can you convince a busy prospect—in just a few words—that your ad is worthy of attention?
 The “4 U’s” copywriting formula—which stands for urgent, unique, ultra-specific, and useful—can help.

-----

### Developed by my colleague Mark Ford for writing more powerful headlines, the 4 U’s formula states that strong headlines are:

 1. Urgent. Urgency gives the reader a reason to act now instead of later. You can create a sense of urgency in your headline by incorporating a time element. For instance, “Make $100,000 working from home this year” has a greater sense of urgency than “Make $100,000 working from home.” A sense of urgency can also be created with a time-limited special offer, such as a discount or premium if you order by a certain date. Many digital marketers give prospects twenty-four hours or less to take advantage of the offer on their screen. Once the offer period is over, the offer is no longer available. However, I have found consumers find “offer extended” after the expiration deadline credible and acceptable.
 2. Unique. The powerful headline either says something new or, if it says something the reader has heard before, says it in a new and fresh way. For example, “Why Japanese women have beautiful skin” was the headline in an e-mail promoting a Japanese bath kit. This is different from the typical “Save 10% on Japanese Bath Kits.”
 3. Ultra-specific. Bottom Line, Inc. (formerly Boardroom), a newsletter publisher, is the absolute master of ultra-specific bullets, known as “fascinations,” that tease the reader into reading further and ordering the product. Examples: “What never to eat on an airplane,” “Bills it’s okay to pay late,” and “Best time to file for a tax refund.”
 4. Useful. The strong subject line appeals to the reader’s self-interest by offering a benefit. In the headline “An Invitation to Ski & Save,” the benefit is saving money.

 When you have written your headline, ask yourself how strong it is in each of the 4 U’s. Use a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = weak, 4 = strong) to rank it in each category.
 Rarely will a headline rate a 3 or 4 on all four U’s. But if your headline doesn’t rate a 3 or 4 on at least three of the U’s, it’s probably not as strong as it could be—and can benefit from some rewriting.

-----

### A common mistake is to defend a weak headline by pointing to a good response. A better way to think is as follows: if the ad generated a profitable response despite a weak headline, imagine how much more money you could have made by applying the 4 U’s.
 A marketer wrote to tell me he had sent out a successful e-mail marketing campaign with the subject line “Free Special Report.” How does this stack up against the 4 U’s?

 • Urgent. There is no urgency or sense of timeliness. On a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the highest rating, “Free Special Report” is a 1.

 • Unique. Not every marketer offers a free special report, but a lot of them do. So “Free Special Report” rates only a 2 in terms of uniqueness.

 • Ultra-specific. Could the marketer have been less specific than “Free Special Report”? Yes, he could have just said “Free Bonus Gift.” So we rate “Free Special Report” a 2 instead of a 1.

 • Useful. I suppose the reader is smart enough to figure that the report contains some helpful information. On the other hand, the usefulness is in the specific information contained in the report, which isn’t even hinted at in the headline. And does the recipient, who already has too much to read, really need yet another “free special report”? I rate it a 2. Specifying the topic would help (e.g., “Free special report reveals how to cut training costs up to 90% with e-learning”).

 I urge you to go through this exercise with every headline you write. You can also apply the formula to other copy, both online and offline, including e-mail subject lines, direct-mail envelope teasers, letter leads, Web page headlines, subheads, and bullets.
 Rate the headline you’ve written in all 4 U’s. Then rewrite it so you can upgrade your rating on at least two and preferably three or four of the categories by at least 1 point. This simple exercise can increase readership and response rates substantially with very little effort.

 MORE HEADLINE TIPS

-----

### Here are a few points to consider when evaluating headlines:

 Does the headline promise a benefit or a reward for reading the ad? Is the headline clear and direct? Does it get its point across simply and quickly? Is the headline as specific as it can be? (“Lose 19 Pounds in Three Weeks” is a better headline than “Lose Weight Fast.”) Does the headline reach out and grab your attention with a strong sales message, dramatically stated in a fresh new way? Does the headline relate logically to the product? (Avoid “sensationalist” headlines that lure you with ballyhoo and then fail to deliver what they promise.) Do the headline and visual work together to form a total selling concept? Does the headline arouse curiosity and lure the reader into the body copy? Does the headline select the audience? Is the brand name mentioned in the headline? Is the advertiser’s name mentioned in the headline? Avoid blind headlines—the kinds that don’t mean anything unless you read the copy underneath. (“Give It a Hand” is a blind headline used in a recent ad for facial powder.) Avoid irrelevant wordplay, puns, gimmicks, and other copywriter’s tricks. They may make for amusing advertising, but they do not sell products. Avoid negatives. (Instead of “Contains No Sodium,” write “100% Sodium-Free.”)

 A TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCING HEADLINES

 No two copywriters have identical methods for producing headlines. Some writers spend 90 percent of their writing time coming up with dozens of headlines before they write one word of body copy. Others write the body copy first and extract the headline from this copy. Many copywriters keep

-----

### swipe files of published ads and use headlines from these ads as inspiration for their own advertisements (I gave you thirty-eight of these from my personal collection earlier).
 Copywriters who work at big agencies often rely on art directors to help them develop the concept. But I believe professional copywriters should be able to generate headlines, concepts, and ideas on their own.
 Let me tell you how I go about writing a headline. You may find these techniques useful in your own work. First, I ask four questions:

 1. Who is my customer? 2. What are the important features of the product? 3. Which of these features do competing products lack? 4. Why will the customer want to buy the product? (What product
 feature delivers the benefit most important to him?)
