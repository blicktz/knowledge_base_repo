## AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION

#### StoryBrand Principle Five: Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take
 action.

### At this point in the story we are inviting our customer into, they are
###### excited. We’ve defined a desire, identified their challenges, empathized with their frustrations, proved our competency, and given them a plan. But they still need us to do one more thing: they need us to call them to action.

##### ASK THEM TO PLACE AN ORDER

###### In stories, characters never take action on their own. They have to be challenged to take action. Tom Cruise’s character would never have journeyed to pick up his brother in the movie Rain Man unless he’d received a call explaining his father had died. Romeo wouldn’t have climbed into the Capulet courtyard unless he’d fallen hopelessly in love with Juliet. Elle Woods wouldn’t have applied to Harvard unless she’d been dumped by her boyfriend. Liam Neeson’s character wouldn’t have chased the bad guys to Europe unless his daughter had been kidnapped.
 The reason characters have to be provoked into taking action is because everybody sitting in the dark theater knows human beings do not make major changes in their lives unless something challenges them to do so.
 If I wrote a story about a guy who wanted to climb Everest and then one day looked at himself in the mirror and decided to do it, the audience would

-----

###### feel that something was wrong in the story itself. Making sudden decisions to change and then taking action on that decision is not how human beings operate. Bodies at rest tend to stay at rest, and so do customers. Heroes need to be challenged by outside forces.
 Have you ever wondered why late-night infomercial hosts keep screaming, “Call now! Don’t delay!” over and over as though they’re trying to wake people up from a zombie trance? They do that because they’re trying to wake people up from a zombie trance.
 Your customers are bombarded with more than three thousand commercial messages per day, and unless we are bold in our calls to action, we will be ignored. If our calls to action are soft, they will not be noticed.

 Do Not Put Customers in the Mind-Reading Business
 A mentor once gave me terrific leadership advice that also applies to marketing and messaging: do not put people in the mind-reading business. He was emphasizing the need to communicate clearly. If you think people are able infer what you mean, you’re mistaken. People who get what they want know how to ask in clear, simple language. And if you want customers to place an order, you, too, should ask using clear, simple language.
 When it’s time to ask for the order, we often use phrases like “If you’re interested, let me know,” but let’s think about the passivity of that statement for a moment. Put yourself in the mind of the customer when they hear a statement like that. What ideas are they actually having to process subconsciously in response to that statement? Am I interested? I’m not sure. How would I contact you? What happens if I’m not interested? Is there going to be weirdness between us if I decide not to buy? What if the product doesn’t work for me? Why aren’t you going to contact me? Why do I have to be the one who contacts you? And the saddest thought that a customer could have is, I’m ready to place an order now, but this guy wants me to contact him later. I hope I remember to do that.
 Next time you’re closing a sale, try this statement instead: If you’re struggling with “X,” which it sounds like you are, I think buying “Y” is the right decision. I can take your order now and you won’t have to struggle with “X” anymore. Would you like to place an order right now?
 When I’m asked to speak to a group of sales professionals, I often ask the audience to pull out their laptops so we can write a sales email right there in the room. I ask them to hold up their hand if they have a client

-----

###### sitting on the fence, and of course every hand in the room goes up. I then walk them through a formula for a follow-up email using the SB7 framework, and we end with the call to action I just included for you above. Then, I tell the audience to hit “Send.” Without exception, those emails have resulted in thousands and often millions in sales. In fact, the process works so well that my team and I guarantee that we will close more in sales during the training sessions themselves than we were paid to be there. We’ve never failed to deliver. In fact, the last time I guided a group of 250 account executives for a company called Calix, a growing broadband infrastructure and support provider for broadband services, through the process they closed more than 2.5 million in sales off the emails that went out during a single hour of the training. The CFO called my office a few days later to say he’d never seen anything like it in all his years in business. Why did that sales team close so many sales? Because the customers on the other end of those emails had experienced empathy and clarity about the problem they were facing and assurance that Calix’s products would solve those problems. Those emails positioned the customer as the hero and the account executive as the guide, and they gave the client confidence that their story would end well. Plus, the calls to action were clear: Our product will solve your problem; would you like to place an order now?

 The Power of the “Buy Now” Button
 I have a friend who has bought and sold nearly one hundred companies. He knows a lot about scaling a business, and as he evaluates a company, he makes sure the people, products, and procedures are all healthy. But the key ingredient he looks for before he will buy a company is whether the sales process is correctly challenging their customers to place orders. Why? Because my friend knows the fastest way to grow a business is to make the calls to action clear and then repeat them over and over. He’s made millions simply buying companies, creating stronger calls to action, and then selling those businesses after the revenue predictably increases.
 One of the biggest hindrances to business success is wrongly assuming customers can read our minds. It’s obvious to us that we want them to place an order (why else would we be talking to them about our products?), so we assume it’s obvious to them too. It isn’t.
 Specifically, as it relates to marketing, there should be a “Buy Now” button in the top right corner of your website, and it shouldn’t be cluttered

-----

###### with a bunch of other buttons. Your “Buy Now” button should be the obvious button to press, meaning it should be featured in a different font or a brighter color than the other buttons on the page. In short, your “Buy Now” or “Add to Cart” or “Schedule a Call” button should be the obvious button to press. The same call to action should be repeated above the fold and in the center of the header on your website, and then featured again and again as customers scroll down your page.
 Companies that don’t make their calls to action clear remind me of my dating days before I met my wife. Instead of clearly asking a girl out, I’d say something like, “If you ever want to get coffee, I’d be up for that. Do you like coffee?”
 What in the world is a woman supposed to do with a question like that? That’s just not how you make a baby.
 As I got older I realized the power of clarity. In fact, the way my wife and I got together was probably the clearest I’ve communicated about anything. I’d known Betsy from a distance for a while, but when I finally got up the courage to ask her out, I discovered she had a boyfriend. Still, I’d been passive long enough. I’d been hoping she’d notice how much I liked her even as I doled out vague and passive hints. It was time for a strong call to action. The next time I saw her, I told her how I really felt and that I’d like to call her in thirty days to ask her out. I said she’d need to ditch the other guy to keep things from being awkward.
 Amazingly, thirty days later, she was out of that relationship and we started dating. About a year later we got married. And now we have a baby. Turns out the StoryBrand framework is effective in a lot more than marketing, but I will save that for a later book.
 The moral of the story is to make your call to action clear by asking customers a yes/no question. Statements like “If you’re interested, let me know” do not prompt our customers to accept or reject our offer and instead send them off into a whirlwind of confusion. The chances of our customers going home, pouring a drink, and meditating on our vague offer are next to zero, so don’t expect to close many sales if you’re passive and confusing.
 When I was a kid there was a guy on late-night television who used to saw mattresses in half with a chainsaw. He’d scream at the camera that he’d gone crazy and was slashing prices on all kinds of furniture. He was effective, but he also looked a little foolish. A lot of us are afraid to ask for the sale because we don’t want to look like an infomercial pitch man, but

-----

###### very few people reading this book are ever going to come off as pushy. Of the thousands of clients we’ve worked with, we’ve yet to encounter anybody who oversells. Most people think they’re overselling when, in truth, their calls to action fall softer than a whisper.

 Do You Believe in Your Product?
 When we try to sell passively, we communicate a lack of belief in our product. When we don’t ask for the sale clearly, the customer senses weakness. When we are vague, our customers think we’re asking them for charity rather than standing in the confidence that our product can change their lives. Customers aren’t looking for brands that are filled with doubt and in need of affirmation; they’re looking for brands that have solutions to their problems.
 If we can change our customer’s story for the better, why shouldn’t we be bold about inviting them to do business with us? The guide in a movie must be direct about what they want the hero to do; otherwise, the guide comes off as weak and the audience experiences cognitive dissonance and loses interest.

 Two Kinds of Calls to Action
 At StoryBrand, we recommend two kinds of calls to action: direct calls to action and transitional calls to action. These calls to action work in two different phases of the guide/hero relationship.
 Let’s say we ask a customer to buy but they aren’t ready. Who knows why, but they aren’t ready. There’s no reason to end the relationship just because they want more time. In fact, most customers, especially if the item is expensive or if the sales process is complicated, rightly need more time. If this is the case, we want to deepen the relationship so that whenever they are ready, they will remember us. The way I deepen that relationship is through transitional calls to action.
 Direct calls to action include requests like “buy now,” “schedule an appointment,” or “call today.” A direct call to action is something that leads to a sale or at least is the first step down a path that leads to a sale.
 Transitional calls to action, however, do not require a purchase but do require some sort of commitment that further builds toward a trusting relationship. Transitional calls to action can be used to “on-ramp” potential

###### customers to an eventual purchase. Inviting people to watch a webinar or download a PDF are good examples of transitional calls to action.
 To further the relational metaphor, a transitional call to action is like asking your customer, “Can I take you out on a date?” and a direct call to action is like popping the question, “Will you marry me?”
 In our marketing collateral, we always want to have a direct call to action and a transitional call to action. A metaphorical conversation with our customers goes like this:

 Us: Will you marry me? Customer: No. Us: Will you go out with me again? Customer: Yes. Us: Will you marry me now? Customer: No. Us: Will you go out with me again? Customer: Sure, you’re interesting and the information you provide is
 helpful. I will go out with you again. Us: Will you marry me? Customer: Okay, I’ll marry you now.

 As a brand, it’s our job to pursue our customers. We want to get to know them and for them to get to know us, but we are the ones who need to take the initiative and keep the relationship alive and flourishing, even if they aren’t ready to place an order.

##### THOSE WHO ASK AGAIN AND AGAIN SHALL FINALLY
 RECEIVE

###### Now that you’ve read this chapter, you will begin to notice how good brands build relationships, even using text on landing pages, lead generators, and emails. Years ago I was preparing a keynote presentation for a global shampoo brand and my graphic designer was too busy with other projects to help. Not wanting to wait, I decided to outsource the

-----

###### presentation to a design house. I went looking online for a shop that dealt specifically with presentations and found two local houses that could help.
 The first website I visited was beautifully designed—including a looping video loaded beneath text that explained the design house’s values and priorities. After about twenty seconds admiring the look of their site, though, I started searching for information about how to do business with them. I couldn’t find anything. They featured samples of previous projects, a few testimonials, and a phone number I could call but no direct, clear call to action. So I decided to check out their competitor’s site.
 The other company’s site wasn’t nearly as beautiful, but it dared to be clear. “If you’re worried about a presentation, we can help you hit a grand slam.” The truth is I was worried about my presentation, and they spoke to my internal fear. They also painted a picture of a climactic scene: hitting a grand slam. Then they asked me out: They offered a PDF called “5 Things Great Presenters Get Right,” and I was quite curious. I downloaded the PDF and read it in a few minutes. Their transitional call to action earned my trust and positioned them as the guide in my story. They had authority, it seemed, because in the lead generator they talked about all the other leaders they had helped. Then they sent me emails with helpful information about giving good keynotes. Each email would ask me to schedule a call, but for the first couple of weeks I ignored that request. After reading yet another helpful email, though, about two weeks out, I clicked on a link that took me back to their website. On their website, they had a clear and bright “Schedule a Call” button, and because they’d wined and dined me, I did. I scheduled a call. I never went back to the initial designer’s website (which, remember, was much better looking) because, although they had an impressive-looking site, they’d failed to build a trusting relationship with me, and before long I was gladly writing a check for several thousand dollars to the company that had clearly built a relationship over time and then challenged me to take action.

 Direct Calls to Action
 It bears repeating: there should be one obvious button to press on your website, and that button should be the direct call to action. When I say, “one obvious button,” I don’t mean “only one button” but rather one that stands out.

-----

###### Our customers should always know we want to marry them. Even if they’re not ready, we should keep letting them know where we’d like the relationship to go. Customers don’t buy when we are ready for them to buy; they buy only when two realities overlap: they realize they have a problem and they remember you have a solution. If they don’t have a problem, they aren’t going to place an order; if they do have a problem but forgot you have a solution, they will make a purchase from somebody else who had made the effort to ask them out, spend time with them, and build trust. You just never know when a customer is going to want to make a commitment, and when they do, you want to be on one knee, holding flowers, smiling for the picture.
 Examples of direct calls to action are

 Order now Call today Schedule an appointment Register today Buy now

 Direct calls to action can be included at the end of every email blast, on signage, in our radio ads, and even in our television commercials. Consider including direct calls to action in every team member’s email signature and, if you really want to get the point across, on all your business cards. The idea is to make it very clear what we’d like customers to do: to make a purchase so we can help them solve their problem.
