 Getting Distribution

Most advertisers are confronted with the problem of getting distribution.
National advertising is unthinkable without that. A venture cannot be profitable if nine
in ten of the converts fail to find the goods.

To force dealers to stock by bringing repeated demands may be enormously
expensive. To cover the country with a selling force is usually impossible. To get dealers
to stock an unknown line on promise of advertising is not easy. They have seen too
many efforts fail, too many promises rescinded.

We cannot discuss all plans for getting distribution. There are scores of ways
employed, according to the enterprise. Some start by soliciting direct sales — mail orders
— until the volume of demand forces dealers to supply.

Some get in touch with prospects by a sample or other offer, then refer them to
certain dealers who are stocked.

Some well-known lines can get a large percentage of dealers to stock in advance
under guarantee of sale. Some consign goods to jobbers so dealers can easily order. Some
name certain dealers in their ads until dealers in general stock.

The problems in this line are numberless. The successful methods are many. But
most of them apply to lines too few to be worthy of discussion in a book like this.

We shall deal here with articles of wide appeal and repeated sales, like foods or
proprietary articles.

We usually start with local advertising, even though magazine advertising is best
adapted to the article. We get our distribution town by town, then change to national
advertising.

Sometimes we name the dealers who are stocked. As others stock, we add their
names. When a local campaign is proposed, naming certain dealers, the average dealer
wants to be included. It is often possible to get most of them by offering to name them
in the first few ads.

Whether you advertise few or many dealers, the others will stock in very short
order if the advertising is successful. Then the trade is referred to all dealers.

-----

The sample plans dealt with in the previous chapter aid quick distribution. They
often pay for themselves in this way alone.

If the samples are distributed locally, the coupon names the store. The prospects
who go there to get the samples know that those stores are supplied, if a nearer dealer is
not. Thus little trade is lost.

When sample inquiries come to the advertiser, inquiries are referred to certain
dealers at the start. Enough demand is centered there to force those dealers to supply it.

Sometimes most stores are supplied with samples, but on the requirement of a
certain purchase. You supply a dozen samples with a dozen packages, for instance. Then
inquiries for samples are referred to all stores. This quickly forces general distribution.
Dealers don’t like to have their customers go to competitors even for a sample.

Where a coupon is used, good at any store for a full-size package, the problem of
distribution becomes simple. Mail to dealers proofs of the ad which will contain a
coupon. Point out to each that many of his customers are bound to present that coupon.
Each coupon represents a cash sale at full profit. No average dealer will let those coupon
customers go elsewhere.

Such a free-package offer often pays for itself in this way. It forms the cheapest
way of getting general distribution.

Some of the most successful advertisers have done this in a national way. They
have inserted coupon ads in magazines, each coupon good at any store for a full-size
package. A proof of the ad is sent to dealers in advance, with a list of the magazines to
be used, and their circulation.

In this way, in one week sometimes, makers attain a reasonable national
distribution. And the coupon ad, when it appears, completes it. Here again the free
packages cost less than other ways of forcing distribution. And they start thousands of
users besides. Palmolive Soap and Puffed Grains are among the products which attain
their distribution in that way.

Half the circulation of a newspaper may go to outside towns. That half may be
wasted if you offer a sample at local stores. Say in your coupon that outside people
should write you for a sample. When they write, do not mail the sample. Send the
samples to a local store, and refer inquiries to that store. Mailing a sample may make a
convert who cannot be supplied. But the store which supplies the sample will usually
supply demand. In these ways, many advertisers get national distribution without
employing a single salesman. They get it immediately. And they get it at far lower cost

than by any other method. There are advertisers who, in starting, send every dealer a few
packages as a gift. That is better, perhaps, than losing customers created. But it is very
expensive. Those free packages must be sold by advertising. Figure their cost at your
selling price, and you will see that you are paying a high cost per dealer. A salesman
might sell these small stocks at a lower cost. And other methods might be vastly cheaper.

Sending stocks on consignment to retailers is not widely favored. Many dealers
resent it. Collections are difficult. And non-businesslike methods do not win dealer
respect.

The plans advocated here are the best plans yet discovered for the lines to which
they apply. Other lines require different methods. The ramifications are too many to
discuss in a book like this.

But don’t start advertising without distribution. Don’t get distribution by
methods too expensive. Or by slow, old-fashioned methods. The loss of time may cost
you enormously in sales. And it may enable energetic rivals to get ahead of you.

Go to men who know by countless experiences the best plan to apply to your
line.

 Test Campaigns

Almost any question can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally, by a test
campaign. And that’s the way to answer them — not by arguments around a table. Go to
the court of last resort — the buyers of your product.

On every new project there comes up the question of selling that article
profitably. You and your friends may like it, but the majority may not. Some rival
product may be better liked or cheaper. It may be strongly entrenched. The users won
away from it may cost too much to get.

People may buy and not repeat. The article may last too long. It may appeal to a
small percentage, so most of your advertising goes to waste.

There are many surprises in advertising. A project you will laugh at may make a
great success. A project you are sure of may fall down. All because tastes differ so. None
of us know enough peoples desires to get an average viewpoint.

In the old days, advertisers ventured on their own opinions. The few guess right,
the many wrong. Those were the times of advertising disaster. Even those who
succeeded came close to the verge before the tide was turned. They did not know their
cost per customer or their sale per customer. The cost of selling might take a long time
to come back. Often it never came back.

Now we let the thousands decide what the millions will do. We make a small
venture, and watch cost and result. When we learn what a thousand customers cost, we
know almost exactly what a million will cost. When we learn what they buy, we know
what a million will buy.

We establish averages on a small scale, and those averages always hold. We know
our cost, we know our sale, we know our profit and loss. We know how soon our cost
comes back. Before we spread out, we prove our undertaking absolutely safe. So there
are today no advertising disasters piloted by men who know.

Perhaps we try out our project in four or five towns. We may use a sample offer
or a free package to get users started quickly. Then we wait and see if users buy those
samples. If they do, will they continue? How much will they buy? How long does it take
for the profit to return our cost of selling?

-----

A test like this may cost $3,000 to $5,000. It is not all lost, even when the product
proves unpopular. Some sales are made. Nearly every test will in time bring back the
entire cost.

Sometimes we find that the cost of the advertising comes back before the bills are
due. That means that the product can be advertised without investment. Many a great
advertiser has been built up without any cost whatever beyond immediate receipts. That
is an ideal situation.

On another product it may take three months to bring back the cost with a profit.
But one is sure of his profit in that time. When he spreads out he must finance
accordingly.

Think what this means. A man has what he considers an advertising possibility.
But national advertising looks so big and expensive that he dare not undertake it.

Now he presents it in a few average towns, at a very moderate cost. With almost
no risk whatever. From the few thousand he learns what the millions will do. Then he
acts accordingly. If he then branches he knows to a certainty just what his results will be.

He is playing on the safe side of a hundred to one shot. If the article is successful,
it may make him millions. If he is mistaken about it, the loss is a trifle.

These are facts we desire to emphasize and spread. All our largest accounts are
now built in this way, from very small beginnings. When business men realize that this
can be done, hundreds of others will do it. For countless fortune-earners now lie
dormant.

The largest advertiser in the world makes a business of starting such projects.
One by one he finds out winners. Now he has twenty-six, and together they earn many
millions yearly.

These test campaigns have other purposes. They answer countless questions
which arise in business.

A large food advertiser felt that his product would be more popular in another
form. He and all his advisers were certain about it. They were willing to act on this
supposition without consulting the consumers, but wiser advice prevailed.

He inserted an ad in a few towns with a coupon, good at any store for a package
of the new-style product. Then he wrote to the users about it. They were almost
unanimous in their disapproval.

-----

Later the same product was suggested in still another form. The previous verdict
made the change look dubious. The advertiser hardly thought a test to be worth while.
But he submitted the question to a few thousand women in a similar way and 91 percent
voted for it. Now he has a unique product which promises to largely increase his sales.

These tests cost about $1,000 each. The first one saved him a very costly mistake.
The second will probably bring him large profits.

Then we try test campaigns to try out new methods on advertising already
successful. Thus we constantly seek for better methods, without interrupting plans
already proved out.

In five years for one food advertiser we tried out over fifty separate plans. Every
little while we found an improvement, so the results of our advertising constantly grew.
At the end of five years we found the best plan of all. It reduced our cost of selling by 75
percent. That is, it was four times more effective than the best plan used before.

That is what mail order advertisers do — try out plan after plan to constantly
reduce the cost. Why should any general advertiser be less business-like and careful?

Another service of the test campaign is this:

An advertiser is doing mediocre advertising. A skilled advertising agent feels that
he can greatly increase results. The advertiser is doubtful. He is doing fairly well. He has
alliances which he hesitates to break. So he is inclined to let well enough alone.

Now the question can be submitted to the verdict of a test. The new agent may
take a few towns, without interfering with the general campaign. Then compare his
results with the general results and prove his greater skill.

Plausible arguments are easy in this line. One man after another comes to an
advertiser to claim superior knowledge or ability. It is hard to decide, and decisions may
be wrong.

Now actual figures gained at a small cost can settle the question definitely. The
advertiser makes no commitment. It is like saying to a salesman, “Go out for a week and
prove yourself.” A large percentage of all the advertising done would change hands if this
method were applied.

Again we come back to scientific advertising. Suppose a chemist would say in an
arbitrary way that this compound was best, or that better. You would little respect his
opinion. He makes tests — sometimes hundreds of tests — to actually know which is

best. He will never state a supposition before he has proved it. How long before
advertisers in general will apply that exactness to advertising?

 Leaning On Dealers

We cannot depend much in most lines on the active help of jobbers or of dealers.
They are busy. They have many lines to consider. The profit on advertised lines is not
generally large. And an advertised article is apt to be sold at cut prices.

The average dealer does what you would do. He exerts himself on brands of his
own, if at all. Not on another mans brand.

The dealers will often try to make you think otherwise. He will ask some aid or
concession on the ground of extra effort. Advertisers often give extra discounts. Or they
make loading offers — perhaps one case free in ten — in the belief that loaded dealers
will make extra efforts.

This may be so in rare lines, but not generally. And the efforts if made do not
usually increase the total sales. They merely swing trade from one store to another.

On most lines, making a sale without making a convert does not count for much.
Sales made by conviction — by advertising — are likely to bring permanent customers.
People who buy through casual recommendations do not often stick. Next time
someone else gives other advice.

Revenue which belongs to the advertiser is often given away without adequate
return. These discounts and gifts could be far better spent in securing new customers.

Free goods must be sold, and by your efforts usually. One extra case with ten
means that advertising must sell ten percent more to bring you the same return. The
dealer would probably buy just as much if you let him buy as convenient.

Much money is often frittered away on other forms of dealer help. Perhaps on
window or store displays. A window display, acting as a reminder, may bring to one
dealer a lions share of the trade. Yet it may not increase your total sales at all.

Those are facts to find out. Try one town in one way, one in another. Compare
total sales in those towns. In many lines such tests will show that costly displays are
worthless. A growing number of experienced advertisers spend no money on displays.

This is all in line of general publicity, so popular long ago. Casting bread upon the
waters and hoping for its return. Most advertising was of that sort twenty years ago.

-----

Now we put things to the test. We compare cost and result on every form of
expenditure. It is very easily done. Very many costly wastes are eliminated by this
modern process.

Scientific advertising has altered many old plans and conceptions. It has proved
many long established methods to be folly. And why should we not apply to these things
the same criterion we apply to other forms of selling? Or to manufacturing costs?

Your object in all advertising is to buy new customers at a price which pays a
profit. You have no interest in garnering trade at any particular store. Learn what your
consumers cost and what they buy. If they cost you one dollar each, figure that every
wasted dollar costs you a possible customer.

Your business will be built in that way, not by dealer help. You must do your own
selling, make your own success. Be content if dealers fill the orders that you bring.
Eliminate your wastes. Spend all your ammunition where it counts for most.

 Individuality

A person who desires to make an impression must stand out in some way. Being
eccentric, being abnormal is not distinction to covet. But doing admirable things in a
different way gives one a great advantage.

So with salesmen, in person or in print. There is uniqueness which belittles and
arouses resentment. There is refreshing uniqueness which enhances, which we welcome
and remember. Fortunate is the salesman who has it.

We try to give each advertiser a becoming style. We make him distinctive,
perhaps not in appearance, but in manner and in tone. He is given an individuality best
suited to the people he addresses.

One man appears rugged and honest in a line where rugged honesty counts. One
may be a good fellow where choice is a matter of favor. In other lines the man stands out
by impressing himself as an authority.

We have already cited a case where a woman made a great success in selling
clothing to girls, solely through a created personality which won.
