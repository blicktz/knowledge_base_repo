**Author’s note: It is worth asking what it is about the idea of loss that makes it so**
potent in human functioning. One prominent theory accounts for the primacy of loss over
gain in evolutionary terms. If one has enough to survive, an increase in resources will be
helpful but a decrease in those same resources could be fatal. Consequently, it would be
adaptive to be especially sensitive to the possibility of loss (Haselton & Nettle, 2006).

#### Although the loathing of loss is a central feature of scarcity, it’s just one of the factors embedded within the principle, which makes a fuller tour worthwhile.

## Scarcity: Less Is Best and Loss Is Worst

#### Almost everyone is vulnerable to the scarcity principle in some form. Collectors of everything from baseball cards to antiques are keenly aware of the principle’s influence in determining the worth of an item. As a rule, if an item is rare or becoming rare, it is viewed as more valuable. In fact, when a desirable item is rare or unavailable, consumers no longer base its fair price on perceived quality; instead, they base it on the item’s scarcity. When automobile manufacturers limit production of a new model, its worth goes up among potential buyers. Especially enlightening on the importance of scarcity in the collectibles market is the phenomenon of the “precious mistake.” Flawed items—a blurred stamp or double-struck coin—are sometimes the most valued of all. Thus, a stamp carrying a three-eyed likeness of George Washington is anatomically incorrect, aesthetically unappealing, and yet highly sought after. There is instructive irony here: imperfections that would otherwise make for rubbish make for prized possessions when they bring along an abiding scarcity.
 The more I learn about the scarcity principle—that opportunities seem more valuable to us when they are less available—the more I have begun to notice its influence over a whole range of my own actions. I have been known to interrupt an interesting face-to-face conversation to answer the ring of a caller. In such a situation, the caller possesses a compelling feature that my face-to-face partner does not—potential unavailability. If I don’t take the call, I might miss it (and the information it carries) for good. Never mind that the first conversation may be highly engaging or important— much more than I could expect of an average phone call. With each

#### unanswered ring, the phone interaction becomes less retrievable. For that reason and for that moment, I want it more than the other conversation.

**Figure 6.2: Goosing (demand) by reducing (supply)**
It’s not uncommon for retailers to announce the lack of an item to fuel future desire for it. The idea is
satirized in an old song that mimicked the cries of a local fruit vendor who called out, “Yes, we have
no bananas. We have no bananas today.” When my grandmother used to sing the lyric to me, I never
understood the logic of the vendor’s sales tactic. I do now. So, apparently, does Apple’s phone
division, which is infamous for undersupplying its stores on the day of a launch.

#### As we have seen, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value. For instance, college students experienced much stronger emotions when asked to imagine losses as opposed to equally sized improvements in their romantic relationships; the same was true for their grade-point averages. In the United Kingdom, residents were 45 percent more likely to want to switch to a new energy provider if the change would prevent a loss on their bill as opposed to providing a saving. On tasks, people are more likely to cheat to avoid a loss than to obtain a gain, which can occur in more than just a monetary sense; in one study, team members were 82 percent more willing to cheat to avert a drop in status on the team than to experience an equivalent climb in status. Finally, compared to gains, losses have greater impact on attention (gaze), physiological arousal (heart rate and pupillary dilation), and brain activation (cortical stimulation).
 Under conditions of risk and uncertainty, the threat of potential loss plays an especially powerful role in human decision-making. Health researchers Alexander Rothman and Peter Salovey have applied this insight to the medical arena, where individuals are frequently urged to undergo tests to detect existing illnesses (mammography procedures, HIV

#### screenings, cancer self-examinations). Because such tests involve the risk that a disease will be found and the uncertainty that it will be cured, messages stressing potential losses are most effective. For example, pamphlets advising young women to check for breast cancer through self- examinations are significantly more successful if they state their case in terms of what stands to be lost rather than gained. Even our brains seem to have evolved to protect us against loss in that it is more difficult to short- circuit good decision-making strategies when considering a potential loss than it is when considering a potential a gain.[1]

### Limited Numbers

#### With the scarcity principle operating so powerfully on the worth we assign things, it is natural that compliance professionals will do some similar operating of their own. Probably the most straightforward use of the scarcity principle occurs in the “limited number” tactic in which a customer is informed a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to

#### last long. When the impressively successful international trip and hotel booking site Booking.com first included online information about the limited number of a hotel’s rooms that were still available at a given price, purchases skyrocketed—to such heights that its customer-service team called the technology office to report what “must be a systems error.” There was no error; the increase came from the power of limited numbers to turn shoppers into buyers. During the time I was researching compliance strategies by infiltrating various organizations, I saw the limited-number tactic employed repeatedly in a range of situations: “There aren’t more than five convertibles with this engine left in the state. And when they’re gone, that’s it, ’cause we’re not making ’em anymore.” “This is one of only two unsold corner lots in the entire development. You wouldn’t want the other one; it’s got a nasty east-west sun exposure in summer.” “You may want to think seriously about buying more than one case today because production is backed way up and there’s no telling when we’ll get any more in.”

#### From a woman living in Phoenix, Arizona

I have been using the scarcity principle at a resale shop called Bookman’s. They buy/trade
used books, music, and toys. I had some characters from the 1990s Richard Scarry
children’s TV series and I brought them to Bookman’s. But, they didn’t take any. Then I
decided to bring each one there, by itself. Each time, they took it. I have now traded them
all in. Scarcity principle!

My dad actually did the same thing on eBay with baseball team shot glasses. He bought
a box of 24 for $35 total. Then he sold them individually on eBay. The first one sold for
$35, covering his entire cost. He waited a while to offer the next, which sold for $26. He
waited even longer and sold the next for $51. Then he got greedy and sold another too soon
and only got $22. He learned his lesson. He still has several and is holding on to them to
reestablish their scarcity.

**Author’s note: The wisdom of offering abundant items for sale one at a time**
recognizes that abundance is the opposite of scarcity and, consequently, presenting an item
in abundance reduces its perceived value.

#### Sometimes the limited-number information was true, sometimes wholly false. In each instance, however, the intent was to convince customers of an

-----

#### item’s scarcity and thereby increase its immediate value in their eyes. I developed a grudging admiration for the practitioners who made this simple device work in a multitude of ways and styles. I was most impressed with a particular version that extended the basic approach to its logical extreme by selling a piece of merchandise at its scarcest point—when it seemingly could no longer be had. The tactic was played to perfection in one appliance store I investigated, where 30 to 50 percent of the stock was regularly listed on sale. Suppose a couple in the store seemed moderately interested in a certain sale item. There are all sorts of cues that tip off such interest—a closer-than-normal examination of the appliance, a casual look at any instruction booklets associated with the appliance, and discussions held in front of the appliance. After observing the couple so engaged, a salesperson might approach and say, “I see you’re interested in this model here. But, unfortunately, I sold it to another couple not more than twenty minutes ago. And I believe it was our last one.”
 The customers’ disappointment registers unmistakably. Because of its lost availability, the appliance suddenly becomes more attractive. Typically, one of the customers asks if there is any chance that an unsold model still exists in the store’s back room or warehouse or other location. “Well,” the salesperson allows, “that is possible, and I’d be willing to check. But do I understand that this is the model you want, and if I can get it for you at this price, you’ll take it?” Therein lies the beauty of the technique. In accord with the scarcity principle, the customers are asked to commit to buying the appliance when it looks least available and therefore most desirable. Many customers do agree to purchase at this singularly vulnerable time. Thus, when the salesperson (invariably) returns with the news that an additional supply of the appliance has been found, it is also with a pen and sales contract in hand. The information that the desired model is in good supply may actually make some customers find it less attractive again, although by then the business transaction has progressed too far for most people to back out. The purchase decision made and committed to publicly at an earlier point still holds. They buy.
 When I speak to business groups about the scarcity principle, I stress the importance of avoiding the use of such tricks as providing false limited- number information. In response, I regularly get a version of the question “But what if we don’t have a limited supply of what we offer. What if we can deliver as much as the market demands? How can we use the power of

-----

#### scarcity?” The solution is to recognize that scarcity applies not only to the count of items but also to the traits or elements of the items. First, identify a feature of your product or service that is unique or so uncommon that it can’t be obtained elsewhere at the same price or at all. Then, market honestly on the basis of that feature and the attendant benefits that will be lost if it is missed. If the item doesn’t have a single such feature, it may well possess a unique combination of features that can’t be matched by competitors. In that case, the scarcity of that unique set of features can be marketed honestly.

### Limited Time

#### The city of Mesa, Arizona, is a suburb in the Phoenix area where I live. Perhaps the most notable features of Mesa are its sizable Mormon population—next to Salt Lake City, the largest in the world—and a huge Mormon temple located on exquisitely kept grounds in the city’s center. Although I had appreciated the landscaping and architecture from a distance, I had never been interested enough in the temple to go inside, until the day I read a newspaper article that told of a special inner sector of Mormon temples to which no one has access but faithful members of the Church. Even potential converts must not see it; however, there is one exception to the rule. For a few days immediately after a temple is newly constructed, nonmembers are allowed to tour the entire structure, including the otherwise restricted section.
 The newspaper story reported that the Mesa temple had been recently refurbished and the renovations had been extensive enough to classify it as “new” by church standards. Thus, for the next several days only, non- Mormon visitors could see the temple area traditionally banned to them. I remember well the effect this news had on me. I immediately resolved to take a tour. But when I phoned my friend Gus to ask if he wanted to come along, I came to understand something that changed my decision just as quickly.
 After declining the invitation, Gus wondered why I seemed so intent on a visit. I was forced to admit that, no, I had never been inclined toward the idea of a temple tour before, that I had no questions about the Mormon religion I wanted answered, that I had no general interest in church architecture, and that I expected to find nothing more spectacular or stirring

#### than what I might see at a number of other churches in the area. It became clear as I spoke that the special lure of the temple had a sole cause: if I did not experience the restricted sector soon, I would never again have the chance. Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had become decidedly more attractive merely because it was rapidly becoming less available.

**_EBOX 6.1_**

In an impressive review of online-commercial-site experiments, a pair of researchers
compiled the results of over 6,700 A/B tests, in which the same e-commerce site’s
effectiveness was tested when it did or did not include one or another specific feature
(Browne & Swarbrick-Jones, 2017). The twenty-nine features to be evaluated ranged from
the purely technological (such as the presence or absence of a search function, a back-totop button, and default settings) to the motivational (such as free delivery, product badging,
and calls to action). At the end of their investigation, the researchers concluded, “The
biggest winners from our analysis all have grounding in behavioural psychology.” Happily
for readers of this book, aspects of each of the principles of influence we have covered so
far appeared as the top-six most effective features:

Scarcity—highlighting items low in stock.
Social Proof—describing most popular and trending items.
Urgency—using time limits, often with a countdown timer.
Concessions—offering discounts for visitors to stay on the site.
Authority/Expertise—informing visitors of alternative products that are available.
Liking—including a welcoming message.

**Author’s note: It’s telling that two of the top-three factors align with the two**
presentations of scarcity we have registered historically, since well before the beginnings of
e-commerce—limited-number and limited-time appeals. Once again, we see that although
the platforms on which influence principles are delivered may have changed radically, the
impacts of the principles on human responses have not. It’s also instructive that the
rankings of the two operationalizations of scarcity fit with other research indicating that, in
general, limited-supply appeals are more effective than limited-time appeals (Aggarwal,
Jun, & Huh, 2011). In an upcoming section on competition, we’ll learn why.
