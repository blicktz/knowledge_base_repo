##### If you have read the chapters of this book in sequence, you are building a good foundation to understand and learn copywriting.
 This chapter builds upon the knowledge that took me several years of copywriting to really understand and learn. Learning it wasn’t difficult, but understanding why it was so important took a little longer.
 One of the things that ads should do is harmonize with the reader or viewer. Advertising is the ultimate form of communication in that its purpose is to cause an action to be taken by consumers—usually to exchange their hard-earned money for a product or service. But for some reason, many advertisers are missing an important key in this form of communication—namely, it should be personal.
 As a good example of personal communications, let’s first cover direct mail. In direct mail, personal communication is easy to understand. After all, you are writing a letter to a single individual.

 Every advertisement should be a personal message from the advertiser to the prospect.

##### But in creating the letter that goes with a mailing, too many copywriters write their letters as if they were hiding behind a podium, speaking through a microphone and addressing a large audience. For example:
 We at ABC Company wish to invite all of you to visit our exhibit again at the upcoming trade show. Our staff will be there to meet you and demonstrate our new and novel button machine. The personal way of saying it might be:
 Hi. You might remember me from the last trade show. Well, I’d like to invite you to the next one where I will be looking forward to meeting you again to demonstrate our new and novel button machine. You see the difference? The second version is more personal and direct. It is me talking to you—not me talking to a large crowd. It is as if I, as an individual, were writing that letter to another individual.
 Now, in direct mail this makes sense. Why not make your letters more personal and direct—more like one person talking to another in a direct and eyeball-to-eyeball sort of folksy way? Of course, folksy might not be the best way in certain circumstances. That’s okay. As long as you use words like I, you and me, you create the feel of a personal form of communication.

# Emotional Process in
 Communication

##### Remember I said earlier that copywriting is an emotional outpouring of an idea onto paper. And I said that copywriting is very much an emotional process. Look at the following two letters from the same company and see how much more emotional one sounds than the other.
 Dear Customer: We here at Consolidated International would like to thank you for your recent order. We realize that you could have given your business to many of the other companies in our industry, but the fact that you chose Consolidated International is really appreciated by our entire staff. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Mr. John Smith. Now compare it to the following:
 Dear Mr. Jones: I just wanted to thank you personally for your recent order, which I’ve just received. I took your order and even showed it to the president of our company. I realize that you had a number of other choices, but I really appreciate the fact that you chose my company. Sincerely, John Lee. Both letters would have served the same purpose. But the second letter was warmer, more personal and you felt that Mr. Lee was talking to you directly. Indeed, he was happy to get your order—so happy that he went to his president and showed it to him. It was a genuine expression of thanks and a direct message—all with genuine emotion.
 On the other hand, the letter from Mr. Smith could have been a form letter that the company sends to all its customers, thereby losing the personal feeling that Mr. Lee’s letter had. It lacked the warmth and personal touch. The difference should be obvious. Read both letters again, and this time feel the difference. Put yourself in the place of Mr. Jones and imagine how he would have felt if he had received both letters.

# Letters Should Be Personal

##### Good examples of a personal letter were the letters I used to send out to a membership program in my Consumers Hero club. They may have been totally off the wall, but they served my purposes well.
 The membership program was created in response to our advertisement for our discount club in which we refurbished new but defective products and then sold them, at discount prices, through a club we established.
 Part of the club program was our regular monthly bulletin. It listed all the buys for that month, and along with it came a very folksy letter talking about the club.
 The image I conveyed was not that of a very large, impersonal corporation filling the needs of its membership but that of a bunch of hardworking people, of all ethnic backgrounds, working together in harmony to make the company a success.
 The company had to be portrayed as being small. That was essential for the concept. After all, that was part of the image—a little consumer-oriented company fighting the big U.S. corporations and the effects of inflation.
 And one of the techniques we used to keep the image of a small company was to use old envelopes from companies that had gone out of business. We simply explained that the envelopes were no longer good and it was our way of saving money as well as the environment and passing the savings on to the consumer.
 So in one month, members might get an envelope from Ski Lift International, a defunct company, and the next month they might get a letter from CMT Machine Tool Company, another defunct company, but the contents of the envelope were always from Consumers Hero.
 As membership cards, we sent out Batman credit cards. (There is a whole story on that card, but that’s for some other book I plan to write.) And one of the qualities we tried to convey was absolute total honesty. We were so honest that the reader would actually be embarrassed for us. The typical letter is on the following page.

 The very down-to-earth and personal letter sent to Consumers Hero members.

##### Even though the letters were from the staff as opposed to an individual, they still conveyed a personal feel to the reader. And weren’t they fun to read? We often got comments that the letters alone were worth the price of the membership.
 In print ads, the need to be personal becomes less apparent. After all, you are talking to the masses, aren’t you? But the fact remains that you are

##### indeed talking to a single individual—that person reading your ad. And he or she is listening to a single individual—the person who wrote the ad. So it is essential that you write your copy as if you are writing to that single individual. Your copy should be very personal. From me to you. Period.

# Use of a Byline

##### An effective way to do this in print is to use a byline. Use your name or the name of somebody in your organization such as the president—like the news organizations do in a magazine or newspaper article. This allows you to use words like I and me and we and you. Let’s look at the example of the ad I first ran for BluBlocker sunglasses that launched a multimillion-dollar company.
 Headline: Vision Breakthrough Subheadline: When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I could not believe. Nor will you. Byline: By Joseph Sugarman Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain. Read that personal copy. It’s as if I were talking to that person directly. I used the words I and you and me—all very personal words used in a one-to- one conversation. Let’s examine the first paragraph of copy from a few other ads that were written in this personal tone.
 This may surprise you. In fact, if my hunches are correct simply reading this article may change your idea of aging for the rest of your life. Here’s why. Or how about the following:
 If I were to buy a ticket in the Illinois State Lottery, my chances of winning would be a million to one. But if I were to bet that you, as a reader of this publication, have high blood pressure and don’t even know it, my chances of being correct would be eight to one. The above paragraphs show how very personal you can get in copy and still convey a very powerful thought or develop the environment and slippery slide you need to cause your reader to continue reading and then respond.
 When I started writing, I kept a low profile and never used my name in any advertising communications. But as I became more proficient and saw

##### the effect a personal message could create in direct mail, I started using my byline in print on a regular basis. In my catalog, I could speak in the first person about all the products because on the first page of the catalog I introduced myself in a letter to my customers.

# Even Magazines Have Personalities

##### I remember reading a story about the image conveyed by the magazine itself. Forbes magazine has a strong personality. Steve Forbes now runs the publication and his editorials appear in every issue. A reader feels more personally involved with the publication. In contrast, BusinessWeek appears more like a corporate publication even though it has many bylines. A business-woman once commented that she could put her arms around Forbes and hug the magazine but would only feel comfortable shaking BusinessWeek’s hand. So it is with copywriting.
 You want to create a very personal image so that people will emotionally respond to you, feel close and feel very comfortable parting with their hard- earned money and buying your product or service.

 Axiom 12

**_Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient,_**
**_regardless of the medium used._**

##### So as you start to write copy to reach and motivate an individual, think in terms of writing in the first person with a personal message.
 You are now ready to write that first ad. Everything you’ve read has prepared you for this moment, and everything that you are going to learn later in this book will only polish what you already know. True, you’re also going to get a whole bunch of new insights, too. But right now you’re ready for the big plunge. In the next chapter, we discuss writing your first ad using my techniques and thought processes.

# Chapter 16

 The Copy Sequence

##### You are now really ready to write that first successful ad. You already know how important it is to know your subject. You already know the purpose of all the elements in an advertisement—to get the prospect to read the first sentence. And you know all the axioms to get the reader to read beyond the first sentence and all the way to your last word.
 Copy must also flow. And its flow must make sense. It must be in an understandable order where each thought flows logically to the next.
 Many people have told me that when a question comes into their minds as they read my ads, I answer it in the next sentence. They often claim that it’s almost uncanny. But that’s the skill that makes the good direct response copywriter the envy of any one-on-one salesperson.

# Leading the Reader

##### Since we copywriters do not have the benefit of having the prospect in front of us to ask the questions, we must craft our ads in such a manner that they literally lead our prospect (by the flow of the copy) to ask the question we want to answer. Sounds hard, doesn’t it? It really isn’t.
 Start by writing the headline. Will it grab the reader? Then write the subheadline. Will it compel the reader to read further? Then write the caption to go under an imaginary picture. Is all this strong enough to get people to read the first sentence? And then write the first sentence.
 Once you start using my thought process, you’ll find a discipline and a direction that you might not have experienced in writing copy before.
 You might even write a paragraph in the copy to stand out in boldface type similar to the Consumers Hero ad that reads:

## IMPOSSIBLE-TO-TRACE
 GUARANTEE

##### We guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identification or ownership. At my seminar, I would call on various students and ask them to read their headlines. The class would then critique each headline to determine if it would get us all to read the subheadline. It was a good process with 20 students from all walks of life coming up with some of the most creative approaches on a variety of subjects.
 One day, my eight-year-old daughter April was sitting in one of the chairs in the class. She was taking notes, listening intently and, in short, acting exactly like one of the students. I would always allow my children free access to the entire seminar process and they had never been a nuisance. In fact, the students liked this family touch.

# April Becomes a Real Nuisance

##### After I had assigned an ad-writing exercise and asked for volunteers to read their ads, April started waving her hand wildly. I called on a man from New Zealand—Archie Mason—who was in the wool business. Later, when I asked for another volunteer, April once again waved her hand wildly but I called on another student—Fred Simon, president of Omaha Steaks. Finally, April came up to me in front of the class and whispered, “Dad, let me read my ad. It’s a good one. It follows your principles.”
 I was annoyed. “Later, April. Can’t you see I’m trying to teach the class?” Finally, at break time, April came up to me and handed me her ad. I read it. It indeed was a good example of anticipating what a consumer would ask and then answering it. It was very simple—after all, an eight-year-old had written it—but it contained a question-and-answer format that was very logical and covered a topic of interest that her eight-year-old peers would enjoy reading. Her product was a guinea pig. The ad read:
 Headline: The Best Pet Subheadline: Do you want a pet that doesn’t shed? Copy: Think about it. You can get a pet that doesn’t shed, doesn’t run around the house, and is easy to take care of. You have probably guessed it’s a rabbit, bird, fish or a turtle. Well, you’re wrong. It’s a guinea pig. You probably want to know how do you take care of the guinea pig? Where should I keep it? What does it eat? It’s all simple. If you don’t have a guinea pig cage, then get a box high enough so it won’t get out and large enough so it can run around. Feed it guinea pig pellets and feed it a couple fresh greens. Put plastic at the bottom and newspaper on top then at least an inch high of shavings. Put a bowl in for food and a water bottle for water. That’s all you need to know. To order, call [phone number] and order today. April’s ad made an important point, which I have reminded each class of since. Good copy can be written at any age and by anybody. Simply

# Logical Progression of Flowchart

##### In class I would ask my students to write a headline and a subheadline. I would then ask for the first sentence, then the next sentence and then the next until each student had composed a complete ad.
 The ads had to flow on paper and then, once they were on paper, the editing process was of paramount importance. One of the tips I gave during this process was to create a block diagram of a logical way the copy should flow and the questions that might logically be asked.
 In order to develop a sense for this, you break your ad into small abbreviated copy blocks similar to those in a corporate flowchart. But this flowchart goes in one direction only—down.
 I made a block diagram of the ad I did for an electronic pinball game from Bally manufacturing. I showed that at the start of the ad, I wanted to get my reader into the copy and then I wanted to set the environment for the product. So, I started the ad with the fun times that this product represented. The ad started like this:
 It’s you against a computer. And the action and excitement from Fireball, your own computerized pinball machine, is nothing short of spectacular. Fireball’s computer replaces many of the mechanical, scoring, conventional electronics and sensing devices of a standard pinball machine. It’s a dramatic change in pinball devices and the start of a new consumer electronics revolution.

 The flowchart for copy sequence goes in one direction—down.

##### With the first paragraph I create interest and excitement for this product. With the second paragraph I start to weave the drama of the product and the differences between Fireball and conventional pinball games.
