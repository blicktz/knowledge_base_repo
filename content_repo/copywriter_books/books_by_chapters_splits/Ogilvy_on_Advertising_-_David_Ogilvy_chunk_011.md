###### 2 Cartoons can sell things to children, but they are below average in selling to grown-ups. They don’t hold the viewer as well as live action, and they are less persuasive.
 Two commercials were made for a fabric-softener. One used live action, the other used cartoons. The cartoon commercial had no e�ect on the downward trend in sales. The live-action commercial reversed it.

###### Sixteen tips 1 Brand identi�cation. Research has demonstrated that a shocking percentage of viewers remember your commercial, but forget the name of your product. All too often they attribute your commercial to a competing brand.
 Many copywriters think it crass to belabor the name of the product. However, for the bene�t of those who are more interested in selling than entertaining, here are two ways to register your brand name:

 Use the name within the �rst ten seconds. I have seen a brilliant commercial which repeated the brand name twenty times in 340 seconds, without irritating anyone.

 Play games with the name. Spell it. Veterans will remember Alex Templeton, the blind pianist, spelling out the name C.R.E.S.T.A. B.L.A.N.C.A. to the accompaniment of pizzicato strings.

 When you advertise a new product, you have to teach people its name on television.

 2 Show the package. Commercials which end by showing the package are more e�ective in changing brand preference than commercials which don’t.

 3 Food in motion. In commercials for food, the more appetizing you make it look, the more you sell. It has been found that food in motion looks particularly appetizing. Show chocolate sauce in the act of being poured over your ice cream, or syrup over your pancakes.

 4 Close-ups. It is a good thing to use close-ups when your product is the hero of your commercial. The closer you get on the candy bar, the more you make people’s mouths water.

 5 Open with the �re. You have only 30 seconds. If you grab attention in the �rst frame with a visual surprise, you stand a better chance of holding the viewer.

-----

###### People screen out a lot of commercials because they open with something dull. You know that great things are about to happen, but the viewer doesn’t. She will never know; she has gone to the bathroom.
 When you advertise �re-extinguishers, open with the �re.

 6 When you have nothing to say, sing it. There have been some successful commercials which sang the sales pitch, but jingles are below average in changing brand preference.
 Never use a jingle without trying it on people who have not read your script. If they cannot decipher the words, don’t put your jingle on the air.
 If you went into a store and asked a salesman to show you a refrigerator, how would you react if he started singing at you? Yet some clients feel short-changed if you don’t give them a jingle.
 Many people use music as background – emotional shorthand. Research shows that this is neither a positive nor a negative factor. It does no harm and it does no measurable good. Do great preachers allow organists to play background music under their sermons? Do advertising agencies play background music under their pitch to prospective clients?

 7 Sound e�ects. While music does not add to the selling power of commercials, sound e�ects – such as sausages sizzling in a frying-pan – can make a positive di�erence.
 A commercial for Maxwell House was constructed around the sound of co�ee percolating. It worked well enough to run for �ve years.

 8 Voice-over or on-camera? Research shows that it is more di�cult to hold your audience if you use voice-over. It is better to have the actors talk on camera.
 A manufacturer made two commercials, identical in every respect except that one used voice-over and the other used on-camera voice. When he tested them, the voice-on-camera version sold more of his product.

-----

###### 9 Supers. It pays to reinforce your promise by setting it in type and superimposing it over the video, while your soundtrack speaks the words.
 But make sure that the words in your supers are exactly the same as your spoken words. Any divergence confuses the viewer.
 Many people in agencies resist the use of supers. If you tell them that they increase sales, as they do, the stupid buggers turn a deaf ear.

 10 Avoid visual banality. If you want the viewer to pay attention to your commercial, show her something she has never seen before. You won’t have much success if you show her sunsets and happy families at the dinner table.
 The average American family has the television turned on for six hours a day, and is exposed to 30,000 commercials a year. Most of them slide o� the memory like water o� a duck’s back. For this reason you should give your commercials a touch of singularity, a visual burr that will stick in the viewer’s mind. One such burr was the herd of bulls thundering towards the camera, with the superimposed title: ‘Merrill Lynch is bullish on America.’

 11 Changes of scene. Hal Riney uses a great many scenes without confusing people, but I can’t, and I bet you can’t either. On the average, commercials with a plethora of short scenes are below average in changing brand preference.

 12 Mnemonics. This unpronounceable word is used to describe a visual device repeated over a long period. It can increase brand identi�cation, and remind people of your promise. Example: the car driving through the paper barrier in Shell commercials.

 13 Show the product in use. It pays to show the product being used, and, if possible, the end-result of using it. Show how your diapers (nappies) keep the baby dry. In a commercial for motor oil, show how the pistons look after 50,000 miles.

-----

###### 14 Everything is possible on TV. The technicians can produce anything you want. The only limit is your imagination.

 15 Miscomprehension. In 1979 Professor Jacoby of Purdue University studied the ‘miscomprehension’ of 25 typical television commercials. He found that all of them were miscomprehended, some by as many as 40 per cent of viewers, none by fewer than 19 per cent.
 If you want to avoid your television commercials being misunderstood, you had better make them crystal clear. I cannot understand more than half the commercials I see.

 16 The great scandal. Television programs cost about $4 a second to produce, but commercials cost $2,000 a second. Which is $60,000 for a 30-second commercial.
 This obscene extravagance is largely the fault of the agencies. Says Hooper White, ‘Production dollars are typed into the commercial by the copywriter and drawn into the commercial by the art director.’ Miner Raymond of Procter & Gamble tells the story of an art director who objected to a table on the set. The client pointed out that it was covered by a cloth and thus invisible. ‘But I would know what’s under the cloth’ said the art director, ‘and it just wouldn’t be right.’ So another table was found and the delay cost the client $5,000.[1]
 The easiest way to reduce the cost of a commercial is to cut actors out of the storyboard. Every actor you cut will save you between $350 and $ 10,000, depending on how long you run the commercial.
 Copywriters specify that a commercial should be shot in Bali When it could equally well be shot in a studio for half the price. They insert expensive animation into live-action commercials. They insist that original music be composed for background purposes, as if there were nothing suitable in the whole repertoire of existing music. Worst of all, they use expensive celebrities when an unknown actor would sell more of the product.

###### I have no research to prove it, but I suspect that there is a negative correlation between the money spent on producing commercials and their power to sell products. My partner Al Eico� was asked by a client to remake a $15,000 commercial for $100,000. Sales went down.

 Radio – the Cinderella medium Once upon a time, I spent six months studying radio at the feet of John Royal, the pioneering head of programming at NBC. In those days every family in America tuned in to Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Fred Allen, Amos and Andy, Burns and Allen. Some of us also listened to Roy Larsen’s marvellous March of Time, and Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
 All this was swept away by television. For most people radio has become no more than a security blanket, a reassuring noise in the background.
 Radio has become the Cinderella of advertising media, representing only 6 per cent of total advertising in the United States. There is no research to measure the e�cacy of the commercials, so nobody knows what works. A pilot study I commissioned suggests four positive factors:

 1 Identify your brand early in the commercial.

 2 Identify it often.

 3 Promise the listener a bene�t early in the commercial.

 4 Repeat it often.

 Ninety commercials out of a hundred do none of these things. In my opinion – and it is nothing more than that – the �rst thing your radio commercial has to do is to get people to listen. Surprise them. Arouse their curiosity. Wake them up. Once they are awake, talk to them as one human being to another. Involve them. Charm them. Make them laugh. Here is the script of a radio commercial in a

_This beer commercial, written by my partner Hal Riney, is the best example I know of the use of emotion in advertising._

###### ANNOUNCER: And now, another in�ation-�ghting message from Mr Harmon R. Whittle.

 WHITTLE: One of the biggest strains on our budget is the foreign aid program. Each year, we send billions of dollars worth of planes, computers, tractors and things to foreign countries … Then we pay technical advisers to train them how to use it all. This is expensive.

 A more responsive form of foreign aid would be to send them beer. American-made Red, White and Blue beer.

 Red, White and Blue is less expensive than planes or computers. So we’d save a bundle, right o�. It costs less than other premium-quality beer, so we’d save on that. And Red, White and Blue is easier to teach people to use than a computer. So we’d save on technical advisers, too.

 And if there’s any doubt whether our international popularity would increase, ask yourself this: if you lived in one of those hot, dusty countries, what would you rather have? A computer, or an ice-cold, Red, White and Blue? It’s an honest beer. At an honest price.

 ANNOUNCER: Mr Whittle’s comments do not necessarily re�ect the views of this station. They do however, re�ect the views of the RWB Brewing Company, Milwaukee.

###### Because radio is a high-frequency medium, people quickly get tired of hearing the same commercial. So make several. Compared with television, radio commercials cost almost nothing to produce.
 In some developing countries radio still reaches more people than television. Yet even there nobody really knows what kind of commercials make the cash register ring. Isn’t it time somebody tried to �nd out?

 Eighty-one out of the hundred biggest American corporations advertise their corporations as distinct from their products, and spend about $500,000,000 a year in the process. Most of them make a hash of it. However, if well planned and executed, corporate advertising can be a pro�table investment. Opinion Research Corporation has found that people who know a company well are �ve times more likely to have a favorable opinion of it.
 Corporate advertising can improve the morale of your employees; who wants to work for an out�t that nobody has ever heard of? It can also make it easier to recruit better people, at all levels. And, I believe, it can make your corporation a more seductive suitor in takeover bids. Discretion stops me naming a rich corporation which has recently failed in several takeover bids because its image is unattractive.
 Can corporate advertising make a good impression on the investment community? Yes it can, and this is the unspoken purpose of most such campaigns. A study conducted at Northwestern

###### University examined the stock performance of 731 corporations, and found that corporate advertising had an average positive in�uence of 2 per cent on the price of their stock. If you think this trivial, re�ect that if a corporation has a market value of forty billion dollars – and some do – that extra 2 per cent adds up to $800,000,000. Not to be sneezed at.
 DuPont has run corporate advertising for 47 years, General Electric for 62 years, American Telephone for 75 years, US Steel for 46 years, and Container Corporation for 50 years. But the majority of corporate advertising campaigns are aborted too soon to achieve any measurable objective.
 You cannot rely on short-term advertising to turn the title of hostile public opinion in your favor, to boost the price of your stock or to put a halo around your reputation. In 1941, when Texaco was accused of selling oil to the Nazis, they assumed sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera on radio, but it took a long time for this lovely antidote to exorcize their bad publicity.

###### Most corporate campaigns are short-lived because they don’t start with any clear objective, and because research is not used to track their progress. A glowing exception is DuPont, who for many years measured progress after each television program.

###### Notice that all these bromides are interchangeable – any company could use any of them. They generally appear at the bottom of advertisements, where nobody reads them, and, by cluttering up the layout, they reduce readership of the copy.
 Many corporate campaigns fail because they are under-funded. Companies which spend millions on advertising their brand names are curiously stingy when it comes to their corporate campaigns. The most sensible way to set the budget is to ‘analyse the task.’ How
