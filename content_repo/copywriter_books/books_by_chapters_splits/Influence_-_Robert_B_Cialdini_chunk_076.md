The George Clooney and Emma Watson research (Arnocky et al., 2018) is more instructive than I
have described, owing to a pair of additional experimental procedures. The first extended the breadth
of the basic effect by demonstrating that the liked celebrities’ opinions had the power not only to
increase acceptance of evolution but to decrease it as well. When some study participants were led to
believe that Clooney or Watson had commented favorably about an anti-evolutionary book, support
for evolutionary theory dropped significantly among these observers. So liking’s influence isn’t a
one-way street; it can route attitudinal traffic in positive or negative directions. A second
experimental procedure reinforced the wisdom of using liked (rather than authoritative)
communicators to create change on the topic. The researchers showed a different sample of
participants favorable commentary, purportedly written by a professor of biology from a prestigious
university, regarding either a pro-evolutionary or anti-evolutionary book. The expert’s opinion—for
or against evolution—had no significant effect on participants’ acceptance of the theory. Here we see
the clearest evidence I know for why science communicators’ crusades to heighten support for
evolution have failed over the years: they’ve chosen the wrong battlefield on which to strike.
2. The evidence showing that it’s the quality of the social connections—rather than of the physical
products—that determines buying within a Tupperware party comes from studies by Taylor (1978)
and Frenzen & Davis (1990). For a financial analysis of how Tupperware Brands has successfully
employed principles of social influence, especially in emerging markets, see
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4137896-tupperware-brands-sealed-nearly-20-percent-upside?
page=2. As a testament to the social basis of Tupperware products’ success, after the coronavirus
threat emerged worldwide in February 2020, Tupperware Brands share price dropped severely on the
New York Stock Exchange. The drop (of 90 percent of its value from the previous February) was due
in large part to perceptions that gatherings, even of friends, were no longer considered safe by
consumers.

The Nielsen Company survey showing greater trust for a liked friend’s recommendation is
described at www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2012/trust-in-advertising--paid-owned-andearned.html. But this pattern reverses when liking for the known friend turns into disliking, such as
typically occurs with an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend. In that case, consumers are 66 percent _less_

likely to trust their ex’s product opinion than an online reviewer’s:

liking seems to be a key. The research on the profitability to a bank of referred customers is described
at https://hbr.org/2011/06/why-customer-referrals-can-drive-stunning-profits.
3. The idea that physical attractiveness creates a halo effect for other judgments is not new.
Consider Leo Tolstoy’s 120-year-old assertion: “It is amazing how complete is the delusion that
beauty is good.” Support for the broad (Langlois et al., 2000), immediate (Olson & Marshuetz,
2005), and early (Dion, 1972; Ritts, Patterson, & Tubbs, 1992) effects of physical attraction in a
variety of social (Benson, Karabenic, & Lerner, 1976; Chaiken, 1979; Stirrat & Perrett, 2010),
professional (Judge, Hurst, & Simon, 2009; Hamermesh & Biddle, 1994; Hamermesh, 2011; Mack &
Raney, 1990), and political (Efran & Patterson, 1976; Budesheim & DePaola, 1994) arenas is
historically strong. A more recent review (Maestripieri, Henry, & Nickels, 2017) not only updates
this support but also offers an evolutionary explanation for much of the basic effect: our positive
feelings and beneficial behaviors toward attractive individuals flow from automatic, overgeneralized
romantic feelings toward them.
4. The work measuring infants’ favorable feelings toward similar others was performed by Hamlin
et al. (2013), using puppets whose taste preferences (for crackers versus beans) were similar to or
different from the infants’. The online dating preference study was performed by Levy, Markell, &
Cerf (2019). The unthinking impact of similar dress styles in an antiwar demonstration was seen at a
time of great civil conflict over the American war in Vietnam (Suedfeld, Bochner, & Matas, 1971).
The effects of seemingly trivial similarities such as fingerprint type on helping were obtained by
Burger et al. (2004). Name similarity’s positive effect on brand preferences and survey responding
was demonstrated, respectively, in five separate experiments by Brendl et al. (2005) and in a pair of
studies by Garner (2005).
5. Similarity’s broad influence is evident from its impact in educational settings (DuBois et al.,
2011; Gehlbach et al., 2016; Marx & Ko, 2012) as well as on bargaining outcomes (Moore et al.,
1999; Morris et al., 2002), voter choices (Bailenson et al., 2008), romantic feelings (Ireland et al.,
2011; Jones et al., 2004; Ohadi et al., 2018), and hostage negotiations (Taylor & Thomas, 2008). Its
utility is clear from evidence that influence targets underestimate its force (Bailenson & Yee, 2005;
Gonzales et al., 1983) as well as from its _coached enhancement of restaurant servers’ tips (van_
Baaren et al., 2003), electronics salespersons’ profits (Jacob et al., 2011), negotiators’ outcomes
(Maddux, Mullen, & Galinsky, 2008; Moore et al., 1999; Morris et al., 2002; Swaab, Maddux, &
Sinaceur, 2011), and speed-daters’ romantic wins (Guéguen, 2009).
6. The idea that people typically attend more to differences than commonalities was supported by
Houston, Sherman, & Baker (1991) and Olson & James (2002); however, these results were found in
Western cultures. Although I know of no research into the matter, it would be worth knowing if the
same pattern would appear in Eastern cultures, where, traditionally, harmony is emphasized. The
analysis of thirty-two negotiation studies involved more than five thousand participants and was
performed by Thompson & Hrebec (1996). The research demonstrating that people initially
underestimate the favorability of their later interactions with out-group members (Mallett, Wilson, &
Gilbert, 2008) found that men and women were equally susceptible to this mistake. Apparently,
women’s well-known tendencies toward interpersonal harmony are not enough to protect them from
this error when another is from an out-group.
7. The brain-imaging study was conducted at UCLA’s Brain Mapping Center by Sherman et al.
(2016). It is interesting that in the context of studies showing that compliments delivered by humans
stimulate significant amounts of liking in response (Higgins & Judge, 2004; Seiter, 2007; Seiter &
Dutson, 2007), the authors of the study of machine-based compliments have argued that their results
are due to the same psychological tendencies and that, therefore, designers should build frequent
praise into software programs (such as “Your careful work is impressive” or “Good thinking!”) and
to do so “even when there may be little basis for the evaluation” (Fogg & Nass, 1997b).

-----

8. The study showing that our susceptibility to praise that is insincere or offered in pursuit of a
clear ulterior motive (Drachman, deCarufel, & Insko, 1978) has been supported by subsequent
research (Chan & Sengupta, 2010; Vonk, 2002). I’m as susceptible as anyone. After my election to a
certain scientific society, I received a congratulatory note from one of my state’s elected
representatives praising my “dedication to excellence.” Although I knew the note was an electoral
tactic designed to curry favor, I liked her more afterward. See Vonk (2002) for evidence that
observers who suspect a flatterer is being insincere assign the flatterer an ulterior motive for the
praise; thus, although recipients of flattery tend to believe both sincere and insincere praise, there is a
penalty for insincere flattery—surrounding onlookers register it for what it is and dislike the flatterer.
9. I am not the only one who has trouble giving compliments. Most people do—for one reason,
they underestimate the positive effect of compliments on recipients (Boothby & Bons, 2020; Zhao &
Epley, 2020). The tendency of people to arrange to be associated with good news and avoid being
associated with bad news, even if they didn’t cause it, has been confirmed by Rosen & Tesser (1970);
furthermore, this tendency seems to appear because people recognize that they acquire the character
of the messages they bring (John, Blunden, & Liu, 2019). The advantage that behind-the-back
compliments have of avoiding the perception of an ulterior motive is considerable. Research by
Main, Dahl, & Dark (2007) shows that in situations where an ulterior motive is suspected, flattery
has an automatic negative impact on trust.
10. Altercasting was first described as an influence technique by sociologists Eugene Weinstein and
Paul Deutschberger (1963); since then, its theoretical development has been advanced primarily by
the psychologist Anthony Pratkanis (2000, 2007; Pratkanis & Uriel, 2011). Journalist Elizabeth
Bernstein (2016) has provided a popular-press account of how altercasting works; see
www.wsj.com/articles/if-you-want-to-persuade-people-try-altercasting-1473096624. It’s
demonstrably the case that attributing a praiseworthy trait to either children (Cialdini et al., 1998;
Miller, Brickman, & Bollen, 1975) or adults (Kraut, 1973; Strenta & DeJong, 1981) can produce
more trait-like behavior as a consequence.
11. The study of true-versus–reverse-image photographs (Mita, Dermer, & Knight, 1977) has been
extended in research by Cho & Schwarz (2010). Instructions for how to reverse the image of a selfie
can be found at https://webcazine.com/17190/qa-can-you-flip-or-mirror-a-picture-using-the-nativephoto-editor-on-samsung-galaxy-phone. The positive effect of familiarity on liking has been reported
in multiple settings (Monahan, Murphy, & Zajonc, 2000; Moreland & Topolinski, 2010; Reis et al.,
2011; Verosky & Todorov, 2010).

Evidence that people come to believe the communications they are exposed to most frequently is
both disturbing and compelling (Bornstein, Leone, & Galley, 1987; Fang, Singh, & Ahulwailia,
2007; Moons, Mackie, & Garcia-Marques, 2009; Unkelbach et al., 2019), as is work indicating that
the effect applies even to implausible claims such as those characteristic of “fake news” (Fazio,
Rand, & Pennycook, 2019; Pennycook, Conner, & Rand, 2018). One set of reviewers of the truth-byrepetition phenomenon attributes it to a “fluency” effect in which repetition causes an idea to be
easier to retrieve, picture, and process, giving it the psychological “feel” of the truth (Dechêne et al.,
2010). Although acknowledging the role of fluency, other researchers have also pointed to the role of
salience (the extent to which an item captures attention) in why relatively more exposures to an item
make it seem more worthy (Mrkva & Van Boven, 2020).
12. Not only have researchers documented the beneficial effects of positive contact on attitudes
toward out-group members, such as individuals of different race (e.g., Onyeador et al., 2020; Shook
& Fazio, 2008), ethnicity (e.g., Al Ramiah & Hewstone, 2013; Kende et al., 2018; Jackson et al.,
2019), or sexual orientation (e.g., Tadlock et al., 2017); several have offered reasons for the benefit—
including reduced anxiety (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Wölfer et al., 2019), increased empathy (Al
Ramiah & Hewstone, 2013; Hodson, 2011), and greater openness to experiences (Hodson et al.,
2018).

-----

Reasons for the failure of greater contact to improve attitudes in the schools (Stephan, 1978) can
be understood as flowing from tendencies for racial self-separation (Dixon, Durrheim, & Tredoux,
2005; Oskamp & Schultz, 1998) and for multiple negative experiences there, which reverse increased
contact’s positive effect and turn it more intensely negative (Barlow et al., 2012; Ilmarinen,
Lönnqvist, & Paunonen, 2016; McKeown & Dixon, 2017; Richeson & Shelton, 2007).
13. The long quote describing the competitive nature of the typical American classroom (Aronson,
1975, pp. 44, 47), as well as evidence of the transformative impact of the jigsaw classroom program
can be found in the work of Elliot Aronson and his collaborators (see Aronson et al., 1978, for a
summary). Other versions of cooperative learning procedures in different school systems—and even
different types of institutions such as business organizations (Blake & Mouton, 1979)—have
produced similar outcomes (Johnson, 2003; Oskamp & Shultz, 1998; Roseth, Johnson, & Johnson,
2008).
14. The classic research of Sherif and coworkers (1961) has been supported by other researchers
(Paolini et al., 2004; Wright et al., 1997), who confirmed that a shift from rivals to friends is made
possible by the shift from competition to cooperation. The studies showing that beginning a
negotiation with a handshake enhances the joint outcomes of the bargaining parties (Schroeder et al.,
2019) makes me think the effect might be strengthened if, after a lunch break, the parties shook
hands again. Although considerable evidence establishes the typical superiority of cooperative
approaches to other forms of interpersonal orientations (Johnson, 2003; Roseth, Johnson, & Johnson,
2008; Stanne, Johnson, & Johnson, 1999), it would be naive to think that cooperative acts would be
always best or even always effective. For instance, if a bargainer were to initiate a handshake every
few minutes throughout a negotiation, my guess is that the tactic would foster suspicion and the
effect would be toxic. As other research has indicated, installing cooperative-learning programs isn’t
universally successful (Rosenfeld & Stephan, 1981; Slavin, 1983), competition can sometimes prove
useful (Murayama & Elliot, 2012), and invariant prescriptions for cooperation can backfire (Cikara &
Paluck, 2013).

The conception of hell and heaven attributable to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok appears in
analogous versions within Buddhist, Christian, and Hindu religious traditions. Although the details
can change—for instance, instead of rigid elbow joints, inhabitants can be equipped with spoons or
chopsticks too long to feed themselves—the lesson of cooperation as a heavenly solution to human
problems surfaces in each.
15. It’s remarkable how innocent the delivers of bad news were in studies showing resulting
hostility toward them from recipients. In any rational view, they were not responsible for the
distasteful news; they had just been assigned to report it and gave no indication of enjoying doing so
(Blunden, 2019; Manis, Cornell, & Moore, 1974). There’s no doubt that such innocent associations
apply to both negative and positive connections; for example, listening to liked or disliked music
affects product preferences favorably or unfavorably, respectively (Gorn, 1982). For additional
evidence of the two-way impact of mere associations, see Hofmann et al. (2010), Hughes et al.
(2019), and Jones (2009). The evidence that observers assume we have the same traits as our friends
(Miller et al., 1966) and that an attractive model in an automobile ad influences men to like the car
more (Smith & Engel, 1968) has been long available.

The findings on the effects of credit cards on willingness to pay (Feinberg, 1986, 1990) have been
extended by McCall & Belmont (1996) to the size of tips in restaurants and by Prelec & Simester
(2001) to payments for tickets to a sports event; in the latter case, fans were willing to spend over 100
percent more to see a professional basketball game when paying by credit card versus cash.
16. The paragraph-long commentary on today’s “natural-is-better bias” came from Meier, Dillard, &
Lappas (2019). The Olympic Games aren’t the only sports events that corporations spend big money
to sponsor. For the 2018–19 season, corporate sponsorships of the National Football Association
totaled $1.39 billion. When Papa John’s Pizza ended its sponsorship as “Official Pizza of the NFL,”
Wall Street investors took note, and its stock price dropped by 8 percent immediately

-----

(https://thehustle.co/why-do-brands-want-to-sponsor-the-nfl). Journalists have documented the
impact of popular cultural phenomena on purchases of incidentally related consumer products such
as Mars candy bars (White, 1997) and the Nissan Rogue (Bomey, 2017). But it was researchers who
uncovered the connection of Sale signs to purchasing rates above those warranted by financial
savings (Naylor, Raghunathan, & Ramanathan, 2006).
17. Of course, Gregory Razran’s (1938, 1940) “luncheon technique” research was preceded by
Pavlov’s (1927) discovery of classical conditioning on which the technique is based. Li et al. (2007)
performed the work extending Razran’s findings regarding smells to odors so faint that subjects could
not knowingly sense them. The evidence is overwhelming that, like Pavlov’s dogs, we can be
susceptible to strategically fashioned pairings and clueless about our susceptibility. For instance, to
the delight of advertisers, simply superimposing a brand of Belgian beer five times onto pictures of
pleasant activities, such as sailing, waterskiing, and cuddling, increased observers’ positive feeling
toward the beer (Sweldens, van Osselaer, & Janiszewski, 2010); similarly superimposing a brand of
mouth-wash onto pictures of beautiful nature scenes six times led observers to feel more favorably
toward the brand right away and still three weeks afterward (Till & Priluck, 2000); and subliminally
exposing thirsty people eight times to pictures of happy (versus angry) faces just before having them
taste a new soft drink caused them to consume more of the drink and to be willing to pay three times
more for it in the store (Winkielman, Berridge, & Wilbarger, 2005). In none of these studies were the
participants aware they’d been influenced by the pairings. Just because we are often surreptitiously
influenced by mere associations doesn’t mean we don’t recognize how they work, as is evident from
the research (Rosen & Tesser, 1970) on our strong proclivity to connect ourselves to good news and
distance ourselves from bad news.
18. Although my research team (Cialdini et al., 1976) conducted the original basking-in-reflectedglory research on American football fans, it has been replicated with French and English soccer fans
(Bernache-Assolant, Lacassagne, & Braddock, 2007; Fan et al., 2019) and postelection voters in the
Netherlands and the United States (Boen et al., 2002; Miller, 2009). Additional research indicates a
reason for the practice: it works. Carter and Sanna (2006) found that individuals who were able to
assert a connection to a successful sports team gained favorability in the eyes of observers; however,
in keeping with the principle of association, this effect reversed if observers didn’t view the
successful team favorably. Tal-Or (2008) found that the basking-in-reflected-glory effect applied to a
specific and desirable form of evaluation from others. Individuals who claimed a close association
(“good friend”) to a successful basketball player were rated by observers as more successful
themselves.

#### Chapter 4: Social Proof
1. As another measure of the strength and ease of implementation of the “most popular dishes”
tactic, the Beijing restaurant chain (Mei Zhou Dong Po) has since incorporated it into all its locations
(Cai, Chen, & Fang, 2009). The impact of the London brewery’s bar sign was reported by advertising
expert Richard Shotton, who designed the test (Shotton, 2018). Research on McFlurry choices was
conducted by my InfluenceAtWork.com colleagues Steve J. Martin and Helen Mankin under the
auspices of Dan Gertsacov, at the time the chief marketing officer of Arcos Dorados S.A., which
owned the McDonald’s locations in Latin America. For additional details on this and other
