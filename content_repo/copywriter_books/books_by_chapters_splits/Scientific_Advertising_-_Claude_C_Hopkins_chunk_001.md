 How Advertising Laws Are Established

The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached the status of a
science. It is based on fixed principles and is reasonably exact. The causes and effects
have been analyzed until they are well understood. The correct method of procedure
have been proved and established. We know what is most effective, and we act on basic
laws.

Advertising, once a gamble, has thus become, under able direction, one of the
safest business ventures. Certainly no other enterprise with comparable possibilities need
involve so little risk.

Therefore, this book deals, not with theories and opinions, but with well-proved
principles and facts. It is written as a textbook for students and a safe guide for
advertisers. Every statement has been weighed. The book is confined to establish
fundamentals. If we enter any realms of uncertainty we shall carefully denote them.

The present status of advertising is due to many reasons. Much national
advertising has long been handled by large organizations known as advertising agencies.
Some of these agencies, in their hundreds of campaigns, have tested and compared the
thousands of plans and ideas. The results have been watched and recorded, so no lessons
have been lost.

Such agencies employ a high grade of talent. None but able and experienced men
can meet the requirements in national advertising. Working in co-operation, learning
from each other and from each new undertaking, some of these men develop into
masters.

Individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas behind them.
These become a part of the organization’s equipment, and a guide to all who follow.
Thus, in the course of decades, such agencies become storehouses of advertising
experiences, proved principles, and methods.

The larger agencies also come into intimate contact with experts in every
department of business. Their clients are usually dominating concerns. So they see the
results of countless methods and polices. They become a clearinghouse for everything
pertaining to merchandising. Nearly every selling question which arises in business is
accurately answered by many experiences.

-----

Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising
become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The compass of accurate knowledge
directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.

We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. This is done through
keyed advertising, by traced returns, largely by the use of coupons. We compare one way
with many others, backward and forward, and record the results. When one method
invariably proves best, that method becomes a fixed principle.

Mail order advertising is traced down to the fraction of a penny. The cost per
reply and cost per dollar of sale show up with utter exactness.

One ad is compared with another, one method with another. Headlines, settings,
sizes, arguments and pictures are compared. To reduce the cost of results even one per
cent means much in some mail order advertising. So no guesswork is permitted. One
must know what is best. Thus mail order advertising first established many of our basic
laws.

In lines where direct returns are impossible we compare one town with another.
Scores of methods may be compared in this way, measured by cost of sales.

But the most common way is by use of the coupon. We offer a sample, a book, a
free package, or something to induce direct replies. Thus we learn the amount of action
which each ad engenders.

But those figures are not final. One ad may bring too many worthless replies,
another replies that are valuable. So our final conclusions are always based on cost per
customer or cost per dollar of sale.

These coupon plans are dealt with further in the chapter on “Test Campaigns.”
Here we explain only how we employ them to discover advertising principles.

In a large ad agency coupon returns are watched and recorded on hundreds of
different lines. In a single line they are sometimes recorded on thousands of separate ads.
Thus we test everything pertaining to advertising. We answer nearly every possible
question by multitudinous traced returns.

Some things we learn in this way apply only to particular lines. But even those
supply basic principles for analogous undertakings.

-----

Others apply to all lines. They become fundamentals for advertising in general.
They are universally applied. No wise advertiser will ever depart from those unvarying
laws.

We propose in this book to deal with those fundamentals, those universal
principles. To teach only established techniques. There is that technique in advertising, as
in all art, science and mechanics. And it is, as in all lines, a basic essential.

The lack of those fundamentals has been the main trouble with advertising of the
past. Each worker was a law unto himself. All previous knowledge, all progress in the
line, was a closed book to him. It was like a man trying to build a modern locomotive
without first ascertaining what others had done. It was like a Columbus starting out to
find an undiscovered land.

Men were guided by whims and fancies — vagrant, changing breezes. They rarely
arrived at their port. When they did, quite by accident, it was by a long roundabout
course.

Each early mariner in this sea mapped his own separate course. There were no
charts to guide him. Not a lighthouse marked a harbor, not a buoy showed a reef. The
wrecks were unrecorded, so countless ventures came to grief on the same rocks and
shoals.

Advertising was a gamble, a speculation of the rashest sort. One man’s guess on
the proper course was as likely to be as good as another’s. There were no safe pilots,
because few sailed the same course twice.

The condition has been corrected. Now the only uncertainties pertain to people
and to products, not to methods. It is hard to measure human idiosyncrasies, the
preferences and prejudices, the likes and dislikes that exist. We cannot say that an article
will be popular, but we know how to sell it in the most effective way.

Ventures may fail, but the failures are not disasters. Losses, when they occur, are
but trifling. And the causes are factors which has nothing to do with the advertising.

Advertising has flourished under these new conditions. It has multiplied in
volume, in prestige and respect. The perils have increased many fold. Just because the
gamble has become a science, the speculation a very conservative business.

These facts should be recognized by all. This is no proper field for sophistry or
theory, or for any other will-o’-the-wisp. The blind leading the blind is ridiculous. It is

-----

pitiful in a field with such vast possibilities. Success is a rarity, a maximum success an
impossibility, unless one is guided by laws as immutable as the law of gravitation.

So our main purpose here is to set down those laws, and to tell you how to prove
them for yourself. After them come a myriad of variations. No two advertising
campaigns are ever conducted on lines that are identical. Individuality is an essential.
Imitation is a reproach. But those variable things which depend on ingenuity have no
place in a text book on advertising. This is for groundwork only.

Our hope is to foster advertising through a better understanding. To place it on a
business basis. To have it recognized as among the safest, surest ventures which lead to
large returns. Thousand of conspicuous successes show its possibilities. Their variety
points out its almost unlimited scope. Yet thousands who need it, who can never attain
their deserts without it, still look upon its accomplishments as somewhat accidental.

That was so, but it is not so now. We hope that this book will throw some new
lights on the subject.

#### Chapter 2

 Just Salesmanship

To properly understand advertising or to learn even its rudiments one must start
with the right conception. Advertising is salesmanship. Its principles are the principles of
salesmanship. Successes and failures in both lines are due to like causes. Thus every
advertising question should be answered by the salesman’s standards.

Let us emphasize that point. The only purpose of advertising is to make sales. It
is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales.

It is not for general effect. It is not to keep your name before the people. It is not
primarily to aid your other salesmen. Treat it as a salesman. Force it to justify itself.
Compare it with other salesmen. Figure its cost and result. Accept no excuses which
good salesmen do not make. Then you will not go far wrong.

The difference is only in degree. Advertising is multiplied salesmanship. It may
appeal to thousands while the salesman talks to one. It involves a corresponding cost.
Some people spend $10 per word on an average advertisement. Therefore every ad
should be a super-salesman.

A salesman’s mistake may cost little. An advertisers mistake may cost a thousand
times that much. Be more cautious, more exacting, therefore. A mediocre salesman may
affect a small part of your trade. Mediocre advertising affects all of your trade.

Many think of advertising as ad writing. Literary qualifications have no more to
do with it than oratory has with salesmanship. One must be able to express himself
briefly, clearly and convincingly, just as a salesman must. But fine writing is a distinct
disadvantage. So is unique literary style. They take attention from the subject. They
reveal the hook. Any studies done that attempt to sell, if apparent, creates corresponding
resistance.

That is so in personal salesmanship as in salesmanship-in-print. Fine talkers are
rarely good salesmen. They inspire buyers with the fear of over-influence. They create
the suspicion that an effort is made to sell them on other lines than merit.

Successful salesmen are rarely good speech makers. They have few oratorical
graces. They are plain and sincere men who know their customers and know their lines.
So it is in ad writing. Many of the ablest men in advertising are graduate salesmen. The

-----

best we know have been house-to-house canvassers. They may know little of grammar,
nothing of rhetoric, but they know how to use words that convince.

There is one simple way to answer many advertising questions. Ask yourself,
“Would it help a salesman sell the goods?” “Would it help me sell them if I met a buyer
in person?” A fair answer to those questions avoids countless mistakes. But when one
tries to show off, or does things merely to please himself, he is little likely to strike a
chord which leads people to spend money. Some argue for slogans, some like clever
conceits. Would you use them in personal salesmanship? Can you imagine a customer
whom such things would impress? If not, don’t rely on them for selling in print.

Some say “Be very brief. People will read for little.” Would you say that to a
salesman? With a prospect standing before him, would you confine him to any certain
number of words? That would be an unthinkable handicap. So in advertising. The only
readers we get are people whom our subject interests. No one reads ads for amusements,
long or short. Consider them as prospects standing before you, seeking for information.
Give them enough to get action.

Some advocate large type and big headlines. Yet they do not admire salesmen
who talk in loud voices. People read all they care to read in 8-point type. Our magazines
and newspapers are printed in that type. Folks are accustomed to it. Anything louder is
like loud conversation. It gains no attention worthwhile. It may not be offensive, but it is
useless and wasteful. It multiplies the cost of your story. And to many it seems loud and
blatant.

Others look for something queer and unusual. They want ads distinctive in style
or illustration. Would you want that in a salesman? Do not men who act and dress in
normal ways make a far better impression? Some insist on dressy ads. That is all right to
a certain degree, but is quite important. Some poorly-dressed men, prove to be excellent
salesmen. Over dress in either is a fault.

So with countless questions. Measure them by salesmen’s standards, not by
amusement standards. Ads are not written to entertain. When they do, those
entertainment seekers are little likely to be the people whom you want. That is one of the
greatest advertising faults. Ad writers abandon their parts. They forget they are salesmen
and try to be performers. Instead of sales, they seek applause.

When you plan or prepare an advertisement, keep before you a typical buyer.
Your subject, your headline has gained his or her attention. Then in everything be guided
by what you would do if you met the buyer face-to-face. If you are a normal man and a
good salesman you will then do your level best.

-----

Don’t think of people in the mass. That gives you a blurred view. Think of a
typical individual, man or woman, who is likely to want what you sell. Don’t try to be
amusing. Money spending is a serious matter. Don’t boast, for all people resent it. Don’t
try to show off. Do just what you think a good salesman should do with a half-sold
person before him.

Some advertising men go out in person and sell to people before they plan to
write an ad. One of the ablest of them has spent weeks on one article, selling from house
to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different forms of argument and
approach. They learn what possible buyers want and the factors which don’t appeal. It is
quite customary to interview hundreds of possible customers. Others send out
questionnaires to learn the attitude of the buyers. In some way all must learn how to
strike responsive chords. Guesswork is very expensive.

The maker of an advertised article knows the manufacturing side and probably
the dealers side. But this very knowledge often leads him astray in respect to customers.
His interests are not in their interests. The advertising man studies the consumer. He
tries to place himself in the position of the buyer. His success largely depends on doing
that to the exclusion of everything else.

This book will contain no more important chapter than this one on salesmanship.
The reason for most of the non-successes in advertising is trying to sell people what they
do not want. But next to that comes lack of true salesmanship.

Ads are planned and written with some utterly wrong conception. They are
written to please the seller. The interest of the buyer are forgotten. One can never sell
goods profitably, in person or in print, when that attitude exists.

#### Chapter 3

 Offer Service

Remember the people you address are selfish, as we all are. They care nothing
about your interests or profit. They seek service for themselves. Ignoring this fact is a
common mistake and a costly mistake in advertising. Ads say in effect, “Buy my brand.
Give me the trade you give to others. Let me have the money.” That is not a popular
appeal.

The best ads ask no one to buy. That is useless. Often they do not quote a price.
They do not say that dealers handle the product. The ads are based entirely on service.
They offer wanted information. They site advantages to users. Perhaps they offer a
sample, or to buy the first package, or to send something on approval, so the customer
may prove the claims without any cost or risks. Some of these ads seem altruistic. But
they are based on the knowledge of human nature. The writers know how people are led
to buy. Here again is salesmanship. The good salesman does not merely cry a name. He
doesn’t say, “Buy my article.” He pictures the customers side of his service until the
natural result is to buy.

A brush maker has some 2,000 canvassers who sells brushes from house to
house. He is enormously successful in a line which would seem very difficult. And it
would be for his men if they asked the housewives to buy. But they don’t. They go to the
door and say, “I was sent here to give you a brush. I have samples here and I want you to
take your choice.” The housewife is all smiles and attention. In picking out one brush she
sees several she wants. She is also anxious to reciprocate the gift. So the salesman gets an
order.

Another concern sells coffee, etc., by wagons in some 500 cities. The man drops
in with a half-pound of coffee and says, “Accept this package and try it. I’ll come back in
a few days to ask how you liked it.” Even when he comes back he doesn’t ask for an
order. He explains that he wants the women to have a fine kitchen utensil. It isn’t free,
but if she likes the coffee he will credit five cents on each pound she buys until she has
paid for the article. Always some service.

The maker of the electric sewing machine motor found advertising difficult. So,
on good advice, he ceased soliciting a purchase. He offered to send to any home,
through any dealer, a motor for one weeks’ use. With it would come a man to show how
to operate it. “Let us help you for a week without cost or obligation,” said the ad. Such
an offer was resistless, and about nine in ten of the trials led to sales.
