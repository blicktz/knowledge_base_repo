Chapter 15 presents guidelines on how marketers should write for and use social media to build brands, generate clicks and conversions, and ultimately sell products.

HOW MULTICHANNEL MARKETING HAS CHANGED COPYWRITING

 The major event that has taken place since the publication of the first edition of The Copywriter’s Handbook is the rise of the Internet as a marketing medium and channel for e-commerce.
 The problem for marketing managers, brand managers, small business owners, and copywriters is the growing number of marketing channels, planning how to integrate them into a successful campaign, and then creating a sales funnel for maximum results. A “sales funnel” is a planned sequence of communications that takes people from being unfamiliar with you to doing business with you.
 For instance, many clients ask their copywriters to boost conversion rates on their Web sites. When the copywriter asks what the current conversion rate is, some clients often don’t know, because they don’t measure. (“Conversion rate” is the percentage of users who land on a Web site or landing page and order a product, download free content, or otherwise respond to the call to action.) But without a metric by which to measure and evaluate results, you have no way of knowing which copy is working best.
 The other challenge created by the proliferation of marketing channels is “attribution.” In modern marketing parlance, attribution is knowing which promotion is the original source of the inquiry or order. In a multichannel world, proper attribution can be difficult, with clicks coming in from so many sources, often simultaneously. That’s a problem because the less accurately you can track attribution and ad performance, the less you know

 According to eMarketer, of the more than one thousand marketers surveyed, more than four out of ten identified “integration of marketing tools for greater efficiencies” as a top priority.[9]

## WRITING TO GET ATTENTION: THE
 HEADLINE AND SUBJECT LINE

### When you read a magazine, newspaper, or e-newsletter, you ignore most of the ads and look at or click only a few. Yet many of the ads you skip are selling products that may be of interest to you.
 The reason you don’t read more ads is simple: there are just too many advertisements competing for your attention. And you don’t have the time —or the inclination—to read them all.
 This is why you, as a copywriter, must work hard to get attention for your ad, e-mail, landing page, or podcast. Wherever you turn—the Web, magazines, television, or the e-mail inbox—there are just too many things competing for your reader’s attention.
 For example, each year American companies spend about half a trillion dollars on media advertising.[1]
 Even worse, your ad competes with all of the other content that crosses the reader’s desk or screen.
 Let’s say you’re writing an ad to sell laboratory equipment to scientists. Your ad will compete with other ads in the scientific journal in which it is published. The scientist probably receives a dozen or more such journals every month. Each is filled with articles and papers he or she should read to keep up-to-date in his field.
 And scientists are suffering from massive information overload: 2.5 million scientific articles are published annually[2]—and the total amount of

-----

### knowledge in the world doubles every twelve days,[3] as incredible at that sounds.
 This increased amount of information makes it difficult for any single piece of information to be noticed. Most Americans in urban areas are exposed to more than four thousand ad messages per day.[4]
 Obviously, those ads that don’t do something special to grab the reader’s attention are not noticed and not read. Bob Donath, former editor of Business Marketing, says the successful ad is one that is able to “pop through the clutter.”
 Direct-mail advertisers know that a sales letter has only five seconds in which to gain the reader’s attention. If the reader finds nothing of interest after five seconds of scanning the letter, she will toss the letter in the trash. Similarly, an ad or commercial has only a few seconds to capture the prospect’s interest before the prospect turns the page or goes to the refrigerator. The average cold business e-mail (“cold” meaning sent to a rented e-list) has an open rate of between 14 and 23 percent.[5]
 In advertising, getting attention is the job of the headline. “If you can come up with a good headline, you are almost sure to have a good ad,” writes John Caples in his book How to Make Your Advertising Make Money. “But even the greatest writer can’t save an ad with a poor headline.”

 HOW HEADLINES GET ATTENTION

 In all forms of advertising, the “first impression”—the first thing the reader sees, reads, or hears—can mean the difference between success and failure. If the first impression is boring or irrelevant, the ad will not attract your prospect. If it offers news or helpful information or promises a reward for reading the ad, the first impression will win the reader’s attention. And this is the first step in persuading the reader to buy your product.
 What, specifically, is this “first impression”?

 In a print advertisement, it is the headline and the visual. On a Web site, it is the home page headline and copy.

### In a radio or TV commercial, it’s the first few seconds of the commercial. In a direct-mail package, it’s the copy on the outer envelope or the first few sentences in the letter. In a press release, it’s the lead paragraph. In a sales brochure or catalog, it’s the front cover. In a sales presentation, it’s the first few PowerPoint slides. In an online video, it’s the first twenty seconds of the video. In an e-mail marketing message, it’s the From line and the Subject line.

 No matter how persuasive your body copy or how great your product, your ad cannot sell if it does not attract your customer’s attention. Most advertising experts agree that an attention-getting headline is a key ingredient in a successful advertisement.
 Here’s what David Ogilvy, author of Confessions of an Advertising Man, says about headlines:

The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which
decides whether the reader will read the copy.
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you
have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s
money.

### Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?
 Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?
 The answer is clear. When you shop, you want products that satisfy your needs—and your budget. Good copywriters recognize this fact and put sales

### appeal—not cute, irrelevant gimmicks and wordplay—in their headlines. When readers browse ad headlines, they want to know: “What’s in it for me?”
 The effective headline tells the reader: “Hey, stop a minute! This is something of interest to you!” As mail-order copywriter John Caples explains, “The best headlines appeal to people’s self-interest, or give news.”
 Let’s look at a few examples:

 • A classic appeal to self-interest is the headline “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” from an ad for the Dale Carnegie book of the same name. The headline promises that you will make friends and be able to persuade others if you read the ad and order the book. The benefit is almost irresistible. Who but a hermit doesn’t want more friends?

 • An ad for Kraft Foods appeals to the homemaker with the headline “How to Eat Well for Nickels and Dimes.” If you are interested in good nutrition for your family but must watch your budget carefully, this ad speaks directly to your needs.

 • The headline for a Duncan Hines ad hooks us with the question, “Know the Secret to Moister, Richer Cake?” We are promised a reward— the secret to moist cake—in return for reading the copy.

 • “Geico can save you 15% on your auto insurance in 15 minutes” offers the most basic and appealing offer: saving time and money.

 • “Dollar Shave Club: Shaving and Grooming Made Simple” stresses the main benefit of convenience: razors and other shaving supplies are shipped automatically, eliminating the need to go to the drugstore to purchase them.

 Each of these headlines offers a benefit to the consumer, a reward for reading the copy. And each promises to give you specific, helpful information in return for the time you invest in reading the ad and the money you spend to buy the product.

 THE FOUR FUNCTIONS OF THE HEADLINE

-----

### Headlines do more than get attention. The Dale Carnegie headline, for example, lures you into the body copy of the ad by promising useful information. The Duncan Hines ad also gets you interested in reading more. And it selects a specific type of reader—those people who are interested in baking cakes.
 Your headline can perform four different tasks:

 1. Get attention. 2. Select the audience. 3. Deliver a complete message. 4. Draw the reader into the body copy.

 Let’s take a look at how headlines perform each of these jobs.

 1. Getting Attention

 We’ve already seen how headlines get attention by appealing to the reader’s self-interest. Here are a few more examples of this type of headline:

“Give Your Kids a Fighting Chance” Crest

“Why Swelter Through Another Hot Summer?” GE air conditioners

“For Deep-Clean, Oil-Free Skin, Noxzema Has the Solution” Noxzema moisturizer

### Another effective attention-getting gambit is to give the reader news. Headlines that give news often use words such as new, discover, introducing, announcing, now, it’s here, at last, and just arrived.

“New Sensational Video Can Give You Thin Thighs Starting Now!” Exercise

“Discover Our New Rich-Roasted Taste” Decaffeinated coffee

### If you can legitimately use the word free in your headline, do so. Free is one of the most powerful words in the copywriter’s vocabulary. Everybody

-----

### wants to get something for free.
 Other powerful attention-getting words include how to, why, you, sale, quick, easy, bargain, last chance, guarantee, results, proven, and save. Do not avoid these words because other copywriters use them with such frequency. Other copywriters use these words because they work. You should, too. Grade your performance as a copywriter on sales generated by your copy, not on originality.
 Headlines that offer the reader useful information are also attention getters. The information promised in the headline can be given in the copy or in a free booklet the reader can send for. Some examples:

“Free New Report on 67 Emerging Growth Stocks” Merrill Lynch

“Three Easy Steps to Fine Wood Finishing” Minwax Wood Finish

“How to Bake Beans” Van Camp’s

### Many advertisers try to get attention with headlines and gimmicks that don’t promise the reader a benefit or are not related to the product in any way. One industrial manufacturer features a photo of a scantily clad woman in his ads, with an offer to send a reprint of the photo to readers who clip the coupon and write in for a brochure on the manufacturer’s equipment. It bombed.
 Does this type of gambit get attention? Yes, but not attention that leads to a sale or to real interest in the product. Attention getting for attention getting’s sake attracts a lot of curious bystanders but precious few serious customers.
 When you write a headline, get attention by picking out an important customer benefit or concern and presenting it in a clear, bold, dramatic fashion. Avoid headlines and concepts that are cute, clever, and titillating but irrelevant. They may generate some hoopla, but they do not sell.

 2. Selecting the Audience

-----

### If you are selling life insurance to people over sixty-five, there is no point in writing an ad that generates inquiries from young families. In the same way, an ad for a $95,000 sports car should imply, “This is for rich folks only!” You don’t want to waste time answering inquiries from people who cannot afford the product.
 The headline can select the right audience for your ad and screen out those readers who are not potential customers. A good headline for a life insurance ad might read, “To Men and Women over 65 Who Need Affordable Life Insurance Coverage.”
 Here are a few more headlines that do a good job of selecting the right audience for the product:

“A Message to All Charter Security Life Policyholders of Single
Premium Deferred Annuities”

Charter Security
life insurance

“Is Your Electric Bill Too High?” Utility ad

“Can you trust solar heating companies you never heard of who try to sell
Solar panels
you solar roof panels over the phone?”

### 3. Delivering a Complete Message

 According to David Ogilvy, four out of five readers will read the headline and skip the rest of the ad. If this is the case, it pays to make a complete statement in your headline.
 That way, the ad can do some selling to those 80 percent of readers who read headlines only. Here are a few headlines that deliver complete messages:

 “Caught Soon Enough, Early Tooth Decay Can Actually Be Repaired by Colgate!”

 “Hitachi Chiller-Heater Cuts Cooling and Heating Costs Up to 50%”

 “Allstate—with accident insurance, they guarantee your car insurance rates won’t go up because of an accident.”

-----

### Ogilvy recommends that you include the selling promise and the brand name in the headline. Many effective headlines don’t include the product name. But put it in if you suspect most of your prospects won’t bother to read the copy underneath. For instance, having the product name in the headline or subhead in a half-page newspaper ad for health offers typically boosts response.

 4. Drawing the Reader into the Body Copy

 Certain product categories—liquor, soft drinks, and fashion, for example— can be sold with an attractive photo, a powerful headline, and a minimum of words.
 But many products—automobiles, computers, books, records, home study programs, life insurance, and investments—require that the reader be given a lot of information. That information appears in the body copy, and for the ad to be effective the headline must compel the reader to read this copy.
 To draw the reader into the body copy, you must arouse his or her curiosity. You can do this with news, or intrigue, or mystery. You can ask a question or make a provocative statement. You can promise a reward, news, or useful information.
 A sales letter offering motivational pamphlets was mailed to business managers. The headline of the letter was “What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?” Naturally, American managers wanted to find out about the techniques the Japanese use to run their businesses so effectively.
 A classic headline for an ad offering a facial lotion reads: “The $5 Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.” The reader is lured into the ad to satisfy her curiosity about what this inexpensive alternative might be. The headline would not have been as successful if it said, “$5 Bottle of Lotion Is an Inexpensive Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.”

 EIGHT BASIC HEADLINE TYPES

-----

### It’s only natural for a creative person to avoid formulas, to strive for originality and new, fresh approaches. To the creative writer, many of the headlines in this chapter might seem to follow rigid formulas: “How to…,” “Three Easy Ways…,” “Introducing the New…” And to an extent, copywriters do follow certain rules, because these formulas have been proven effective in thousands of letters, brochures, ads, e-mails, and online videos.
 Remember, as a copywriter, you are not a creative artist; you are a salesperson. Your job is not to create literature; your job is to persuade people to buy the product. As the late John Francis Tighe, a top direct-mail copywriter, pointed out, “We are not in the business of being original. We are in the business of reusing things that work.”
 Of course, John didn’t mean that copywriters spend their time deliberately copying the work of other writers. The challenge is to take what works and apply it to your product in a way that is compelling, memorable, and persuasive. Certainly, the best copywriters succeed by breaking the rules. But you have to know the rules before you can break them effectively.
 Here, then, are eight time-tested headline categories that have helped sell billions of dollars’ worth of products and services. Study them, use them well, and then go on to create your own breakthroughs in headline writing.

 1. Direct Headlines

 Direct headlines state the selling proposition directly, with no wordplay, hidden meanings, or puns. “Pure Silk Blouses—30 Percent Off” is a headline that’s about as direct as you can get. Most retailers use newspaper ads with direct headlines to announce sales and bring customers into their stores.

 2. Indirect Headlines

 The indirect headline makes its point in a roundabout way. It arouses curiosity, and the questions it raises are answered in the body copy.
