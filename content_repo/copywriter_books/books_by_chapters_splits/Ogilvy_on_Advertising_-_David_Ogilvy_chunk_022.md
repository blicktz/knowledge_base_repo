##### “At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock”

_What makes Rolls-Royce the best car in the world? “There is really no magic about it — is_

_merely patient attention to detail” says an eminent Rolls-Royce engineer._

**1. “At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise comes from the electric clock,” reports the**

Technical Editor of THE MOTOR. Three mu�ers tune out sound frequencies — acoustically.

**2. Every Rolls-Royce engine is run for seven hours at full throttle before installation, and**

each car is test-driven for hundreds of miles over varying road surfaces.

**3. The Rolls-Royce is designed as an owner-driven car. It is eighteen inches shorter than the**

largest domestic cars.

**4. The car has power steering, power brakes and automatic gear-shift. It is very easy to**

drive and to park. No chau�eur required.

**5. The �nished car spends a week in the �nal test-shop, being �ne-tuned. Here it is**

subjected to 98 separate or- deals. For example, the engineers use a stethoscope to listen for

axle-whine.

**6. The Rolls-Royce is guaranteed for three years. With a new network of dealers and parts-**

depots from Coast to Coast, service is no problem.

**7. The Rolls-Royce radiator has never changed, except that when Sir Henry Royce died in**

1933 the monogram RR was changed from red to black.

**8. The coachwork is given �ve coats of primer paint, and hand rubbed between each coat,**

before nine coats of �nishing paint go on.

**9. By moving a switch on the steering column, you can adjust the shock-absorbers to suit**

road conditions.

**10. A picnic table, veneered in French walnut, slides out from under the dash. Two more**

swing out behind the front seats.

**11. You can get such optional extras as an Espresso co�ee-making machine, a dictating**

machine, a bed, hot and cold water for washing, an electric razor or a telephone.

-----

**12. There are three separate systems of power brakes, two hydraulic and one mechanical.**

Damage to one will not a�ect the others. The Rolls-Royce is a very safe car—and also a very

_lively car. It cruises serenely at eighty-�ve. Top speed is in excess of 100 m.p.h._

**13. The Bentley is made by Rolls-Royce. Except for the radiators, they are identical motor**

cars, manufactured by the same engineers in the same works. People who feel di�dent

about driving a Rolls-Royce can buy a Bentley.

##### Think small.

Our little car isn’t so much of a any more.

A couple of dozen college kids don’t try to squeeze inside it.

The guy at the gas station doesn’t ask where the gas goes.

Nobody even stares at our shape.

In fact, some people who drive our little �ivver don’t even think 32 miles to the gallon is

going any great guns.

Or using �ve pints of oil instead of �ve quarts.

Or never needing anti-freeze.

Or racking up 40,000 miles on a set of tires.

That’s because once you get used to some of our economies, you don’t even think about

them any more.

Except when you squeeze into a small parking spot. Or renew your small insurance. Or

pay a small repair bill. Or trade in your old VW for a new one.

Think it over.

Hello?

_You snore._

And you steal all the covers. What time did you leave?

_Six-thirty. You looked like a toppled Greek statue lying there. Only some tourist had swiped_

_your �g leaf. I was tempted to wake you up._

I miss you already.

_You’re going to miss something else. Have you looked in the bathroom yet?_

-----

Why?

_I took your bottle of Paco Rabanne cologne._

What on earth are you going to do with it … give it to a secret lover you’ve got stashed

away in San Francisco?

_I’m going to take some and rub it on my body when 1 go to bed tonight. And then I’m going_

_to remember every little thing about you … and last night._

Do you know what your voice is doing to me?

_You aren’t the only one with imagination. I’ve got to go; they’re calling my �ight. I’ll be back_

_Tuesday. Can I bring you anything?_

My Paco Rabanne. And a �g leaf.

Paco Rabanne

A cologne for men

What is remembered is up to you
