2. You can slice right through it …

3. Prepare any number of delicious chicken dishes, from
chicken scampi to chicken salad, quickly and easily,
without having to cut around bones.

-----

4. MS: Smiling family eating
chicken.

5. CU: Fully sliced chicken on
platter.

6. CU: Packaged chicken, showing
Galantine name and logo.

4. A Galantine chicken costs a bit more than an ordinary
chicken.

5. But then there’s no waste. You get one hundred percent
meat.

6. So if you have a bone to pick with ordinary chicken, try
Galantine instead. At your butcher’s and at fine grocers
everywhere.

### There are a number of things I like about this commercial:

 1. It’s simple—easy to take in—and inexpensive to produce. 2. The visuals show the product, a demonstration of the product (easy slicing of boneless chicken), people enjoying the product, and the package —all in thirty seconds.
 3. The narration tells us the unique selling feature of the chicken (no bones), the benefits of this feature (slice right through it, no waste, quick and easy), and shows what you can do with the product (prepare any number of dishes).
 4. The ending (“if you have a bone to pick with ordinary chicken”) is a clever play on words that leaves a smile on your face. And it tells you where you can buy the product.

 Here’s another effective thirty-second spot from the same writer:

Writer: Amy Bly
Product: YOURS beer for women (30 seconds)

### VIDEO: AUDIO:

1. MS: Well-dressed couple sitting in fancy
restaurant. Man reaches for bottle of beer on
table. Woman slaps his hand away playfully.

1. WOMAN: Hey, that’s YOURS!

2. MS: Man’s face. He looks over at her,
2. MAN: If it’s mine, why can’t I have it?
puzzled, grinning.

-----

3. TS: Woman’s finger pointing at label on
bottle.

4. MS: Woman pouring beer.

5. MS: Woman finishes pouring beer and
picks up glass.

3. WOMAN: Because YOURS is the beer that’s
made for women only.

4. SFX: Beer being poured into glass. ANNCR:
YOURS is bubbly, light, and has fewer calories
than ordinary beer.

5. ANNCR: And, it comes in convenient ten-ounce
bottles that pour one perfect glass of beer …
enough to quench your thirst without filling you
up.

6. MS: Man reaching for glass of beer. 6. MAN: Why can’t I have YOURS?

7. MS: Woman pulls glass away, smiling. 7. WOMAN: ’Cause it’s mine …

8. TS: Bottle of YOURS against black
background.

8. ANNCR: (VO): YOURS … the first beer for
women only.

### This is basically a lifestyle commercial combined with a presentation of product benefits. YOURS is a beer for women who eat in fancy restaurants, dress well, and have attractive, personable dinner companions. You can picture Cameron Diaz and Dylan McDermott playing the upscale duo.
 Other things I like about the script:

 1. It is fun, humorous, and playful. But all the playfulness is relevant to
 the product! 2. The product has a strong position: “The first beer for women only.” 3. The commercial highlights product features that would appeal to
 women: light, few calories, small servings per bottle. 4. The name is repeated five times and the label shown twice.

 HOW TO WRITE RADIO COMMERCIALS

 Radio is different from TV and print. And the difference is threefold. First, the radio spot may be prerecorded by professional voice-over actors with music and sound effects, or it may be read on the air by the radio personality.

-----

### Second, buying radio time is usually far less costly than buying TV time. Third, much of your audience is driving while listening to your commercial, which makes writing down a phone number or URL more difficult.
 The radio copywriter works with words and sounds. Words and sounds must create a picture of the product in the reader’s mind.
 A radio commercial for “Aunt Lucy’s Luscious Blueberry Pie” can’t show the family eating and enjoying the pie. So you must use sound to paint the picture of the pie being sliced, of a fork cutting into crust, of chewing, of people “mmm”-ing in delight and praising their hostess.
 Suppose the blueberry pies are sold in local supermarkets in a distinctive blue foil wrapper. You can’t show the package on radio. You must have the announcer say, “Look for the homemade pie in the blue foil wrapper at your local supermarket and bake shop.”
 A mini-industry has developed around independent radio production houses that write and produce radio commercials for ad agencies and their clients. Many ad agency writers and creative directors look down their noses at radio (perhaps because the money involved is insignificant compared with television) and are happy to pass on radio commercials to outsiders.
 There are trends and stars in radio advertising. For years, Stan Freberg was the rage with humorous radio commercials for Chung King and others. Then, Dick Orkin and Bert Berdis were the reigning kings. Then John Cleese of Monty Python fame became a hit with his spots for Callard & Bowser candies and Kronenbourg beer. And Jerry Seinfeld has featured in American Express ads.
 In an article published in Writer’s Digest, copywriter David Campiti offered these tips to radio novices.

 • Lock on to a salesperson’s “keys.” This is “inside information” a company’s salespeople get from talking with customers.

 • Feedback from customers can reveal key selling points. For instance, a copywriter interviewed farmers to find out why his radio commercial was not selling rat poison by mail. He discovered that farmers with rat problems were embarrassed about it and didn’t want the postman or neighbors to see

-----

### them receive rat poison packages in the mail. The copywriter added a line to the commercial about how the poison was mailed in a plain brown wrapper, and sales soared.

 • Talk about benefits. Tell the audience what the client’s goods will do for them.

 • Be concise. Use short sentences.
 • Repeat key information. Minimum: list store names twice; the URL toward the end once or twice. Include phone numbers at least twice, more in a sixty-second commercial. A recent development is encouraging response online or via texting.

 • Know what you’re writing about. Research the product.
 • Know what resources are available to the producers of radio commercials. Learn to use production facilities. Know the extent of their music and sound effects libraries, the quality and capability of recording equipment, and the abilities of actors who will read your copy over the air.

 Here are two radio commercials I like and the reasons why. First, a sixty-second spot from the Masonry Institute of St. Louis:

MAN: Uh, today we’re speaking with the Three Little Pigs, is that…?

PIGS: Yes, that’s right. You got it, buddy.

MAN: Yeah, well, tell me, ever since you guys opted to build with brick, have you had any further
difficulties with uh …

PIG #1: Big, bad, and breathless?

MAN: Right.

PIG #2: No, he never comes around anymore.

MAN: That’s good.

PIG #3: He knows better than to try and blow this pad down, boy!

MAN: Yes, well, besides solving your security problems, there must have been other reasons for
your choosing brick.

PIG #1: Listen, when you’re spending eighty big ones on a house these days you want something
that’ll last, right guys?

PIG #2: Oh yeah.

PIG #3: You said it.

MAN: Well, brick certainly does that, all right.

PIG #1: With little or no maintenance.

MAN: Right.

PIG #2: Not only keeps the wolf from the door but withstands fire, hail …

PIG #3: Aluminum-siding salesmen.

MAN: Yes, well, I notice you also have a solid brick fireplace as well.

-----

PIG #1: Yes, we do.

MAN: Very attractive.

PIG #2: We think it adds a nice little touch.

PIG #3: Especially when the girls come over.

MAN: Safe, too, I’ll bet.

PIG #1: It is. They aren’t. (Man and Pigs laugh.)

MAN: Is there anything else we should know about building with brick?

PIG #1: If there is, don’t ask us.

MAN: Oh?

PIG #2: Ask the folks at the Masonry Institute.

MAN: The Masonry Institute?

PIG #3: They’ll be happy to send you complete information.

MAN: On brick.

PIG #1: No, on paper.

MAN: What?!

PIG #1: They couldn’t get a brick in the envelope …
(Music)

ANNCR: If you’d like to know more about building with brick, call the Masonry Institute of St.
Louis at 555-550-5888. That’s 555-550-5888.

### The commercial caught and kept my attention because it is both fast- paced and genuinely funny. The banter between the three pigs and the interviewer keeps things lively. Yet this clever little dialogue manages to pack a great deal of product information into sixty seconds. We learn that:

 1. Brick stands up to the environment—hail, wind, storms. 2. Brick lasts a long time and requires little or no maintenance. 3. It is fireproof. 4. If your house is made of brick, you won’t need aluminum siding. 5. You can use brick to build a safe, attractive fireplace. 6. The Masonry Institute will send free information on building with
 brick to anyone who asks for it.

 The second radio spot that caught my ear is this classic sixty-second commercial for the California Milk Advisory Board, produced and performed by Dick Orkin and Bert Berdis:

MILK EXECUTIVE: Hello.

SIDNEY: California Milk Advisory Board?

-----

EXECUTIVE: Yes.

SIDNEY: May I make a small suggestion about your jingle?

EXECUTIVE: “Any time is the right time for milk”?

SIDNEY: Yes, it’s real catchy, but maybe you ought to change it to, “Any time is the right time for
milk except at a bullfight.”

EXECUTIVE (laughs): Sounded almost like you said, “Any time is the right time for milk except at
a bullfight.”

SIDNEY: That’s what I said.

EXECUTIVE: What…?

SIDNEY: Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Sidney Feltzer, freelance matador.

EXECUTIVE: Uh-huh.

SIDNEY: I love your milk.

EXECUTIVE: Uh-huh.

SIDNEY: Drink it all the time. It’s cold and refreshing …

EXECUTIVE: Go on, Sidney.

SIDNEY: But trying to drink milk with one hand and wave my cape with the other is just so …

EXECUTIVE: Sidney, you didn’t try to, uh…?

SIDNEY: Just today I went through six cartons.

EXECUTIVE: Of milk?

SIDNEY: Pants.

EXECUTIVE: Pants?

SIDNEY: See, when you turn and run, the bull is right there …

EXECUTIVE: Sidney, why not have your milk afterward?

SIDNEY: In the hospital?

EXECUTIVE: No, no, I meant after you exercise, milk is terrific, or with snacks, or just sitting down
watching television.

SIDNEY: Oh, I can’t do that.

EXECUTIVE: Watch television?

SIDNEY: No, sit.

EXECUTIVE: Oh.

SIDNEY: See, when you turn and run, the bull is right there.

EXECUTIVE: I see, I get it all right, Sidney.

JINGLE: Yeah! Any time at all … is the time for milk!

SIDNEY: Except during a bullfight.

EXECUTIVE: Hang it up, Sidney.

SIDNEY: My cape?

EXECUTIVE: The phone.

SIDNEY: Oh, right. (Music fades.)

ANNCR: This phone call brought to you by the California Milk Advisory Board.

### Again, a fast-paced, humorous commercial with a persuasive message. Note the use of very short (one- and two-word) sentences to set the pace.

 NONBROADCAST AV

-----

### Radio and TV commercials are the most visible part of the copywriter’s work, because we hear them every day. But each year, there are thousands of scripts written and produced that we never get to hear or see.
 This area of copywriting is known as nonbroadcast audiovisual (AV). These are audiovisual presentations created by a company and used to reach select, small audiences. Instead of being aired over radio or TV, these presentations are shown at meetings, at trade shows, at seminars, at presentations, and in one-on-one sales pitches where the salesperson is sitting down with a customer. They are also posted today as videos on YouTube and Web sites.
 Many different media are available for nonbroadcast AV. These include:

 PowerPoint Online video content DVD Videotext Software

 And these presentations are used in many different applications:

 Employee communications Trade show exhibits Seminars and conferences Recruitment Community relations Public relations Sales support Advertising inquiry fulfillment (free DVDs sent to select prospects who respond to commercials for your ab machine or Caribbean cruise ship) Presentations to top management Training Product introduction

-----

### Product demonstration Case histories Meetings Sales aids for company salespeople and sales reps Point-of-purchase display in retail locations Executive summaries of annual reports, sales presentations, and other printed literature Records of historic events

 The script format for slide shows and films is the same as for TV commercials: visuals on the left, audio on the right.
 But nonbroadcast AV is not limited to thirty or sixty seconds. You can make it as long or as short as you like. Eight to ten minutes is the best length for a slide show or film. Twenty minutes is the maximum. Beyond that, your audience will begin to fade.
 Nonbroadcast AV is much less expensive to produce than TV commercials. A one-minute commercial could cost $40,000 or more. A ten- minute nonbroadcast videotape can be produced for as little as $500 to $1,000.
 Here are a few tips for writing nonbroadcast AV:

 Write words for the ear, not for the eye. A script is not simply words on a page, but words that are spoken aloud. The spoken words should be precise, coherent, and full of vivid images. Be crystal clear. The listener doesn’t have the luxury of referring back to the text. Your writing must be readily understood the first time it is heard. Research. Find out all you can about the topic, the product, the purpose, the audience. The script should repeat the key selling points several times. The beginning is critical and must “hook” the audience, locking their attention.

-----

### Be lively, catching, precise. Use active verbs, colorful words and phrases. Spoon-feed the audience. Don’t assault them with fact after fact. Be selective about the facts you choose. An AV presentation doesn’t tell the whole story but should leave the viewer hungry for more information. Use words to paint pictures that complement the actual visuals on the screen. Be as concise and direct as possible. Avoid complicated sentences.

 WRITING FOR POWERPOINT

 Okay. Let’s say you are putting together a presentation and PowerPoint is required. What can you do to make it more effective?
 First, you don’t have to show slides all the time. Use PowerPoint selectively, not throughout the entire presentation.
 When there’s a valuable picture to show, show it. When you’re through with it, use a blue or black blank slide.
 Second, use visuals only when they communicate more effectively than words. If you are talking about quality, having the word Quality on-screen adds little to your point. On the other hand, if you want to explain what an aardvark looks like, there are no words that can do it as effectively as simply showing a picture.
 Third, don’t overcrowd your slides. Have no more than one major visual per slide, and keep it simple; avoid, for example, process diagrams with too many lines and connections.
 Fourth, consider adding other media as supplements or even alternatives to PowerPoint. When I taught telephone selling, the sound of a ringing telephone and a prop—a toy telephone—engaged the trainees in a way computer slides could not.
 Fifth, design your presentation so that, if there is a problem with the computer equipment, you can go on without it. There’s nothing more embarrassing than watching a speaker fall apart because he can’t find the right slide. Use visuals as an enhancement, not a crutch.

-----

### Graphic design consultant Roger C. Parker offers the following tips for preparing your PowerPoint presentations:

 Keep visuals simple. Avoid decorative clip art. These often project a cartoon-like image. Add graphics only when they support your arguments. Use keywords, not sentences. Visuals should provide a framework, not a script, for your presentation. Limiting text to keywords permits you to use a large, easy-to-read type size. Avoid complex backgrounds. When in doubt, choose black type against a white background. Personalize your visuals. Add your logo to each visual, along with the presentation title and date.

 To Roger’s suggestions I would add these of my own, based on my experience of creating dozens of PowerPoint presentations over the years:

 Do not make charts, graphs, and diagrams too cluttered, complex, or small. The slides should be easy to see and read for all attendees, even those sitting in the back row. If you in fact have a lot of information or data to communicate using bullet lists or visuals, remember the 5 x 5 rule for word slides: no more than 5 bullets per slide and no more than 5 words per bullet. Mix word slides with image slides (e.g., if you are selling corn seed, show a farmer planting the seeds and then tall, healthy corn stalks). Ideally have one image per slide and no more than three.

## WRITING WEB SITES

### Twenty years ago, 100 percent of my copywriting was print and zero percent was on the Internet. Today, 30 percent of my copywriting is print and 70 percent is online.
 The conclusion? A working copywriter today is going to be doing a lot of writing for the Internet. Some of your assignments will focus on driving traffic to an existing Web site. Others will focus on creating Web copy, either adding pages to existing sites or creating brand-new sites.
