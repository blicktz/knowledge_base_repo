###### which clutters up layouts, and proclaim ‘this is only an advertisement’. Readership of the advertisement is reduced.

_Don’t make the mistake of designing subway cards to look like billboards – all display and only �ve or six words. In New_
_York subways, the average rider is exposed to your card for twenty-one minutes and 85 per cent carry nothing else to read._

_That is why I wrote 76 words for this card._

###### One of my clients was persuaded that his company’s symbol was too old-fashioned and paid a fancy �rm $75,000 to design a new one. At the unveiling I whispered to one of the Vice-Presidents, ‘A tyro in our art department could have designed a better symbol for $75.’ ‘No doubt,’ he replied, ‘but we would have argued it to death.’

 Typography – ‘the eye is a creature of habit’ Good typography helps people read your copy, while bad typography prevents them doing so.
 Advertising agencies usually set their headlines in capital letters. This is a mistake. Professor Tinker of Stanford has established that capitals retard reading. They have no ascenders or descenders to help you recognize words, and tend to be read letter by letter.
 The eye is a creature of habit. People are accustomed to reading books, magazines and newspapers in lower case. Look how di�cult it is to read the all-caps headline in the ABN advertisement opposite.
 Another way to make headlines hard to read is to superimpose them on your illustration.

-----

###### Another mistake is to put a period at the end of headlines. Periods are also called full stops, because they stop the reader dead in his tracks. You will �nd no full stops at the end of headlines in newspapers.
 Yet another common mistake is to set copy in a measure which is too wide or too narrow to be legible. People are accustomed to reading newspapers which are set about 40 characters wide.
 Which typefaces are easiest to read? Those which people are accustomed to reading, like the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville and Jenson. The more outlandish the typeface, the harder it is to read. The drama belongs in what you say, not in the typeface.
 Sanserif faces like this are particularly di�cult to read. Says John Updike, ‘Serifs exist for a purpose. They help the eye pick up the shape of the letter. Piquant in little amounts, sanserif in page-size sheets repels readership as wax paper repels water; it has a sleazy, cloudy look.’
 Some art directors use copy as the raw material for designing queer shapes, thus making it illegible.
 In a recent issue of a magazine I found 47 advertisements with the copy set in reverse – white type on a black background. It is almost impossible to read.
 If you have to set very long copy, there are some typographical devices which increase its readership:

 1 A subhead of two lines, between your headline and your body copy, heightens the reader’s appetite for the feast to come.

 2 If you start your body copy with a drop-initial, you increase readership by an average of 13 per cent.

 3 Limit your opening paragraph to a maximum of 11 words.

 4 After two or three inches of copy, insert a cross-head, and thereafter throughout. Cross-heads keep the reader marching forward. Make some of them interrogative, to excite curiosity in the next run of copy.

###### 5 When I was a boy, it was common practice to square up paragraphs. It is now known that widows – short lines – increase readership.

 6 Set key paragraphs in bold face or italic.

###### 9 What size type should you use?

This is 5-point, and too small to read.

###### This is 14-point, and too big.

This is 11-point, and about right.

###### 10 If you use leading (line-spacing) between paragraphs, you increase readership by an average of 12 per cent.

 You may think that I exaggerate the importance of good typography. You may ask if I have ever heard a housewife say that she bought a new detergent because the advertisement was set in Caslon. No. But do you think an advertisement can sell if nobody can read it? You can’t save souls in an empty church.
 As Mies van der Rohe said of architecture, ‘God is in the details’.

1 This is one of my over-simpli�cations. Starch �nds that on the average, two-page spreads

achieve only 28 per cent higher rating than single pages, but Edwin Bird Wilson has drawn

attention to the fact that two-page spreads for �nancial advertisers achieve an average of

150 per cent more readership than single pages. The readership of ads for low-interest

products bene�ts more from big spaces than ads for high-interest products.

 How to make TV commercials that sell

## E

###### of a book. All I can do is reproduce some storyboards which illustrate my points, and pray that you can decipher them.
 In my chapter on print advertising, I have relied not only on research, but also on long experience. My experience in television has been more limited. True, I once won an award at the Cannes Festival, but it wasn’t a good commercial. So most of this chapter will have to rely on research, and the judgments I have formed while looking at thousands of other people’s commercials.

_Testimonials by celebrities are below average in their ability to change brand preference, but American Express has been_
_running commercials like this one since 1975 — with outstanding success. They have a special element of mystery: ‘Do you_

_know me?’_

-----

###### My most valuable source of information is the factor analyses I commission at regular intervals from Mapes & Ross. They measure changes in brand preference. People who register a change in brand preference after seeing a commercial subsequently buy the product three times more than people who don’t.
 Research organizations also measure the recall of commercials, and this method �nds favor with many advertisers. But some kinds of television commercials which get high recall scores get low scores on changing brand preference, and there appears to be no correlation between recall and purchasing. I prefer to rely on changes in brand preference.
 I will start by telling you about ten kinds of commercial which are found to be above average in their ability to change people’s brand

-----

###### preference, and three kinds which are below average.

 Above average 1 Humor. Conventional wisdom has always held that people buy products because they believe them to be nutritious, or labor-saving, or good value for money – not because the manufacturer tells jokes on television. Claude Hopkins, the father of modern advertising, thundered, ‘People don’t buy from clowns’
 I think this was true in Hopkins’ day, and I have reason to believe that it remained true until recently, but the latest wave of factor- analysis reveals that humor can now sell. This came as a great relief to me; I had always hated myself for rejecting the funny commercials submitted for my approval.

_three out of four people in France, and sales of the product jumped from fourth place to second._

###### But I must warn you that very, very few writers can write funny commercials which are funny. Unless you are one of the few, don’t try.

 2 Slice of life. In these commercials one actor argues with another about the merits of a product, in a setting which roughly approximates real life. In the end, the doubter is converted – your toothpaste really does give children healthier teeth.
 These playlets have been successful in case after case. Copywriters detest them because most of them are so corny – and because they have been in such wide use for such a long time. But some agencies have succeeded in producing slices which are not only e�ective at the cash register, but realistic and charming.

 3 Testimonials. The most e�ective testimonial commercials are those which show loyal users of your product testifying to its virtues – when they don’t know they are being �lmed. The interviewer pretends to �nd fault with the product and the loyal user rises to its defense with far more conviction than if you simply asked him what he thought of it. Here is an example:

-----

###### The scene is the forecourt of a Shell station. We see an actor disguised as the man on the pump.

 Announcer: ‘This man is an imposter. He’s not really a Shell dealer. He’s going to see if he can talk our customers out of buying Super Shell. Let’s watch through this hidden camera.’

 Shell dealer: ‘I’ll bet you get bad mileage with Super Shell.’

 Mrs. Longo, a customer: ‘It’s good. I’ll tell you where a penny saved is a penny earned.’

 Shell dealer: ‘Aw, come on. What do you know about gasoline?’

 Mrs. Longo: ‘You see this little dog I have back here? I bought this little dog because it saves money on food. Now I can save on Super Shell.’

 Shell dealer: ‘Bunk! B-U-N-K.’

 Mrs. Longo: ‘You are absolutely wrong. That is the best gasoline. Why, if I were them, I would �re you’.

 Announcer: ‘We’ll give him another chance because he got you to say nice things about Super Shell.’

 When you pick loyal users to testify, avoid those who would give such polished performances that viewers would think they were professional actors. The more amateurish the performance, the more credible.
 A French agency picked an 80-year-old laundress as the heroine in a campaign for washing machines. This keg-shaped, wrinkled old woman came to be recognized by three out of four people in France, and sales of the washing machine went from fourth place to second.

_This French commercial demonstrates how well Super Glue-3 works by applying it to the announcer’s shoes and hanging him_

_upside down from the ceiling. Super Glue-3 became the brand-leader and the commercial won First Prize at the Cannes_

_Festival._

###### The use of unusual characters increases the power of commercials to change brand preference by a remarkably high percentage.

-----

###### 4 Demonstrations which show how well your product performs are above average in their ability to persuade.
 Demonstrations don’t have to be dull. To demonstrate how strong paper-board can be, International Paper spanned a canyon with a bridge made of paper-board – and then drove a heavy truck over it.
 The Paris o�ce of Ogilvy & Mather demonstrated the strength of a client’s glue by applying it to the soles of the announcer’s shoes and hanging him upside down from the ceiling – from which position he delivered his sales pitch.

-----

_A successful example of using a character to reinforce the authenticity of your product._

-----

###### If you use a demonstration to compare your product with your competitor’s, think twice before identifying the competitor by name. It is illegal in Germany, but the US Government encourages it as providing information which will help the consumer make an informed choice. Studies conducted by Ogilvy & Mather found that commercials which name competing brands are less believable and more confusing than commercials which don’t. There is a tendency for viewers to come away with the impression that the brand which you disparage is the hero of your commercial.

 5 Problem solution. This technique is an old as television. You show the viewer a problem with which he or she is familiar, and then show how your product can solve it.

-----

###### One of the best problem-solution commercials I have seen was made in Madras for Train matches. It starts by showing a man unable to strike ‘ordinary’ matches in the muggy climate of southern India. He goes mad with impatience. Then his cool, beautiful wife comes to the rescue with a box of Train matches which strike immediately.

 6 Talking heads. This is the derisive name given to commercials which consist of a pitchman extolling the virtues of a product. Agency people �nd them non-creative, and are sick of them, but several advertisers still use them because they are above average in changing brand preference.
 Talking heads are particularly appropriate for announcing new products. More than a hundred new brands of cigarette have been introduced in Germany in recent years, and the only one which succeeded was launched by a talking head. Perhaps the most persuasive talking head of all time is John Houseman saying, ‘Smith Barney make money the old-fashioned way. They earn it.’
 As a former door-to-door salesman, I shall go to my grave believing that, given two minutes on television, I could sell any product on the face of the earth. Any o�ers?

 7 Characters. In some commercials, a ‘character’ is used to sell your product over a period of years. The character becomes the living symbol of the product – like Titus Moody, the crusty old New England baker who has been extolling the quality of Pepperidge Farm bread for 26 years, or Cora, who sold Maxwell House co�ee for seven years.
 Provided they are relevant to your product, characters are above average in their ability to change brand-preference.

 8 Reason why. Commercials which give the viewer a rational reason why they should buy your product are slightly above average. When Maxim Instant Co�ee was launched, the commercials said Maxim was superior because it was freeze-dried. Nine out of ten advertising people will tell you that consumers don’t give a hoot about how

-----

###### products are made. They may be right, but the process of freeze- drying was su�ciently new and interesting to persuade many viewers to try the co�ee.

 9 News. Commercials which contain news are above average. But even when they have news to tell, which is all too rare, some copywriters underplay it, or leave it out altogether. They should be boiled in oil. Products, like human beings, attract most attention when they are �rst born.
 For an old product, you can create news by advertising a new way to use it, like using baking soda to keep refrigerators smelling sweet.

 10 Emotion. Researchers have not yet found a way to quantify the e�ectiveness of emotion, but I have come to believe that commercials with a large content of nostalgia, charm and even sentimentality can be enormously e�ective. The commercials for Hovis bread in Great Britain and Blitz-Weinhard beer in Oregon strike me as among the most persuasive I have seen. (See this page, this page.)
 Emotion can be just as e�ective as any rational appeal, particularly when there is nothing unique to say about your product. ‘But,’ says my partner Hal Riney, ‘here is where things get sticky. Most clients – and I’m afraid most agency people – think the rational appeals for their products are much more important than the consumer thinks they are. If your advertising is going to be successful, if it is going to stand out from the clutter, you must be objective about the bene�ts of your product. What exactly are the “bene�ts” of candy bars, cigarettes, soda pop and beer?’
 I hasten to add that consumers also need a rational excuse to justify their emotional decisions. So always include one. Above all, don’t attempt emotion unless you can deliver it.

 Below average 1 Testimonials by celebrities. These are below average in their ability to change brand preference. Viewers guess that the celebrity has

-----

###### been bought, and they are right. To get Farrah Fawcett for three years, Fabergé is reported to have paid $2,000,000. Bob Hope, Gregory Peck, Candice Bergen and Dean Martin charge about $1,000,000 each. The spokesman everyone wants is Walter Cronkite, but he isn’t available at any price. However, for a beggarly $10,000 you can get Ronald Biggs who escaped from jail after being convicted for his part in England’s Great Train Robbery. He lives in Brazil.
 Viewers have a way of remembering the celebrity while forgetting the product. I did not know this when I paid Eleanor Roosevelt $35,000 to make a commercial for margarine. She reported that her mail was equally divided. ‘One half was sad because I had damaged my reputation. The other half was happy because I had damaged my reputation.’ Not one of my proudest memories.
