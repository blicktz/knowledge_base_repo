##### The moment you get the reader to say “No” or even “I really don’t believe what he is saying” or “I don’t think that relates to me,” you’ve lost the reader. But as long as the reader keeps saying yes or believes what you are saying is correct and continues to stay interested, you are going to be harmonizing with the reader and you and the reader will be walking down that path toward that beautiful room in the art gallery.
 To show you a specific approach to this method, let’s take an example from an ad I wrote for one of my seminar participants. Entitled “Food Crunch,” it offered dehydrated survival food. On occasion, when one of my students wrote a good ad that did not succeed, I would help him or her by either suggesting minor copy changes or sometimes rewriting the entire ad myself if I felt I had a better overall concept. The first ad, by John Sauer, was written right after our major fuel crunch in 1973, when there were lines of cars at gas pumps that had little or no fuel to pump. The ad is shown on the next page with my ad above it. John chose the concept of insurance as the best approach in his ad. I felt that insurance put people to sleep. See if you agree with the copy statements in my ad as I tie in the then-current feelings of helplessness during the fuel shortage with John’s product.
 We all take our food supply for granted. And for good reason. Americans have always had plenty. But we may be heading for one of the most serious periods in our history. Let me explain.

 Which ad would you read first right after the fuel crunch?

-----

##### The ad then goes on to explain the writer’s first-hand experience of arriving at a supermarket right after the news of the Kennedy assassination only to discover that the shelves were bare and that people in time of distress or calamity think first of their own survival.
 Notice that the reader’s attention was riveted. The headline, “Food Crunch,” and subheadline, “We’ve all experienced the fuel shortage and most of us were unprepared. Will you be prepared for the food crunch?” caused us to read the first sentence. The first sentence was short and the typical American who could afford this offer would nod his or her head in

-----

##### the affirmative. The sentences were both interesting and true and caused the reader to start nodding his or her head.
 So now we have three things we are trying to do at the beginning of an ad. First we want the reader to read the copy. Remember, that’s the objective of all copy. Without the prospect reading the ad, you have nothing.
 Then we create the type of environment through copy that causes the prospect to feel comfortable in exchanging his or her hard-earned money for your product or service. And finally, we want the prospect to harmonize with us—to agree with us—by feeling that indeed we are saying something that is truthful, interesting and informative and that the prospect can agree with. In short, we want agreement. We want that head to nod in the affirmative. We want harmony.
 Look what Cycle magazine did to create the perfect harmony with me when they tried to get me to buy media in their magazine. They created a knockoff of my ad format and sent it to me with a copy style that resembled mine. Of course it could have backfired if I was upset that they were copying me, but they also knew that I would quickly recognize the format and the effort they were making to land me as a customer and that I would respect their creativity. Indeed I harmonized with their effort and bought some space in their magazine.

 This is the ad that Cycle magazine created as a sales tool to harmonize with JS&A and convince us to buy.

-----

##### Another illustration of this concept is in the ad I wrote trying to appeal to bargain hunters for a company called Consumers Hero. After a few sentences the copy read as follows:
 Consumers are being robbed. Inflation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered, robbed and stepped on. If you were a consumer looking for bargains when inflation was skyrocketing during the years when I wrote this, you would very likely be in harmony after that brief paragraph. I used words that the consumer could relate to. I spoke in the consumer’s language.
 A top-producing salesman once said to me, “Joe, I really admire you. I can sell anybody on a one-to-one basis. Put me up against the toughest customers and I’ll melt them down and sell them. But you have the ability to do that on a scale that dwarfs mine. When you sell, you manage to duplicate yourself and sell millions of people all at the same time.”

-----

##### And that’s what is so incredible about selling in print. You can duplicate yourself on billions of pages. You’ve got to be able to reproduce a selling job in print that will harmonize with the consumer, and then you’ve got the essence of a powerful tool that will bring you rewards for the rest of your life in all forms of communication whether they be in print or on TV or in any of the new electronic media of the future.
 So our fifth axiom is simply:

 Axiom 5

**_Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate and truthful statements while_**
**_reading your copy._**

##### Now you have the basis for another very important principle in writing effective copy.

 The Slippery Slide

##### By now you have learned several very important points about copywriting. First, you learned that you have, in your life, experienced general knowledge through your actions, circumstances and personality. You have also been given the tools to obtain specific knowledge, such as the ability to inquire, read and research. Then you learned that practice is a great teacher —that the more you write, the better you get. And finally you learned that copywriting is the mental process of transferring what is in your head onto a sheet of paper.
 Then we got into the pure Sugarman stuff. We learned what most people think elements like the headline and captions do for a typical ad. And then we learned what I believe their primary purpose is: to get the reader to read the first sentence.
 And if you remember, we said that the sole purpose of the first sentence is to get prospects to read the second sentence and that the sole purpose of the second sentence is to get them to read the third and then the fourth—all while you are building a selling environment for the sale of your product.

 Every element must be so compelling that you find yourself falling down a slippery slide unable to stop until you reach the end.

-----

##### We also compared the selling process in print to what a live and in-person salesperson does. You learned that ideally, as your reader starts reading your copy, you get the reader to start nodding in agreement with everything you say.
 So now the reader is reading your first few sentences, is feeling comfortable in the environment you have created and is nodding in agreement. Now comes the critical part called the “slippery slide.”
 Picture a steep slide at a playground. Now picture somebody putting baby oil or grease along the entire length of the slide including the side rails. Picture yourself now climbing up the ladder, sitting at the top of the slide and then letting gravity force you down the slide.
 As you start to slide down and build momentum, you try holding on to the sides to stop, but you can’t stop. You continue to slide down the slide despite all your efforts to prevent your descent. This is the way your copy must flow.
 Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery slide effect. The headline must be so powerful and compelling that you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must be so powerful that you are

-----

##### compelled to read the first sentence, and the first sentence must be so easy to read and so compelling that you must read the next sentence and so on, straight through the entire copy to the end.

####

# The Force of “Reading Gravity”

##### I once received a letter from a reader of Scientific American magazine in response to one of our ads on thermostats. The lady who sent me the typewritten letter told me that she had no need for a thermostat, was not interested in the subject, rarely reads advertisements and when she does, she just scans through them. But, she went on, “I am a busy scientist. When I started reading your ad, I wasted five minutes of my valuable time reading the entire thing and I was so upset at the complete waste of my time, that I wanted to write you and complain.” As a copywriter, I couldn’t have gotten a more complimentary complaint letter.
 If you can get the majority of the people who scan a magazine to read your ad, maybe you won’t sell every one of them but you will sell a good percentage. Creating the slippery slide will cause people to “traffic” your ad —to go through the entire text of your ad and then decide if they want to buy.
 Traffic is a good word in retail selling. Any shopping center that can draw increased traffic will have increased sales for its stores. But the traffic generated by these stores can only be compared to the people who actually read your copy. That’s why some of the greatest magazines with the largest circulations do not guarantee the success of your advertisement. Traffic is strictly the number of people who get into your copy. When I say “get into,” I mean falling down the slippery slide all the way through to the end of your copy.
 Creating the slippery slide effect is not that difficult once the reader is well into your copy. In fact, it’s been proven that if a reader reads more than 25 percent of your ad, there is a great probability that he or she will read the entire ad. So once you’ve grabbed your reader at the start of your ad with your perfect environment and once they’re reading your compelling first sentence, you’ve got them started down the slippery slide.

# Slippery Slide Examples

##### Let’s look at a few examples of the use of the slippery slide in some of the advertising I’ve written through the years. I referred to the thermostat ad earlier, so let’s start with that. The copy starts out with the following headline, subheadline and first two paragraphs:
 Headline: Magic Baloney Subheadline: You’ll love the way we hated the Magic Stat thermostat until an amazing thing happened. Picture Caption: It had no digital readout, an ugly case and a stupid name. It almost made us sick. Copy: You’re probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a great product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we’re going to tear it apart. Unmercifully. When we first saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name and went, “Yuck.” We took one look at the plastic case and said, “How cheap looking.” And when we looked for the digital readout, it had none. So before the salesman even showed us how it worked, we were totally turned off. Now if you’re reading the above ad, you’re starting down the slippery slide unable to stop. You might find yourself reading the copy even though you have no intention of buying a thermostat by mail. You’re curious. What’s the gimmick?
 The environment was set by the very clean layout. The tone of the ad was one of a flip, sarcastic and skeptical company exploring the possibility of selling a product that we were not very impressed with.
 Of course the rest of the ad told of how we discovered a few nice points and then a few more and then some really great features and finally decided that this was one great product. At the end of the ad, we finished with:
 Beauty is only skin deep and a name doesn’t really mean that much. But we sure wish those guys at Magic Stat would have named their unit something more impressive. Maybe something like Twinkle Temp.

-----

##### That single ad ran more than three years and not only generated large volume for us but propelled the Magic Stat people to become one of the major thermostat contenders nationwide.
 Another example of the slippery slide theory is in my ad for a company I started that sold bargains, called Consumers Hero.
 Picture yourself scanning through a magazine and coming across the following copy:
 Headline: HOT Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen merchandise if you’re willing to take a risk. Highlighted Copy Block: Impossible-to-trace Guarantee—We guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand-new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identification or ownership. Well, if you’re like most readers, you had to start reading the copy. How could you help but read it?
 Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing concept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing! Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being robbed. Inflation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered, robbed and stepped on. So the poor consumer tries to strike back. First, he forms consumer groups. He lobbies in Washington. He fights price increases. He looks for value. So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was to steal from the rich companies and give to the poor consumer, save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, make a buck. I then went into the concept, which was our plan to take defective merchandise, repair it and then make it available to the consumers through a club that cost $5 to join. Newsletters were sent to members offering the products. One of the paragraphs near the end of the ad summed it up beautifully:
 So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into super new products with five-year warranties. We steal from the rich

##### manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hard and make a glorious profit. The Magic Stat and Consumers Hero ad examples are but two of the many I’ve written through the years that illustrate the slippery slide theory. Once you start reading the headline, which forces you eventually down to the first sentence, you are in my slide. And then I take you all the way to the bottom of that slide so before you know it you’ve read the entire ad. You’ve been in my store; you entered and didn’t get out until you fully examined the merchandise I offered you. I took you into my private room and gave you a demonstration of my product in an environment that was so compelling, you couldn’t help but buy. And I did it with integrity and honesty while getting you to nod your head as I sold you.
 That’s what the slippery slide is all about: getting your reader to read all of the copy. So a major axiom of mine is simply:

 Axiom 6

**_Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until_**
**_they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide._**

##### As we explained earlier, one of the most important elements in creating the slippery slide is the start of your ad copy. I often will start my copy with a story or even pick up a piece of news from a magazine that I feel would be of interest to my readers. The story is often offbeat, always interesting and a great short story.
 A good example of this technique is the story about a trusted accountant who was caught embezzling money from his company. Here’s the copy I wrote based on that article and the very unusual connection I made to the product I was selling:
 Headline: Last Wish Subheadline: He was a prisoner confined to a cell block. “Give him one last wish,” pleaded his wife. Copy: George Johnson is in a state penitentiary for a white-collar crime. His seven-year sentence gives him plenty of time to exercise. Johnson, 36 years old, always took care of himself. He exercised regularly, ate good food and took vitamins. But he got greedy. As a

-----

##### company accountant he kept issuing bogus checks to “Cashin Electric Company” for electrical contracting work. One day his boss noticed the large payments being made to the Cashin Electric Company and discovered that the outfit didn’t exist. Johnson was actually typing out checks to “Cash,” cashing them himself and then after the checks cleared the bank and were returned to his company, he carefully typed on the checks “in Electric Company” after the word “Cash.” Since he was a trusted accountant, who would suspect?
