##### Or don’t put a thing on paper and just think through everything you know about the challenge you have to solve through copy.
 You might even visualize the end result of your work. Maybe it’s imagining that a stack of mail has arrived showing what a great response you received. Maybe it’s your boss coming up to you and patting you on the back for a job well done. Once you’ve done all that, do something that may seem strange to you at first. Stop.
 That’s right, stop. Do something else. Forget about the project. Do something pleasurable—a stroll in the park, a walk down the street or lunch with a good friend. Whatever you do, let it be a total diversion from what you are currently working on, and please don’t even think of the copy project.
 Whether you realize it or not, you are actually working on the ad constantly even though you’ve put it out of your mind. Your subconscious mind is actually processing everything you’ve learned—all of that data that you have accumulated in general and all of the information in particular. And your mind is then taking all of that data and running it through everything you know about copywriting and communications, mentally preparing the first version of your ad copy.
 It is taking this information and working through the millions of permutations possible to come up with the best solution to your marketing problem. And you’re doing absolutely nothing about it. You’re just out having a good time while your brain is working like crazy. And ironically, if

##### you start thinking about your project again, you interrupt this process and the results won’t be as good. This entire subconscious activity is called the incubation process, and the time you are giving to it is called the incubation period.
 Your subconscious is processing millions of bits of data like a computer in your brain running a very important program in the background. Then, while you’re taking a walk or standing in a shower or even daydreaming, suddenly that big idea will flash across your mind. Eureka! Then go to your desk and start writing down some of that good stuff your subconscious mind has created and organized for you.

# Your Mind Is Always Working

##### Sure, you might think you can eliminate the incubation period. You never do. Even when the pressure of deadlines prevents me from taking the luxury of time to incubate, I’m still incubating but at a much more rapid speed. The results may not be as good, however. The time pressure only increases the incubation process and speeds up the assimilation of data in your brain. If you have the luxury, your copywriting and what you produce will improve if you balance the pressure of deadlines with time away from the project. This could also mean working on one project, then going to another and subsequently coming back to the first one. This is another way of allowing you the luxury of having your subconscious mind work on a project while you do something else.
 The incubation process actually works best with pressure of some kind. If you have no pressure, your brain will not work as fast or as efficiently. So it is a balance of various pressures that produces the optimum results.
 What causes pressure? We already know that time causes pressure but there are other factors as well. Ego for example. If you have a big ego, it creates a certain amount of pressure. This pressure can be very positive in the incubation process. For example, your boss expects you to produce some knockout copy and your ego won’t let you disappoint her. You’ve added to the incubation pressure. Your creative orientation plays a role, too. For example, if you are naturally creative, you have a big advantage over someone who is not. And finally, the environment plays a role. If you are in a creative environment that encourages those incubation activities required in the creative process, it will help the incubation process along.

# Just Allow It to Happen

##### Now don’t show this chapter to your boss and say, “See, Joe Sugarman tells me to take a pleasurable walk in the park on company time and enjoy myself while my brain incubates.” That’s nonsense and not the purpose of this chapter. In this chapter, I just want you to realize that there is a constant process going on in the background of your brain. And with the proper balance, you can create blockbuster copy by allowing the incubation process to function.
 The biggest mistake a manager can make in a mail order company is to have the creative department in the same building as any other department in the company. Imagine the operations people walking in to see the creative people incubating—staring into space or taking a long break with one of their peers. “Those privileged bastards in creative really get away with murder” would be a typical comment. But the creative department needs that atmosphere in order to function to its optimum.
 If management imposed the same rules on the creative department as on the rest of the staff who have to function on a conscious level during their jobs, the end result would be a sure drop in good creative work. It’s important to keep the creative staff separate from the rest of a company because the copywriter needs a little more freedom to incubate and create.
 When it comes time to sit down and knock out that copy, discipline comes into play. You’ve got to let that copy come pouring out of your brain, forgetting about spelling and grammar. Remember, your mind takes the data you’ve accumulated and runs it through everything you know about copywriting, communications and life in general. Well, hold back the stuff on spelling and grammar just long enough to let the copy flow out freely.

# Left Brain versus Right Brain

##### If you’re knowledgeable about writing and creative thinking, you know that there has been much said about the different hemispheres of our brains controlling different types of thinking. The right brain does the intuitive or emotional thinking and the left brain does the logical. Which side of the brain should write the copy? The right brain of course. Let the copy flow out of that right brain and let it pour out unencumbered by any left-brain restraints.
 The pouring out of that copy or idea is the culmination of the incubation process. It is the end result of all the mental activity that has been running in the background. And so, the axiom that I suggest you remember is:

 Axiom 10

**_The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge_**
**_and experiences to solve a specific problem, and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative_**
**_orientation, environment and ego._**

##### If you’ve gone through the incubation process and then put your thoughts on paper, you’ve accomplished half the challenge of writing good copy. (Next comes the fun part—the editing process. We’ll have to wait for that process in later chapters of this book.) Now that you are mentally prepared to tackle the copywriting process, it’s time to decide how much copy you should actually write.

 How Much Copy Should You
 Write?

##### Incubate, slippery slide, seeds of curiosity—all may be neat concepts, but often at my seminars the question would come up: Do people read all the copy in your ads? Students of direct marketing learn that there is no such thing as copy that is too long. And there is some truth to this.
 The key is simply this: Copy is never too long if the reader takes the action you request. Therefore, it can’t be dull, it must be compelling, it must relate to the reader and, finally, it’s got to be about something the reader is interested in.
 What we’re talking about here is the slippery slide concept. The copy must be so compelling that it will be read from the beginning to the end. Everything else is secondary. If you don’t write compelling copy, you’ll never get the reader to read the part of the copy that sells your product.
 Will people read long copy? Let me answer the question in a different way by having you go through a little experiment. On the following lines I want you to fill in the blanks for an article as I direct you.
 Headline: _______________ (Your Last Name) Family Chosen as Heirs of Multimillion-Dollar Fortune Subheadline: Family who lives on ____________ (Your Street) in ____________ (Your City) was willed millions of dollars by an anonymous person. If you saw that headline and subheadline in your local newspaper, would you read the first sentence? Of course you would. Let’s say the copy read as follows:
 Wow, what a score! How would you like to inherit millions of dollars from somebody you don’t even know?

-----

##### Well, that’s what happened to __________ (Your Full Name), who has yet to be found but who might have fallen into one of the greatest fortunes ever received from somebody who remains unknown. Of course you would read the entire 3,000-word article. After all, the article is talking about you. You are involved, you relate to what is being written in a very intense way and it’s both informative and interesting, to you in particular.
 And that’s my point about long copy. If the copy does all the things I’ve just described, the reader will be intensely interested in it and will read it all —maybe not with the intensity of somebody who just won millions of dollars, but with an intensity that could come very close if your copy is effective.

# Intense Interest

##### I’m writing this book on a Macintosh computer. A short time ago while I was mastering my word processing program and had an intense interest in this computer, I would read anything on the Macintosh. And I would read an entire article or advertisement if it was on the subject I was interested in. Later, after I mastered what I had to learn, the information was not as interesting to me and I did not seek it out with the same intensity.
 This is also true about products. When digital watches first appeared, my customers were very intense about buying them. And they bought them in droves. They read every word of my copy. It was informative and helpful, it involved them and they read the ads with interest. When the market for digital watches deteriorated and the fad was over, my customers were not as intense about the product category and went on to other things. Therefore readership dropped.

 If the copy is interesting, the reader will read it all.

 Copy will be read if it is interesting to the reader. I can remember when I would visit the car showrooms in the 1950s looking at new cars with their huge tail fins and sleek new designs. Ads would talk about rack and pinion steering and I often wondered what that meant. All that the copy would do is go into the feel of driving the car, which is good emotional copy but didn’t really tell me enough. And when something doesn’t tell you enough, it will cause you to go to the showroom and ask questions, which is maybe what the car companies want you to do.

-----

##### But often the salesmen didn’t know much, either. Rack and pinion steering was foreign even to them.
 I learned a lesson from those visits to car showrooms. You can’t tell the prospect enough about a subject he or she is truly interested in. And so it is with copywriting. People will read with a high degree of intensity if you are talking about something they are genuinely or passionately interested in.

# Long Enough but Short Enough

##### Back in the days when copywriters were mostly men, there was an old adage about copy length: “Copy is like a woman’s skirt. It should be long enough to cover the essentials but short enough to make it interesting.”
 Let’s use the same example of the salesperson visiting a prospect that we used earlier in this book on page 35. But this time, the salesperson appears for the appointment and the prospect explains that he can’t meet for 45 minutes because he is in the middle of a budget session. Could the salesperson make the presentation in 15 minutes? What would you do?
 A good salesperson would make a new appointment. If the sales presentation takes an hour, then it should be an hour long—not more and not 15 minutes. And so it is with copy. Depending on how long your sales pitch is, the copy should cover the amount of time you need to create the selling environment, develop interest in the product, relate to the prospect’s needs and make the sale.
 The copy has to be long enough to tell the entire story or make the entire sales pitch—no longer and no shorter. Of course there are certain practical limits, but even these can be broken. When Gary Halbert, one of the great mail order copywriters, was looking for a girlfriend, he ran a full-page 3,000-word personal ad in a local Los Angeles newspaper. He was deluged with potential dates.
 And when Richard DelGaudio wanted a personal assistant to help him run his fund-raising company, he ran a 4,000-word want ad that pulled in more qualified respondents than he was able to interview.

# The Long-Copy Approach

##### There really is no limit to how long copy should be if you get results. For example, if a good salesperson made his or her pitch in 10 minutes and sold a prospect on purchasing a $19.95 household gadget and another salesperson selling a million-dollar high-speed printing press took several months to consummate a sale, then who would be the better salesperson? There is, of course, no answer. Both could be great or both could be lousy. Why then should there be such controversy over copy length? If, as I hope you believe by now, selling in print is very similar to selling in person, then shouldn’t the same rules apply?
 So let’s take a moment and look at two factors that increase the need for a lot of copy.
 Price Point: The higher the price point, the more copy required to justify the price or create the need. This is a general rule unless the price point is perceived to be a tremendous value (then less copy may be required) or the lower price point appears to lack credibility (then more copy is required). More copy will allow you to increase the value of a product and add many more dollars to your retail price. In short, by educating the consumer you can demand more money for your product.
 Unusual Item: The more unusual the product, the more you need to relate that product to the user and the more you’ve got to focus on creating the buying environment and explaining the product’s new features. At retail, generally, this type of item will not sell. Mail order is the perfect method to use when you have the right amount of copy.
 In conclusion, there are two basic reasons for using the long-copy approach. The first is to allow you to create an environment that will place your prospect in the proper buying mood, and the second is to give you the time necessary to tell the full story of your product.

# Short Copy Works, Too

##### Robert Scott of Scottcade Ltd., an English mail order company, came to my seminar and told me that his approach broke all of my rules. His catalog copy was very short, yet he still sold a lot of merchandise.
 But his catalog really appeared to follow my rules. First, he created his environment through photography. The products were placed in elegant settings using fine photography. Second, his prices were very low compared to those of other companies or retailers. Since he was offering his products at such low prices and since his environment was so effective in placing the customer in a buying mood, a lot of what normally would have been done in copy was being done visually and through the price points of his products. Then too, his medium was a catalog, and in catalogs long copy is often not required. The catalog creates the environment, thus saving you the time of creating it with copy.
 I am not trying to sell you on using long copy. I use short copy at times and sometimes very short copy indeed. But the short copy I use is usually all that is required and the price points are low enough that the short copy does the job. In fact, I am not for long or short. I’m for causing the prospect to exchange his or her hard-earned money for your product or service, and quite frankly, copy length has always been just one of several considerations in producing an advertisement.
 So the axiom to remember from this chapter is simply:

 Axiom 11

**_Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request._**

##### Do people read all that copy? Some do. And there are enough of them who do to have earned me and several other copywriters a nice living.
