##### than a grapefruit? But look at how Schultz has brought out all the features and the complexities of his selection process and even his own expertise by telling you more than you’ve ever wanted to know about grapefruit.
 Schultz is now ready for the pitch. The grapefruit could not get any better. It is rare, it is delicious, it is beautiful and it has value. It’s now up to Schultz to make his customers reach into their pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for his grapefruit, and he makes it as simple as possible.
 Frank does this by offering a sample shipment—a low-priced no-risk opportunity just to try his product. He makes it so simple that you begin to wonder if he’s going to be ripped off. And what does that signify? That’s right—a satisfaction conviction—something that is so compelling, you wonder if people are going to take advantage of him.
 When I realized that the Royal Ruby Reds were the ultimate fruit, I decided to form a club and sell only to my club members. In this manner, I can control my production to insure that nobody will be disappointed. But before I ask you to join my club, I want you to sample my Royal Ruby Reds for yourself, at no cost to you whatsoever. Let me send you a box prepaid of 16 to 20 Royal Ruby Reds. Place four of them in your refrigerator until they are thoroughly cool. Then cut them in half and have your family sample this unusual fruit. You decide whether or not Royal Ruby Reds are everything I say. You determine whether or not eating a Royal Ruby Red is the fantastic taste experience I promise. You decide. I’m confident that you and your family will want more of this superb fruit and on a regular basis, too. If the four Royal Ruby Reds make you say “yes,” then keep the remaining fruit. Otherwise return the unused fruit (at my expense) and you won’t owe me a single penny. But you are never going to know just how wonderful genuine Royal Ruby Reds are unless you place your order right quick. This way you are sure to receive your package containing 16 to 20 Royal Ruby Reds for you and your family to sample. But since the supply is strictly limited it’s important to place your order now. Note the use of the words “right quick.” That’s the way farmers talk, isn’t it. And it is this homey-sounding copy that captivated his audience. In fact,

##### Schultz asked me if he should leave it in. “It isn’t really good English” was his concern. “By all means, leave it in,” I suggested. “It sounds great to me.”
 His offer then went on to give the terms of the purchase. The first box was going to cost $5 less than the standard shipment—a further incentive to at least try his grapefruit. In fact, you actually didn’t pay anything up front, as he also included a bill for $9.95. You paid only if you wanted to keep the shipment and you then were enrolled in his monthly club. His copy continued:
 Now suppose you do like Royal Ruby Reds—suppose you love them— can you be sure of getting more? You surely can. By saying “yes” to my first shipment you have the privilege of automatically joining my Winter Fruit Club. Please be assured you pay nothing in advance. But each month during the winter, I’ll ship you a pack of 16 to 20 orchard-fresh, hand-selected, hand- picked Royal Ruby Reds. Every Royal Ruby Red you receive will pass my tough tests. Each will weigh a pound or more. Safe delivery is guaranteed. This fruit is picked, packed and shipped each month, December through April. You pay only after you have received each shipment. And you can skip or cancel any shipment, simply by telling me your wishes. He summarized his offer. He restated most of the points he told you in the previous copy at the very end of the ad. And then he goes into the close:
 Remember, it obligates you to nothing except making a taste test of the best grapefruit that has ever been grown. And this taste test is on me! Of course, as you can well imagine, when I say supplies are limited— I’m not kidding! There’s just so many club members I can accept before I must close my membership this year. In this statement, he is giving you a sense of urgency that is both believable and true. Production is limited and getting your order in quickly is very important to ensure that you’ll be part of the membership program. He also makes it sound risk free and easy to test.
 So to taste this “miracle” grapefruit and have the opportunity to savor it each month during the growing season, be sure to place your order at no obligation, today.

##### Frank was pleasantly surprised when he ran his test ad in the Wall Street Journal: “Our cost per order was the lowest of any outside list we’ve ever used, and I realized that a single advertisement held the key to the rapid growth of our company.”
 But Frank Schultz didn’t stop there. He continued to advertise in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Parade, and TV Guide, to name only a few. “When you’re a farmer you always worry about the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’s growing too fast—you really worry,” said Frank later in a letter to me.
 “I find it to be about the same when a farmer gets into space advertising. The orders are coming in so good from our space ads, I’m beginning to worry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.”
 In December 1980, an article on Schultz appeared in Texas Monthly magazine. The story talked about his wonderful copy and how the copy made his business seem small and personal. Yet it also explained that the business was quite large by then. He harvested 26,000 tons of grapefruit in 1979 with only 4 percent passing Schultz’s rigorous standards for Royal Ruby Red grapefruit. The rest were sold to the grocery chains. And he now had 80,000 customers in the 48 contiguous states. He owned 14,000 acres of orchards spread out from Brownsville to McAllen, Texas, and had hundreds of employees. He truly was a success story—all created from the power of his pen.
 And yet, his customers visualized Frank with his picking ring out in the orchard picking those perfect Royal Ruby Red grapefruit free of sheep nose and wind scarring.
 From time to time, Frank would send me some of the letters he received complimenting him on his copy. One came from Stanley Marcus, then the chairman of Neiman Marcus. Some were from other copywriters who recognized his ad as brilliant. And for many years Schultz ran the ads until they finally wore out.
 I myself was in Schultz’s grapefruit club for many years. And from my orders alone, he probably made back all the money he had spent on my seminar. If you’d like Royal Ruby Red grapefruit sent directly to your door, call Frank toll free—1-800-477-4773 between 8 A.M. and 6 P.M. Central time. But do it “right quick.”

 Lingerie for Men

##### Victoria’s Secret is now a major chain with 900 stores doing $2.4 billion in sales with a major catalog division that does $870 million by itself. But back in 1979, it consisted of just three small stores and a catalog—all founded by an entrepreneur named Roy Raymond. And that is when Barbara Dunlap attended my seminar.
 The ad she wrote helps illustrate many of the principles you’ve learned in this book and also points to a few she overlooked. Let’s start with the headline and subheadline. If you were a man or a woman reading through a newspaper, you might stop dead in your tracks if you saw the following:
 Headline: Lingerie for Men Subheadline: How a Group of Very Special Men Made It All Possible

 The ad drew a lot of attention but missed a few major points at the end.

-----

##### Note that the headline was just three words—short, concise and certainly enough to get you to read the subheadline. Then notice that the subheadline did not give away the premise of the ad; you still don’t know what it is. In fact, it might sound like some men got together and made the wearing of lingerie possible. You just don’t know, so you keep reading.
 Now read the first paragraph, which is in large type and actually draws you into the copy. Also note the storytelling feel of the first few paragraphs.
 WE WERE ASTOUNDED! When we opened the doors of our new business, we thought most of our customers would be women. After all, beautiful designer lingerie is the kind of luxury a lady can’t resist.
 How wrong we were. That first Valentine’s Day, the men came in droves! Hundreds of men, who had secretly been dying to visit our boutique. At last, they had the perfect excuse—Valentine’s Day gifts for their favorite ladies.
 They loved the merchandise. Can you imagine how shocked we were? All those men—milling about our Victorian boutique. Admiring the silk stockings and lacy garter belts from France. Totally smitten by the luxurious silk and satin

##### kimonos from London. Crowding around the bra and bikini sets from Italy. They couldn’t wait to surprise their wives or girlfriends with something truly special. Once again as the story is told you can visualize the scene. You can almost see the merchandise and appreciate how the variety of merchandise is woven neatly into the story. But now a question might pop into your mind as you are reading this. And this very question is brought into the copy at precisely this moment.
 Weren’t they embarrassed? The truth is, they were. But not enough to keep them away! They had seen our exciting, full-color catalogue. A breathtaking picture book of beautiful women, wearing enticing creations. Besides, a few men became our first satisfied customers. And in a short time, they had managed to spread the good word. Victoria’s Secret wasn’t like shopping for lingerie in a department store. No matronly saleslady to make a man feel uneasy. No raised eyebrows or pursed lips asking about sizes. No racks of flannel and terrycloth to wade through. And no clunky, plastic boxes over-flowing with boring white foundation garments. There were a number of good issues just covered. First, Dunlap comes across as being truthful when she admits that the men were embarrassed. In short, she raises an objection in the paragraph heading (“Weren’t they embarrassed?”) and then answers it honestly. But then she brings in the fact that they were motivated by a full-color catalog that she refers to as a “breathtaking picture book.” Here she very subtly brings in the catalog as the motivational factor that prompted all these men to come to the store.
 Another objection you might raise if you decided to go to the store is the store environment itself and the human element in the store—the salesclerks. If you were a man, would you be embarrassed? Here in this same paragraph (which really should have been a new paragraph) she raises the objection and resolves it by pointing out that the store has none of the embarrassments found in a department store. In short, this is a store that would not embarrass a man at all.
 In this ad, Dunlap first got your attention and raised all the objections that you might have if you were a man and wanted to buy lingerie for your wife or girlfriend in a women’s lingerie store. In the next paragraph, Dunlap

##### broadens the market from just a few men to all men, similar to the way Karbo broadened his income opportunity ad to include anybody interested in bettering his or her life. Here’s what she said.
 The men in our life. Since that first Valentine’s Day, we’ve learned a lot about our male customers. Mainly, they can’t be stereotyped. Some are conservative, some far from it. Some are rather old, while others are much younger. Whether doctors, accountants, salesmen or bankers . . . they all have one thing in common. They are true connoisseurs of beauty. They know how sensuous and lovely a lacy camisole or elegant gown looks on a woman. And what’s more, they know how wonderful a woman feels to receive something beautiful and intimate from a special man. And it takes a very special man to shop from Victoria’s Secret. Not only does Dunlap include a broad range of men but she then compliments the men on their taste and understanding of women in general.
 In the next paragraph we finally get the real pitch of the ad. Since the only Victoria’s Secret stores were located in northern California at the time, the real purpose of this ad, which ran nationally, was to attract catalog customers from the other 49 states. So after the paragraph heading “Our luxurious photo album . . .” comes the pitch. Note the colorful and sensuous language, which only helps to create the environment for this ad.
 If you’re like our male patrons—sensuous and fashion-conscious in your own right—you’ve been dying to find a place like Victoria’s Secret. However, if you live outside of northern California you won’t find it. But for $2.00 you can have the next best thing. Our luscious, full-color catalogue of alluring designer lingerie.
 What if you don’t like our style? We guarantee you’ll be the first man who didn’t. But . . . if after you receive our catalogue, you find our fashions too sensuous or too luxurious for the lady in your life, you haven’t lost a thing. Our lush, full-color catalogue is an elegant collector’s item—a conversation piece your friends will adore! (Already, our customers are requesting previous editions of the Victoria’s Secret catalogue.) To receive your own personal copy, send $2.00 to Victoria’s Secret, dept. W500 [address went here]. We’ll send you our colorful catalogue

##### of fashion romance via first class mail. There was one main problem with this ad, and unfortunately it came at the most critical part—at the end. The objection some prospects might raise is, “What if I’m not pleased with the $2 catalog or any of the merchandise?” Nothing was indicated about their return policy. And a nice hook could have been to allow customers to use their $2 investment in buying the catalog toward the purchase of their first order. Or even allowing them $10 toward their first order.
 From what I understand, the first ad was moderately successful in bringing in catalog requests, which in turn brought in sales. This was a two- step process—to scan the market for possible customers and then make them customers through the catalog. This is a very good application of a print ad and a good example of many of the principles.
 The principles that you should particularly pay attention to are the excellent timing of the objections and how they were resolved and the beautiful use of words that told a story and created the perfect environment for the offer. The real offer was the catalog, but the story that was told gave men permission to get the catalog and buy from it—a lot less embarrassing than going into the store.
 “Lingerie for Men” was brief, it was interesting and it flowed quite nicely. And although its ending could have been more compelling and more effective, it brought you through the copy like a slippery slide all the way to the very end. I would have also added a byline to the ad to make it even more personal.
 The catalog Victoria’s Secret published back in 1979 was a lot more sensuous than the catalog they put out today. If I had to classify it, I would say it was an upscale version of a Frederick’s of Hollywood lingerie catalog. And indeed, both catalogs were quite popular with the men.
 Two advertising people from Victoria’s Secret attended my seminar before the franchise was sold to The Limited. The two women used their copywriting skills to write the colorful catalogs. They both claim that the seminar was one of the turning points in their careers and a major factor in the early success of Victoria’s Secret. Tragically, Roy Raymond, Victoria Secret’s founder, committed suicide in 1993 by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.

##### The lesson to be learned from this example is that you can write a great ad but then miss some important opportunities at the end. And the end of the ad is when the buying decision has to be made—it’s a critical point in any advertisement.
 In the next chapter, I give you an example of a company trying to resolve a problem without first raising it. It will clarify the important method of always raising an objection and then resolving it.
