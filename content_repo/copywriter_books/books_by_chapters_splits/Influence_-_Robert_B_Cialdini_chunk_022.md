#### made every attempt to dodge fame; given dozens of opportunities to proselyte, they had remained evasive and secretive and behaved with an almost superior indifference.”
 Eventually, when all the reporters and would-be converts had been cleared from the house, the believers began making final preparations for the arrival of the spaceship scheduled for midnight that night. The scene as viewed by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter must have seemed like absurdist theater. Otherwise ordinary people—housewives, college students, a high school boy, a publisher, a physician, a hardware-store clerk and his mother—were participating earnestly in tragic comedy. They took direction from a pair of members who were periodically in touch with the Guardians; Marian Keech’s written messages were being supplemented that evening by “the Bertha,” a former beautician through whose tongue the “Creator” gave instruction. They rehearsed their lines diligently, calling out in chorus the responses to be made before entering the rescue saucer: “I am my own porter.” “I am my own pointer.” They discussed seriously whether the message from a caller identifying himself as Captain Video—a TV space character of the time—was properly interpreted as a prank or a coded communication from their rescuers.
 In keeping with the admonition to carry nothing metallic aboard the saucer, the believers wore clothing from which all metal pieces had been torn out. The metal eyelets in their shoes had been ripped away. The women went braless or wore brassieres whose metal stays had been removed. The men had yanked the zippers out of their pants, which were supported by lengths of rope in place of belts.
 The group’s fanaticism concerning the removal of all metal was vividly experienced by one of the researchers, who remarked, twenty-five minutes before midnight, that he had forgotten to extract the zipper from his trousers. As the observers tell it, “this knowledge produced a near panic reaction. He was rushed into the bedroom where Dr. Armstrong, his hands trembling and his eyes darting to the clock every few seconds, slashed out the zipper with a razor blade and wrenched its clasps free with wirecutters.” The hurried operation finished, the researcher was returned to the living room—a slightly less metallic but, one supposes, much paler man.
 As the time appointed for their departure grew close, the believers settled into a lull of soundless anticipation. Fortunately, the trained

#### scientists were able to provide a detailed account of the events that transpired during this momentous period.

_The last ten minutes were tense ones for the group in the living room. They had nothing to do_
_but sit and wait, their coats in their laps. In the tense silence two clocks ticked loudly, one about_
_ten minutes faster than the other. When the faster of the two pointed to twelve-five, one of the_
_observers remarked aloud on the fact. A chorus of people replied that midnight had not yet_
_come. Bob Eastman affirmed that the slower clock was correct; he had set it himself only that_
_afternoon. It showed only four minutes before midnight._

_These four minutes passed in complete silence except for a single utterance. When the_

_[slower] clock on the mantel showed only one minute remaining before the guide to the saucer_
_was due, Marian exclaimed in a strained, high-pitched voice: “And not a plan has gone_
_astray!” The clock chimed twelve, each stroke painfully clear in the expectant hush. The_
_believers sat motionless._

_One might have expected some visible reaction. Midnight had passed and nothing had_
_happened. The cataclysm itself was less than seven hours away. But there was little to see in the_
_reactions of the people in the room. There was no talking, no sound. People sat stock-still, their_
_faces seemingly frozen and expressionless. Mark Post was the only person who even moved. He_
_lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes but did not sleep. Later, when spoken to, he answered_
_monosyllabically but otherwise lay immobile. The others showed nothing on the surface,_
_although it became clear later that they had been hit hard. . . ._

_Gradually, painfully, an atmosphere of despair and confusion settled over the group. They_
_reexamined the prediction and the accompanying messages. Dr. Armstrong and Mrs. Keech_
_reiterated their faith. The believers mulled over their predicament and discarded explanation_
_after explanation as unsatisfactory. At one point, toward 4 A.M., Mrs. Keech broke down and_
_cried bitterly. She knew, she sobbed, that there were some who were beginning to doubt but that_
_the group must beam light to those who needed it most and that the group must hold together._
_The rest of the believers were losing their composure, too. They were all visibly shaken and_
_many were close to tears. It was now almost 4:30 A.M. and still no way of handling the_
_disconfirmation had been found. By now, too, most of the group were talking openly about the_
_failure of the escort to come at midnight. The group seemed near dissolution. (pp. 162–63, 168)_

#### In the midst of gathering doubt, as cracks crawled through the believers’ confidence, the researchers witnessed a pair of remarkable incidents, one after another. The first occurred at about 4:45 a.m. when Marian Keech’s hand suddenly began transcribing through “automatic writing” the text of a holy message from above. When read aloud, the communication proved to be an elegant explanation for the events of that night. “The little group, sitting alone all night long, had spread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction.” Although neat and efficient, this explanation was not wholly satisfying by itself; for example, after hearing it, one member simply rose, put on his hat and coat, and left, never to return. Something additional was needed to restore the believers to their previous levels of faith.

-----

#### It was at this point that the second notable incident occurred to supply that need. Once again, the words of those who were present offer a vivid description:

_The atmosphere in the group changed abruptly and so did their behavior. Within minutes after_
_she had read the message explaining the disconfirmation, Mrs. Keech received another message_
_instructing her to publicize the explanation. She reached for the telephone and began dialing the_
_number of a newspaper. While she was waiting to be connected, someone asked: “Marian, is_
_this the first time you have called the newspaper yourself?” Her reply was immediate: “Oh yes,_
_this is the first time I have ever called them. I have never had anything to tell them before, but_
_now I feel it is urgent.” The whole group could have echoed her feelings, for they all felt a sense_
_of urgency. As soon as Marian had finished her call, the other members took turns telephoning_
_newspapers, wire services, radio stations, and national magazines to spread the explanation of_
_the failure of the flood. In their desire to spread the word quickly and resoundingly, the believers_
_now opened for public attention matters that had been thus far utterly secret. Where only hours_
_earlier they had shunned newspaper reporters and felt that the attention they were getting in the_
_press was painful, they now became avid seekers for publicity. (p. 170)_

#### Not only had the long-standing policies concerning secrecy and publicity done an about-face, but so, too, had the group’s attitude toward potential converts. Whereas likely recruits who previously visited the house had been mostly ignored, turned away, or treated with casual attention, the day following the disconfirmation saw a different story. All callers were admitted, all questions were answered, all visitors were proselytized. The members’ unprecedented willingness to accommodate new recruits was perhaps best demonstrated when nine high school students arrived on the following night to speak with Mrs. Keech.

_They found her at the telephone deep in a discussion of flying saucers with a caller whom, it_
_later turned out, she believed to be a spaceman. Eager to continue talking to him and at the_
_same time anxious to keep her new guests, Marian simply included them in the conversation_
_and, for more than an hour, chatted alternately with her guests in the living room and the_
_“spaceman” on the other end of the telephone. So intent was she on proselyting that she seemed_
_unable to let any opportunity go by. (p. 178)_

#### To what can we attribute the believers’ radical turnabout? Within a few hours, they had moved from clannish and taciturn hoarders of the Word to expansive and eager disseminators of it. What could have possessed them to choose such an ill-timed instant—when the failure of the flood was likely to cause nonbelievers to view the group and its dogma as laughable?

#### The crucial event occurred sometime during “the night of the flood” when it became increasingly clear the prophecy would not be fulfilled. Oddly, it was not their prior certainty that drove the members to propagate the faith, it was an encroaching sense of uncertainty. It was the dawning realization that if the spaceship and flood predictions were wrong, so might be the entire belief system on which they rested. For those huddled in Marian Keech’s living room, that growing possibility must have seemed hideous.
 The group members had gone too far, given up too much for their beliefs to see them destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, the mockery would be too great to bear. The overarching need of the cultists to cling to those beliefs seeps poignantly from their own words. From a young woman with a three-year-old child:

_I have to believe the flood is coming on the twenty-first because I’ve spent all my money. I quit_
_my job, I quit computer school. . . . I have to believe. (p. 168)_

#### From Dr. Armstrong to one of the researchers four hours after the failure of the saucermen to arrive:

_I’ve had to go a long way. I’ve given up just about everything. I’ve cut every tie. I’ve burned_
_every bridge. I’ve turned my back on the world. I can’t afford to doubt. I have to believe. And_
_there isn’t any other truth. (p. 168)_

#### Imagine the corner in which Dr. Armstrong and his followers found themselves as morning approached. So massive was the commitment to their beliefs that no other truth was tolerable. Yet those beliefs had taken a merciless pounding from physical reality: No saucer had landed, no spacemen had knocked, no flood had come, nothing had happened as prophesied. Because the only acceptable form of truth had been undercut by physical proof, there was but one way out of the corner for the group. It had to create another type of proof for the truth of its beliefs: social proof.
 This, then, explains the group members’ sudden shift from secretive conspirators to zealous missionaries. It also explains the curious timing of the shift—precisely when a direct disconfirmation of their beliefs had rendered them least convincing to outsiders. It was necessary to risk the scorn and derision of nonbelievers because publicity and recruitment efforts

#### provided the only remaining hope. If they could spread the Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer. The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more a given individual will perceive the idea to be correct. The group’s assignment was clear; because the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had to be. Convince, and ye shall be convinced.[3]
