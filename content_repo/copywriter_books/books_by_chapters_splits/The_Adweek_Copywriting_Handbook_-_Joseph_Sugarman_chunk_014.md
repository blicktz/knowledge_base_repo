### Praise for Joseph Sugarman’s Previous
 Books

##### You have a real talent for promotion and writing advertisements.
 Albert Gore, Former Vice President United States of America There are a lot of great copywriters, but Joe Sugarman is the best. He knows how to build a story and close the sale. Anyone who wants to sell better will enjoy Advertising Secrets of the Written Word.
 Richard Thalheimer, Founder The Sharper Image I have been a fan of Joseph Sugarman’s copywriting and marketing ideas for years and have benefited greatly by imitating his long-copy ads. Now he is letting us all in on his secrets in a book that should cost $2,000 because it contains so much detailed information. Thank you, Joe. I really liked the book!
 Jack Canfield, Co-Author Chicken Soup for the Soul Every trade has its role models. And for me, there is no better model for ad copywriters or magazine editors than Joe Sugarman.
 Ray Schultz, Editor DIRECT Magazine Joseph Sugarman is brimming over with creative ideas. That isn’t so unusual; many of us are. But Joe’s ideas rocket into our marketing consciousness like shooting stars with one triumphant difference: His ideas invariably work. They motivate. They sell. So this isn’t a book for theoreticians. It’s aimed like an exquisitely polished arrow into the heart of writing to sell. New to marketing? Read this book. Been in the business for 30 years? Read this book.
 Herschell Gordon Lewis, Chairman Communicomp

### From Seminar Participants Who Learned
 What You Are About to Learn

##### I enjoyed the seminar, and I learned a lot. I am more determined than ever to start and succeed at running a mail order business.
 Lee R. Herrington III, President Herrington’s Catalog Your seminar has really opened my eyes to a realization of what makes effective mail order advertising. I am sure that attending the seminar will pay dividends many times over in the years ahead.
 J. M. Robinson Atlantic Richfield Company I told you I’d summarize the 6 or 8 major things, new to me, that I got from the seminar. Going over the notes I find it’s 36 major things I’ll be doing differently.
 Gordon T. Beaham III, President Faultless Starch/Bon Ami Company Not only did you teach me some fundamental new concepts in space advertising, but you planted some seeds that may well change our marketing program and perhaps even our way of doing business.
 Frederick J. Simon, President Omaha Steaks International I would recommend your seminars to novices to gain the degree of confidence necessary to write super ads almost instantaneously. Old- timers will also benefit because what they’ll learn is that you can help them make their ordinary ads super successful. Although I’ve been in mail order for more than 15 years I soon found, as a result of your 5- day seminar, that there was more I didn’t know than I did know.
 Ed Axel Energy Group of America, Inc. You did two things right. First, you charged $2,000. This clever device guaranteed the quality of the participants and assured you of their rapt and undivided attention. Second, you gave them their money’s worth. I did only one thing right. I came.
 Joe Karbo Huntington Beach, California

##### The depth of knowledge and the skill with which you organized and presented it was far above what I anticipated when I signed up for the seminar. But the real payoff was what the course covered that was not in the outline. I feel that the content relating to the philosophy of achieving success in life and the numerous examples you provided to prove this philosophy will have the greatest payoff for us in the long run.
 Ed Scofield Garden Way Associates When you’re a farmer you always worry about the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’s growing too fast—you really worry. I find it to be about the same when a farmer gets into space advertising. The orders are coming in so good from our space ads, I’m beginning to worry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.
 Frank Schultz Alamo, Texas I most enjoyed your openness in revealing, in depth, how you run your company. Few businessmen have the confidence to give away their “secrets” as you did!
 C. L. Schaldenbrand Word Processing Exchange At times the seminar combined high drama, “made for TV” movie serialization, and mail order technique in an unbeatable blend of education and excitement. It was the best class I have taken since Harvard Business School.
 John E. Groman Epsilon Data Management On my way back, on Friday night I stayed at the Sheraton Centre Hotel in New York. My two bags with my clothes were stolen in the lobby of the hotel. I don’t care about the clothes, but I can’t tell you how much I regret the loss of the seminar material, which is of inestimable value for me, and which was also in the bags.
 Herman Van Hove Brussels, Belgium It has given me a fresh perspective and the insight I had sought when I first decided to attend your seminar. I now have a much clearer picture of why our successful promotions succeeded and our failures failed.

### Foreword

 The Sugarman Legacy

##### By Ray Schultz, Editor, DIRECT Magazine Every trade has its role models. And for me, there is no better model for ad copywriters or magazine editors than Joe Sugarman.
 Bandleader Artie Shaw had a standard question for musicians who wanted to join his band: “Who do you listen to?”
 A similar question might be asked of writers applying for work: “Who do you read?”
 Sugarman is the guy who sells BluBlocker sunglasses on TV. He also happens to be one of the most amusing and prolific writers in the United States, as I discovered when I started reading his JS&A catalog in 1985.
 He was totally out of the box. He cracked me up with the sheer exuberance of his copy approach.
 He offered readers $10 for every spelling error they found in his copy. (“Please don’t correct my grammar.”)
 He offered “loaner” watches to customers as part of a service guarantee. He offered a $6 million home for sale in the airline magazines, accepting American Express, Visa, MasterCard or any negotiable hard currency.
 He sold a $240,000 airplane in a single mail order ad. And he did it all with a very special tone. It’s like Nelson Algren said about John Cheever—that he was the one writer you could identify “without turning the pages of The New Yorker back to see who wrote it.”
 Not that Sugarman is the most colorful rogue ever to write great mail order copy. There were others. Louis Victor Eytinge, a convicted murderer who learned how to write in prison. Or Gene Schwartz, the art collector, who made his living writing stuff like “She Fled the Table When the Doctor Said Cut Her Open.”
 But Joe surpassed those guys in a few very important ways—the sheer volume of his writing, the trends that he set and my favorite, the personal

##### catalog, one in which the copy and the product reflect the quirks of the owner. And Joe has a lot of imitators who have personalized their catalogs using Joe’s catalog as their inspiration.
 How did Joe learn his trade? He claims he learned it from his failures and not from the mail order greats who preceded him. Greats like David Margoles, who sold 4 million garlic crushers in the 1950s.
 Then there was Max Sackheim, co-founder of the Book-of-the-Month Club and another great pitchman who lived by his wits. As Lester Wunderman in 1996 reflected about Sackheim, “When he talked to clients, he promised a breakthrough—not as we have now, minuscule improvement.”
 Then there was John Caples, who entered American folklore by writing “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano.” The late Larry Chait asked Caples why he stressed the social benefits instead of just selling the virtues of the course.
 “You don’t understand,” Caples answered. “Learning the piano is tough. You can’t sell that. But you can sell the idea of social success and overcoming whatever deficiencies you have in order to become popular.”
 Though he may never have met them, Sugarman knows on a gut level what these guys knew. And that’s important, because he’s one of the last of a breed.
 Now for the good news. He’s passed the tradition down in this handbook, the best book ever done on the subject of mail order writing.
 Besides the advice on selling, it stresses basic truths about writing, in language anyone can understand. I’ve even given the manuscript to my new reporters to read.
 I’m sad to report that Sugarman doesn’t write as much copy as he used to —no more catalogs and very few space ads. He’s followed the money into infomercials and home shopping.
 Until they reissue old JS&A catalogs (the way they’ve reissued the 1909 edition of Sears, Roebuck), this book will have to stand as Joe’s legacy in print. But it’s a fine legacy.
 So here it is. Enjoy. As Walter Winchell said when he introduced Damon Runyon, “The next act is better.” Ray Schultz is one of the top writers and editors in the direct marketing industry and editor of DIRECT magazine, a Cowles Business Media

### Acknowledgments

##### Many people have contributed to my copywriting skills and to the creation of this book, and to all of them I am very grateful. Mary Stanke, president of JS&A Group, Inc., whose direction, commitment and 35 years of service allowed me the creative freedom to express myself through my writing and who helped me build a substantial business in the process. My ex-wife, Wendy, and our two children, April and Jill, for their understanding and support during the many seminars we held—always behind the scenes, but their presence was very important and always felt. Judy Sugarman, my sister and copyeditor for 25 years—always there to correct my spelling, undangle my modifiers and give me very candid feedback.
 I also wish to acknowledge the thousands of customers who gave me a tremendous education and for whom I have an unwavering respect. I wish to acknowledge my many competitors, too. I hated it when they copied me, but in the process of trying to outwit them my copywriting skills grew even stronger. There are hundreds of other people I could mention—too numerous to list here—who have played a vital role in my success and growth.
 A special acknowledgment to all my wonderful seminar participants who learned from me and went on to create or build successful businesses—all through the power of their pens. I learned a great deal from them. Finally, I wish to thank, with humility and gratitude, all who have exchanged their hard-earned money for this book. May you, too, learn and prosper.

### Introduction

 The Origins of This Book

##### The truly creative mind in any field is no more than . . . a cruelly delicate organism with the overpowering necessity to create, create, create—so that without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.
 —Pearl Buck This is a story about a seminar. It was a copywriting and marketing seminar I presented starting in the 1970s during a time when I was actively involved in both writing copy and marketing a range of products that included everything from electronics to collectibles—from Bone Fones to Picasso tiles.
 I was a prolific writer, often writing complete catalogs, print advertisements and direct mailings. And I owned the company, JS&A Group, Inc., that sold these products, so I experienced the direct consequences of my successes and failures.
