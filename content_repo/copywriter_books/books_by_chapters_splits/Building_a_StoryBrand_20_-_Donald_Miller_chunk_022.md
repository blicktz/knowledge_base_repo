Have you thought about who you want your customer to become? Participating in your customer’s transformation can give new life and meaning to your business. When you identify an aspirational identity for your customers, your brand will not only transform customers but will begin to inspire and unite your own team. When your team realizes they sell more than products, that they guide people toward a stronger belief in themselves, their work will have greater meaning.
 Spend some time thinking about who you want your customers to become. How can you improve the way they perceive themselves?
 How can your brand participate in your customer’s identity transformation?

 CLARIFY YOUR MESSAGE SO CUSTOMERS LISTEN

-----

Go to StoryBrand.AI and either create a BrandScript or log in to your existing
BrandScript.
Brainstorm the aspirational identity of your customer. Who do they want to
become? How do they want to be perceived by others?
Use the “to” lines of your BrandScript to define an aspirational identity. Filling
out the “from” line is then simple. It’s simply the opposite of whatever you
define as their aspirational identity captured in the “to” line.
