##### His wife was more sympathetic than was the judge. She wanted to help her husband and suggested he pick an exercise product for his cell— something that was easy to store and could give him a complete workout. And the prison agreed. Johnson chose a Precor precision rower. Here’s why. I then described the Precor rower and how beneficial it was for your entire body, how it stored easily out of the way and why George selected the product for his primary exercise device.
 Later in the ad I admitted the liberty I had taken with the story out of frustration. The copy ended with the following:
 Before I tell you which rower Johnson selected, I have a confession to make. I love the Precor line of rowers so much that I probably committed a crime too. The story about Cashin Electric Company is true. Some trusted accountant was sent to prison. But his name wasn’t Johnson and his wife never called JS&A to order a thing, let alone a rower. But one night, while I was trying my hardest to figure out a new way to share my enthusiasm for the Precor rowers, I started getting a little silly and concocted this dumb story about Johnson and his interest in the rower. Copywriting is not easy and sometimes you go a little bonkers. I then finished the ad with a selection of rowers and my usual close. In this case the offbeat article about Cashin Electric Company had nothing to do with the product I was offering but it created a very strong beginning for my slippery slide.
 The news item could have nothing to do with your product or it could tie in perfectly. For example, I was reading Forbes magazine, and in the “Informer” section there was an article entitled “Growth Market.” The copy read as follows:
 It looks like U.S. underwear manufacturers have overlooked a potential growth market. According to a survey of 1,000 adult Brits conducted by London-based Survey Research Associates, one in ten British men wears the same underpants two or three days running. One in a hundred

##### wears the same pair all week. Half the women polled said they kept wearing underwear after it went gray with age. I would cut out articles just like this one and keep a collection of them. And then when appropriate, I would use one of them to begin an ad that somewhat related to the news item.
 For example, I was in England appearing on QVC, the TV home shopping network. QVC has a branch office in England and I often appeared on TV selling my products there. While in the lounge waiting to go on the air, I met a man who showed me a new product he was presenting called Scrub Balls. They were simply nine golfball-sized spheres that you put in your washing machine with your laundry. They sloshed around scrubbing the clothes to bring out more dirt and make the clothes cleaner and whiter. They also saved on detergent and made your clothes cleaner while using less water. If I were marketing that product in print, I might pull out that Forbes article and start my ad with something like the following:
 Headline: British Men Have Underwear Problem Subheadline: New survey shows that many British men do not change their underwear for up to three days, and some even as long as a week. Copy: Holy Odor Eaters! Has Britain got a problem. It seems that the men in Britain don’t change their underwear often and the survey mentioned above shows that many men change their underwear just once a week. But there’s an important question I’d like to ask you. How often do you change yours? If you’re like most Americans, you change it every day. And as an American, you probably use more detergent than most Britons. But there is one more surprise that you may not realize, either. Americans have a serious waste problem. Let me explain. I would then go on to explain how we waste our resources by not efficiently washing our clothes and that there was this product I discovered in England called Scrub Balls and how efficiently it cleaned your clothes with less water and laundry detergent.
 I could also use the same article to sell an electronic product simply by saying:
 Now you probably wonder what dirty British underwear has to do with this new pocket-sized computer. I’m glad you asked. It has nothing to

##### do with it except for one important fact that I will reveal shortly. But first let me explain an unimportant fact.

 Quest/80 magazine started their feature story on the cover to hook the readers and get them interested.

 I would then go into the computer features, playing off British men, and I would use odor or smell to relate to some of the computer features. I would then come up with a computer feature at the end of the ad that would tie into the story.

# Save Those Articles

##### I realize that it may seem a little far-fetched to sell a rower tied into an embezzlement story or a computer using that Forbes article on British underwear habits. But the point I am making is simply this: The use of an interesting article or bit of information, when tied into your product or service, often makes for a good start to the slippery slide. And when blended nicely with your product, it can work to cause a reader to read every bit of your copy. So save those offbeat articles you come across that tweak your interest and might interest your readers—regardless of how ridiculous or offbeat they may be.
 Some magazines create the slippery slide by simply starting out their stories with larger type to get you into the copy. Larger type is easier to read and so you tend to start reading the copy, which may seem less imposing. Quest/80 magazine (no longer around) started the copy of an article on the front cover and then continued it inside the magazine to get you into their slippery slide. Many articles written for magazines use similar graphic elements to get you into their stories. Of course, the key is to make the copy so compelling that once you start reading it, you can’t put it down. And there are even more techniques to create the slippery slide that I will cover later in this book.
 You’re now in store for some fun. For in the next few chapters, I’m going to stretch your imagination and then continue to build the foundation we’ve been building in Section One of this book. So stay with me as we cover the timely topic of assumed constraints.

 Assumed Constraints

##### Have you ever looked at a circus elephant anchored to the ground? If you have, you might notice that the elephant has a metal collar around its leg to which is attached a small chain. And the chain is attached to a wooden peg driven into the ground. Pretty good protection?
 Pretty lousy, if you ask me. That 12,000-pound elephant could very easily pick up its foot and with one fell swoop yank the peg out of the ground and walk away. But the elephant doesn’t. Why? I’ll explain.
 When that elephant was still a baby, that same collar and chain and peg were used to hold the elephant in place. The restraint was sufficient to hold the baby elephant in place even if it wanted to break away. And break away is indeed what the baby elephant tried to do.
 So every day while the baby was chained up, it would pull at the chain and pull and pull until finally a cut appeared on its leg exposing the sore sensitive layers of deep skin tissue. It hurt to pull like that and soon the baby elephant, realizing the effort was both futile and painful, stopped trying to escape.

# Elephants Never Forget

##### As the baby elephant grew older, it never forgot that bad experience with the chain and the peg. And so whenever it was anchored down in a spot, it would think, “Hey, it’s impossible to break away and besides, it hurts.”
 The adult elephant had what I call an “assumed constraint.” And all of us have the same problem to one degree or another. We all have the power to be great copywriters. But at one point in our lives, we may have written something and gotten a bad grade in English. Or we may have attempted to communicate something in writing to somebody else and had a bad experience as a result. As we’ve grown older, those hurt feelings, the feelings of inadequacy and the wrong guidance we may have received from teachers or friends are still in our subconscious, and whether we want to admit it or not, they really do affect us.
 If you understand the hurt and you understand some of the constraints we put upon ourselves, then you are better able to cope with breaking out of those assumed constraints and becoming anything you want to be and accomplishing anything you want to accomplish. Let me cite some examples.
 One of the best is the following nine-point puzzle. I gave this puzzle to my students as an example of an assumed constraint. The rules to solve this puzzle are very simple. You must draw four straight lines and connect all the points without taking your pen off the page. In short, all the lines have to be connected. Please do the puzzle before reading on.

 See if you can connect the dots in this puzzle with four straight lines without taking your pen off the paper.

##### Most people who try to solve the puzzle make one fatal error and it is simply that they don’t realize the constraint they subconsciously put upon themselves. The solution is in Appendix A on page 317. Turn to it now for the answer.
 As you can see, you were constrained by the box surrounding the points and did not go out of the box in order to find the solution. Often, to solve that very important problem, you’ve got to go out of the problem area itself to find the answer.
 A good example of assumed constraints was my choice of mailing lists for my first direct mailing when I sold the first pocket calculator by mail. I had to select 10 mailing lists for my 50,000-piece mailing and I picked eight good lists that made a lot of sense to me.
 I selected engineers, accountants and surveyors, for example. I selected wealthy people at their home addresses. I chose the mail order buyers from a certain catalog that sold similar products. But when it came to the last two lists, my list broker suggested the presidents of corporations with $20 million in sales or more.
 I thought the idea really didn’t make sense. I thought that the presidents of these companies would be so busy that more than likely they wouldn’t even open their own mail and that some secretary would throw my mailing in the garbage. But I went along with the list broker and to my surprise, those lists he suggested turned out to be the best ones, while the others really pulled poorly.

##### I can point to hundreds of assumed constraint examples that I personally experienced. Here are five of them:
 1. “You can’t sell your airplane for over $190,000.” I sold it for $240,000 in 10 days. 2. “You can’t sell a $600 pinball game through the mail.” We sold more than 3,000 of them. 3. “Consumers will rip you off if you let them buy using their credit cards over a toll-free line without having them sign anything.” We launched toll-free order taking in the United States and were very successful with very few problems before everybody else caught on. 4. “This calculator isn’t selling at all at retail. It’s the biggest bomb in calculator history. How are you going to sell it via mail order?” We sold over 30,000 of them at $59.95. 5. “Who would buy sunglasses through the mail? People need to try them on first, and besides, people buy different styles.” We sold more than 10 million pairs of the same style. Or how about the following three business examples of other historical assumed constraints:
 1. “There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.” This was said by Ken Olsen, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, in 1977. 2. “Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.” This was quoted by Popular Mechanics magazine forecasting the relentless march of science in 1949. 3. “The concept is interesting and well-formed, but in order to earn better than a ‘C,’ the idea must be feasible.” This was said by a Yale University management professor in response to Fred Smith’s paper proposing reliable overnight delivery service. Smith then went on to found FedEx. If you’d like to read more examples of assumed constraints, look in Appendix A, which lists other historical quotes.

# You Never Really Know

##### I can give you dozens of examples from history and from our company or from friends, but my point is simple. You never really know what will work or what won’t. If you believe in your idea, do it. Step out of those assumed constraints.
 This concept also applies to coming up with marketing solutions. When thinking about a problem or looking for a solution, don’t rule anything out. Sometimes that big idea will come to you if you step out of the traps that we very often fall into. Remember Edward de Bono’s concept of lateral thinking, which is somewhat the opposite of assumed constraints. Step away from the problem, think of some possible situations that have nothing to do with the problem and guess what? You’ll be amazed at how often you find a solution.
 As you proceed in this book, remember the baby elephant and the nine- point puzzle and break out of those assumed constraints.

 Axiom 7

**_When trying to solve problems, don’t assume constraints that aren’t really there._**

 Seeds of Curiosity

##### We have already learned that traffic is a key word to any retailer. A shopping center that increases traffic will generally see an increase in sales for its stores. And since the traffic generated by these stores can only be compared to getting a prospect into your copy, you increase traffic by increasing readership.
 One way to increase readership is by applying a theory I call “seeds of curiosity.” It goes like this. At the end of a paragraph, I will often put a very short sentence that offers some reason for the reader to read the next paragraph. I use sentences such as:
 But there’s more. So read on. But I didn’t stop there. Let me explain. Now here comes the good part. These seeds of curiosity cause you to subconsciously continue reading even though you might be at a point in the copy where the copy slows down. This concept is used a lot on TV before the show host goes to a commercial. She may say, “When we come back, we’ll see something that you’ve never seen on TV before. Stay tuned.” Well, it should be done in print, too. And here’s why. (Notice how I just used it.)
 In print, the ideal situation is to create such interesting and compelling copy that you don’t need the seeds of curiosity, but often that is very difficult. And using these seeds of curiosity enhances most copy. But like every good thing, don’t overdo it. Later in this book I will be showing examples of seeds of curiosity at work in many of my ads. Use them; they are very effective. But there’s another example.

-----

##### Seeds of curiosity can be used at the beginning of an ad where you mention some benefit or payoff that you are going to reveal somewhere in your copy. In short, the reader has to read the entire ad to find it. A good example of this technique was in our Consumers Hero ad mentioned in Chapter 8 and reproduced in Chapter 34. In that ad, you had to read the entire copy before you got to the punch line.
 A great example of both seeds of curiosity and traffic is what happened to me at my office. It’s something that I’ve quite frankly never experienced again but it is very relevant to this subject.
