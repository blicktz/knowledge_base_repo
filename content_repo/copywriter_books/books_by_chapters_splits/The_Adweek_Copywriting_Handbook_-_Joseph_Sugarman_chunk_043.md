##### I refused and it was my final refusal. “I’m sorry, I cannot sell anything without a 30 day return privilege. My customers all have the opportunity to return anything we sell them for a prompt and courteous refund. And then there’s the credit card issue. We make it easy for them to purchase with either Master Card, Visa or American Express.” Well, the rest is history. I am indeed offering the house for sale. Please call me at (312) 564-7000 and arrange for a personal showing. Then I urge you to buy it. We accept Visa, Master Card, American Express, American dollars, Japanese Yen or any negotiable hard currency. After you buy the home, live in it for 30 days. Enjoy the spectacular view, walk on the beautiful beaches, experience the spacious living. If, after 30 days, you aren’t completely satisfied, return the home to the original owner for a prompt and courteous refund. The developer and his wife are thrilled that I am selling their home. They realize that the mail order business is a lot different than the real estate business and are willing to compromise. But don’t you compromise. If you truly are one of those rare people in search of a spectacular home on the best location in America, call me personally at no obligation, today. PS: If you don’t have time for the showing, please order a video tape of the home. (Please refer to product number 7077YE.) Send $20 plus $3 postage and handling to the address below or credit card buyers call our toll-free number below. Malibu Mansion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $6,000,000 As I mentioned, the house did not sell. And, as a matter of fact, we didn’t sell enough videos to break even, either. But that was part of the risk I was willing to take. We did get a lot of publicity from the ad including an invitation to appear on the David Letterman show, which I declined.
 I also got a call from the Disney estate asking me if I would sell Walt Disney’s old home in the same fashion I offered the Mail Order Mansion. I didn’t accept the opportunity, as one crazy real estate ad was enough for me.

 Hungarian Conspiracy

##### Some of my ads were never even published. Others were not that successful and some appeared only in our catalog. From this last group I have selected one that I felt struck out in a very unique direction and had an interesting story. Hungarian Conspiracy appeared only in our catalog and was moderately successful. It was, however, one of my favorites.
 I actually traveled to Hungary, did all the photography in Budapest and even met with Professor Erno Rubik, the inventor of Rubik’s Cube—a three-dimensional puzzle in the shape of a cube that was a fad in the early 1980s.

 After completely insulting my prospects, I still did well.

 What was unique in this ad was the message. Consumers were urged not to buy the product through a tongue-in-cheek explanation of why

-----

##### purchasing one could cause another major recession. It is only in the last paragraph of the ad that I actually offer the product for sale.
 Keep in mind that when this was written in 1983, we still had the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union with all the associated paranoia.
 The environment created in the ad for the product is both a story and a tease. “What’s the gimmick here if they aren’t selling the product?” is one of the questions you might ask yourself as you slowly slip through the copy. And you don’t get the answer until the very last paragraph. What do you think of the ad copy?
 Headline: Hungarian Conspiracy Subheadline: Hungary plans massive assault on America with new computer weapon. Exclusive report from Budapest. Caption 1: Warn your neighbors not to buy this dangerous Hungarian secret weapon. Caption 2: Thomas Kovacs caught holding the XL-25 in this special photo smuggled out of Budapest. “You think the last recession was bad?” Copy: Note: Reproduction or any reprints, in whole or in part, of the following material is strictly forbidden without the express written permission of JS&A. All rights reserved. BUDAPEST (JS&A)—Reporters have smuggled intelligence reports out of Hungary on a conspiracy that may have far-reaching consequences for all Americans. In the coming year, Hungarians will be shipping to the United States, via Hong Kong, a game with the code name “XL-25.” The game at first may look innocuous—a typical electronic game that could come from Mattel, or any of the other big electronic game manufacturers. But beware. Whatever you do, don’t buy it.

# MASSIVE CONSPIRACY

##### The game is part of a massive conspiracy to weaken the United States by destroying our productive work force and eventually putting the entire free world into a major depression. Here’s what we’ve discovered. In 1980 when Erno Rubik, the Budapest University professor, unleashed the now famous Rubik’s Cube, the United States economy was growing at a nice clip. Shortly after the cube was introduced, America entered into a major recession. Our gross national product dropped, factories started laying off people by the thousands and the economy took a big nosedive. The exact reasons for the recession are varied, but our theory is quite simple. JS&A contends that millions of Americans were so busy twisting that small cube that they were not paying attention to their jobs. Productivity dropped, profits plunged and consumer spending fell to new lows. It was obvious to Russian intelligence sources that the cause of the American recession was the Rubik’s Cube. The Russians reasoned that if the Hungarians could invent games and then flood the American market with them, they could cause a massive depression—one that would permanently weaken America thus making us easy targets for a communist takeover. If you think this theory is farfetched, please read on.

# THANK YOU

##### Hungarians everywhere, proud of the huge success of the Rubik’s Cube, were now inspired. Hungarians are quite a creative bunch to start with. They were responsible for such things as glass fiber optics, the micro floppy disk and the science of holography. Hungary always had creative people, but their potential was never really unleashed until Rubik. The Hungarian government wanted to not only encourage this pent-up creativity, but help Hungary develop their game industry for specific communist purposes. A new private company was set up last year for the sole purpose of developing computer games for the American market. Funded by banks and run by successful Budapest business types, the company developed the XL-25 through the efforts of three game designers shown to the left. The bearded communist shown in the picture is Laszlo Mero, 33, a winner of the 1968 International Mathematical Student Olympiad held in Moscow. He’s bright, intelligent and one of the top puzzle and game designers in Hungary.

# AUTO PARTS DEALER

##### The man in the middle is Thomas Kovacs, a Hungarian auto parts dealer. At least that’s what our investigators turned up. We suspect auto parts is only a front. The man to the left is Ferenc Szatmari, a physicist and a real genius. He graduated from the University of Budapest with a doctorate degree in elementary particle physics. The incredible game they invented and the one we must stop from being sold in this country is quite fascinating. The XL-25 is an electronic game with five rows of five squares or 25 squares in all. Each square is actually a button with a built-in light-emitting diode. When you start, lights light up under five of the buttons. The object of the puzzle is to get all the lights under the buttons to light up. But there’s a catch, and here’s where the frustration comes in. Each time you press a button, the four buttons immediately surrounding the button you push change state. If they’re lit, they go off. If they’re off, they’ll go on. If you’re a little confused, it doesn’t matter anyway. Just remember that the object of the game is to get all the buttons to light up with the least number of keystrokes. The unit counts the number of button entries and you can ask the XL-25 what your score is and still return to your game. Once you try the XL-25, you’ll be immediately sucked into the Hungarian conspiracy. But don’t worry. You’re in good company. Texas Instruments was so impressed with its design that they developed the integrated circuit. A group in Hong Kong became so obsessed with it that they built the game with the quality you’d expect from a Mattel or Atari game. Quite frankly, we were so hooked that we bought thousands and even dispatched a reporter to Budapest where we made our shocking intelligence discovery.

# YOU CAN HELP

##### So there’s the story. A communist game, whose circuit was designed by a good ol’ American company, carefully assembled by one of our best friends in the Far East—all part of a massive conspiracy to prepare Americans for a major communist takeover. Prevent other Americans from falling into this scam. Order a unit from JS&A. When you receive it, whatever you do, don’t play with it. Instead, immediately take it to all your neighbors and urge them not to buy one. Tell them about the real cause of our last recession, the communist plot and the Hungarian conspiracy. And then make sure you give them the ultimate warning. “Anybody who buys this thing is a real idiot.” XL-25 (3045C 4.00) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $29 This was a really good example of pushing the envelope. The ad copy was strong enough to get my prospects to read all the copy and hopefully the curiosity was strong enough to cause them to purchase the product. Even if I did call anybody who bought one an idiot.

 Vision Breakthrough

##### The Vision Breakthrough advertisement was among the most successful in my company’s history, so it merits a close look.
 In this ad I did not want to present the product as another pair of sunglasses, so I presented it as a vision breakthrough that protects you from the harmful rays of the sun. It was one of the first ads that provided a real educational message about the dangers of ultraviolet (UV) rays on the eyes. Before this ad ran, there was really nothing in the popular press about UV ray damage.
 The approach I used was to tell the story of how I discovered the glasses and all the facts I learned about them as well as the sun’s light. I did it in a simple yet powerful way.

 This single ad started an entire business that eventually created a brand name.

-----

##### I also used a tremendous dose of curiosity. You can’t experience the pair unless you personally try them on. Thus, you must buy them to satisfy your curiosity.
 The BluBlocker advertising campaign was a major success that started with this print ad in 1986 and continued on television for several years. Today BluBlocker is a recognized brand name that is sold in retail stores throughout the country.
 Headline: Vision Breakthrough Subheadline: When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I could not believe. Nor will you. Caption: They look like sunglasses. Byline: By Joseph Sugarman Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain. Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so incredible,” he said, “when you first look through a pair, you won’t believe it.” “What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?” Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision improves. Objects appear sharper, more defined. Everything takes on an enhanced 3-D effect. And it’s not my imagination. I just want you to see for yourself.”

# COULDN’T BELIEVE EYES

##### When I received the sunglasses and put them on I couldn’t believe my eyes. I kept taking them off and putting them on to see if what I was seeing was indeed actually sharper or if my imagination was playing tricks on me. But my vision improved. It was obvious. I kept putting on my $100 pair of sunglasses and comparing them. They didn’t compare. I was very impressed. Everything appeared sharper, more defined and indeed had a greater three dimensional look to it. But what did this product do that made my vision so much better? I found out. The sunglasses (called BluBlockers) filter out the ultraviolet and blue spectrum light waves from the sun. Blue rays have one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum (red is the longest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front of the retina, which is the “focusing screen” in our eye. By blocking the blue from the sunlight through a special filtration process and only letting those rays through that indeed focus clearly on the retina, objects appear to be sharper and clearer. The second reason is even more impressive. It is harmful to have ultraviolet rays fall on our eyes. Recognized as bad for skin, UV light is worse for eyes and is believed to play a role in many of today’s eye diseases.

# SUNGLASS DANGER

##### But what really surprised me was the danger in conventional sunglasses. Our pupils close in bright light to limit the light entering the eye and open wider at night like the lens of an automatic camera. So when we put on sunglasses, although we reduce the amount of light that enters our eyes, our pupils open wider and we allow more of the harmful blue and ultraviolet light into our eyes.

 DON’T BE CONFUSED

**I’m often asked by people who read this, “Do those BluBlockers really work?” They**
**really do and please give me the opportunity to prove it. I guarantee each pair of**
**BluBlockers to perform exactly as I described.**

##### BluBlocker sunglasses use Malenium[™] lenses with a hard antiscratch coating. No shortcuts were taken. The black, lightweight frame is one of the most comfortable I have ever worn and will comfortably contour to any size face. It compares with many of the $200 pairs you can buy from France or Italy. There is a clip-on pair that weighs less than one ounce and fits over prescription lenses. All models include a padded carrying case and a one-year limited warranty. I urge you to order a pair and experience your improved vision. Then take your old sunglasses and compare them to the BluBlocker sunglasses. See how much clearer and sharper objects appear with the BluBlocker pair. And see if your night vision doesn’t improve as a direct result. If you don’t see a dramatic difference in your vision—one so noticeable that you can tell immediately—then send them back anytime within 30 days and I will send you a prompt and courteous refund.

 Gold Space Chains

##### This was the ad that created a lot of controversy when it appeared in our catalog in 1978. A number of women complained vehemently. It is a good example of the insensitivity to women’s issues that I had at the time. But, hey. I’m human and I learned.
 I also received a lot of mail congratulating me on the incredible piece of copy that I had written. So for its controversial response and for the sake of presenting some interesting and entertaining copy, I have included it here.
 Another interesting factor was the timing of this ad. When we placed it in our catalog, prices for gold were pretty low. Right after the ad appeared, the price of gold skyrocketed, the response grew like crazy and we sold out. So it proved to be quite a successful ad, too—but probably due to the serendipity of our timing.

 This controversial ad was a complete departure from our normal offerings.
