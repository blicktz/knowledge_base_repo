leave … a dollar.

To my wife Rose, who spent money like there was no tomorrow, I leave $ 100 and a

calendar …

To my sons Rodney and Victor, who spent every dime I ever gave them on fancy cars and

fast women … I leave $50 in dimes …

Finally, to my nephew, Harold, who oft time said: A penny saved is a penny earned: And

who also oft time said: ‘Gee Uncle Max, it sure pays to own a Volkswagen’ … I leave my

entire fortune of one hundred billion dollars.

##### JAPAN

The bata-bata and the moon-Watching platform

HE Japanese have a wonderful way with words. What we call a back porch they call a

moon-watching platform. A fountain pen is a ten-thousand-year brush.T

-----

Their name for a motorcycle truck it beta-beta—because that is the noise it makes. And

do you know a word in any other language that sighs good-bye as wistfully as sayonara?

Even o�cial honors reveal a touch of the poet. A Japanese genius and his work can be

declared a mukeibunkazai — an _intangible cultural treasure. At the last count, Japan had_

half-a-million practising poets, all striving m become suitably intangible.

Then there are the gentle rhythms of Japanese life. Serving tea is a formal art. So is

arranging �owers. So are good manners. You will �nd a hostess on every bus who calls out

the stops, helps old people alight, and tells the driver how he is doing on di�cult tuns.

And there's a charming festival called Seven-Five-Three Day — when parents visit their

shrines to seek blessings for children who are seven, �ve and three years old. Our

photograph shows the ancient Inari Shrine in Kyoto.

Yet, despite here engaging sensibiltiy, Japan is no nation of lotus-eaters. She builds more

ships than any other country on earth. She has a higher percentage of electri�ed homes

than we do. And Tokyo has recently passed London and New York to become the world's

largest city.

The Jersey Standard a�liate that operates in Japan is understandably eager that

anybody we send over should see the country at cherry blossom time. We do our best to

oblige. We might lose a businessman, but we could gain a poet.

##### London’s heart beats faster as the Life
 Guards clatter by

UDDENLY, sharp against the humdrum roar of tra�c, comes the clean clip of hoofbeats.

### S

Your eye is caught by the bobbing scarlet of the Life Guards, or by sunlight blinking on the

Horse Guards’ silver breastplates.

All heads turn as the cavalry troop sweeps by with a brave jingle. London’s heart beats

faster. Yours will, too.

This is a daily scene from London’s passing show. It’s part of the ageless pageantry of

Britain.

In spring, summer, fall and winter, special red-and-gold days of pomp and circumstance

await you. Whether you’re here for Trooping the Colour in June — or in November for the

Lord Mayor’s Show—you will be struck by the British genius for showmanship in the grand

manner and great tradition.

It costs so little, nowadays, to visit this friendly country. You can �y round trip from

New York to London for only $453.60 (to Scotland for $27 less); or go both ways by ship

for $400—with an extra saving of $50 between September and April. Call your travel agent

today.

##### Tread softly past the long, long sleep of
 kings

HIS IS Henry VII’s chapel in Westminster Abbey. These windows have �ltered the

### T

sunlight of �ve centuries. They have also seen the crowning of twenty-two kings.

Three monarchs rest here now. Henry, Elizabeth and Mary. Such are their names in

sleep. No titles. No trumpets. The banners hang battleheavy and becalmed. But still the

royal crown remains. Honi soit qui mal y pente.

When you go to Britain, make yourself this promise. Visit at least one of the thirty great

cathedrals. Their famous names thunder! Durham and Armagh. Or they chime! Lincoln and

Canterbury. And sometimes they whisper. Winchester, Norwich, Salisbury and Wells. Get a

map and make your choice.

Each cathedral transcends the noblest single work of art. It is a pinnacle of faith and an

act of centuries. It is an o�ering of human hands as close to Abraham as it is to Bach.

Listen to the soaring choirs at evensong. And, if you can, go at Christmas or Easter.

You will rejoice that you did.

##### Girl by a gate — in old San Juan

IME STANDS STILL in this Puerto Rican patio. That weathered escutcheon bears the Royal

### T

Arms of Spain. You might have stepped back three centuries. In a sense, you have.

You start to wonder. Can this really be the Puerto Rico everybody is talking about? Is

this the island where American industry is now expanding at the rate of three new plants a

-----

week? Is this truly the scene of a twentieth-century renaissance? Ask any proud Puerto

Rican. He will surely answer—yes.

Within minutes from this patio, you will see the signs. Some are spectacular. The new

hotels, the four-lane highways, the landscaped apartments. And some are down-to-earth. A

tractor in a �eld, a village clinic, a shop that sells refrigerators. Note all these things. But,

above all, meet tbt people.

Renaissance has a way of breeding remarkable men. Men of industry who can also love

poetry. Men of courage who can also be tender. Men of vision who can also respect the

past. Make a point of talking to these twentiethcentury Puerto Ricans.

It won’t be long before you appreciate the deeper signi�cance of Puerto Rico’s

renaissance. You’ll begin to understand why men like Pablo Casals and Juan Ramon

Jimenez (the Nobel Prize poet) have gone there to live.

##### A solid silver issue so limited only a fraction
 of Olympic Coin collectors can own this
 edition

Only an extremely limited number of 1980 Olympic Coin Collections will be minted and

o�ered to collectors—so few, in fact, that only a fraction of 1976 Olympic Coin collectors

will be able to own them.

-----

For example, only 450,000 of each Coin in Series I Geographic will be minted. 100,000

will be reserved for distribution within the Soviet Union and other related Socialist

countries—leaving a total of only 350,000 for the rest of the world. In contrast, the 1976

Montreal Olympic minting was between 650,000 and 1,480,000 of each Coin, depending

on the Series. The 1952 Helsinki issue was 600,000, And the 1964 Innsbruck issue was

2,900,000.

Nearly half a million collectors in the U.S. and Canada purchased Canadian Olympic

Coins. Yet, the entire number of 1980 Olympic Coins available to North American

collectors is only 20 percent of the Canadian Olympic Coins available in 1976.

In the entire history of Olympic Coinage there has never been an issue quite Tike this

one. These rare and beautiful Coins commemorate the �rst Olympic Games ever held in the

USSR. They are the �rst Proof Quality Coins ever minted in the Soviet Union. They are

legal tender in the USSR, backed for their full face value at the o�cial rate of exchange by

the Soviet Authorities.

And because so few 1980 Olympic Coins will be available, their importance is even

further enhanced.

**Certi�cate of Authenticity**

All Proof Quality 1980 Olympic Coins come with a signed and numbered Certi�cate of

Authenticity, which validates the Proof Quality of the Coins, their precious metal content

and their identity as the O�cial 1980 Olympic Issue by authority of the Chief Manager of

the Goznak Mints.

##### The Giant Panda needs your help to survive

NCE every eighty to a hundred years the bamboo forests in China’s Sichuan Province

### Oburst into �ower and then die o�. And that’s bad news for the Giant Panda, which depends

for its survival on huge amounts of bamboo.

But that’s just one of the problems facing the Panda.

To ensure that it has a future it is vital to preserve the complex ecosystem in which it

lives, to carry out research into its dietary needs and investigate possible alternatives, to

discover the reasons for its low reproduction rate, to study the problem of internal

parasites — all these faaors and many more which threaten its survival.

Recognition of the urgent need to solve these and other problems has resulted in a

unique and historic partnership between WWF and the People’s Republic of China.

WWF has agreed to contribute US $1,000,000 towards a total of about US $3,000,000

needed by the Chinese Government to mount a major Panda Conservation Programme.

This includes construction of a research and conservation centre in the largest of the Panda

reserves — Wolong Natural Reserve in Sichuan Province.

A team from WWF, led by the distinguished ecologistDr. G. Schaller, is already at work

in Wolong together with top Chinese scientists under the leadership of Professor Hu

Jinchu.

The Giant Panda is an endangered animal. It is also the symbol of WWF’s worldwide

conservation e�orts to save life on earth.

But WWF needs money - your money.

##### SHOULD WE ALSO FLOOD THE SISTINE CHAPEL SO TOURISTS CAN GET NEARER THE
 CEILING?

ARTH began four billion years ago and Man two million. The Age of Technology, on

the other hand, is hardly a hundred years old, and on our time chart we have been

# E

generous to give it even the little line we have.

It seems to us hasty, therefore, during this blip of time, for Man to think of directing his

fascinating new tools toward altering irrevocably the forces which made him. Nonetheless,

in these few brief years among four billion, wilderness has all but disappeared. And now

these:

1) There are proposal still before Congress to “improve” Grand Canyon. If they succeed,

two dams could back up arti�cial lakes into 93 miles of canyon gorge.This would bene�t

tourists in power boats, it is argued, who would enjoy viewing the canyon wall more

closely. (See headline.) Submerged underneath the tourists would be part of the most

revealing single page of earth’s history. The lakes would be as deep as 600 feet (deeper

for example, than all but a handful of New York buildings are high) but in a century,

silting would have replaced the water with that much mud, wall to wall.

There is no part of the wild Colorado River, the Grand Canyon’s sculptor, that would

not be maimed.

Tourist recreation, as a reason for the dams, is in fact an afterthought. The Bureau of

Reclamation, which has backed them, calls the dams “cash registers.” It expects they’ll

make money by sale of commercial power.

_They will not provide anyone with water._

2) In Northern California, during only the last 115 years, nearly all the private virgin

redwood forests have been cut down.

-----

Where nature’s tallest living things have stood silently since the age of the dinosaurs,

there is, incredibly, argument against a proposed park at Redwood Creek which would

save a mere 2% of the virgin growth that was once there. For having cut so much and

taken the rest for granted, the lumber companies are eager to get on with business. They

see little reason why they should not.

The companies have said tourists want only enough roadside trees for the snapping of

photos. They o�ered to spare trees for this purpose, and not much more. The result

would remind you of the places on your face you missed while you were shaving.

3) And up the Hudson, there are plants for a power complex — a plant, transmission lines,

and a reservoir near and on Storm King Mountain—e�ectively destroying one of the last

wild and high and beautiful spots near New York City.

4) A proposal to �ood a region in Alaska as large as Lake Erie would eliminate at once the

breeding grounds of more wildlife than conservationists have preserved in history.

5) In San Francisco, real estate interests have for years been �lling a bay that made the city

famous, putting tract houses over the �ll; and now there’s a new idea — still more �ll,

enough for an air cargo terminal as big as Manhattan.

There exists today a mentality which can conceive such destruction, giving commerce

as ample reason. For 74 years, the Sierra Club (now with 48,000 members) has opposed

that mentality. But now, when even Grand Canyon is endangered, we are at a critical

moment in time.

_This generation will decide if something untrammelled and free remains, as testimony_

we had love for those who follow.

We have been taking ads, therefore, asking people to write their Congressmen and

Senators ; Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall; The President; and to send us funds to

continue the battle. Thousands have written, but meanwhile, Grand Canyon legislation

_still stands a chance of passage. More letters are needed and much more money, to help_

�ght the notion that Man no longer needs nature.*

##### Wouldn’t you protest if Shell ran a pipeline
 through this beautiful countryside?

-----

##### They already have!

“When Shell proposed a pipeline from the North East coast of Anglesey to Stanlow re�nery,

seventy eight miles away in industrial Cheshire, people were worried.

The line would run through part of the Snowdonia National Park and have to pass under

rivers Conwy, Elwy, Clwyd and Dee.

What scars would remain?

It is �ve years since the line was laid, and as I �y along the route today, even I can see

no sign of it.

On the ground, the course of the pipe can be followed by a series ot small unobtrusive

markers. Apart from these, there is nothing to tell you that the top of a pipeline runs one

metre beneath your teet.

The sheer invisibility oi the line surprises visitors but not me. 1 was responsible for re
instating the land and well know what unprecedented lengths we went to. Every toot of the

way was photographed before digging started, and the vegetation restored the way the

record showed it … even to the exact varieties of grass.

Sometimes, I agreed deviations in the line to avoid disturbing rare trees. In addition, a

team ot archaeologists preceded pipeline contractors to make sure that the route would

avoid cromlechs, barrows, earthworks and other historical sites.

“We are proud ot the result, and it shows the way ftor othner conservation projects.”

##### The Instrument of the Immortals

There has been but one supreme piano in the history of music. In the days of Liszt and

Wagner, of Rubinstein and Berlioz, the preeminence of the Steinway was as unquestioned

-----

as it is today. It stood then, as it stands now, the chosen instrument of the masters—the

inevitable preference wherever great music is understood and esteemed.

STEINWAY & SONS, Steinway Hall, 107-109 E. 14th Street, New York

_Subway Expnu Stations al the Dear_

**Fortress Steinway.**

So begins the Steinway Grand Piano.

The basic frame, shown here, is so solid, so strong, so well made that even at this early

stage of construction-before a note is played-the Steinway takes leave of lesser quality

instruments.

Examine the curved rim. While other pianomakers build it in sections, we build it the

hard way.

Inner and outer rims are rock maple, laminated in one operation into a rigid arch strong

enough to withstand 20 tons of pressure from the strings.

Now take a closer look. The inner rim mount of the Steinway grand is beveled at an

88.5° angle so that the soundboard, when glued in, is forced to arch just enough to increase

vibrancy and responsiveness.

Also observe that there are no metal connectors in a Steinway frame. We know they

distort the sound and loosen with time.
