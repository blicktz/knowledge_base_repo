There is considerable evidence of the varying and often only temporary success of connections
designed to reduce the dehumanization of rival groups or to build unity with them by highlighting
common enemies or by finding some kind of shared identity or by undertaking perspective-taking
(Catapano, Tormala, & Rucker, 2019; Dovidio, Gaertner, & Saguy, 2009; Goldenberg, Courtney, &
Felig, 2020; Lai et al., 2016; Mousa, 2020; Over, 2020; Sasaki & Vorauer; 2013; Todd & Galinsky,
2014; Vorauer, Martens, & Sasaki, 2009). Evidence documenting the undercutting effects of
perceived threat on unity-generating procedures is extensive (Gómez et al., 2013; Kauff et al., 2013;
Morrison, Plaut, & Ybarra, 2010; Pierce et al., 2013; Riek, Mania, & Gaertner, 2006; Sassenrath,
Hodges, & Pfattheicher, 2016; Vorauer & Sasaki, 2011).
32. For a review of evidence of likely greater genetic commonality among those who share families,
friendships, and locales, as well as political and religious attitudes, see research included in this
chapter’s endnotes 9, 12, 14, 16, and 17. The initial research on which Kahneman based the focusing
illusion was published in Schkade & Kahneman (1998); for subsequent support, see Gilbert (2006),
Krizan & Suls (2008), Wilson et al. (2000), and Wilson & Gilbert (2008). Related data come from a
study investigating why items placed in the center of an array of brands on store shelves tend to be
purchased more often. The one in the center gets more visual attention than those to the left or right.
Furthermore, it is this greater attention that predicts the purchase decision (Atalay, Bodur, &
Rasolofoarison, 2012). As regards the general rationale for and the consequences of the focusing
illusion, there is evidence that what’s important gains our attention and what we attend to gains in
importance. For instance, in the realm of attitudes, researchers have shown that we are organized
cognitively so that the attitudes we can most readily access (focus upon) are the ones most important
to us (Bizer & Krosnick, 2001). As well, any attitude we can readily access comes to be seen as more
important (Roese & Olson, 1994). There is even evidence that concentrated visual attention to a
consumer item increases the item’s judged worth by influencing sectors of the brain that govern
perceived value (Lim, O’Doherty, & Rangel, 2011; Krajbich et al., 2009). The studies demonstrating
how attentional focus from media coverage, landing-page imagery, and aged photos influenced
perceived importance were performed by Corning & Schuman (2013), Mandel & Johnson (2002),
and Hershfield et al. (2011).

Although not all methods have proved effective, considerable research indicates that it is possible
to be trained to shift attention away from threatening entities toward more positive or at least less
frightening ones (Hakamata et al., 2010; Mogg, Allison, & Bradley, 2017; Lazarov et al., 2017; Price
et al., 2016). Besides training ourselves to focus away from the sometimes threatening aspects of outgroups, we can use focus in another way to defuse the resulting anxiety. It involves focusing away
from the anxieties themselves and onto our strengths. When we experience these sorts of threats, the
key is to engage in “self-affirmations” that channel attention to something about ourselves we value,
such as a strong relationship with a family member, friend, or friendship network; it could also be to
a trait we prize—our creativity or sense of humor, perhaps. The effect is to reorient our focus from
threatened aspects of ourselves and the defensive responses that accompany them (prejudice,
combativeness, self-promotion) to valued aspects of ourselves and the confident responses that
follow (openness, equanimity, self-control). Numerous studies have recorded the ability of timely
self-affirmations to reverse the negative impact of out-group threat (Čehajić-Clancy et al., 2011;
Cohen & Sherman, 2014; Shnabel et al., 2013; Sherman, Brookfield, & Ortosky, 2017; Stone et al.,
2011).
33. The studies documenting the greater dishonesty of employees of firms with togethernessemphasizing Code of Conduct statements were published by Kouchaki, Gino, & Feldman (2019).
The tendency to excuse such conduct from members of a “we”-group isn’t limited to humans. In
another illustration, food theft by young chimpanzees is much more tolerated by adult food-holders if
the young thief is their kin (Fröhlich et al., 2020).

The wisdom of a no-tolerance policy for proven unethical conduct can be seen in evidence of the
toxic economic consequences of allowing such behavior within an organization. My colleagues and I
have labeled these consequences as “the triple-tumor structure of organizational dishonesty.” We’ve
argued that an organization that regularly allows the use of deceitful tactics by its personnel (against
coworkers and also against customers, clients, stockholders, suppliers, distributors, and so on) will
experience a trio of costly internal outcomes: declining employee performance, high employee
turnover, and prevalent employee fraud and malfeasance. In addition, the outcomes will function like
malignant tumors—growing, spreading, and eating progressively at the organization’s health and
vigor. In a set of studies, literature reviews, and analyses, we found support for our assertions
(Cialdini, 2016, chap. 13; Cialdini et al., 2019; Cialdini, Petrova, & Goldstein, 2004).

A no-tolerance policy of dismissals following ethical infractions in organizations, especially
togetherness-minded organizations, may seem ruthless, and I can’t recall ever before advocating
ruthlessness in human exchanges, yet, based on our findings, it seems justified. Of course, I
recognize and am even generally sympathetic to counterarguments that stress forbearance, that say to
err is human and people should be given a second chance, and that point to Shakespeare’s lines in
_The Merchant of Venice regarding treatment of ethical abusers: “The quality of mercy is not strained._
/ It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath.” But, pertaining specifically to
unethical conduct in workforce units, I (unlike the Bard) have seen considerable research
documenting a set of corrosive and contagious consequences that would be foolish to underestimate.

#### Chapter 9: Instant Influence
1. Evidence of the perceptual and decisional narrowing produced by cognitive overload can be
found in Albarracin & Wyer (2001); Bawden & Robinson (2009); Carr (2010); Chajut & Algom
(2003); Conway & Cowan (2001); Dhami (2003); Easterbrook (1959); Hills (2019); Hills, Adelman,
& Noguchi (2017); Sengupta & Johar (2001); and Tversky & Kahneman (1974).
