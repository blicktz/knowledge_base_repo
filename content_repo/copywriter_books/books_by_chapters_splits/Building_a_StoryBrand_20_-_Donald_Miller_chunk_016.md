Transitional Calls to Action
 Direct calls to action are simple and obvious (though ridiculously underused), but transitional calls to action can be equally as powerful to grow your business. In fact, StoryBrand grew into a multimillion-dollar company in only its second year based solely on the use of a transitional call to action. Recognizing that most of our clients were using the StoryBrand framework to fix their websites, we released a free PDF called “5 Things Your Website Should Include,” and thousands of people downloaded it. At the back of the PDF we placed an ad for our StoryBrand

 A good transitional call to action can do three powerful things for your brand:

 1. Stake a claim to your territory. If you want to be known as the
 leader in a certain territory, stake a claim to that territory before the competition beats you to it. Creating a PDF, a video series, or anything else that positions you as the expert is a great way to establish authority. 2. Create reciprocity. I’ve never worried about giving away too much
 free information. In fact, the more generous a brand is, the more reciprocity they create. All relationships are give-and-take, and the more you give to your customers, the more likely it is they will give something back in the future. Give freely. 3. Position yourself as the guide. When you help your customers
 solve a problem, even for free, you position yourself as the guide. The next time they encounter a problem in that area of their lives, they will look to you for help.

 Transitional calls to action come in all shapes and sizes. Here are a few ideas to create transitional calls to action of your own:

 Free information: Create a white paper or free PDF educating customers about your field of expertise. This will position you as a guide in their story and create reciprocity. Educational videos, podcasts, webinars, and even live events are great transitional calls to action that on-ramp customers toward a purchase. Testimonials: Creating a video or PDF including testimonials from happy clients creates a vision of a climactic scene in your customer’s mind. When they see others experience a successful ending to their story, they will want that same ending for themselves. Samples: If you can give away free samples of your product, do it. Offering a customer the ability to test-drive a car, taste your seasoning, sample your music, or read a few pages of your book are great ways to introduce potential customers to your products.

###### Free trial: Offering a limited-time free trial works as a risk-removal policy that also on-ramps your customers. Once they try your product, they may not be able to live without it.

 Connecting the Dots
 Earlier this year StoryBrand worked with a clinic that specialized in health screening, drug testing, treating minor sicknesses, and giving shots. The primary traffic the clinic received was through businesses who needed their employees to complete drug tests, which provided a steady stream of predictable revenue. Still, the clinic was stagnant in growth. Customers were coming in to get one product but weren’t aware of anything else the clinic offered.
 Upon visiting the clinic, one of our StoryBrand marketing coaches noticed they were missing a clear, direct, and transitional call to action.
 Patients would come into the shop, sign and date an entry form, then sit in the lobby reading magazines or watching television while they waited for a nurse. As one of our StoryBrand certified coaches consulted with the clinic, she told the owner to remove the television and magazines. Instead, she encouraged them to create a transitional call to action called “The Healthy Body Checklist,” allowing patients to self-assess their health. The checklist included questions like, “Do you feel tired at about two in the afternoon every day?” and “Are you satisfied with your current weight?” After patients finished their drug or blood tests, we suggested that nurses review the checklist with each patient and let them know about solutions that were also available at the clinic. The receptionist could then enter the customer’s data into their email marketing system and, based on how a patient was tagged, an automated campaign would go into effect. If the customer seemed like they needed more vitamin B, they’d get a series of emails explaining the benefits of a monthly vitamin B shot, along with clear calls to action directing the patient to make another appointment. What happened? Sales, of course, increased. And why? Because the nurses provided a transitional call to action that identified the customer’s problems and then the clinic built a trusting relationship with each new client via an automated email campaign.
 Is there a transitional call to action you can create that will grow your business? Are your direct calls to action clear and repeated often? If not, your customers likely don’t know what you want them to do. Remember,

###### people are drawn to clarity and away from confusion. Having clear calls to action means customers aren’t confused about the actions they need to take to do business with you, and having transitional calls to action increases the length and depth of the relationship you are building with customers.

##### WHAT ARE THE STAKES?

###### At this point in the optimizing of your messaging and marketing using the StoryBrand framework, customers are going to start placing orders. But let’s not stop. How can we make the story we are inviting customers into so enticing that they can’t wait to do business with us?
 To do this, we must define the stakes. What’s at stake in the customer’s story if they do or do not choose to buy our product? If we’ve not defined the stakes, we’ve missed the opportunity to make the story interesting.
 In the next two modules, I’ll teach you how to increase a sense of intrigue and urgency with your brand by defining exactly what’s at stake.
 Before we move forward, though, continue clarifying your business by brainstorming potential calls to action you can include in your StoryBrand BrandScript.
