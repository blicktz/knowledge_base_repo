##### The ad was a terrific success. We eventually placed the ad in dozens of magazines and while the other competitors dropped out, we succeeded handsomely. But look at the emotional approach I used. There is nothing about the product’s technical advantages, nothing about the powerful memory of the unit. I just knew the nature of the product and the person buying this product. Each product has an inherent nature, and understanding that inherent nature will help you sell it. (I explained this partially when I talked about the Midex burglar alarm and the insurance salesman in Chapter 2, “Specific Knowledge,” and will explain it in more detail later.) I realized that the product would appeal to the gadget-motivated person who would want to show it off to his or her friends. The ad copy reflects this specific knowledge.
 Later on in the ad I justified the purchase with the facts and the technology but not too deeply. The real motivation for people to buy this product was the emotional appeal of the sales message.
 I was invited once to speak at New York University to a class on direct marketing. As I addressed all the students on copywriting, I told them that if I was handed a product, showed it to the class and told the class to write an ad on the product, I would venture to say that everyone in the class would write a better ad than I would. I said, “Your grammar would be correct, your spelling would be perfect and mine would be just horrible.”

# What Comes after the First Draft
 Is What Counts

##### But it is what I do after that first draft that makes my copy successful compared to the rest of the class. I then went on to explain the editing process and its importance. But the reason, I explained, for my ad appearing so poorly written in my first draft is because it is simply an emotional outpouring of my thoughts on the product and how I feel it should be sold. It is a free release of my emotions.
 And as you write copy, keep this in mind. It makes absolutely no difference what your first draft looks like. If you can get all your feelings and emotions about the subject out on paper and work from there, you will have mastered a very important technique.
 The final point on the emotion of copy relates to words themselves. If you realize that each word has an emotion attached to it—almost like a short story unto itself—then you will also have a very good understanding of what emotion means in the copywriting process.
 Look at a dictionary not as a collection of words but as a collection of short stories. Webster once was quoted as saying that if you took every one of his possessions away and left him with just his words, he’d get all his possessions back. The power of words is enormous.

# Words Have Strong Emotions
 Attached

##### What emotions do you feel when I mention the following words: Cleveland, rip-off, consumer, farmer, lawyer, Soviet? Cleveland may have evoked a little laughter as a place you might not consider moving to unless you live in Cleveland, and if you do live there, please accept my apologies. Cleveland is a very nice city. But every country has a famous city that everybody makes fun of. The Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff once said that in Russia they also have one city that the Russian comedians make fun of. He says it too is Cleveland.
 And then what do words like consumer and rip-off make you feel? The word farmer may not only remind you of what a farmer does for a living but also bring to mind words like honesty, integrity, earthy, hardworking. Think of all the feelings the word farmer conjures up, not only from your experience but from what you feel emotionally. The word Soviet sounds more sinister to me than Russian. What thoughts come to mind with the word lawyer?
 When you analyze these words and see how you can use them to create a message that has emotional impact, then you have mastered an important lesson in writing copy.
 Here’s some copy I wrote that points out the emotional differences in copy. Which sounds better?
 Example 1: The old woman in the motel. Example 2: The little old lady in the cottage. I was writing an ad on some rubbing oil I had discovered in Hawaii and describing how I had discovered it. Example 1 was in my first draft but example 2 sounded much better.
 I’m not suggesting that you materially change the facts of a situation to suit an emotional feeling. In this case, the motel office was in a small cottage, and the word cottage gave the copy a better emotional feel. What do you think? Do you “feel” the difference?

##### Sometimes changing a single word will increase response in an ad. John Caples, the legendary direct marketer, changed the word repair to the word fix and saw a 20 percent increase in response.
 Don’t feel that you have to have a total command of the emotional impact of words to be a great copywriter. It takes testing and common sense more than anything else. And knowing the emotional feel of words is like your general knowledge—it comes with time. It is enough for now that you realize the importance of the emotional values in every word. As time goes on, you will feel this influence play a bigger and bigger role in your successful copywriting.

# Chapter 12

 Selling the Concept, Not the
 Product

##### Let’s discuss one of the most important and basic copywriting principles I teach. In fact, if you can understand and learn this single point, you will have mastered a major lesson in writing good advertising copy.

 Axiom 9

**_Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept._**

##### What do I mean by “concept”? There are many words that mean the same thing. One day, for example, the hot buzzword in advertising might be positioning. A product is positioned or placed in such a way as to appeal to the consumer.
 Other terms commonly used are Big Idea, or USP (unique selling proposition), maybe even gimmick. Whatever it’s called, it means basically the same thing. You sell the sizzle and not the steak—the concept and not the product.
 The only exception to this rule is when the product is so unique or new that the product itself becomes the concept. Take the digital watch for example. When the watches first came out, I could hardly keep them in stock. When I first announced them, my main thrust was to explain the various features, which were all new, and then just take orders.
 But as the digital watches became plentiful and everybody understood what they did and how they worked, each ad had to differentiate the features of the watch through a unique concept. For example, the world’s thinnest digital watch or one with a built-in alarm or one with the most expensive band, or the one with the finest quality, or even one that required a laser beam in its manufacturing process—all were different concepts. Concepts started selling watches; the product was no longer the concept.

-----

##### Another example is the Pocket CB. It had its concept right there in the headline. There were walkie-talkies and there were mobile CB units, but we had the first Pocket CB. And it was the name itself that expressed the concept.
 Or take the example of the Pocket Yellow Pages I referred to in the previous chapter. Doesn’t that name express everything you really need to know about the product in a simple concept? In that ad I didn’t sell the product, but rather the concept of standing in a phone booth and pulling out an electronic directory to the surprise and delight of those around you.
 Another example was a smoke detector I was selling. Instead of selling it as a smoke detector, the headline screamed, “Nose”—a product that just sat on your ceiling and sniffed the air. It sold quite well.

# Combining Products into Concepts

##### Sometimes the concept naturally comes from the product and other times the concept can be created. I remember once running several products in my catalog without much copy and discovering two that sold quite well. Rather than run them as separate products in full-page ads, I decided to run them together in one full-page ad as a concept.
 The two products were a miniature travel alarm and a chess computer. But rather than develop a concept for each, I wrote the headline “Winners” and told how both products were the top-selling products in our recent catalog. The headline put both products under a single concept and made them both winners while drawing attention to our catalog.
 Sales continued briskly with the chess computer in 1978 when I received a call from the company in Hong Kong from whom we were importing the product. “Joe,” said my friend Peter Auge, the man in Hong Kong supplying me with the computer, “I think I can get Anatoli Karpov, the Soviet chess champion, to endorse our chess computer. I’m friends with him through a contact in Russia and it might make the chess computer sell better.”
 Indeed it would, I thought, but let’s come up with a concept using Karpov —not as a person who will endorse the product but as somebody whom we can challenge to play our unit. And indeed, that’s what we did. Our first major ad with Karpov’s name appeared with the headline “Soviet Challenge.”
 Subheadline: Can an American chess computer beat the Soviet chess champion? A confrontation between American space-age technology and a Soviet psychological weapon. Copy: The Soviet Union regards chess as a psychological weapon, not just a game. It is a symbol of Communism’s cultural struggle with the West. So when Russian Anatoli Karpov competed against the Russian defector Victor Korchnoi, he had the entire Soviet Union’s resources at his disposal, including a hypnotist and neuropsychologist.

##### Karpov won. And with it the world’s undisputed chess championship. Karpov, however, has never confronted American space-age technology and in particular JS&A’s new chess computer. Of course the copy continued to talk about the challenge we were making against Karpov. That was the concept. We weren’t selling chess computers. We were selling the challenge against the Russian champion and as a consequence selling chess computers. It was taking a very staid product and giving the entire promotion a more emotional appeal.
 Then the ad went on to explain how the unit worked, its features and ended with the challenge to Karpov.
 The ad had some pretty effective copy. And I’ve reproduced it in Appendix E at the end of the book. Read it. It’s a lot of fun.

# Soviet Intrigue

##### I was sitting in my office as the ad was breaking throughout the United States when I received an urgent telegram from overseas. Opening it up, I saw right away it was from Karpov. “I am going to sue you for using me in your advertising without permission.” Signed: Anatoli Karpov.
 I was told that I had permission to use his name by my friend Peter, who said, in fact, that he would be sending me the endorsement contract and that I should go ahead and run the ad. So I did, thinking all was okay.
 What to do? Simple. I could just see my next headline: “Soviet Union Sues JS&A” or maybe “Little JS&A Attacked by Soviets.” What a great concept. But before I could sit down and write it, my friend Peter called and advised me that he had gotten a copy of the telegram, too, and that everything had been worked out with Karpov’s agent and there was nothing to worry about. Karpov would endorse the chess computer and I could continue my ad campaign.
 I then sat down and wrote the third ad in the series, entitled “Karpov Accepts,” which talked about the challenge made to Karpov and how he then decided that for whatever reason, he didn’t want to play the chess computer as part of the challenge. Instead he could just endorse it and hope that many Americans would learn to improve their chess game on it.

# Concept Selling Does Well

##### All three ads did very well and more than 20,000 chess computers were sold. And all three had different concepts associated with them. Meanwhile, my competition was out there in force trying to sell their chess computers but not succeeding because they were selling chess computers and not Soviet Challenges and Karpov Accepts—concept advertising.
 If your advertising just sells the product, be careful. You need a concept. If you’ve come up with a unique concept, fantastic. You’ll do much better.

####

# Price Can Also Affect Concept

##### Sometimes simply changing the price of a product can dramatically alter its concept. For example, when we were offering our Pocket CB at $39.95 it came across as a serious electronic product similar to a full-sized CB radio. When we dropped the price to $29.95 it became more of a sophisticated walkie-talkie. And finally when we dropped the price to $19.95, the product was perceived as a toy—all this despite the fact that the copy in the ad was pretty much the same.
 Finding the concept is often not easy. It takes all the skills of a conceptual thinker to come up with the right idea and the right position. One of my favorite advertisements that really captured the essence of this chapter was an ad I once read from the Leo Burnett ad agency. It was a full-page ad that appeared in Advertising Age magazine and is reproduced on the next page.

##### Tcudorp

 The first job of an ad agency is to look at your product in every imaginable way: frontwards, backwards, sideways, upside down, inside out. Because somewhere, right there in the product itself, lies the drama that will sell it to people who want it. There may be 10,000 ways to bring that inherent drama to the stage. And given a world in which “me-too” products multiply like mayflies, the drama may seem that much harder to find. It is. But every good product has it. And every good agency finds it.

(Please note: The “t” in tcudorp is silent.)

##### It’s so true. Every product has that unique selling proposition that makes it stand out from the rest. And it is indeed up to you, the copywriter, to realize this fact and discover each product’s uniqueness. If you do, the simple positioning of a product and the developing of a concept can be so powerful that it can make the difference between a huge success and a loser.
 In the next chapter, you’ll discover how to come up with that great idea as we study the incubation process.

# Chapter 13

 The Incubation Process

##### It’s fine to read about the real secrets of copywriting, but let’s get serious. One of these days you’re going to have to implement what you’ve learned and start writing copy. What are some of the mental steps required to write copy in general and how do you go about writing effective copy?
 Let’s establish a few things that you have learned already in this book and then take everything a step further. As you recall, I referred to general knowledge—the knowledge you have picked up simply by living—and specific knowledge—the knowledge you acquired while studying the specific product you want to write copy about.
 Assume you are now an expert on a particular product and you are ready to start writing. The first thing I would do is go over all the material you have on your subject and give a great deal of thought to what you have just read and studied. Do plenty of thinking about what you want to write. You may jot down some headlines and some of the copy points you would like to bring out. You might list those points that best describe the nature of the product you are selling and you might like to list some of the strong reasons that your product would appeal to your customers. Put all your thoughts down on paper. But keep in mind, you have not yet started to write the copy. This is just preparation.

 Take a break from your work and do something pleasurable while your brain incubates.
