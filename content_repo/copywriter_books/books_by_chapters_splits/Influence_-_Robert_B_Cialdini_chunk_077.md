The lesson that popularity begets popularity also emerges from research into music-download
choices. If, on a music site, a never-before-heard song was designated (at random by researchers) as
popular, it became more popular (Salganik, Dodds, & Watts, 2006). Results like these fit with
evidence that people believe, correctly, that the crowd is typically right (Surowiecki, 2004). For an

-----

extensive exploration of the rise of popularity in today’s information environment, see Derek
Thompson’s (2017) engaging book on the topic, which confirms the tongue-in-cheek observation we
could make that “Popularity these days is all the rage.”
2. The experiment showing the effect of social-proof information on estimates of morality was
conducted by Aramovich, Lytle, & Skitka (2012). See Barnett, Sanborn, & Shane (2005) for the
research showing that perceptions of the frequency of crimes by others are related to possible
perpetrators’ likelihood of performing the crimes themselves. Besides the bad news that when people
perceive partner violence as frequent, they are more likely to engage in it (Mulla et al., 2019), there is
the good news that when they get evidence that bad behavior is not the social norm, they refrain from
it (Paluck, 2009). The data indicating that 98 percent of online shoppers prioritize authentic customer
reviews most when making purchase decisions comes from a survey in _Search Engine Journal_
(Nijjer, 2019). Marijn Stok and her associates (2014) did the research on Dutch teens’ fruit
consumption. The city of Louisville’s success in getting parking-ticket holders to pay on time was
reported by the Behavioral Insights Team on p. 29 of _Behavioral Insights for Cities_
(www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Behavioral-Insights-for-Cities-2.pdf). The research into
face-mask wearing in Japan was conducted by Nakayachi et al. (2020). For reviews of the
effectiveness of social-proof interventions on various forms of pro-environmental action, see Andor
& Fels (2018), Bergquist, Nilsson, & Schultz (2019), and Farrow, Grolleau, & Ibanez (2017).
Countries using social proof to reduce corporate pollution are Indonesia (Garcia, Sterner, & Afsah,
2007) and India (Powers et al., 2011). Albert Bandura and his coworkers performed the work on how
to reduce children’s fear of dogs via social proof in a pair of famous studies (Bandura, Grusec, &
Menlove, 1967; Bandura & Menlove, 1968).
3. Perhaps because of the quality of ragged desperation with which they approached their task, the
believers were wholly unsuccessful at enlarging their number. According to Festinger, Riecken, &
Schachter (1964), not a single convert was gained. At that point, in the face of the dual failures of
physical and social proof, the cult quickly disintegrated. Less than three weeks after the date of the
predicted flood, group members were scattered and maintained only sporadic communication with
one another. In one final—and ironic—disconfirmation of prediction, it was the movement that
perished in the flood.

Ruin has not always been the fate of doomsday groups whose predictions proved unsound,
however. When such groups have been able to build social proof for their beliefs through effective
recruitment efforts, they have grown and prospered. For example, when the Dutch Anabaptists saw
their prophesied year of destruction, 1533, pass uneventfully, they became rabid seekers after
converts, pouring unprecedented amounts of energy into the cause. One extraordinarily eloquent
missionary, Jakob van Kampen, is reported to have baptized one hundred persons in a single day. So
powerful was the snowballing social evidence in support of the Anabaptist position that it rapidly
overwhelmed the disconfirming physical evidence and turned two-thirds of the population of
Holland’s great cities into adherents. More recent evidence supports the idea that when their central
beliefs are undermined, people engage in efforts to persuade others to those beliefs as a way to
restore their validity (Gal & Rucker, 2010).
4. The scientific literature is clear that attention to the actions of others is intensified under
conditions of uncertainty because those actions serve to reduce the uncertainty (Sechrist & Stangor,
2007; Sharps & Robinson, 2017; Wooten & Reed, 1998; Zitek & Hebl, 2007). For the Sylvan
Goldman story, see Dauten (2004) and www.wired.com/2009/06/dayintech-0604.

Besides a lack of familiarity with a particular situation, another kind of uncertainty occurs when
we don’t have much confidence in our existing preferences on an issue. In that case, we are again
especially influenced by social proof. Take as evidence the results of one more study done in Latin
American McDonald’s restaurants by my InfluenceAtWork.com colleagues Steve J. Martin and
Helen Mankin. Most McDonald’s customers don’t purchase a dessert with their order; hence, they
don’t have confidence in their preferences toward the range of dessert selections there. Consequently,

-----

when given the social-proof information that a McFlurry was the favorite choice, their likely
purchase of a McFlurry rose significantly. But most McDonald’s customers _do have a lot of_
experience with the burgers there. With that confidence of what they preferred already in place, when
told the favorite burger selection at the restaurant, this information did not affect their burger choices.
For additional details on this and other McDonald’s studies done by our team, see
www.influenceatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Persuasion-Pilots-McDonalds-ArcosDorados-INFLUENCE-AT-WORKpdf.pdf.

Finally, in one study, participants who were hooked up to brain-imaging equipment saw product
reviews of consumer items available on Amazon. The participants with low levels of confidence in
their own initial opinions of the products became especially likely to move in the direction of others’
reviews as they saw more and more of them. This greater influence was registered in a sector of the
brain associated with perceived value—the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (De Martino et al., 2017).
5. The famous, and now infamous, account of the Genovese neighbors’ “apathy” was presented in
detail first in a long, front-page New York Times article (Gansberg, 1964) and later in a book by the
_Times metropolitan editor A. M. Rosenthal (1964). Early work successfully challenging many of the_
central details of these accounts can be credited to Manning, Levine, & Collins (2007); see also
Philpot et al. (2020). Evidence for the pluralistic-ignorance phenomenon was provided by Latané and
Darley (1968), whereas evidence that it and bystander inaction are unlikely to occur when observers
are confident that an emergency exists can be seen in Clark and Word (1972, 1974) as well as in
Fischer et al. (2011). Shotland and Straw (1976) conducted the studies on what a woman should
shout to get bystander assistance when in a physical confrontation with a man.
6. The New York City study on looking up in a crowd (Milgram, Bickman, & Berkowitz, 1969)
was replicated by investigators who found a similar pattern nearly a half-century later and in a
different place, Oxford, England (Gallup et al., 2012). See Fein, Goethals, & Kugler (2007) and
Stewart et al., (2018) for the work on the contagious effects of audience reactions at US presidential
debates.

8. Researchers from the Alfresco Labs performed the shopping-mall study; see
www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/behavioural-economics-used-herd-shoppers/1348142. Freling &
Dacin (2010) collected the data showing the greater and greater effectiveness of ads reporting higher
and higher percentages of others’ preference for the advertised brand. The fruit-fly research was done
by Danchin et al. (2018). Doug Lansky (2002) reported his experience at the Royal Ascot Races in
his newspaper travel column “Vagabond Roaming the World.” Charles MacKay’s account of the
1761 London earthquake panic appeared in his classic book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and
_the Madness of Crowds (1841). For a detailed account of the consequences of the cascading white-_
van frenzy, see www.insider.com/suspicious-white-van-unfounded-facebook-stories-causing-masshysteria-2019-12.

Other evidence is available for the validation component of social proof. In one study, children
six to eleven years old given information that the other kids in the study had chosen to eat a lot of
carrots responded by eating more of their own carrots—because that information gave them
confidence that eating carrots was a good choice (Sharps & Robinson, 2017). An online consumerchoice experiment showed a similar effect. Participants who learned that two-thirds of the bottles of a
particular wine had already been sold were more willing to purchase that wine than if they learned
that only one-third of the bottles had been sold. Why? Because they assigned greater quality to the
wine if its sales were stronger (van Herpen, Pieters, & Zeelenberg, 2009).
9. The data on Italian residents’ willingness to recycle household waste was collected in the cities
of Rome, Cagliari, Terni, and Macomer by Fornara et al. (2011). My colleagues and I collected our
data on household energy conservation in San Marcos, California, where, in addition to the effects I

-----

have described, we learned something else we found noteworthy. Our study included two control
groups—one set of residents who received a message urging them to save energy but providing no
stated reason for it and a second set of residents who received no message at all. Those two control
groups were not different from one another in the subsequent energy they used (Nolan et al., 2008).
In other words, simply exhorting people to conserve had the same impact as nothing. People want
reasons to act. The important question is, of course, Which reasons are particularly mobilizing? In
our study, easily the most persuasive reason to conserve energy in the home was that most of one’s
neighbors were doing so.
10. When people desire social approval, they are more likely to conform to the group mind on an
issue; more perilously, they are also more likely to conform to the alcohol-consumption levels of the
group (Cullum et al., 2013). Berns et al. (2005) collected the data showing greater conformity and
greater psychological pain when people feel out of keeping with the opinions of other people (versus
computers); see Ellemers & van Nunspeet (2020) for additional such evidence. For a description of
cult “love bombing,” see Hassan (2000).
11. Several research teams have confirmed that worried students’ adjust better when informed that
other students like them have overcome their similar concerns (Binning et al., 2020; Borman et al.,
2019; Stephens et al., 2012; Wilson & Linville, 1985). The work on adolescent aggression was
reviewed by Jung, Busching, & Krahé (2019). Boh & Wong (2015) did the study showing that
coworkers use one another rather than managers to decide whether to share information. Studies
demonstrating that physicians’ prescribing practices conform to peer norms were reported by Fox,
Linder, & Doctor (2016), Linder et al. (2017), and Sacarny et al. (2018). Robert Frank’s review of the
impact of peer behavior on environmental action is contained in his book, _Under the Influence:_
_Putting Peer Pressure to Work (2020). For additional evidence of the impact of peer-suasion on pro-_
environmental action, see Nolan et al. (2021), Schultz (1999), and Wolske, Gillingham, & Schultz
(2020). Finally, college students’ attitudes toward minority groups can be modified by information
about their peers’ attitudes (Murrar, Campbell, & Brauer, 2020).
12. It was Aune & Basil (1994) who hypothesized correctly that donations would rise after having
an on-campus charity requester say, “I’m a student here, too.” The studies showing the influence of
same-age peers were done by Murray et al. (1984) within an antismoking program and Melamed et
al. (1978) for dental anxieties. The success of Opower’s Home Energy Reports containing peer
consumption comparisons has been documented by Allcott (2011), Allcott & Rogers (2014), and
Ayres, Raseman, & Shih (2013); although Opower’s reports have been delivered by mail, they work
just as well when delivered electronically (Henry, Ferraro, & Kontoleon, 2019). Because of a
corporate buyout, Opower’s name has changed to Oracle Utilities/Opower.
13. Phillips’s sequence of investigations began with the Werther effect (Phillips, 1974, 1979)—the
modern-day operation of which can be found in the study of the 13 Reasons Why Netflix web series
(Bridge et al., 2019)—and continued with his examination of the impact of widely publicized suicide
stories on plane and automobile fatalities (Phillips, 1980). The story of contagious train suicides in a
California high school was recounted by _Los Angeles Times reporter Maria La Ganga (2009)._
Sumner, Burke, & Kooti (2020) provide a review of the role of the media in the contagiousness of
suicide. A description of the infectious nature of product-tampering episodes is presented by Toufexis
(1993). Mass murders in the United States are becoming more deadly and frequent over time—the
largest total number of such deaths in recorded history, 224, occurred in 2017, whereas the largest
number of incidents in recorded history, 41, occurred in 2019 (Pane, 2019). Evidence for the
contagiousness of mass murder has been amassed by Towers et al. (2015) and reported on by Goode
& Carey (2015) and Carey (2016).

Good accounts of the Jonestown massacre are provided by journalist J. Oliver Conroy in a 2018
retrospective (www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-deadremembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on) and by survivor Tim Reiterman in his 2008 book
on the matter. The analysis of factors affecting brands’ market share was conducted by Bronnenberg,

-----

Dhar, & Dubé (2007), whose findings fit with research showing large personality and attitude
differences between people who live in different regions (Rentfrow, 2010).
14. The research on eating-disorder, suicide-prevention, and alcohol-deterrence programs was
conducted by Mann et al. (1997), Shaffer et al. (1991), and Donaldson et al. (1995), respectively. In
more recent research on programs designed to reduce stereotyping, informing participants that
stereotyping was regrettably prevalent led them to exhibit more stereotyping (Duguid & ThomasHunt, 2015). The study my team and I performed in the Petrified Forest National Park is described
more fully in Cialdini (2003).

Unfortunately, after we reported the outcomes of our study to park administrators, they decided
not to change the relevant aspects of their signage. This decision was based on evidence from a
survey they subsequently performed in which park personnel questioned several visitors, who said
that information indicating the theft problem at the park was sizable would _not increase their_
likelihood of stealing wood but would decrease it. We were disappointed—but, truth be told, not
surprised—that in their signage decision, park officials weighted visitors’ subjective responses to
hypothetical questions more heavily than our experimentally based empirical evidence, as it confirms
what appears to be a lack of understanding within the larger society of what constitutes confidenceworthy research results (Cialdini, 1997).
15. The tendency for people to expect a trend to continue has been documented by Hubbard (2015),
Maglio & Polman (2016), Markman & Guenther (2007), and Maus, Goh, & Lisi (2020). Our research
into the effects of a trend on water conservation also included a study with similar results on
willingness to complete a survey without pay (Mortensen et al., 2017). In addition, researchers have
demonstrated the positive impact of trends on other low-prevalence behaviors such as eating meatless
meals (Sparkman & Walton, 2017), reducing sugar consumption (Sparkman & Walton, 2019),
choosing reusable drinking cups in a cafeteria (Loschelder et al., 2019), and—among female high
school and college students—intending to pursue STEM fields for future study (Cheng et al., 2020).
16. It is perhaps no accident that the events leading to the bank crash took place in Singapore
(News, 1988), as research tells us that citizens of Far Eastern societies have a greater tendency to
respond to social-proof information than do those from Western cultures (Bond & Smith, 1996). But
any culture that values the group over the individual exhibits this greater susceptibility to information
about peers’ choices. A few years ago, some of my colleagues and I showed how this tendency
operated in Poland, a country whose population is moving toward Western values but still retains a
more communal orientation than do average Americans. We asked college students in Poland and the
United States whether they would be willing to participate in a marketing survey. For the American
students, the best predictor of their decision was information about how often they, themselves, had
agreed to marketing-survey requests in the past; this is in keeping with the primarily individualistic
point of reference of most Americans. For the Polish students, however, the best predictor of their
decisions was information about how often their friends had agreed to marketing-survey requests in
the past; this is in keeping with the more collectivistic values of their nation (Cialdini et al., 1999). Of
course, as the evidence from this chapter shows, social proof also works forcefully in predominantly
individualistic cultures, such as the United States. For instance, the data showing the deadly influence
of social proof on the decisions of airplane pilots came from American flights (Facci & Kasarda,
2004).

#### Chapter 5: Authority
1. Additional reasons I think that “behavioral science is so hot now” are explicated in Cialdini
(2018). The BIT charity study is described in _The Behavioural Insights Team Update, 2013–2015_
report, www.bi.team/publications/the-behavioural-insights-team-update-report-2013-2015. For a
history of the unit and a description of much the early work of the BIT as written by one of its
founders, see Halpern (2016). Although in the BIT charity study combining two principles of

-----

influence had the greatest effect on donations, it would be a mistake to assume that inserting more
than one principle into a persuasive message will always increase its impact. Shoehorning multiple
tactics into the same communication can alert recipients to a heavy-handed effort to persuade them,
which can have the opposite effect (Friestad & Wright, 1995; Law & Braun, 2000; Shu & Carlson,
2014).
2. The basic experiment, as well as his other variations on it, are presented in Milgram’s highly
readable Obedience to Authority (1974) as well as in Doliński & Grzyb’s excellent Social Psychology
_of Obedience toward Authority (2020). A variety of reviews of subsequent research on obedience_
since the Milgram work concluded that the levels of obedience he found in his procedure in the
United States in the 1960s are remarkably similar to those of more recent time periods (Blass, 2004;
Burger, 2009; Doliński et al., 2017; “Fake Torture TV ‘Game Show’ Reveals Willingness to Obey,”
www.france24.com/en/20100317-fake-torture-tv-game-show-reveals-willingness-obey) and similar
to those in other countries.
