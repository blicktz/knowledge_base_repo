## Owen Thomas wrote in an amazed tone in The New York Times recently how he managed

to lose 83 pounds using a mobile app. He used MyFitnessPal. The developers of the app
discovered that users who exposed their calorie counts to friends lost 50% more weight
than a typical user.

It seems obvious that a social network can help you make a change, but it is less clear
how. Many cite social proof—looking to others for how to behave—as influential, but what
better explains transformation is commitment and consistency.

The more public our commitment, the more pressure we feel to act according to our
commitment and therefore appear consistent. It can become a virtuous (or destructive)
cycle as according to Robert Cialdini, “you can use small commitments to manipulate a
person’s self-image” and once you change a person’s self-image you can get that person to
behave in accordance with that new image—anything that would be consistent with this
new view of herself.

So want to change your life? Make a specific commitment, use social media to
broadcast it and use the internal pressure you then feel to get you to follow through. This in
turn should cause you to see yourself in a new way and therefore keep you continuing to
follow through.

While Mr. Thomas’ experience demonstrates the power of this theory as applied to
dieting, I see the possible applications everywhere. Like say struggling Hispanic high
school students (they have the highest high school drop-out rate). Why not get them to
publicly commit to going to college? Might more then go? There should be an app for that.

**Author’s note: In this blog post, its author judges correctly that even though peer**
pressure was involved, the principle that produced desired change for Mr. Thomas was not
social proof. It was commitment and consistency. What’s more, the effective commitment
was public, which fits with research showing that commitments to weight-loss goals are
increasingly successful—in both the short and long term—when they become increasingly
public (Nyer & Dellande, 2010).

#### An illustration of the way public commitments can lead to consistent further action was provided in a famous experiment performed by two prominent social psychologists, Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard. The basic procedure was to have college students first estimate in their minds the length of lines they were shown. Then, one sample of the students had to commit publicly to their initial judgments by writing their estimates down, signing their names to them, and turning them in to the experimenter. A second sample also committed themselves to their first estimates, but did so privately by writing them down and then erasing them before anyone could see what they had written. A third set of students did not commit themselves to their initial estimates at all; they just kept the estimates in mind privately.
 In these ways, Deutsch and Gerard cleverly arranged for some students to commit publicly, some privately, and some not at all, to their initial decisions. The researchers wanted to find out which of the three types of students would be most inclined to stick with their first judgments after receiving information that those judgments were incorrect. Therefore, all the students were given new evidence suggesting their initial estimates were wrong, and they were then given the chance to change their estimates.
 The students who had never written down their first choices were the least loyal to those choices. When new evidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that had never left their heads, these students were the most influenced to change what they had viewed as the “correct” decision. Compared to the uncommitted students, those who had merely written their decisions for a moment were significantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance. Even though they had committed themselves under anonymous circumstances, the act of writing down their first judgments caused them to resist the influence of contradictory new data and to remain congruent with their preliminary choices. However, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their initial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from those positions later. Public commitments had hardened them into the most stubborn of all.
 This sort of stubbornness can occur even in situations in which accuracy should be more important than consistency. In one study, when six-or

#### twelve-person experimental juries were deciding a close case, hung juries were significantly more frequent if the jurors had to express their opinions with a visible show of hands rather than by secret ballot. Once jurors had stated their initial views publicly, they were reluctant to allow themselves to change publicly. Should you ever find yourself the foreperson of a jury under these conditions, you could reduce the risk of a hung jury by choosing a secret rather than public balloting method.
 The finding that we are truest to our decisions if we have bound ourselves to them publicly can be put to good use. Consider organizations dedicated to helping people rid themselves of bad habits. Many weight- reduction clinics, for instance, understand that often a person’s private decision to lose weight will be too weak to withstand the blandishments of bakery windows, wafting cooking scents, and pizza-delivery commercials. So they see to it that the decision is buttressed by the pillars of public commitment. They require clients to write down an immediate weight-loss goal and show that goal to as many friends, relatives, and neighbors as possible. Clinic operators report this simple technique frequently works where all else has failed.
 Of course, there’s no need to pay a special clinic in order to engage a visible commitment as an ally. One San Diego woman described to me how she employed a public promise to help herself finally stop smoking. She bought a set of blank business cards and wrote on the back of each, “I promise you I’ll never smoke another cigarette.” She then gave a signed card to “all the people in my life I really wanted to respect me.” Whenever she felt a need to smoke thereafter, she said she’d think of how those people would think less of her if she broke her promise to them. She never had another smoke. These days, behavior-change apps linked to our social networks allow us employ this self-influence technique within a much larger set of friends than a few business cards could reach.[6] See, for example, eBox 7.1.

I just read a newspaper article on how a restaurant owner used public commitments to
solve a big problem of “no-shows” (customers who don’t show up for their table
reservations). I don’t know if he read your book or not first, but he did something that fits
perfectly with the commitment/consistency principle you talk about. He told his
receptionists to stop saying, “Please call us if you change your plans,” and to start asking,
“Will you please call us if you change your plans?” and to wait for a response. His no-show
rate immediately went from 30 percent to 10 percent. That’s a 67 percent drop.

**Author’s note: What was it about this subtle shift that led to such a dramatic**
difference? For me, it was the receptionist’s request for (and pause for) the caller’s
promise. By spurring patrons to make a public commitment, this approach increased the
chance that they would follow through on it. By the way, the astute proprietor was Gordon
Sinclair of Gordon’s restaurant in Chicago. _eBox 7.2 provides the online version of this_
tactic.

**_EBOX 7.2_**

**Author’s note: Today, restaurants are reducing reservation no-shows by asking customers**
to make active and public commitments online before the date of their reservation.
Recently, my doctor’s office began doing the same, with one additional complianceenhancing element. In the confirmation email, I was given a reason by the nurse for my
active, public commitment: “By telling me if you can or cannot make it, you help make
sure that all patients are getting the care they need.” When I inquired about the success of
the online confirmation program, the doctor’s office manager told me it had reduced noshows by 81 percent.

### The Effort Extra

#### The evidence is clear: the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater its ability to influence the attitudes and actions of the person who made it. We can find that evidence in settings as close by as our homes and schools or as far away as remote regions of the world.
 Let’s begin nearer to home with the requirements of many localities for residents to separate their household trash for pro-environmental disposal. These requirements can differ in the effort needed for correct disposal. This is the case in Hangzhou, China, where the steps for proper separation and disposal are more arduous in some sections of the city than in others. After informing residents of the environmental benefits of proper disposal, researchers there wanted to see if residents who had to work harder to live up to environmental standards would become more committed to the environment in general, as shown by also taking the pro-environmental action of reducing their household electricity consumption. That’s what happened. Residents who had to work harder to support the environment via household-waste separation then worked harder to support the environment through electricity conservation. The results are important in indicating that deepening our commitment to a mission, in this case by increasing the effort required to further it, can inspire us to advance the mission in related ways.
 More far-flung illustrations of the power of effortful commitments exist as well. There is a tribe in southern Africa, the Thonga, that requires each of its boys to go through an elaborate initiation ceremony before he can be counted a man. As in many other tribes, a Thonga boy endures a great deal before he is admitted to adult membership in the group. Anthropologists John W. M. Whiting, Richard Kluckhohn, and Albert Anthony described this three-month ordeal in brief but vivid terms:

_When a boy is somewhere between 10 and 16 years of age, he is sent by his parents to_
_“circumcision school,” which is held every 4 or 5 years. Here in company with his age-mates he_
_undergoes severe hazing by the adult males of the society. The initiation begins when each boy_
_runs the gauntlet between two rows of men who beat him with clubs. At the end of this_
_experience he is stripped of his clothes and his hair is cut. He is next met by a man covered with_
_lion manes and is seated upon a stone facing this “lion man.” Someone then strikes him from_
_behind and when he turns his head to see who has struck him, his foreskin is seized and in two_
_movements cut off by the “lion man.” Afterward he is secluded for three months in the “yard of_
_mysteries,” where he can be seen only by the initiated._

-----

_During the course of his initiation, the boy undergoes six major trials: beatings, exposure to_
_cold, thirst, eating of unsavory foods, punishment, and the threat of death. On the slightest_
_pretext, he may be beaten by one of the newly initiated men, who is assigned to the task by the_
_older men of the tribe. He sleeps without covering and suffers bitterly from the winter cold. He_
_is forbidden to drink a drop of water during the whole three months. Meals are often made_
_nauseating by the half-digested grass from the stomach of an antelope, which is poured over his_
_food. If he is caught breaking any important rule governing the ceremony, he is severely_
_punished. For example, in one of these punishments, sticks are placed between the fingers of the_
_offender, then a strong man closes his hand around that of the novice, practically crushing his_
_fingers. He is frightened into submission by being told that in former times boys who had tried_
_to escape or who had revealed the secrets to women or to the uninitiated were hanged and their_
_bodies burned to ashes. (p. 360)_

#### On their face, these rites seem extraordinary and bizarre. Yet they are remarkably similar in principle and even in detail to the common initiation ceremonies of school fraternities. During the traditional “Hell Week” held yearly on college campuses, fraternity pledges must persevere through a variety of activities designed by older members to test the limits of physical exertion, psychological strain, and social embarrassment. At week’s end, the boys who have persisted through the ordeal are accepted for full group membership. Mostly, their tribulations have left them no more than greatly tired and a bit shaky, although sometimes the negative effects are much more serious.
 It is interesting how closely the features of Hell Week tasks match those of tribal initiation rites. Recall that anthropologists identified six major trials to be endured by a Thonga initiate during his stay in the “yard of mysteries.” A scan of newspaper reports shows that each trial also has its place in the hazing rituals of Greek-letter societies:

 Beatings. Fourteen-year-old Michael Kalogris spent three weeks in a Long Island hospital recovering from internal injuries suffered during a Hell Night initiation ceremony of his high school fraternity, Omega Gamma Delta. He had been administered the “atomic bomb” by his prospective brothers, who told him to hold his hands over his head and keep them there while they gathered around to slam fists into his stomach and back simultaneously and repeatedly.

 Exposure to cold. On a winter night, Frederick Bronner, a California community-college student, was taken three thousand feet up and ten miles into the hills of a national forest by his prospective fraternity

#### brothers. Left to find his way home wearing only a thin sweatshirt and slacks, Fat Freddy, as he was called, shivered in a frigid wind until he tumbled down a steep ravine, fracturing bones and injuring his head. Prevented by his injuries from going on, he huddled there against the cold until he died of exposure.

 Thirst. Two Ohio State University freshmen found themselves in the “dungeon” of their prospective fraternity house after breaking the rule requiring all pledges to crawl into the dining area prior to Hell Week meals. Once locked in the house’s storage room, they were given only salty foods to eat for nearly two days. Nothing was provided for drinking purposes except a pair of plastic cups in which they could catch their own urine.

 Eating of unsavory foods. At Kappa Sigma house on the campus of the University of Southern California, the eyes of eleven pledges bulged when they saw the sickening task before them. Eleven quarter- pound slabs of raw liver lay on a tray. Thick-cut and soaked in oil, each was to be swallowed whole, one to a boy. Gagging and choking repeatedly, young Richard Swanson failed three times to down his piece. Determined to succeed, he finally got the oil-soaked meat into his throat, where it lodged and, despite all efforts to remove it, killed him.

 Punishment. In Wisconsin, a pledge who forgot one section of a ritual incantation to be memorized by all initiates was punished for his error. He was required to keep his feet under the rear legs of a folding chair while the heaviest of his fraternity brothers sat down and drank a beer. Although the pledge did not cry out during the punishment, a bone in each foot was broken.

 Threats of death. A pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was taken to a beach area of New Jersey and told to dig his “own grave.” Seconds after he complied with orders to lie flat in the finished hole, the sides collapsed, suffocating him before his prospective fraternity brothers could dig him out.
