Don’t write essays. Tell your reader what your product will do for him or her, and tell it with speci�cs.
 Write your copy in the form of a story, as in the advertisement which carried the headline, ‘The amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the belly of a �sh.’ One of the most famous advertisements ever written was by John Caples for International Correspondence School, under the headline ‘They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano – But When I Started to Play …’.
 I advise you to avoid analogies. Gallup has found that they are widely misunderstood. If you are writing copy for a face cream and say, ‘Just as plants require moisture, so too does your skin’ readers don’t complete the equation. If you show a Rembrandt and say, Just as this Rembrandt portrait is a masterpiece, so too is our product,’ readers think you are selling the Rembrandt.
 Stay away from superlatives like ‘Our product is the best in the world.’ Gallup calls this Brag and Boast. It convinces nobody.
 If you include a testimonial in your copy, you make it more credible. Readers �nd the endorsements of fellow consumers more persuasive than the pu�ery of anonymous copywriters. Says James Webb Young, one of the best copywriters in history, ‘Every type of advertiser has the same problem: to be believed. The mail-order man knows nothing so potent for this purpose as the testimonial, yet the general advertiser seldom uses it.’

###### Sometimes you can cast your entire advertisement in the form of a testimonial. My �rst ad for Austin cars took the form of a letter from an ‘anonymous diplomat’ who was sending his son to Groton with money he had saved driving an Austin. A combination of snobbery and economy. Unfortunately, a Time editor guessed that I was the anonymous diplomat, and asked the headmaster of Groton to comment. I had to send my son to another school.

###### Testimonials from celebrities get high recall scores, but I have stopped using them because readers remember the celebrity and forget the product. What’s more, they assume that the celebrity has been bought, which is usually the case. On the other hand, testimonials from experts can be persuasive – like having an ex- burglar testify that he had never been able to crack a Chubb safe.

_Testimonials from experts can be extremely e�ective. This advertisement by Ogilvy & Mather appeared in Singapore._

###### Most copywriters believe that markdowns and special o�ers are boring, but consumers don’t think so. They are above average in recall.
 Always try to include the price of your products. You may see a necklace in a jeweler’s window, but you don’t consider buying it because the price is not shown and you are too shy to go in and ask. It is the same way with advertisements. When the price of the product is left out, people have a way of turning the page. When Ellerton Jetté retired as head of Hathaway and became a picture dealer, he violated tradition in the art trade by showing the price of the pictures in his advertisements. Unfortunately it is seldom possible for manufacturers to do this in their advertisements, because they cannot dictate prices to retailers. This reduces the

_This two-page advertisement for the World Wildlife Fund appeared in the New York Times. It contains 3,232 words._

###### I believe that all copy should be signed by the agency. This is never done in the United States, on the ground that manufacturers buy space to advertise their products, not their agencies. Short-sighted. My experience suggests that when agencies sign their ads, they produce better ones. When Reader’s Digest asked me to write an advertisement for their magazine (see this page), they speci�ed that I had to sign it. Golly, did I work hard on that ad. Everyone was going to know who wrote it.
 It is now the convention for agencies in Germany and France to sign their ads. The FCB-Impact agency in Paris even gives its copywriters a by-line. Jolly good.

 Short copy or long?

-----

###### All my experience says that for a great many products, long copy sells more than short. I have failed only twice with long copy, once for a popular-priced cigar and once for a premium-priced whiskey. Here are nine examples which were successful:

 1 The late Louis Engel wrote an advertisement of 6,450 words for Merill Lynch. One insertion in the New York Times pulled 10,000 responses – without a coupon.

###### 2 Claude Hopkins wrote an advertisement for Schlitz beer with �ve pages of solid text. In a few months, Schlitz moved from �fth in sales to �rst.

 3 I wrote 700 words for Good Luck margarine. Sales responded.

 4 My �rst ad for Puerto Rico contained 600 words (signed by Beardsley Ruml but written by me). Fourteen thousand readers sent in the coupon, and scores of them built factories in Puerto Rico.

-----

###### 5 A series of newspaper ads for Shell carried 800 words. Twenty-six per cent of men read more than half of them, and Shell’s share of the market reversed a seven-year decline.

 6 My partner Francis X. Houghton wrote an advertisement for US Trust which contained 4,750 words. It was a success.

 7 In advertisements for Ogilvy & Mather, I used 2,500 words. They brought in a lot of new business.

 8 In an advertisement for the World Wildlife Fund, I used 3,232 words.

 9 In a series for Morgan Guaranty, I used 800 words. They did the bank a lot of good.

###### I could give you countless other examples of long copy which has made the cash register ring, notably for Mercedes cars. Not only in the United States, but all over the world.
 I believe, without any research to support me, that advertisements with long copy convey the impression that you have something important to say, whether people read the copy or not.
 After studying the results of advertising for retailers, Dr. Charles Edwards concluded that ‘the more facts you tell, the more you sell.’ An advertisement’s chance for success invariably increases as the

-----

###### number of pertinent merchandise facts included in the advertisement increases.
 Direct-response advertisers know that short copy doesn’t sell. In split-run tests, long copy invariably outsells short copy.
 But I must warn you that if you want your long copy to be read, you had better write it well. In particular, your �rst paragraph should be a grabber. You won’t hold many readers if you begin with a mushy statement of the obvious like this one in an ad for a vacation resort: ‘Going on vacation is a pleasure to which everyone looks forward.’
 A Harvard professor used to begin his series of lectures with a sentence that took his students by the throat: ‘Cesare Borgia murdered his brother-in-law for the love of his sister, who was the mistress of their father – the Pope.’

 How to become a good copywriter It is no bad thing to learn the craft of advertising by copying your elders and betters. Helmut Krone, one of the most innovative of art directors, has said: ‘I asked one of our writers recently what was more important, doing your own thing or making the ad as good as it can be. The answer was, “Doing my own thing”. I disagree violently with that. I’d like to propose a new idea for our age: until you’ve got a better answer, you copy. I copied Bob Gage for 5 years, I even copied the leading between his lines of type. And Bob originally copied Paul Rand, and Rand �rst copied a German typographer named Tschichold.’
 I, too, started by copying. Working in a London agency, I used to copy the best American ads. Later, I began to do my own thing.

 Layouts Advertising su�ers from sporadic epidemics of Artdirectoritis. Those a�icted with this disease speak in hushed voices of ‘cool grey bands of type,’ as if the copy in advertisements was a mere design element. They extol the importance of ‘movement,’ ‘balance’ and other

-----

###### mysterious principles of design. I tell them KISS – an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid.
 In the early days of Ogilvy & Mather I used the same, simple layout for all our advertisements in magazines. (See 86 and 87.) Later, when a competitor accused me of foisting a house-style on all our clients, I invented a second layout which allowed space for more copy. I challenge you to invent a better layout than these.
 Readers look �rst at the illustration, then at the headline, then at the copy. So put these elements in that order – illustration at the top, headline under the illustration, copy under the headline. This follows the normal order of scanning, which is from top to bottom. If you put the headline above the illustration, you are asking people to scan in an order which does not �t their habit.
 On the average, headlines below the illustration are read by 10 per cent more people than headlines above the illustration. You may not think the di�erence worth writing about, but consider the fact that 10 per cent of, say, 20,000,000 readers is two million. Not to be sneezed at. Yet in 59 per cent of magazine advertisements the headlines are above.
 Some dopes even put their headline at the bottom, under the copy!
 More people read the captions under illustrations than read the ’body copy, so never use an illustration without putting a caption under it. Your caption should include the brand name and the promise.

###### Advertising people have an unconscious belief that advertisements have to look like advertisements. They have inherited graphic conventions which telegraph to the reader, ‘This is only an advertisement. Skip it.’
 There is no law which says that advertisements have to look like advertisements. If you make them look like editorial pages, you will attract more readers. Roughly six times as many people read the average article as the average advertisement. Very few

-----

###### advertisements are read by more than one reader in twenty. I conclude that editors communicate better than admen.
 Look at the news magazines which have been successful in attracting readers: Time and Newsweek in the United States, L’Express and Le Point in France, Der Spiegel in Germany, L’Espresso in Italy, Cambio 16 in Spain. They all use the same graphics:

 Copy has priority over illustration.

 The copy is set in serif type.

 Three columns of type, 35 to 45 characters wide.

 Every photograph has a caption.

 The copy starts with drop-initials.

 The type is set black on white.

_Pierre Lemonnier and Philippe Saalburg at the FCB-IMPACT agency in Paris pinched my ‘editorial’ layouts and improved_

_them. Their ads don’t look like ads._

-----

_All news magazines use the same format. Copy has priority over illustration. Three columns of type, set in serif faces._
_Captions under photographs. But the advertisements in these magazines do not follow any of these conventions, so very few_

_people read them. Next time you construct an ad, pretend you are an editor; you will get more readership._

###### Now look at the advertisements in the same magazines. You will see that:

 Illustrations are given priority over copy.

 The copy is often set in sanserif, which is hard to read; we are accustomed to serifs in books, magazines and newspapers.

-----

###### The copy is often set in one column of 120 characters or more – too wide to be readable.

 Few of the photographs have captions, because the art directors are not aware that four times as many people read captions as read body copy.

 There are very few drop-initials, because the art directors are not aware that they increase readership.

 The copy is frequently set in reverse – white on black. I have even seen coupons in reverse; you cannot �ll them out unless you have white ink in the house.

_Only use two-page spreads when you have a long product and need to show it horizontally, as with this hammer. If you swear_

_o� the self-indulgence of spreads, you will be able to buy twice as many ads, thereby doubling your reach or your frequency._

###### If you pretend you are an editor, you will get better results. When the magazine insists that you slug your ads with the word advertisement, set it in italic caps, in reverse. Then nobody can read it.
 The FCB-Impact agency in Paris consistently produces better magazine advertisements than any other agency, and none of them

###### look like advertisements. Hats o� to Pierre Lemonnier, the copywriter who is Impact, and Philippe Saalburg who was his art director for many years. They pinched my techniques and improved them.
 If you abandon the conventional graphics of advertisements and adopt editorial graphics, your campaigns will become islands of good taste in an ocean of vulgarity.

 Layouts are often pinned up on bulletin boards at meetings and approved at a distance of 15 feet, as if they were posters. This leads to setting headlines in 72-point, which is impossible to read at the normal distance of 20 inches.

-----

_Editorial graphics also work well in newspapers. I made this launch ad for Guinness look like the front page of a newspaper._

###### Are two-page spreads worth the cost? They cost twice as much as single pages, but seldom get twice the readership, or pull twice as many coupons.

-----

_This looks like an editorial page in the French newspaper Le Monde. Actually it is an advertisement on behalf of French sheep_

_farmers who opposed the importation of duty-free mutton from England._

-----

_This front-page format is particularly appropriate for the announcement of a new product._

-----

_A superb example of FCB-Impact’s editorial style, this time for Mumm champagne._

###### Occasionally there is a functional reason for using a double- spread, as when your product is a long one and has to be shown horizontally. But nine times out of ten, double-spreads are no more than self-indulgence by an art director who wants his advertisements to look big and juicy. If you swear o� double- spreads, you will be able to run twice as many advertisements for the same money, thereby doubling your reach or your frequency.[1]

 Posters For better or worse, posters are still with us, so I had better tell you what little is known about designing them to maximum e�ect. There has been little or no research on the subject.

-----

_One in a series of posters that appeared in England during the thirties. They made Guinness part of the warp and woof of_

_English life, and have never been excelled – anywhere._

###### It pays to make your poster what Savignac called a ‘visual scandal.’ But don’t overdo the scandal or you will stop the tra�c and cause fatal accidents.
 Your poster should deliver your selling promise not only in words, but also pictorially. Use the largest possible type. Make your brand name visible at a long distance. Use strong, pure colors. Never use more than three elements in your design.
 If you know more than that, please tell me.

_It pays to make your poster a ‘visual scandal’, as in this British example for FCO Univas._

###### Subway cards If it falls to you to produce advertisements for the subway, it may help to know that the average rider in the New York subway will be exposed to your advertisement for 21 minutes, which is long enough to read quite a long message. Only 15 per cent of passengers carry anything to read. The other 85 per cent have nothing to do but read your copy.

 Trademarks are an anachronism In olden days, before people could read, manufacturers used trademarks to identify their brands. If you saw a tiger on a bottle of beer, you knew it was Tiger beer.
 Many companies, unaware that consumers are no longer illiterate, still use graphic symbols to identify their brands, and insist on them being displayed in their advertisements. They add to the gadgetry
