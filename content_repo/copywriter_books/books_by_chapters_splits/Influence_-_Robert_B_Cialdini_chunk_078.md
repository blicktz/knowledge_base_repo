In this latter respect, Milgram first began his investigations in an attempt to understand how the
German citizenry could have participated in the concentration-camp destruction of millions of
innocents during the years of Nazi ascendancy. After testing his experimental procedures in the
United States, he had planned to take them to Germany, a country whose populace he was sure would
provide enough obedience for a full-blown scientific analysis of the concept. The first eye-opening
experiment in New Haven, Connecticut, however, made it clear that he could save his money and
stay close to home. “I found so much obedience,” he said, “I hardly saw the need of taking the
experiment to Germany.” But Americans have no monopoly on the need to obey authority. When
Milgram’s basic procedure was eventually repeated elsewhere (South Africa, the Netherlands,
Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Australia, India, and Jordan), the results were on average similar (see
Blass, 2012; and Meeus & Raaijmakers, 1986, for reviews).

The decades-long Milgram saga has something of a detective-story ending. The journalist Gina
Perry was able to get access to the archive at Yale University where Milgram’s papers are kept and
where she discovered the procedures and findings of a study he never published. In it, each Teacher
was instructed to deliver a shock to a Learner whom he thought was a friend or neighbor. Compliance
with the experimenter’s orders was drastically different as a consequence. Compared to the 65
percent of subjects who typically obeyed the experimenter to the end in Milgram’s paradigm, only 15
percent did so under these circumstances. This outcome fits well with evidence we’ll see in chapter 8
that compared to strangers or mere acquaintances, people are massively more likely to take the side
of individuals with whom they feel a sense of unity, such as friends, neighbors, or kin. In addition to
Perry’s book-length account (2012), Rochat & Blass (2014) have authored an academic article
describing Milgram’s “secreted study.”
3. The alarming statistics regarding the frequency and impact of medical errors come from
analyses by Szabo (2007), Makary & Daniel (2016), and Wears & Sutcliffe (2020), respectively.
Regrettably, the situation hasn’t improved since “To Err Is Human,” the first report on the magnitude
of medical error in the United States by the Institute of Medicine over two decades ago. As the
researcher Kathleen Sutcliffe (2019) points out, much of the problem is attributable not to how the
human body works but, rather, to how human psychology works.
4. The research showing the physical “growth” of classroom lecturers, politicians, and task
participants based on their perceived status was conducted by Wilson (1968), Higham & Carment
(1992), Sorokowski (2010), and Duguid & Goncalo (2012). Additionally, politicians who are taller
than their opponents typically receive more votes (McCann, 2001). For instance, since 1900, the US
presidency has been won by the taller of the major-party candidates in nearly 90 percent of the
elections. So, in people’s minds, status doesn’t just increase height; height increases status as well.
Additional data collected in the Hofling et al. (1966) study of nurses suggest that nurses may not be
conscious of the extent to which the title “doctor” sways their judgments and actions. A separate
group of 33 nurses and student nurses was asked what they would have done in the experimental

-----

situation. Contrary to the actual findings, only two predicted they would have given the medication
as ordered.

More complete treatments of how hackers use psychology to breach elaborate security
protections are available. One benefits from the coauthorship of Keven Mitnick, the acknowledged
king of security hackers (Sagarin & Mitnick, 2012). The other offers a thoroughgoing, book-length
description (Hadnagy & Schulman, 2020).
5. The studies of the compliance-enhancing effects of an authoritative uniform were done by
Bickman (1974) and Bushman (1988); in a related update, Smith, Chandler, & Schwarz (2020) found
that people who receive poor service from a company’s employee are more likely to blame the
organization rather than the employee if the employee was wearing a uniform while providing the
service. The jaywalking study was done by Lefkowitz, Blake, & Mouton (1955); Doob & Gross
(1968) performed the prestige-versus–economy car experiment. Nelissen & Meijers (2011) collected
the data showing the positive impact of prestige clothing on survey participation, charity donations,
and job-interview ratings, whereas Oh, Shafir, & Todorov (2020) conducted the research showing the
practically instantaneous assignment of competence to wearers of higher-versus lower-quality
clothing. These last authors commented on a troubling aspect of their results—individuals from
poorer economic backgrounds who are unable to afford expensive clothing are put at definite,
automatically occurring disadvantage in employment interviews.
6. Michel Strauss’s account comes from his book, _Pictures, Passion, and Eye (2011). For a_
thoroughgoing treatment of the increasingly valued role of the expert in modern life, see Stehr &
Grundmann (2011). The research on the “halo effect” of expertise in a therapist’s office is attributable
to Devlin et al. (2009), whereas the large impact of a single Op-Ed piece by an expert on readers’
opinions was documented by Coppock, Ekins, & Kirby (2018), who showed this effect for both
ordinary readers and professional “elites,” such as think-tank scholars, journalists, bankers, law
professors, congressional staffers, and academics. The willingness to follow those who appear to
know what they are doing starts young, showing itself in preschoolers (Keil, 2012) and infants
(Poulin-Dubois, Brooker, & Polonia, 2011).

For confirmation that both expertise and trustworthiness lead to perceived credibility and
dramatically greater influence, see Smith, De Houwer, & Nosek (2013). The effectiveness in legal
contexts of the “be the one to disclose a weakness” tactic has been demonstrated repeatedly (e.g.,
Dolnik, Case, & Williams, 2003; Stanchi, 2008; Williams, Bourgeois, & Croyle, 1993); the same
tactic has proved effective for corporations that revealed negative information about themselves
(Fennis & Stroebe, 2014). The information that politicians can increase their trustworthiness as well
as their vote-worthiness by seemingly arguing against self-interest was provided by Cavazza (2016)
and Combs & Keller (2010); a related effect in the political arena is that politicians who frame a
message in negative terms (“15% are unemployed”) versus positive terms (“85% are employed”) are
more persuasive with it because they are viewed as more trustworthy (Koch & Peter, 2017). The
advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (now DDB) was the first to produce hugely successful ads
admitting to a weakness that was then countered by a strength, such as the “Ugly is only skin deep”
and “It’s ugly but it gets you there” ads for the early Volkswagen Beetle, as well as the gamechanging “We’re #2. We try harder” campaign for Avis Rent A Car. Since then, similarly worded
promotions for products, such as Buckley’s cough syrup (“It Tastes Awful. And It Works”), have also
been highly effective. Ward & Brenner (2006) confirmed that an acknowledge-a-negative strategy is
effective only when the negative occurs first.
7. The team that successfully trained people to disregard ads featuring bogus experts—by
recognizing their vulnerability to such experts and distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant
expertise—was led by my colleague Brad Sagarin (Sagarin et al., 2002). The tendency to resonate
with the appeals of experts who seem impartial and resist the appeals of experts who have something
to gain from our compliance has been demonstrated around the world (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken,

-----

1978; McGuinnies & Ward, 1980; Van Overwalle & Heylighen, 2006) and in young children (Mills
& Keil, 2005).

#### Chapter 6: Scarcity
1. Research into the psychological primacy of loss as demonstrated in a university cafeteria (West,
1975), multiple countries (Cortijos-Bernabeu et al., 2020), multiple domains (Hobfoll, 2001; SokolHessner & Rutledge, 2019; Thaler et al., 1997; Walker et al., 2018), managerial decisions (Shelley,
1994), professional golfers’ efforts (Pope & Schweitzer, 2011), college students’ emotions (Ketelaar,
1995), energy-provider preferences (Shotton, 2018), task performers’ cheating choices (Effron,
Bryan, & Murnighan, 2015; Kern & Chung, 2009; Pettit et al., 2016), and individuals’ physical
reactions (Sheng et al., 2020; see Yechiam & Hochman, 2012, for a review) demonstrates the
widespread applicability of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Evidence from a variety
of contexts indicates that loss aversion is particularly strong when risk and/or uncertainty are great
(De Dreu & McCusker, 1997; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Walker et al., 2018; Weller et al.,
2007), including the health/medical context (Gerend & Maner, 2011; Meyerwitz & Chaiken, 1987;
Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Rothman et al., 1999). When risk and uncertainty are low, however, a
promotive (rather than protective) orientation becomes dominant, and people value gains over losses
(Grant Halvorson & Higgins, 2013; Higgins, 2012; Higgins, Shah, & Friedman, 1997; Lee & Aaker,
2004). The influence of scarcity on the judgments of new car buyers and fair-price judges can be seen
in the findings of Balancher, Liu, & Stock (2009) and Park, Lalwani, & Silvera (2020), respectively.
2. The results of several experiments show that consumers are strongly attracted to products and
experiences that possess unique elements (Burger & Caldwell, 2011; Keinan & Kivetz, 2011; Reich,
Kupor, & Smith, 2018). The evidence that after a scarce item has been restored to good supply,
people lose attraction for it comes from Schwarz (1984). A related point—that a rare object we think
we like for its inherent qualities may surprise us and lose its appeal once it loses its scarcity—is made
persuasively in a Reader’s Report I received from a Minneapolis woman: “Although I am from the
U.S., I always loved putting together jigsaw puzzles of London’s Big Ben. They were rare finds in
the U.S. and exciting when I came across one. But, once eBay came along and I could search for
these puzzles on eBay, I started to find a lot of them and buying each one. I lost interest in them after
that. Your book helped me realize that the scarcity of the Big Ben puzzles was more of the reason I
wanted them than my fascination with Big Ben. At that point, after 23 years of loving to put together
Big Ben puzzles, I had no more desire to put together another one, once I could find many of them.”
3. For the research showing that people assign greater worth to entities that are difficult to obtain
and that they are normally correct in this presumption, see Lynn (1989) and McKenzie & Chase
(2010). So ingrained is the belief that what’s scarce is valuable that we have come to believe that if
something is valuable, it must be scarce (Dai, Wertenbroch, & Brendel, 2008). Jack Brehm
formulated reactance theory in the mid-1960s (J. W. Brehm, 1966), and subsequent work has
provided considerable support for it (e.g., Burgoon et al., 2002; Bushman, 2006; Dillard, Kim, & Li,
2018; Koch & Peter, 2017; Koch & Zerback, 2013; Miller et al., 2006; Schumpe, Belanger, & Nisa,
2020; Zhang et al., 2011). The study revealing reactant tendencies toward physical barriers in twoyear-old boys was performed by S. S. Brehm & Weintraub (1977). Two-year-old girls in their study
did not show the same resistant response to the large barrier as did the boys. Another study suggested
this to be the case not because girls don’t oppose attempts to limit their freedoms. Instead, it appears
that they are primarily reactant to restrictions that come from other persons rather than from physical
obstacles (S. S. Brehm, 1981). For both sexes, however, children come to see themselves as separate
individuals at around eighteen to twenty-four months of age, when they first recognize their
“cognitive self” (Southgate, 2020; Howe, 2003).

Driscoll, Davis, & Lipetz (1972) performed the initial work identifying the Romeo and Juliet
effect. The occurrence of the Romeo and Juliet effect should not be interpreted as a warning to

-----

parents to be always accepting of their teenagers’ romantic choices. New players at this delicate
game are likely to err often and, consequently, would benefit from the direction of an adult with
greater perspective and experience. In providing such direction, parents should recognize that
teenagers, who see themselves as young adults, will not respond well to control attempts that are
typical of parent–child relationships. Especially in the adult arena of mating, adult tools of influence
(preference and persuasion) will be more effective than traditional forms of parental control
(prohibitions and punishments). Although the experience of the Montague and Capulet families is an
extreme example, heavy-handed restrictions on a young romantic alliance may well turn it
clandestine, torrid, and sad.

The reach of reactance into supermarket shoppers’ petition-signing decisions was identified by
Heilman (1976). Moore & Pierce (2016) collected the data indicating that officials were more likely
to punish rule violators on their birthdays and especially when the birthday was made salient; among
the researchers’ six studies of the phenomenon, one examined 134,000 drunk-driving arrests in
Washington State and found that police officers penalized drivers more harshly on the offender’s
birthday. The investigation of the effects of a ban on phosphate detergents was done by Michael
Mazis and colleagues (Mazis, 1975; Mazis, Settle, & Leslie, 1973), whereas early research on banned
information was done by a wider range of researchers (Ashmore, Ramchandra, & Jones, 1971;
Lieberman & Arndt, 2000; Wicklund & Brehm, 1974; Worchel, 1992; Worchel & Arnold, 1973;
Worchel, Arnold, & Baker, 1975; Zellinger et al., 1974). The study of the effects of commodity
scarcity plus information exclusivity was done as a doctoral dissertation by Amram Knishinsky
(1982); for ethical reasons, the information provided to the customers was always true—there was an
impending foreign-beef shortage, and this news had indeed come to the company through its
exclusive sources.
4. See research by Thomas Koch (Koch & Peter, 2017; Koch & Zerback, 2013) for evidence that
the perceived intent to persuade generates reactance and the resultant reactance weakens message
effectiveness. Nicolas Guéguen and his colleagues are responsible for developing and testing the
“But you are free” technique (Guéguen et al., 2013; Guéguen & Pascual, 2000). The meta-analysis of
forty-two experiments was performed by Carpenter (2013). More recently, Guéguen has constructed
another reactance-based compliance tactic. Rather than reducing reactance against saying _yes to a_
request via words such as “But, you are free to refuse,” he builds reactance against saying no with the
words “You’ll probably refuse, but . . .” Adding “You will probably refuse but” to a request for
donations to a children’s health-care organization increased the percentage of donors in one study
from 25 percent to 39 percent (Guéguen, 2016).
5. Worchel, Lee, & Adewole (1975) are to be credited with the famous chocolate-chip-cookie
study. For marketing-oriented descriptions of the New Coke, story see Benjamin (2015) and C. Klein
(2020); for an academic account based on scarcity and reactance, see Ringold (1988).

The work identifying reimposed deprivation as an initiating factor in political revolutions can be
found in Davies (1962, 1969) and Fleming (1997); Lance Morrow’s commentary (1991) on how the
people of the Soviet Union staged a coup against a coup still stands up to the test of history. Studies
demonstrating that the inconsistent granting of freedoms by parents leads to generally rebellious
children were done by Lytton (1979) and O’Leary (1995). To avoid this last form of insurgency,
parents needn’t be severe or unduly rigid rule-keepers. For example, a child who unavoidably misses
lunch can be given a before-dinner snack because this would not violate the normal rule against such
snacks and, consequently, would not establish a general freedom. The difficulty comes when the
child is capriciously allowed a treat on some days but not on others and can see no good reason for
the difference. It is this arbitrary approach that can build perceived freedoms and provoke
insurrection.
6. Advertisers employ limited offers in their messages in either limited-number or limited-time
form. By far, limited-time offers are the more frequent—in one study of 13,594 newspaper ads,
nearly three times as often (Howard, Shu, & Kerin, 2007). Yet research indicates that if they had the

-----

choice, advertisers would be better off using limited-number offers, which are superior in outcome—
because only limited-number arrangements include the (potentially crazy-making) factor of
interpersonal competition (Aggarwal, Jun, & Huh, 2011; Häubl & Popkowski Leszczyc, 2019;
Teuscher, 2005).
7. The idea that in situations with new romantic opportunities, individuals seek to differentiate
themselves has been validated in studies of animals (Miller, 2000) and humans (Griskevicius,
Cialdini, & Kenrick, 2006). In the latter research, when placed in a romantic state of mind, college
students displayed significantly more creativity. The effect among humans is hardly restricted to
college students. For example, each of Pablo Picasso’s highly generative artistic periods (Blue, Rose,
Cubist, and Surrealist) reveals a constant. As Griskevicius and colleagues state, “Each new epoch
blossoms with paintings of a new woman—not a sitter or model, but a lover—each of whom is
touted to have served Picasso as an incandescent, albeit temporary, muse (Crespelle, 1969;
MacGregor-Hastie, 1988).” The research on the ad for the San Francisco Museum of Art was also led
by my colleague, Vladas Griskevicius (Griskevicius et al., 2009). The claim that, in matters of
opinion, people like to be in the majority but, in matters of taste, they do not is supported by Spears,
Ellemers, & Doosje (2009). See Chan, Berger, & Van Boven (2012) for a full description of the
research showing how in-group members balance the desire to conform to group taste preferences
with the desire to express their individuality. The best reporting of General Shinseki’s rationale for
his decision to provide black berets to the great majority all US Army personnel, as well as of the
problem it produced and his resolution of it come from the official US Military newspaper, Stars and
_Stripes, October 20, 2000._
8. Data documenting the emotional arousal and narrowed focus that accompanies limitations are
compelling (Shah et al., 2015; Zhu & Ratner, 2015; Zhu, Yang, & Hsee, 2018). Usually marketing
schemes that use deceptive restrictions of a product (via “manufactured scarcity”) are kept hidden
(www.wired.com/2007/11/best-buy-lying; www.nbcnews.com/technolog/dont-blame-santa-xboxplaystation-supply-probably-wont-meet-demand-6C10765763), but Kellogg’s chose to publicize one
such scheme as evidence of the value of their Rice Krispies Treats (www.youtube.com/watch?
v=LKc0Gtt91Js).
