### On the contrary, I invite you to stop by. You may enjoy reading and downloading the free articles I’ve posted. And I’d be pleased and happy if you bought any of my books there (though you would not be buying them directly from me—our publication page links to Amazon.com, from which we get a 15 percent commission on every book it sells through our site).
 And what if you’re a small entrepreneur and need professional marketing help? Just click on “Vendors.” You’ll find a list of folks who can help you with everything from Web design to mailing lists. But do me a favor. When you call them, tell them Bob Bly sent you. They’re busy, too, and it helps if they know you’re a qualified referral.
 Another problem with offers of unsolicited advice on how to improve your Web site is that the caller has little or no idea of your metrics: the factors by which you measure results and the numbers you are currently getting. This is like an interior decorator giving clients advice on how to decorate their homes without having even seen the house. Absurd, right?

 SEO COPYWRITING

 The growing usage of Google has given rise to a new discipline: SEO (search engine optimization) copywriting.
 When writing online copy, you have to consider not only how the reader will react to the copy, but also whether the words you use will attract search engines to your site and increase your rankings within these search engines and directories.
 Google ranks traditional Web sites, in which the content is broken up into many individual pages, higher than landing pages and single-page Web sites. Traditional sites typically have a separate page on each of the products and services the company offers. Each page is optimized for keywords related to the subject matter of the page. For instance, if one page of an exercise equipment manufacturer’s site advertises its ab machine, what keywords do you think prospects for ab machines would use to search the Web for the product? Possibilities might include abs, ab machines, ab exercisers, and six-pack.

### There are many online tools to help you search for the most relevant keywords for your Web pages. They include Soovle, Jaaxy, Ahrefs Keywords Explorer, SEOCockpit, and the Google Search Console.
 Each page of your site should be optimized for two or three keyword phrases. Use the most important keyword in the page headline, preferably as the first word in the headline, and then judiciously within the page’s body copy. When possible, link these keywords to other pages on your site that contain additional content on that topic.
 Using keywords in meta tags also helps optimize your pages for search engines. Meta tags are not visible in the Web site copy your visitors see. Rather, the meta tags are embedded in the HTML code supporting each page.
 When people Google your pages’ keywords, meta tags help the search engine find your page. The two most important meta tags are the meta descriptions and the title tags. The meta description helps Google find the Web page.
 When you search a keyword and find the page, the meta description text from that page is usually displayed on the Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP). It gives a concise description of the page contents, not to exceed 158 characters. The keyword should appear at the beginning of the meta description.
 The title tag is an HTML title for the page, no longer than sixty characters. Again, the keywords should be at the beginning of the meta tag. The main title is given the designation H1 in the HTML coding for the Web page.
 You may think that cramming the keywords into Web page copy and meta tags as many times as possible would improve SEO. But using too many keywords in your Web copy and tags, a practice known as “keyword stuffing,” can backfire. Keyword stuffing can result in your page being ignored by the search engine algorithms or, in some cases, your page and site will be penalized. Worse still, keyword stuffing can makes pages read strangely and awkwardly to human visitors.
 Using keywords too often on a page and in the meta-tags is worse than not using them at all. The frequency of keywords on a page has nothing to

### do with whether a spider will find the page. And if a spider finds the page, it doesn’t need a keyword repeated frequently in order to find it.
 The more the keywords reflect what the user is searching for, the better the SEO results will be. Use descriptive keyword phrases of two to four words, not a single word; i.e. “Boston cosmetic dentists” instead of just “dentists.”
 Work the keyword phrases naturally into the body copy, so the writing sounds smooth and not stilted. Instead of “modern technologies,” for instance, use “modern cosmetic dentistry technologies.”

## WRITING LANDING PAGES

### A “landing page” is a dedicated Web page that allows site visitors to proactively contact you online. The landing page is designed to capture some information about the visitor such as e-mail address and name.
 “Conversion” means taking that click and moving it forward to the next step in the sales funnel. Some of the many objectives for which you can use landing pages include:

 Opt-in to your e-list. Subscribe to your newsletter. Download a white paper or other content. Fill out online forms. Purchase products online using PayPal or credit cards.

 A “call to action” (CTA) tells visitors to take a specific action (e.g., register for a webinar) and includes the instructions needed to take that action (e.g., filling out and submitting a form on a webinar registration to sign up for the event).
 There’s lots of buzz about blogging, viral marketing, social networking, and other new methods of generating eyeballs (people viewing your pages) and traffic online. But all that traffic won’t make you any money unless you can convert those unique visitors to leads or customers.
 That’s where your landing pages come in. Landing page performance is measured as conversion. Specifically, of the people who click onto the

-----

### page, how many take the action you want them to take? If a hundred people click onto your page and five buy your widget, the conversion rate is 5 percent.
 According to an article in PR Daily, businesses with ten to fifteen landing pages increase leads by 55 percent, and those with more than forty landing pages get twelve times as many leads as companies with five or fewer landing pages.[1]

 10 TIPS FOR INCREASING LANDING PAGE CONVERSION RATES

 Depending on whether you are selling a product directly from your landing page, asking visitors to download a free white paper, or promoting a webinar or demonstration, conversion rates can range from as low as 1 percent or less to as much as 50 percent or more. Here are ten keys to writing landing pages that maximize online conversion rates:
 1—Build credibility early. People have always been skeptical of advertising, and with the proliferation of spam and shady operators, they are even more skeptical of what they read online. Therefore, your landing page copy must immediately overcome that skepticism. One way to do that is to make sure one or more “credibility builders” is clearly displayed on the first screen the visitor sees. In the banner at the top of the page, use your logo and company name if you are well known; universities, associations, and other institutions can place their official seal in the upper left of the screen. Within or immediately under the banner, above the headline, put a strong testimonial or three. Consider adding a pre-head or subhead that summarizes the company’s mission statement or credentials.
 2—Capture the e-mail addresses of non-buyers. There are a number of mechanisms available for capturing the e-mail addresses of visitors who click on your landing page but do not buy the product.
 One is to use a window with copy offering a free report or e-course in exchange for submitting an e-mail address. This window can be served to the visitor as a pop-up (it appears when the visitor arrives at the landing page) or a pop-under (a window that appears when the visitor attempts to

-----

### leave the landing page without making an inquiry or purchase). The negative is that both the pop-up and the pop-under are often blocked.
 A “floater” is a window that slides onto the screen from the side or top. Unlike the pop-up and pop-under, the floater is part of the Web site HTML code, so it is not stopped by the pop-up blocker.
 3—Use lots of testimonials. Testimonials build credibility and overcome skepticism, as do case studies and white papers posted on the Web site. If you invite customers to a live event, ask if they would be willing to give you a brief testimonial recorded on video.
 Have a professional videographer tape it, get a signed release from the customer, and post the testimonial on your Web site as streaming video. Require the customer to click a button to hear the testimonial, rather than have the video play automatically when the visitor clicks on the page.
 For written testimonials, customers may suggest that you write what you want them to say and just run it by them for approval. Politely ask that they give you their opinion of your product in their own words instead of having you do it. What they come up with will likely be more specific, believable, and detailed than your version, which might smack of puffery and promotion.
 4—Use lots of bullets. Highlight key features and benefits in a list of short, easy-to-read, bulleted items. I often use a format where the first part of the bullet is the feature, and after a dash comes the benefit (e.g., ““Quick-release adhesive system—your vehicle graphics stay clean and don’t stick together”).
 Online buyers like to think they are getting a lot for their money, so when selling a product directly from your landing page, be sure all major features and important benefits are covered in a comprehensive bullet list appearing on your landing page.
 When generating leads by giving away white papers, you don’t need a huge list of bulleted features and benefits. But using bullets to describe the contents of the paper and the benefits that information delivers can raise conversion rates for download requests.
 5—Arouse curiosity in the headline. The headline should either arouse curiosity, make a powerful promise, or otherwise grab the reader’s attention

### so he has no choice but to keep reading. The headline for a landing page selling a training program on how to become a professional property locator makes a big promise: “Become a Property Locator Today—and Make $100,000 a Year in the Greatest Real Estate Career That Only a Few Insiders Know About.”
 6—Use a conversational copy style. Most corporate Web sites are unemotional and sterile: just “information.” But a landing page is a letter from one human being to another. Make it sound that way. Even if your product is highly technical and you are selling it to techies, remember that they are still human beings, and you cannot sell something by boring people to death.
 7—Incorporate an emotional hook in the headline and lead paragraph. Logical selling can work, but tapping in to the prospect’s emotions is much stronger—especially when you correctly assess how the prospect is feeling about your product or the problem it solves right now.
 Another effective tactic for lead-generation landing pages is to stress your free offer in the headline and lead. Example: Kaydon’s landing page shows a picture of its catalog with the bold heading above it reading, “FREE Ceramic Bearings Product Selection Guide.”
 8—Solve the reader’s problem. Once you hook the reader with emotional copy dramatizing her problem or a powerful free offer, show how your product—or your free information—can help solve her problem.
 For example: “Now there is a better, easier, and more effective solution to wobbly restaurant tables that can irritate customers and ruin their dining experience: Table Shox, the world’s smallest shock absorber.”
 To maximize landing page conversion rates, you have to convince the visitor that the quickest route to solving his problem is taking the action indicated on the landing page, and not—as you might be tempted to let him do—surfing your site.
 That’s why landing pages should have no navigation, so the reader’s only choice is to respond or not respond; there’s no menu of click buttons and hyperlinks to other interesting pages to distract him.
 9—Make it timely and current. The more your online copy ties in with current events and news, the higher your response rates. This is especially

-----

### critical when selling financial and investment information, as well as regulatory compliance products in fields where laws and rules change frequently. Periodically update your landing page copy to reflect current business and economic conditions, challenges, and trends. This shows your visitor that your company is current with and on top of what’s happening in your industry today.
 10—Stress the money-back guarantee or lack of obligation on the part of the user who performs your call to action. If you allow customers to order products directly from the landing page, make sure you have a money-back guarantee clearly stated on that page.
 If you are generating leads, stress that your offer—which might be a white paper, online demonstration, or webinar—is free. Say that there is no obligation to buy something.

 ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE LANDING PAGES[2]

 In your landing page headline, engage the target prospect by promising a big and compelling benefit. The marketer in whose voice the sales copy has been written should be clearly identified and her credentials as an expert in the topic presented. The sales letter should tell an engaging story that moves the user to buy. Prove all sales claims with specifics (e.g., facts, figures, diagrams, testimonials). The page layout is uncluttered and easy to follow. The primary response mechanism is for the visitor to click a “call to action” button that links to your shopping cart or other transactional page (e.g., a form for downloading a free e-book). CTA buttons should be big, bold, and colorful. You can also enable readers to click through to the order or download page by hyperlinking a keyword or phrase in the sales letter copy to that transaction page; the hyperlinked word or phrase is typically blue and underlined.

-----

### In addition to the CTA buttons and hyperlinked keywords and phrases, you can add a toll-free number for phone response. The copy, content, and references must be accurate and up to date. Having outdated content on the page causes you to lose credibility with many of your visitors. The graphics make the sales copy easy to read. Conversely, avoid graphics that make copy difficult to read, as much as your Web designer might like it (e.g., lack of color contrast between the type and background screen).

 SEVEN WAYS TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO YOUR LANDING PAGES

 1. Search Engines

 Google, the world’s largest search engine, facilitates 5.5 billion Web searches per day for its users. As an advertiser, you can buy preference in Google’s search engine, based on keyword, on a cost-per-click basis.
 It could cost you as little as a dime a click or more than a dollar a click, depending on the popularity of the keyword you want to buy. If the cost of the keyword is 30 cents per click, and 100 people click on your site that day as a result of a Google search on the keyword you bought, Google charges you $30. Google lets you put a limit on how much you spend per day, so the cost can fit any budget.

 2. Affiliate Marketing

 Find Web sites that cater to the same market you do. Arrange for them to feature your products on their site and in their e-mails. Online ads, e-mail blurbs, and Web pages talking about your product link to your site where the user can purchase the product under discussion. The affiliate receives a percentage of the sale ranging from 15 to 50 percent. To recruit affiliates or make money being an affiliate for other marketers, visit www.affiliatesdirectory.com.
 Amazon.com runs one of the largest affiliate programs, enabling you to feature books on your site that are related to your topic and of interest to

-----

### your audience; when users click on the book page, they are automatically linked to www.amazon.com, where they can buy the book online. It’s a service for your visitors, and you earn a small commission on each sale.

 3. Co-registration

 In co-registration marketing, the user who visits a Web site is served a pop- up window containing a number of special offers; most frequently these are subscriptions to free e-zines. By arranging to have your e-zine or another offer featured in these co-registration pop-ups, you can capture many new names for your online database at a relatively low cost compared to traditional e-mail marketing.
 There are a number of companies that can find such co-registration deals for you. One of these is Tiburon Media Group, http://www.tiburonmedia.com/coreg. Another is Opt Intelligence, http://www.opt-intelligence.com/.

 4. Banner Ads

 Banner ads can work but should be tested conservatively and cautiously, and don’t get your hopes of a breakthrough up too high. Banner ads usually supplement other traffic generation methods, and are only occasionally a primary source of unique visits. Exceptions? Of course.

 5. E-mail Marketing
