##### Then I go into the next block of copy and explain why and how the game is different, how to play it and some of the unique features made possible by the computerized electronics.
 Logically, a reader who had read this far would want to know a little more about how the game was constructed, the quality of the product and the many new features. Therefore, the next block of copy has this information.
 Okay, you are really interested in purchasing this game. But you say to yourself, “How can I justify it? I’d love to get this Fireball game. Emotionally I’m hooked, but how can I justify purchasing it?”
 So the next block should justify the purchase. I used cost comparisons with what you pay for a TV set, pool table or your stereo system. I plant the seed about its practicality when guests pop in and how Fireball will be the hit of any party or family gathering. It’s here that I’m giving the prospects the logic they need to make that emotional purchase. I even suggest that a business might purchase one as a way to entertain employees at work and claim it as an investment tax credit and depreciation expense—all tax- saving measures. I knew I had to provide all the logic possible for this $650 purchase.
 By now the customer is saying to himself, “Okay, I want to get the unit and I can justify the purchase, but what if I use it, get tired of it and it sits in the corner like that exercise device that’s gathering dust?”
 So I go into the fact that it has lasting play value. And I describe several reasons why people won’t get tired of it.
 The customer is now thinking to himself, “Hmm. I like the product, I can justify it and I can see that it will have lasting play value, but what if I buy this big pinball game and suddenly the computer poops out?” I then raise the service question in the ad copy and answer it. The point of each of these blocks of copy is that they are logically placed as if to anticipate the next question a prospect is going to ask—all in an environment that you have created and all flowing logically to the last part of the ad when you ask for the order.

# Flowing in a Logical Sequence

##### When you work with copy long enough, the flow is automatic. You don’t need to do flowcharts, as you can instinctively sense the next question and answer it. And that is the special skill that a good direct response copywriter has over a one-on-one salesperson. We sense the questions, answer them— and we do it on a mass scale.
 You still might find it helpful to create a block diagram of your ad after you’ve written it to see if it flows properly and raises the right question at the right time. How do you want to sequence your questions in your copy? What kind of environment do you want to weave through the early part of the text? What are some of the questions you would surely be asked about the product if you were a salesperson and you were selling the product face- to-face?
 It’s really all common sense. Looking at your copy as it flows out onto a computer screen or onto a piece of paper is the mechanical part of this process but not the important part. It’s the common sense you use to anticipate the sequence of what will be asked next and how your copy should flow that really counts at this stage of the copywriting process. This brings up my next axiom.

 Axiom 13

**_The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your_**
**_prospect’s questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face._**

##### By now you understand the basic concepts of good direct-marketing copywriting. You understand the importance of becoming an expert on the product you are going to write about. You know that the more you learn about a product or service, the greater the chances you’ll come up with that unique copy angle or product position or big idea.
 But there are some other tips I can give you that will help generate that concept you want to develop. First, state the problem. It might be as simple as “I want to sell this pinball game.” Then, once you have stated the problem, restate it in a different way: “I would like to introduce my prospect to the unique aspects of this pinball game.” Then restate it again: “I want to make the pinball machine easy to buy and seem like fun.”

-----

##### It’s that last restatement that makes the pinball game seem to come alive and is closer to the copy approach I’ve actually used. During problem restatements (and you could list dozens of them), all the knowledge that you’ve gained about the product seems to come together to give a new perspective.

####

-----

# Prepare That Big Idea

##### Once you’ve restated your problem and you have the statement that you like best, sit down and list your big ideas or concepts. List several concepts. Then pick the one or two that make the most sense.
 Visualize your concept and see how it might be incorporated into the ad. Think again about your problem restatement and whether your concept seems to be consistent with it. Then stop. It’s time to incubate.
 After you’ve slept on it for a while, start writing. First write your headline —an attention-getting blockbuster of a headline short enough to grab the reader’s attention. Then write the subheadline—so compelling and curiosity-building that your prospect must read the first sentence. And finally, write the first sentence of the copy—short, to the point and strong enough to carry you into the next sentence—and then it’s down the slippery slide.
 Block-diagram your ad. What do the first few paragraphs do for the ad? What is the emotional appeal? Are you anticipating those questions and answering them to the satisfaction of your prospect? Are you frank and honest in those answers?

####

# Try Patterning Your Ad

##### Another approach is called “patterning.” Simply pick an ad written by somebody you admire and whose product or service is similar to yours and use their ad as a pattern or style from which to write. If they use a long headline, make your headline long. If they use a lot of captions, then you create a number of captions. Capture the feel of the ad, but be careful. Do not copy the person’s layout too closely so that people reading the ad might think at first glance it was from the company you were copying. This exercise is only to give you a format or guide from which to write. If you copy the layout too closely, you are violating the rights of the person who wrote the ad.
 The main points in this chapter are the basic steps and the thought processes you go through as you construct your ad. The key point is that you don’t have the prospect in front of you, so you have to anticipate the questions the prospect will ask in almost the same order the prospect will ask them.
 This flow is important. But there is also a critical part of the copywriting process that really separates the best copywriters from the rest. It’s called the editing process and we cover it in the next chapter.

# Chapter 17

 The Editing Process

##### This chapter holds one of the most valuable secrets to effective and persuasive copy, for it is in the editing process that you turn that raw emotional outpouring of thoughts and ideas into a polished, harmonious, resonant tuning fork that will vibrate perfectly with your prospect.
 It’s like the story of a diamond. When a diamond is found it looks like a piece of coal or carbon. Take that black, ugly stone and polish it and it soon becomes the world’s most beautiful gemstone.
 Remember that lecture I referred to earlier in Chapter 11 that I gave at New York University? I mentioned to the students that if everybody in the class completed a writing assignment, my first draft would probably be the worst in the class. Poor grammar, atrocious spelling and disjointed sentence structure might be the way an English teacher would describe it.
 But it is what I do after that first draft that makes the difference. It’s the difference between just plain copy and a polished advertising message— from copy that doesn’t move prospects to copy that moves prospects so strongly that they reach into their collective pockets and exchange their hard-earned money for your product or service. It’s the difference between earning a salary as a copywriter and earning millions of dollars as an effective copywriter/entrepreneur.

# The Secret to Editing

##### Is there a secret to editing? Once again, it is a mental process that almost parallels that of the copywriting act itself. It requires lots of practice, although you will find it easier to do than writing the copy itself. In fact, it is a lot more fun. Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving birth. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child—the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child.
 You wouldn’t want your child to go out into the world in funny clothes, unable to communicate or relate with others, would you? You therefore have to mold and nurture that child as you prepare to present him or her to the rest of the world.
 Editing is a nurturing process. And just as there is no perfect way to nurture your child, there are many different approaches to editing copy that are certainly acceptable. I strive for one result when I edit, and this can be summed up in the following axiom:

 Axiom 14

**_In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express_**
**_with the fewest words._**

##### Now this sounds rather simple, doesn’t it? But it is the true essence of the editing process. You want to maintain the same emotional feel, the same thought process, the same vibration that you had in mind when you wrote the copy. It’s just that you want to do it in the fewest words.
 This may mean that you rearrange the words you wrote to make the thought more direct. Or it may mean cutting out words that have little contribution to the overall feel of the ad. It may mean substituting new words that express your thoughts better. And it may even mean adding words to clarify a thought. But the goal in writing ad copy is to express the thoughts you want to convey in the most powerful way but with the fewest words.
 I remember the feeling I had writing my book Success Forces in 1980. Since it was a book format and I was not under the same constraints as when I wrote my advertising copy, it was an easy process. In fact, it is a lot

-----

##### easier writing anything other than direct response advertising copy. You have the freedom to use as many words as you wish to express a thought or feeling. And you have no space restrictions.

####

# Copy Has Space Restrictions

##### But with advertising copy you do have space restrictions. Your copy has a very focused purpose—to motivate your prospects to exchange their hard- earned money for your product or service. And everything you do or write must lead to this one goal.
 Let me give you one example from an ad that I wrote. We’ll look at my first draft of the initial two paragraphs, which contained 66 words, and then the final draft, which contained 43 words. We’ll then study the two versions and certain lessons will emerge. The ad was for a bathroom scale, and here’s the first draft:
 Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone. And, if you’ve tried it, you know that part of a good weight reduction program is your bathroom scale. A bathroom scale is like a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done. In fact, one of the few pleasures of losing weight is stepping on your bathroom scale and seeing the positive results. Now let’s take the same ad and condense it to reduce the word count while still maintaining the same meaning and emotional feel.
 Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone. One of the few pleasures of losing weight is stepping on your bathroom scale and seeing positive results. Your bathroom scale is like a report card—a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done. In the second paragraph there is a reduction from 59 words to 36. With nearly 40 percent fewer words, the meaning and emotional appeal of the second version is exactly the same as the first or even better.
 Apply this percentage to a full-page ad with 1,000 words and you can see the difference the editing process can make. In fact, at this point, let’s look at the advantages.

####

# Advantages of Fewer Words

##### With less copy, your ad will look less imposing to the prospect and he or she will be more likely to read it. The second advantage is that you are making the slippery slide even more slippery by making it shorter. Your prospect will get to the bottom of the slide much faster, yet still get the full impact of your sales message.
 The preceding example was given to my seminar class and they spent about 20 minutes coming up with their own edited versions of the ad. Many of them were excellent and some were even shorter than my version. Of course, the copy was taken out of context; they didn’t have the rest of the ad and couldn’t see far enough into the ad to see what my environment, goal and emotional appeal for the product were, so this might not be the perfect example. But it brought out many of the principles of good editing. The following are five of the principles they learned:

####

# Some Principles of Editing

##### 1. Look for any “that” words. For example, in my first draft I used the words, “And, if you’ve tried it, you know that. . . .” The words up to and including “that” can very often be eliminated. In this example, I could eliminate eight words. 2. Edit for rhythm. Make sure that you vary the length of sentences so they don’t sound monotonous. I discuss rhythm later in this book, in Chapter 18. 3. Consider combining sentences. Note that in the edited version, I combined the two sentences that read, “A bathroom scale is like a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done.” I condensed it into “Your bathroom scale is like a report card—a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done.” I saved only one word by doing this, but it made sense to combine the sentences and eliminating even one word is a good move. 4. Eliminate unnecessary words. Look at the word “the” in the phrase “and seeing the positive results.” The word “the” can easily be eliminated without changing the meaning so that the final sentence will read, “and seeing positive results.” 5. Rearrange thoughts so they flow better. Note that in the first draft, the flow of the copy pointed out that the scale was a report card and the second thought was that part of the pleasure of a weight loss program was stepping on a scale and seeing the positive results. By reversing these two thoughts, I made the ad more emotional by focusing on the pleasure of using a scale when losing weight and then I explained why. This sounds a lot better and more logical from a flow standpoint than the first draft.

# Take as Long as You Need

##### Sometimes editing is like raising and nurturing your child and you need to take a lot of time. You may end up doing 10 drafts before you get to the final draft. Other times it may flow right out of your mind with hardly a correction.
 When Frank Schultz, the grapefruit marketer, attended my seminar and wrote his famous grapefruit ad, it was so close to perfect that it didn’t need much editing at all. When Joe Karbo, who wrote The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches, attended my seminar, he told the class that after his ad was written, other than two words that needed correction, the ad was perfect. In contrast, other seminar participants who had a great deal of copywriting experience spent many hours editing their ads.
 And the same holds true for me. I’ve written ad copy that flowed right out of my brain through my pen, or later my computer, and never had to be edited much. Most of the time, though, I would have to go through several drafts before I was satisfied. And then there is the experience factor. The more you write, the less editing you have to do. The easier the flow out of your brain, the better you are at expressing the emotional feel of copy and the excitement that each word represents.

 You want to remove the unnecessary words and still have the ad make sense.

 The novice copywriter will usually need the editing process to craft and polish an ad, whereas the experienced copywriter has many of the editing
