###### Dewey was a scienti�c demagogue. Before speaking on major issues, he used research to �nd out which policies had the widest popular support and then put them forward as if he believed in them.
 In his book The Duping of the American Voter,[4] my colleague Robert Spero analyzed the commercials used by Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter. He concluded that they were ‘the most deceptive, misleading, unfair and untruthful of all advertising … the sky is the limit with regard to what can be said, what can be promised, what accusations can be made, what lies can be told’.
 The nine Federal agencies which regulate advertising for products have no say in political advertising. The broadcasting networks, which turn down half the commercials for products submitted to

-----

###### them because they violate their codes, do not apply any code whatever to political commercials. Why not? Because political advertising is considered ‘protected speech’ under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The networks are obliged to broadcast every political commercial submitted to them, however dishonest.
 In 1964, Johnson’s commercials disparaged Senator Goldwater with a cynical dishonesty which would never be tolerated in commercials for toothpaste. They gave voters to understand that Goldwater was an irresponsible, trigger-happy ogre who would start nuclear wars at the drop of a hat. Johnson was presented as a dove of peace.
 What had happened was this. Goldwater, one of the most decent men in public life, had been asked by an interviewer to di�erentiate between the reliability and the accuracy of guided missiles. He had replied that they were accurate enough ‘to lob one into the men’s room at the Kremlin’. And he had told another interviewer that it would be possible to destroy the forests in North Vietnam by using low-yield atomic weapons. These were no more than theoretical answers to speculative questions. Goldwater did not recommend the use of atomic weapons, and Johnson knew this perfectly well.

-----

_In 1964, Barry Goldwater’s presidential campaign was e�ectively scuppered by unscrupulous commercials put out by his_

_opponent, Lyndon Johnson._

###### Nixon’s campaigns against Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern were less dishonest, but they too violated the network code for product advertising.
 Jimmy Carter’s commercials pictured him as an innocent newcomer to politics, with no political organization – a poor farmer with no money. Nothing could have been further from the truth, but the voting public swallowed it. Gerald Ford, his Republican opponent, used commercials which were relatively honest – and lost the election.

-----

_The ‘down-home’ image of Jimmy Carter’s campaign belied the reality – a highly professional, and costly, publicity machine._

###### The Kennedys and the Rockefellers have proved that it helps a politician to be rich. In his campaign for election to a second term as Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jay Rockefeller spent $11,000,000 of his own money and defeated his Republican opponent, who spent only $800,000. Rockefeller’s commercials were unusually statesmanlike, and a survey found that the people of West Virginia were not shocked by his expenditure. Even his uncle Nelson Rockefeller had not spent so much in his re-election campaign for Governor of New York.
 In a period when television commercials are often the decisive factor in deciding who shall be the next President of the United States, dishonest advertising is as evil as stu�ng the ballot box. Perhaps the advertising people who have allowed their talents to be prostituted for this villainy are too naïve to understand the complexity of the issues.
 The United States is almost the only country which allows political candidates to buy commercial time. In England, France and

-----

###### other democracies, the networks allot free time to serious discussion of the issues.
 Could political commercials be banned in the United States? Not without violating the US Constitution. Could they be regulated, like every other kind of advertising? That too would be illegal.
 Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln hiring an agency to produce 30-second commercials about slavery?

 Down with billboards Highways with billboards have three times as many accidents as highways without billboards. President Eisenhower said, ‘I am against those billboards that mar our scenery, but I don’t know what I can do about it.’ In California, Governor Pat Brown said, ‘When a man throws an empty cigarette package from an automobile, he is liable to a �ne of $50. When a man throws a billboard across a view, he is richly rewarded.’
 Bob Moses, the illustrious Parks Commissioner of New York State, said that ‘e�rontery and impudence can go no further. The time for compromise with these stubborn and ruthless people is over.’ But the majority of legislators are still ready to compromise with them. Here is how a State Senator explains it:

 ‘The billboard lobby shrewdly puts many legislators in its debt by giving them free space during election time. The lobby is savage against the legislator who dares oppose it by favoring anti-billboard laws. It subsidizes his opposition, foments political trouble in his home district, donates billboards to his opponents and sends agents to spread rumours among his constituents.’

 Says the New York Times, ‘the forces of ugli�cation are rampant. The Illinois Democrat and the Florida Republican are united in their determination to protect the �nancial welfare of the billboard industry at the expense of millions of ordinary tourists who would like to see some scenery as they drive.’

-----

_When President Johnson sent the Highway Beauti�cation Bill to Congress, the head of one billboard company claimed that_

_‘There are times when most people would rather look at posters than scenery.’_

###### The Highway Beauti�cation Act actually states that it is the purpose of Congress to promote outdoor advertising. Some departments of the Federal Government are users of billboards. The Internal Revenue Service once accepted the free gift of 4,000 empty billboards and used them to urge taxpayers to make honest returns.
 One day Monty Spaght, then President of Shell, asked me, ‘We get a lot of letters protesting against our use of billboards. Do we need billboards?’ I replied, ‘If you give up billboards, you can still use newspapers and magazines and radio and television. That ought to be enough.’ Shell gave up billboards.
 Billboards represent less than 2 per cent of total advertising in the United States. I cannot believe that the free-enterprise system would be irreparably damaged if they were abolished. Who is in favor of them? Only the people who make money out of them. What kind of people are they? When President Johnson sent the Highway Beauti�cation Bill to Congress, the head of one billboard company protested that Johnson had ‘taken a stand in favor of an abstract concept – beauty. Some people like scenery and are interested in it.

-----

###### Others can take it or leave it. There are times when most people would rather look at posters than scenery.’
 The Roadside Business Association has said, ‘We do not believe that everyone is for beauty in all things.’
 On a Sunday morning in 1958, vigilantes sawed down seven billboards along a highway in New Mexico. Citizens of surrounding areas expressed support for them. One telephone call complained that the vigilantes had not cut down enough billboards, and another that they had frustrated the plan of a large group of citizens who had scheduled a mass burning of billboards for later in the month. The vigilantes were never arrested.
 In 1961 the Quebec government sent hundreds of men with axes to chop down billboards. In 1963 the head of the New York State Thruway Authority knocked down 53 billboards in a dawn raid; he was sick of legal bickering. But in June 1982, a judge in Oregon overturned an ordinance that required the removal of billboards on the ground that it was a denial of free speech. The battle goes on.

 Can advertising sell bad products? It is often charged that advertising can persuade people to buy inferior products. So it can – once. But the consumer perceives that the product is inferior and never buys it again. This causes grave �nancial loss to the manufacturer, whose pro�ts come from repeat purchases.
 The best way to increase the sale of a product is to improve the product. This is particularly true of food products; the consumer is amazingly quick to notice an improvement in taste and buy the product more often. I have always been irritated by the lack of interest brand managers take in improving their products. One client warned me, ‘You are too prone to criticize our products. We could �nd it easier to accept criticism of our wives.’

 Not enough information Do you think advertising gives you enough information about products? I don’t.

-----

###### Recently, I smashed my car beyond repair and had to buy a new one. For six months I read all the car ads in search of information. All I found was fatuous slogans and �atulent generalities. Car manufacturers assume that you are not interested in facts. Indeed, their advertising is not aimed at consumers. Its purpose is to win an ovation when it is projected on the screen at hoopla conventions of dealers. Show-biz commercials have that e�ect. Sober, factual advertising does not. If their engineering was as incompetent as their advertising, their cars would not run ten miles without a breakdown.
 When I advertised Rolls-Royce, I gave the facts – no hot air, no adjectives. Later, my partner Hank Bernhard used equally factual advertising for Mercedes. In every case sales went up dramatically – on peppercorn budgets.
 I have written factual advertising for a bank, for gasoline, for a stockbroker, margarine, foreign travel and many other products. It always sells better than empty advertising.
 Before I started writing advertisements, I spent three years selling Aga cooking stoves to Scottish housewives, door to door. All I did was give my customers the facts. It took me 40 minutes to make a sale; about 3,000 words. If the people who write Detroit advertising had started their careers as door-to-door salesmen, you and I would be able to �nd the facts we need in their advertisements.

 Summary 1 Whether economists are right or wrong in proclaiming that advertising is an ‘economic’ waste, manufacturers do not regard it as a commercial waste.

 2 Apart from political advertising, which is �agrantly dishonest, advertising is now far more honest than consumers realize.

 3 The world would be a safer, prettier place without billboards.

-----

###### 4 The majority of campaigns fail to give consumers enough information.

1Keep buggering on.

2Automobile manufacturers spend 1 per cent of their revenue on advertising. Appliance

manufacturers 2 per cent. Soft drinks 4 per cent. Food manufacturers and brewers 5 per

cent.

 I predict 13 changes

###### have never been a futurist, and with every passing year my interest in the future declines. However, my publisher insists that I

## I

###### take a shot at predicting the changes that you, gentle reader, will see in the advertising business. So here goes:

 1 The quality of research will improve, and this will generate a bigger corpus of knowledge as to what works and what doesn’t. Creative people will learn to exploit this knowledge, thereby improving their strike rate at the cash register.

 2 There will be a renaissance in print advertising.

 3 Advertising will contain more information and less hot air.

 4 Billboards will be abolished.

 5 The clutter of commercials on television and radio will be brought under control.

 6 There will be a vast increase in the use of advertising by governments for purposes of education, particularly health education.

 7 Advertising will play a part in bringing the population explosion under control.

 8 Candidates for political o�ce will stop using dishonest advertising.

-----

###### 9 The quality and e�ciency of advertising overseas will continue to improve – at an accelerating rate. More foreign tortoises will overtake the American hare.

 10 Several foreign agencies will open o�ces in the United States, and will prosper.

 11 Multinational manufacturers will increase their market-shares all over the non-Communist world, and will market more of their brands internationally. The advertising campaigns for these brands will emanate from the headquarters of multinational agencies, but will be adapted to respect di�erences in local culture.

 12 Direct-response advertising will cease to be a separate speciality, and will be folded into the ‘general’ agencies.

 13 Ways will be found to produce e�ective television commercials at a more sensible cost.
