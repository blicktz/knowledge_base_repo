#### examine the problem in the context of a serious treatment error: the gross overprescription of an unauthorized drug to a hospital patient. Finally, they wanted to see what would happen if they physically removed the authority figure from the situation and substituted an unfamiliar voice on the phone, offering only the weakest evidence of authority—the claimed title “doctor.”
 One of the researchers made an identical phone call to twenty-two separate nurses’ stations on various surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric wards. He identified himself as a hospital physician and directed the answering nurse to give twenty milligrams of a drug (Astrogen) to a specific ward patient. There were four excellent reasons for the nurse’s caution in response to this order: (1) the prescription was transmitted by phone, in direct violation of hospital policy; (2) the medication itself was unauthorized (Astrogen had been neither cleared for use nor placed on the ward’s stock list); (3) the prescribed dosage was obviously and dangerously excessive (the medication containers clearly stated that the “maximum daily dose” was only ten milligrams, half of what had been ordered); and (4) the directive was given by a man the nurse had never met, seen, or even talked with on the phone before. Yet after 95 percent of the calls, the nurses went straight to the ward’s medicine cabinet, where they secured the ordered dosage of Astrogen, and then started walking to the patient’s room to administer the drug. At this point, they were stopped by a secret observer, who revealed the nature of the experiment.
 The results are frightening indeed. That 95 percent of regular staff nurses complied unhesitatingly with a patently improper instruction of this sort must give us all as potential hospital patients great reason for concern. The midwestern study showed that mistakes are hardly limited to trivial slips in the administration of harmless ear drops or the like but, rather, extend to grave and dangerous blunders.
 In interpreting their unsettling findings, the researchers came to an instructive conclusion:

_In a real-life situation corresponding to the experimental one, there would, in theory, be two_
_professional intelligences, the doctor’s and the nurse’s, working to ensure that a given procedure_
_be undertaken in a manner beneficial to the patient or, at the very least, not detrimental to him_

_[or her]. The experiment strongly suggests, however, that one of these intelligences is, for all_
_practical purposes, nonfunctioning._

#### It seems, in the face of a physician’s directives, the nurses unhooked their “professional intelligences” and moved to a click, run form of responding. None of their considerable medical training or knowledge was engaged in the decision of what to do. Instead, because obedience to legitimate authority had always been the most preferred and efficient action in their work setting, they were willing to err on the side of automatic obedience. Moreover, they had traveled so far in this direction that their error came in response not to genuine authority but to its most easily falsified symbol—a bare title.[4]

**_EBOX 5.1_**

For five years, a team of security-system hackers launched concerted attacks on the
computer networks of nearly one thousand local banks and credit unions in the United
States. Their hit rate was spectacular. In 963 of the cases, they were able to pierce the
banks’ security systems and come away with such items as protected internal documents,
loan applications, and customer databases. How did they manage to succeed 96 percent of
the time, when banks are intensely on guard with their own sophisticated technological
software to detect and prevent digital incursions? The answer is as basic as the method the
hackers employed. They didn’t penetrate the banks’ advanced digital-security-system
technology with even more advanced digital technology. In fact, they didn’t use digital
technology at all. They used human psychology, embodied in the principle of authority.

Because the hackers had no criminal intent—they had been hired by the banks to try to
defeat the security systems—we know how they maneuvered to be so effective. Equipping
themselves with the accoutrement (uniforms, badges, logos) of fire inspectors, government
safety monitors, and pest exterminators, they were admitted to the facilities without
appointments, escorted to restricted-access sectors, and left to do their work. However, it
wasn’t the “work” bank personnel expected. Instead, it involved downloading sensitive
programs and data from unattended computers and sometimes carrying data disks, laptops,
and even big computer servers out the door as they left. In a newspaper account of the
project (Robinson, 2008), Jim Stickley, the hacking team’s boss, provided an enlightening
lesson, “[This] illustrates something provocative about the way security has changed with
the rise of the Internet, which has shifted attention and dollars spent on security toward
computer networks and threats from hackers. They’ve kind of forgotten the basics.” In the
compliance arena, there’s little as basic as deference to authority.

**Author’s note: Among the authorities allowed admittance to bank facilities were not**
just the sort who could be considered _in authority, such as fire inspectors or government_
safety monitors, but also the sort who could only be considered an authority, such as pestcontrol experts. It’s instructive that both forms of authority worked.

### Clothes

#### A second kind of authority symbol that can trigger our mechanical compliance is clothing. Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of authority is every bit as fakeable. Police files bulge with records of con artists whose methods include the quick change. In chameleon style, they adopt the hospital white, priestly black, army green, or police blue the situation requires for maximum advantage. Only too late do their victims realize the garb of authority is hardly its guarantee.
 A series of studies by social psychologist Leonard Bickman indicates how difficult it can be to resist requests from figures in authority attire. Bickman’s basic procedure was to ask passersby on the street to comply with some odd request (for example, to pick up a discarded paper bag or stand on the other side of a bus-stop sign). In half of the instances, the requester, a young man, was dressed in ordinary street clothes; in the rest, he wore a security guard’s uniform. Regardless of the type of request, many more people obeyed the requester when he was wearing the guard costume. Similar results were obtained when the requester was female.
 In one especially revealing version, the requester stopped pedestrians and pointed to a man standing by a parking meter fifty feet away. The requester, whether dressed normally or as a security guard, always said the same thing to the pedestrian: “You see that guy over there by the meter? He’s overparked but doesn’t have any change. Give him a dime!” The requester then turned a corner and walked away so that by the time the pedestrian reached the meter, the requester was out of sight. Nonetheless, the power of his uniform lasted, even after he was long gone. Nearly all the pedestrians complied with his directive when he wore the guard costume, but fewer than half did so when he was dressed normally.
 It is interesting that, later on, Bickman found college students guessed with some accuracy the percentage of compliance that occurred in the experiment when the requester wore street clothes (50 percent versus the actual 42 percent); yet the students greatly underestimated the percentage of compliance when he was in uniform, 63 percent versus the actual 92 percent.
 Less blatant in its connotation than a uniform, but still effective, is another kind of attire that has traditionally indicated authority status in our culture: the business suit. It, too, can evoke a telling form of deference from total strangers. In a study conducted in Texas, researchers arranged for a

-----

#### thirty-one-year-old man to cross the street against the light, against the traffic, and against the law on a variety of occasions. In half of the cases, he was dressed in a freshly pressed business suit and tie; on the other occasions, he wore a work shirt and trousers. The researchers watched from a distance and counted the number of pedestrians who followed the man across the street; three-and-a-half times as many people swept into traffic behind the suited jaywalker.
 Noteworthy is that the two types of authority apparel shown by these studies to be influential, the guard uniform and the business suit, are combined deftly by con artists in a fraud called the bank examiner scheme. The target of the swindle can be anyone, but elderly persons living alone are preferred. The con begins when a man dressed in a properly conservative business suit appears at the door of a likely victim. Everything about the con man’s clothing speaks of propriety and respectability. His white shirt is starched, wingtip shoes glow darkly, and suit is classic. The lapels are three inches wide, no more, no less; the cloth is heavy and substantial, even in July; the tones are muted—business blue, business grey, business black.
 He explains to his intended victim—perhaps a widow he secretly followed home from the bank a day or two earlier—that he is a professional bank examiner who, in the course of auditing the books of her bank, has found some irregularities. He thinks he has spotted the culprit, a bank officer who is regularly doctoring reports of transactions in certain accounts. He says that the widow’s account may be one of these, but he can’t be sure until he has hard evidence; therefore, he has come to ask for her cooperation. Would she help by withdrawing her savings so a team of examiners and responsible bank officials can trace the record of the transaction as it passes across the suspect’s desk?
 Often the appearance and presentation of “bank examiner” are so impressive that the victim never thinks to check on their validity with even a simple phone call. Instead, she drives to the bank, withdraws all her money, and returns home with it to wait with the examiner for word on the trap’s success. When the message comes, it is delivered by a uniformed “bank guard” who arrives after closing hours to announce that all is well— apparently the widow’s account was not one of those being tampered with. Greatly relieved, the examiner offers gracious thanks and, because the bank is now closed, instructs the guard to return the widow’s money to the vault, to save her the trouble of doing so the next day. With smiles and handshakes

#### all around, the guard leaves with the funds while the examiner expresses a few more thanks before he, too, exits. Naturally, as the victim eventually discovers, the “guard” is no more a guard than the “examiner” is an examiner. What they are is a pair of bunco artists who have recognized the capacity of carefully counterfeited uniforms to click us into mesmerized compliance with “authority.”

**_READER’S REPORT 5.2_**

#### From a Florida-based physician

The title MD carries significantly more authority when placed in the visual context of a
white coat. At first, I hated to wear white coats but later in my career came to understand
that the garment carries power. On multiple occasions when I started work in a new
hospital rotation, I made it a point to wear the white coat. Without fail my transition went
smoothly. Interestingly, physicians are highly aware of this and have even created a
pecking order assigning medical students the shortest white coats, while residents in
training get medium length coats, and attending physicians have the longest white coats. In
hospitals where nurses are aware of this hierarchy, they rarely question the orders of “long
coats”; but when interacting with “short coats,” hospital staffers make alternative medical
diagnosis and therapy suggestions openly—and sometimes rudely.

**Author’s note: This report makes an important point: in hierarchical organizations, not**
only are those with authority status treated respectfully, but those without such status are
often treated disrespectfully. As we saw in the reader’s account, and as we will see in the
next section, the symbols of status one displays can signal to others which form of
treatment seems appropriate.

### Trappings
#### Aside from its function in uniforms, clothing can symbolize another type of status. Finely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of economic standing and position. Mall shoppers were more willing to comply with a request to participate in an unpaid survey, homeowners contributed more donations to a charity solicitor at their door, and job evaluators gave higher suitability ratings and starting salaries to an applicant if the individual involved was wearing a shirt or sweater showing

#### a prestige designer label. What’s more, the differences were strikingly large: 79 percent more compliance with the survey request, 400 percent more frequent donations to charity, and a nearly 10 percent higher starting wage for a job candidate. A separate set of studies offers a reason for the employment-interview results. People judge those dressed in higher quality apparel, even higher quality T-shirts, as more competent than those in lesser quality attire—and the judgments occur automatically, in less than a second.
 Other examples of trappings, such as high-priced jewelry and cars, can have similar effects. The car as a status symbol is particularly relevant in the United States, where “the American love affair with the automobile” gives it unusual significance. According to a study done in the San Francisco Bay area, owners of prestige autos receive a special kind of deference from others. The experimenters discovered motorists would wait significantly longer before honking their horns at a new luxury car stopped in front of a green traffic light than at an older economy model. The motorists had little patience with the economy-car driver. Nearly all sounded their horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply rammed into the rear bumper. So intimidating was the aura of the prestige automobile, however, that 50 percent of the motorists waited respectfully behind it, never touching their horns until it moved on after fifteen seconds.
 Later the researchers asked college students what they would have done in such situations. Compared to the true findings of the experiment, the students consistently underestimated the time to honk at the luxury car. The male students were especially inaccurate, feeling that they would honk faster at the prestige-than at the economy-car driver; of course, the study itself showed just the opposite. Note the similarity of pattern to many other studies on authority pressures. As in Milgram’s research, the midwestern hospital nurses’ study, and the security-guard-uniform experiment, people were unable to predict correctly how they or others would react to authority influence. In each instance, the effect of the influence was grossly underestimated. This property of authority status may account for much of its success as a compliance device. Authority influence not only works forcefully on us but does so without our awareness.[5]

#### From a financial adviser in Michigan

A big problem in my business is getting clients to change their long-held financial goals
and strategies when turns in conditions, like in their personal situations or in the economy,
make those moves the right thing to do. After reading the chapter on Authority in your
book I switched from just basing my advice to these clients on my own opinion to
including the stated opinion of a financial expert on the subject. A lot of times this would
be the chief economist of my company which is a big brokerage firm with hundreds of
offices around the country. But sometimes it would be a TV expert from one of the
financial channels like Bloomberg and CNBC or the author of a published article on the
subject. That worked, getting me about 15 percent to 20 percent more agreement than
before. But honestly from what I read in your chapter I expected better results. Am I doing
something wrong that if corrected would give me stronger results?

**Author’s note: This is an unusual Reader’s Report. For multiple reasons, I rarely**
respond to appeals for personal advice, which can range from assistance on a college
student’s influence-related homework to counsel on how to persuade a wayward spouse to
end an affair “once and for all.” But this reader’s request is different, principally because it
makes contact with a pair of issues of general relevance to other readers. First, when people
such as those the reader is trying to change have a long-standing commitment to particular
goals and approaches, it’s difficult to get any movement from them at all, so a 15–20
percent improvement in compliance strikes me as pretty good. There will be more to say
about this in chapter 7, on commitment and consistency. Second, there is something I can
recommend to enhance the impact of an expert’s advice—multiply it. Audiences trust and
follow the advice of a set of experts more than that of any one of them (Mannes, Soll, &
Larrick, 2014). Thus, a communicator who does the work of collecting and then pointing to
support from multiple experts will be more successful than a communicator who settles for
claiming the support of just one.
