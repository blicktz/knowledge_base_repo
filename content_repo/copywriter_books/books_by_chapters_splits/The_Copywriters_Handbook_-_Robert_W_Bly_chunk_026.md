There are many different business modes for e-commerce companies.
 Here is one online marketing methodology that has been proven effective for many different types of businesses: online marketing works best when you e-mail to people who already know you.
 Therefore, successful online marketers build their “house file” or “e-list” (lists of prospects and their e-mail addresses) using the process outlined below, and then sell to those people via e-mail marketing. This is called the “Organic Model” or “Agora Model,” (fig. 11.1).

**Fig. 11.1: The Agora Model of online marketing.**

### First, the marketer builds a Web site that positions his company as an expert resource in a specific niche or industry. This is the client’s “base of operations” for his online marketing campaign.
 This Web site should include a home page with a banner at top (fig. 11.2), an “About the Company” page, and a menu with links to a series of pages, each with a brief description of the client’s products and services (each product or service description can link to a longer document giving more details on the item).
 The home page should also have one or more calls to action (CTAs). In figure 11.2, this is a sign-up box to subscribe to a free e-newsletter, indicated by call-out C on the diagram. Also recommended: another CTA where interested potential buyers can inquire about your products or services.

**Fig. 11.2: Copywriter’s rough layout for home page.**

### You should also have an “Articles Page” where you post articles you have written on your area of specialty, and where visitors can read and download these articles for free.

 WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE A ROTATING BANNER

Rotating banners consist of a series of slides or images running on a loop at the top of your
home page.

The banners display, in a quick-moving, auto-rotating loop, four to eight promotional
messages, which can include still images, videos, or text.

Despite rotating banners being a hot trend on Web sites, you should not use them on your
site because:

1—Only about 1 to 2 percent of your Web site visitors will ever click on a rotating
banner.
2—Banners are perceived to be advertising, and are therefore ignored by the vast
majority of your visitors, 86 percent of whom won’t even recall reading them.
3—Image banners are large files that can slow Web site load speed, and even a onesecond delay causes 7 percent of visitors to abandon the site.
4—Rotating banners do not display well on mobile devices.
5—Visitors have to wait to view all of the banners. And the banners change so rapidly,
they often don’t have time to read the messages.

### Write a short special report or white paper on your area of expertise, and make this available to people who visit your site. They can download it for

### free, but in exchange, they have to register and give you their e-mail address (and any other information you want to capture).
 Consider also offering a monthly or weekly online newsletter, or “e- zine.” People who visit your site can subscribe for free if they register and give you their e-mail address. You may want to give visitors the option of checking a box that reads: “I give you and other companies you select permission to send me e-mail about products, services, news, and offers that may be of interest to me.”
 The more “content” (useful information) on your site, the better. More people will be attracted to your site, and they will spend more time on it. They will also tell others about your site.
 The model is to drive traffic to your site, shown in fig 11.1, where you get them to sign up for either your free report or your free e-zine. Once they register, you have their e-mail address and can now market to them via e- mail as often as you like at no extra cost.
 The bulk of your online leads, sales, and profits often comes from repeat e-mail marketing to this “house e-list” of prospects. Therefore your goal is to build a large e-list of qualified prospects as quickly and inexpensively as you can.
 There are a number of online marketing options that can drive traffic to your site. These include free publicity, e-mail marketing, banner advertising, co-registrations, affiliate marketing, search engine optimization, direct mail, and e-zine advertising (see fig. 11.1).
 The key to success is to try a lot of different tactics in small and inexpensive tests, throw out the ones that don’t work, and do more of the ones that are effective.

 COMMON ONLINE COPYWRITING ASSIGNMENTS

 There is often confusion as to what the particular “deliverables” are in online copywriting, what the terms mean, and how much copy is involved.
 For instance, what exactly do we mean by a “microsite”? How long is it? When should you use it?

-----

### Here are the most common online copywriting assignments I write for my clients, and the definition and scope of each:

 • A microsite, also known as a long-copy landing page, is a Web site designed to sell a product—such as a newsletter, e-book, vitamin, ab machine, or conference—directly. Copy length is equivalent to a four- to eight-page sales letter.

 • A name squeeze page is a simple landing page for a product or offer. Often used for white papers, software demos, and other inquiry fulfillment. Copy length is about the same as a magazine ad and often briefer, with a headline, a few paragraphs of descriptive product copy, and an online reply form.

 • A transaction page is similar to a short-copy landing page, but with even less descriptive product copy. It is basically an online form the visitor can use to either order the product or request more information.

 • A long-copy e-mail is designed to sell a product directly by driving the recipient to a short-copy landing page or transaction page. Number of words is roughly the same as a two- or three-page sales letter. (E-mails are covered in the next chapter.)

 • A teaser e-mail is a short e-mail designed to drive the readers to a microsite or long-copy landing page where they can order the product. It’s the online equivalent of a half-page sales letter.

 • A lead-generation e-mail is similar to the teaser e-mail, but the purpose is to drive readers to a landing page or transaction page where they can request a free white paper or other information.

 • An online e-mail conversion series is a series of follow-up e-mail messages, sent via autoresponder, designed to convert an inquiry into a sale.

 • An online text ad is typically a 50- to 100-word classified ad to run in an e-zine and drive readers to a microsite or landing page.

 • A banner ad is an HTML ad on a Web site. It hyperlinks to a landing page or other page.

 • A pop-under is a window that appears on a Web site when the visitor takes a certain action (typically trying to leave the site without ordering). It

 WRITING AN E-COMMERCE WEB SITE

 An e-commerce Web site sells many different items, and in a way that is the online equivalent of a catalog. Examples include Amazon, Alibaba, Target, Walmart, and Blue Nile.
 Many successful e-commerce Web sites have the following characteristics:

 A large, searchable database of product photos and descriptions. A shopping cart that enables you to buy products online.

 The biggest e-commerce Web site is Amazon.com, which originally sold books only and has branched into numerous other products including videos, music, tools, and electronics.
 Another example of a successful e-commerce Web site is www.bluenile.com, an online marketer of jewelry. It’s a great example of how to set up an attractive Web site that sells merchandise online.
 There, the home page has pictures of jewelry and product descriptions that are hyperlinked to pages showing and describing those products. Simple and basic, but sensible; I wouldn’t do it any other way.
 Value-added links at the bottom of the home page provide consumers with offers of free guides and education on diamonds (which periodically change).

 The mission of the Web site—to help the consumer shop for and buy a diamond or other jewelry online—is crystal clear. The entire site is designed to make the transaction as easy and painless as possible.
 Most of the hyperlinks on the home page go to specific products, so you can see what stones and jewelry are available. These pages are augmented by a useful but not overwhelming choice of helpful hints on buying diamonds, product searches, and interactive jewelry design.
 It’s fun and easy to shop for jewelry on Blue Nile. You can easily find what you are looking for, the shopping cart works well, and there are links that let you drill down for more product detail and consumer information, whether it’s a close-up photograph of a ring or a schematic diagram showing how a certain setting holds the stone in place. All told, Blue Nile is a case in point that functional, useful copy and design can help create an accessible and successful Web site.

 THE TROUBLE WITH SINGLE-PAGE WEB SITES

A big fad in designing company Web sites today is “single-page” sites. On these one-page
sites, rather than create separate Web pages for each major topic (e.g., testimonials, client
list, about the company, products), where you reach each page by selecting the topic from a
menu, all the topics are on one long home page, and you reach them by scrolling down that
long home page.

Usually there is also a menu. But when you click the topic button on a one-page Web
site, instead of taking you to a separate page, it just takes you immediately to where that
information appears on the home page—eliminating the need to scroll.

Single-page sites are popular today, even “all the rage.” But I don’t like them, and I
recommend that most businesses not use them for four reasons:

First, Link-Assistant.com and others note that one-page Web sites are not good for
search engine optimization. With a one-pager, you usually can’t drive a lot of organic
search traffic via search engine optimization (SEO). This is because you won’t have
enough content to target a wide range of keywords and topics.

-----

According to a study by insurance company NN Group, 76 percent of users surveyed
said the most important factor to them when on a Web site is ease of finding what they
want. Traditional multipage sites make it easy for visitors to go to the content they seek
quickly.

Only 10 percent of users said that the design is first in importance to them when
visiting Web sites. And single-page Web sites were innovated for their cool look, not
their SEO or usability.

Users prefer to consume content in small chunks rather than big gulps. Traditional
multipage sites accommodate the visitor’s natural preference for modular content.
Single-page sites violate it, presenting all the content on one enormous page that is
intimidating to search and to read.

### WRITING A CLICKFUNNEL WEB SITE

 A “sales funnel” (fig. 11.3) is the sequence of steps that take a consumer from being a stranger to either making an inquiry for more information about your products or service or becoming a customer and making a purchase.

**Fig. 11.3: A typical online sales funnel for converting clicks to customers and sales.**

### ClickFunnels is a platform designed to put your entire sales funnel online on a single Web page or site. To see how these funnel sites are written and designed, visit www.clickfunnels.com.
 A ClickFunnels site is laid out in a vertical format. The first section is the top of your sales funnel. Middle sections follow the steps of your sales funnel. And the last section is the call to action. In consumer ClickFunnels, the CTA is to buy the product.
 From top to bottom, the sections of the ClickFunnels site are typically organized using the Motivating Sequence presented in chapter 4. As a

-----

### reminder, the steps in the Motivating Sequence are (a) get attention, (b) state the problem, concern, or need the potential customer for your product has, (c) show him that your product is the solution to his problem or need, (d) prove that your product is superior to other products addressing the same needs and problems your does, and (e) ask for the order with your call to action.
 Each step is presented in a separate level in the funnel. Because the layout has limited space, ClickFunnel copy is relatively brief and frequently presented in bullet form.
 The “proof” step of the sales funnel may be spread over several descending levels, each covering just a single proof element. One panel might be customer testimonials. The next panel could be a description of the product; e.g., how it works, how it is made, the materials it is made of. The panel after that could highlight awards the product has won or press coverage it has garnered. Then, you might have a panel presenting more scientific evidence of product superiority, such as clinical studies or test results.
 Although there are similarities, the ClickFunnel is a dedicated sales page whose only purpose is to get a lead or an order. By comparison, the single- page Web sites we discussed earlier are used as a format in full company Web sites, not sales pages.

 MORE TIPS ON WRITING WEB SITE COPY

 Since putting up my Web site, www.bly.com, in April 1998, I’ve received a ton of unsolicited e-mails, faxes, and phone calls—from casual Internet surfers as well as Web professionals—with all sorts of advice on how to make my Web site better. Unfortunately, more than 90 percent of their suggestions are totally off the mark—and would be a complete waste of my time and money.
 Why is this the case? It’s not that site visitors don’t have valid opinions on graphics or content, or that Web professionals also don’t have good ideas. They often do.

-----

### The problem is, all the advice is given with no thought to the business objective of the site. For example, a Web consultant called and said, “You’re not getting nearly as much traffic as you should. I can help you get much more.” He would advise me, he promised, on how to help my Web site get more hits than the New York Yankees. I politely explained that I had absolutely no desire to increase hits to my Web site and was not interested in what he was selling.
 Frankly, he was baffled. Maybe you are, too. Who doesn’t want more hits on their Web site? Plenty of folks do. Before you can meaningfully enhance a Web site, you need to understand the business of the person or company sponsoring that site, as well as the business objectives they want the site to achieve.
 In the case of www.bly.com, I’m a freelance writer specializing in direct marketing. I serve a higher-end clientele—major direct marketers, Fortune 500 companies, and substantial technology firms—and charge accordingly.
 This makes me different from many entrepreneurs who have Web sites —in two important ways.
 First, 99.99 percent of people cruising the Internet are not my prospects. I’m highly selective, and I infrequently work with small firms, start-ups, mom-and-pop operations, home-based businesses, and wannabe entrepreneurs—precisely the mass market that’s cruising the Internet looking for free marketing information and advice.
 Second, with more business than we can handle, our office (I have two assistants) can’t waste time responding to low-level leads. Handling inquiries from casual Internet surfers takes time and effort, and we need to devote those to the needs of our many ongoing clients.
 Then why do I have a Web site? That’s the key relevant question, and it’s one almost no one who seeks to advise me asks.
 My Web site exists primarily for instant inquiry fulfillment to qualified prospects.
 What does that mean? Before the Internet, when a serious prospect called, we’d send him an information package describing my services. That meant a lot of priority mail and overnight courier bills. And even with

-----

### overnight shipping, the prospect often waited up to twenty-four hours to get his hands on the material.
 Having a Web site eliminates that cost and wait. When prospects want a package, we can send it, but first we tell them that all the information they need to make a decision about using my services is online.
 What should that information be? In his book Roger C. Parker’s Guide to Web Content and Design, my friend Roger Parker says that content on your Web site should consist of two components:

 1. Information your prospects need to know in order to buy from you 2. Information that will convince prospects to buy from you

 My Web site covers both these areas. The “need to know” stuff includes:

 An overview of my services (our home page) An online portfolio of my copywriting samples Pages on each major service (copywriting, consulting, copy critiquing) My credentials (on an “About Bob Bly” page) Client list

 The stuff that helps convince prospects that I’m the person they should hire to write their copy includes:

 Client testimonials Case studies highlighting my success stories Descriptions of the marketing books I’ve written A library of how-to articles I’ve written on marketing A list of recommended vendors that shows I have the connections to help potential clients get whatever they need done

 As you can see, my Web site is totally oriented toward the needs of my potential clients, not to someone who happened upon it online. But does this mean I don’t want you to visit www.bly.com? Not at all.
