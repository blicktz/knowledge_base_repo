The copywriter’s job is to come up with selling ideas. Many of the most important of these messages can be expressed primarily with words, though experience shows that a strong photo or drawing with a persuasive caption can improve ad effectiveness.
 In the pre-digital era, many copywriters stated that the primary purpose of the layout was to make the copy easy to read. While older boomers (like me) still believe making copy easy to read is an essential component of design, many younger marketers make the graphics, pictures, and videos the center of attention.
 The reason is twofold. First, they contend that consumers do not read copy, especially long copy. This erroneous assumption has repeatedly been proven wrong in countless digital and print tests. Or, rather more specifically, casual Web surfers and browsers don’t read long copy, but prospects and buyers do.
 Second, they have grown up in a digital, visual age. They subscribe to the old saw “one picture is worth a thousand words.” They do not realize that the ads are stronger when a powerful visual is accompanied by words.
 As noted, people who do not read your copy are usually not serious buyers, but rather browsers. Consumers who intend to buy read a lot of copy about the product—and without this detail, do not buy. Exceptions? Of course.

### The visual supports, enhances, and explains the ideas in the copy, but the copy usually doesn’t depend on the visual and can stand on its own, even in the digital age. Some concepts are best expressed only by a strong combination of images and pictures. For others, especially those that would benefit from demonstration, video may work best.
 There are times when you, as a copywriter, need more than copy to get your ideas across. You may need photos to show the consumer what you are offering and make it desirable (e.g., travel, fashion, jewelry, cars, homes, and many other things that are most clearly communicated with pictures).
 To guide both digital and print designers and graphic artists on how the copywriter wants the copy designed, he creates what is known as a copywriter’s rough. As the name implies, this is a simple sketch used to communicate the layout the copywriter envisions, especially the positioning of headlines, subheads, banners, calls to action, videos, photos, and response devices.
 I draw my copywriter’s roughs in Microsoft Word, so I can easily insert them into the Word documents containing my copy. I also keep a subdirectory of files on my PC containing copywriter’s roughs I have created for many different projects. Often the copywriter’s rough for one project can be reused as is or with minor modification, saving me time and effort.
 Some prospective clients ask, “Do you do the artwork also?” I reply, “I don’t take photographs or do illustrations. If my concept depends on a visual, I’ll either write a description of the visual in the copy or provide a copywriter’s rough.” See figure 19.1 for an example.

**Fig. 19.1: Copywriter’s rough layout for full-page magazine ad.**

### A freelance copywriter submits a copywriter’s rough—typically a crude sketch just to show where the various elements go.
 An agency writer turns his copy and copywriter’s rough over to the art director for polishing. A good art director enhances the writer’s visual concept by adding his own ideas and creativity to it.
 Some agencies submit two or three versions of the layout so the client can select the one he likes best. To me, this is like having my lawyer say, “Which defense do you think I ought to use?” I believe the agency should select the version it thinks is best and submit this to the client. After all, the client is paying the agency to make judgments in the creative area.
 Once the rough is approved, the agency may submit a more polished drawing—the comp—before photos are taken and type is set.
 Why do ad agencies go through the process of submitting roughs? Because of the cost of revisions. It is relatively inexpensive to make

 ART DIRECTION FOR COPYWRITERS

 Agency copywriters know they have staff artists who can put their layout ideas in polished form.
 Freelancers don’t. So the client can either hire a freelance graphic artist or rely on the company’s staff graphics team.
 There is no need for the freelancer to hire an artist; just let your clients know that you will be providing copywriter’s roughs, not finished comps. If the client demands comps, and if you’re willing to provide this service, you can hire an artist.
 In return for supervising the artwork, you may add an extra charge for artwork to your bill. This charge can be based on a percentage of the cost of hiring the artist. Or it can be whatever fee you think is reasonable.
 If all this talk of drawing and art has you, as a “pure” writer, a bit worried, stop worrying.
 On nine out of ten projects I do not do a copywriter’s rough or any other type of sketch. It’s not necessary: either my concept doesn’t depend on a visual or, if it does, the visual can easily be described in words in the manuscript I submit.
 Only one out of ten of my ads or Web pages is so visually complex or dependent upon a visual that I need to sketch it out. And doing the crude sketch never takes more than ten minutes.
 The computer has helped with this enormously. Reason: not every promotion needs an original layout. So the layout I draw for one project can often be recycled, as is, or with minor modification for other projects— saving me an enormous amount of time.
 As mentioned earlier, I keep all the layouts I do for my various copywriting assignments in a folder on my PC labeled “layouts.” They are all drawn in Microsoft Word, making them easy to incorporate into the Word documents I submit as copy to my clients.

### Below is another sample layout from this folder. As you can see, a copywriter’s rough is truly rough—this is a layout for a postcard. The copywriter does not design the finished piece; the layout is to show position of copy elements only.

### Here are a few more of my copywriter’s roughs you may find interesting —even useful.
 These are crude drawings, which you can do either using drawing software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator) or with a black marker on a sheet of paper.
 Note that there is no attempt to dress them up and make them looked like a finished layout. That’s the graphic designer’s job, and she can do it better than you can. All that your copywriter’s roughs do is show where you

### 10 TIPS FROM A TOP GRAPHIC DESIGNER

Veteran graphic artist Lori Haller says that by following the tips below, you can easily
eliminate the most common graphic design mistakes from your marketing materials:

#1) Copy is KING. ALWAYS. PERIOD.
#2) Readability can make or break the campaign—online, print, always …
#3) Know your reader—deeply.

-----

#4) Use fonts that are easy to read for your core audience. Small fonts are difficult for
older audiences, as are column widths that are too wide.
#5) Stay on top of color trends. Your design can look outdated quickly.
#6) You have the ability to force the reader to read where you direct them.
#7) Get into the minds of the audience, into their shoes; become them, think like them,
feel their pain, know what keeps them up at night.
#8) Read testimonials about the product, service, or guru …
#9) Order forms and cart pages must be easy to read, simple, and easy to understand. The
reader does not want to feel tricked.
#10) Read the copy. Understand it. Get tight as a unit with the writer and make strategic
plans together for success. Trust each other; share, bend, learn, and grow together. A
solid team has a bigger potential to WIN—ALWAYS.

### MORE DESIGN TIPS FOR COPYWRITERS

 Here is a miscellany of graphic arts tips, rules, and techniques that every copywriter should know:

 • First, there’s the magic of the “Basic A” layout for magazine ads (fig. 19.5). This is the simplest, most standard layout: large picture at the top, headline underneath, body copy in two or three columns under the headline, logo and address in the bottom right-hand corner.

 • Basic A is not spectacular, and some art directors consider it “old hat.” But it’s sensible, it draws the reader into the copy, and it’s easy to read.

 • You may want something different. Fine. But at least consider Basic A before going on to a more “creative” design.

**Fig. 19.5: Copywriter’s rough for Basic A ad layout.**

### • A layout should have a single “focal point” where the eye goes to first. This is usually the visual; it can also be the headline.

 • A layout should pull the eye from headline and visual through the body copy in logical sequence to the signature and logo. Subheads and bullets can help accomplish this.

 • On a Web site, the visitor’s eye goes to the upper right corner of the home page first. So that’s a good location for a prominent call to action (CTA).

 • Setting the headline in big, bold type helps draw attention to it. A powerfully written headline, splashed across a print or Web page in large letters, can be a real stopper.

 • If you want the reader to respond to your ad, use a coupon. The coupon should appear in the lower right-hand corner of the ad; the ad should be run against the outer edge of the right-hand page. If a coupon

-----

### borders the “gutter”—the fold running down the middle of a magazine or newspaper—people will not tear it out.

 • If you want people to respond to your ad by phoning, set the phone number in large type at the end of the body copy. A toll-free number gets more calls than a pay number—even if you invite the reader to call on your pay number “collect.”

 • If you prefer an online response, include in large bold type the URL of the sales or landing page where the consumer can see and read more about the product, and also buy online.

 • Photos usually make better visuals than drawings. They are more real, more believable, than illustrations.

 • Full-color gets more attention and gives a better impression than black and white. But full-color is much more expensive to produce and to run in print.

 • Online, color adds no cost. But put most of the copy in black type against a white background. Sparingly use red or another color to emphasize a word or phrase.

 • In the hands of a skilled graphic artist, a second color can add to a brochure or ad’s effectiveness. In the hands of an amateur, it can look chintzy and cheap. Be careful when using a second color in your layout.

 • The simpler the layout, the better. Ads, PowerPoint slides, and Web pages with too many elements—small pictures, graphs, tables, charts, sidebars—have a complex look that discourages people from reading the copy. It takes a highly skilled graphic designer to produce a multielement ad that doesn’t look cluttered and ponderous.

 • The most important factor in selecting type is its readability. Type should be clear, easy on the eye, friendly, and inviting. Style is important— the choice of font is one of many elements that contributes to the image conveyed by the ad—but readability comes first. Always.

 • Photos should be sharp, clear, and simple. If you have to choose between using a photo of poor quality or no photo, don’t use a photo. Professional photography once was necessary in advertising. Today many people are capable of producing ad-quality photographs taken with the cameras in their smartphones.

### • The best photos demonstrate a product benefit or make you think, “That looks interesting. I wonder what is going on here?” The latter type of photo has story appeal but doesn’t tell the whole story; it leaves something to the imagination and arouses curiosity so that you will read the body copy to find out what the photo is about.

 • Never do anything to make the copy difficult to read. Type should be set in black against a white background: not a tint, not white on black, not in color. I just saw an ad in which the copy was printed on a tablecloth and shot as a photo! Naturally, it was quite difficult to read.

 Some ads and many Web sites, of course, are strongly driven by visuals, but even then, the visuals must complement the copy. One example that ran many years ago was an ad for United Technologies. The headline reads, “If you could punch this hole in a Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopter’s gas tank, it would seal itself. In flight.”
 The visual is stark: a black circle five inches in diameter. To make the demonstration more dramatic, the ad is printed as an insert in the magazine on card stock.
 The circumference of the black is perforated with a dashed line. Push on the black circle, and it pops out of the page, leaving the hole talked about in the headline.

 PARTING THOUGHTS

 Here are a few opinions I’ve developed on copywriters, art, and art directors:
 Some copywriters try to add to their value in the marketplace by taking on a second skill. There are copywriter-photographers, copywriter–art directors, copywriter-narrators, and copywriter–television producers.
 The logic makes sense. By hiring the dual-function copywriter, the client gets two services for the price of one.
 In reality, the vast majority of A-level copywriters are those who write copy exclusively. People who do two jobs are usually not very good at either one. I know of only one or two exceptions, if that.

-----

### For example, all of the copywriter-photographers I know are mediocre writers and mediocre photographers. The reason may be that a skilled writer is so in demand that he has no time for picture taking.
 But whatever the reason, I’ve rarely met a “combination copywriter” who was a truly first-rate writer.
 Successful copywriters—at least the ones I know—are good at visualizing their ideas, but their visual concepts and layouts are always simple in design. The reason may be that copywriters don’t have the drawing skills needed to express complex visual concepts on paper. So they stick to layouts they can illustrate with stick figures and squiggly lines.
 Art directors, on the other hand, have the ability to do elaborate sketches, and so their layouts tend to be more sophisticated and complex.
 A good art director can take a writer’s simple concept and add graphic elements that enhance its selling power.
 A clear-thinking copywriter can look at an art director’s layout and see ways to make it cleaner, simpler, easier to read, and easier to respond to.
 Designing ads is not the complex, mysterious task some people make it out to be. Laypeople believe, and artists encourage this belief, that there is some arcane formula of color combinations, type styles, photography, illustration, graphic elements, and positioning that creates ads with magical selling power.
 Simple layouts are the best layouts. They are easier to conceive and cost much less to produce. And they are often the most effective.
 A copywriter friend of mine wrote a small (6½ x 4⅞–inch) black-and- white ad selling a home-study foreign language course. The ad’s layout is undistinguished: all copy except for a small line drawing of the study kit in the bottom right-hand corner. Yet this plain-Jane ad has produced sales of more than $5 million!
 Words, not pictures, are the most important way of communicating great ideas. The Bible contains many thousands of words and not a single picture.
