##### I was once told this story by a master salesman who worked at a TV and appliance store. He was the most successful salesman this store ever had. He consistently beat out all the other salesmen. He had some very good sales techniques, but that wasn’t what impressed me. It was the way he decided in advance who his best prospects might be.
 What he would do was stand in an aisle watching customers walk into the store. He would observe them. If they walked up to a TV set and started turning the knobs, he knew that he had a 50 percent chance of selling them. If they didn’t turn the knobs, he had a 10 percent chance of selling them. This was before remote controls.
 Direct response advertising doesn’t give you the opportunities of observing your prospects. You are not there to see any knobs being turned. But you can get them to turn the knobs by giving them a feeling of involvement with or ownership of the product you are selling.
 In all my ads I try to make the prospects imagine they are holding or using my product. For example, in one of my earlier calculator ads, I might have said, “Hold the Litronix 2000 in your hand. See how easily the keys snap to the touch. See how small and how light the unit is.” I create through imagination the reader’s experience of turning the knobs.
 In short, I take the mind on a mental journey to capture the involvement of the reader. I make the reader believe that he or she could indeed be holding the calculator and experiencing the very same things that I’ve described. It’s mental energy creating a picture for the prospect, whose mind is like a vacuum waiting to be filled.
 In your copywriting, let your readers take a stroll down a path with you or let them smell the fragrance through your nose or let them experience some of the emotions you are feeling by forming a mental picture from your description.
 If I were writing an advertisement for the Corvette sports car, I might say, “Take a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breeze blowing through your hair as you drive through the warm evening. Watch heads turn. Punch the

##### accelerator to the floor and feel the burst of power that pins you into the back of your contour seat. Look at the beautiful display of electronic technology right on your dashboard. Feel the power and excitement of America’s super sports car.”
 I would still explain all the special features of the car—the logic upon which to justify its purchase—but I would really play up that feeling of involvement and ownership.
 This technique is used in many different ways. In direct response, it is often referred to as an involvement device—something that involves the consumer in the buying process. Sometimes it may seem silly. Have you ever received those solicitations that say, “Put the ‘yes’ disk into the ‘yes’ slot and we will send you a trial subscription to our new magazine”? I often wonder who invented that seemingly simpleminded and juvenile concept. Yet, as direct marketers will tell you, this type of involvement device often doubles and triples response rates. It’s not simpleminded at all but rather a very effective direct response involvement technique.
 The reader becomes involved in the solicitation. Similarly, your reader is either taking action or imagining taking action through the power of the words you write.

## The Involvement of TV and the
 Internet

##### TV and the Internet are great examples of involvement. You see, hear and can almost touch the product. It is no wonder that TV and the Internet are among the most effective ways to sell.
 My own daughter, when she was four years old, clearly demonstrated how you can get involved in the sales message. There was a Peanuts Valentine’s Day TV special and my daughter Jill was sitting and watching the show with her seven-year-old sister, April. My wife, who was watching as well, told me this fascinating story.
 Charlie Brown was passing out Valentine cards in a classroom and was reading off names of the recipients, “Sarah, Mary, Sally . . . Jill. Where’s Jill?” said Charlie Brown. My daughter immediately raised her hand and said, “Here.” She was so involved in watching the show that she felt like she was a part of it. I use involvement devices quite often. An involvement device that ties in with what you are selling can be very effective. Let me give you a perfect example from an ad that I wrote. The results really surprised me.
 The product I was offering was the Franklin Spelling Computer—a device that helped correct your spelling. It was a novelty when it first appeared and it sold quite well. Although I wasn’t the first to sell it, I had a model that was a little more sophisticated than the first version.
 I examined the product and felt it was priced too high. But the manufacturer would be pretty upset with me if I were to drop the price. So I tried an involvement device as a method of lowering the price.
 First, I wrote an ad that described the product but with an unusual premise. The ad that I wrote had several misspelled words. If you found the misspelled words, circled them and sent the ad with the misspelled words circled, you would get $2 off the price of the computer for each misspelled word you circled. My concept was simple. If you didn’t find all the misspelled words, you paid more for the computer, but then again, the computer was worth more to you than to somebody who found all the mistakes.

##### I ran the first ad in the Wall Street Journal and the responses poured in. I also received a few phone calls from people I hadn’t heard from in years. “Joe, I want you to know, I spent the last hour and a half trying to find all the words and I don’t even intend on buying your damn computer. I normally don’t read the entire Wall Street Journal for that length of time.”

## I Even Made More Money

##### And the response was surprising. I anticipated that the readers would find all the misspelled words. In fact, even the word mispelled was misspelled. When the response was finally tallied, to my amazement, people only caught, on average, half of the words and I earned a lot more money than I had expected from the ad. And, of course, those who really needed the computer got real value.
 The feeling of ownership is a concept that is pretty close to the feeling of involvement, but here you are making readers feel that they already own the product and you’re letting them use their imaginations as you take them through the steps of what it would be like if they already owned it. An example might be, “When you receive your exercise device, work out on it. Adjust the weights. See how easy it is to store under your bed. . . .” In short, you are making them feel that they have already bought the product.
 Advertising copy that involves the reader can be quite effective— especially if the involvement device is part of the advertising. Whenever you write an ad, keep this very important concept in mind. It can make direct response copy far more effective.

# 2. Honesty

##### If I had to pick the single most important point of the 64 points, I would pick honesty. Your advertising must be honest. This doesn’t mean that if you are dishonest in your message you won’t achieve a successful result. Give the consumer a price that’s too hard to believe or a product that doesn’t live up to its claims and you might be able to get away with it once, maybe even twice, but not for the long haul.
 But this section on honesty is not about whether you can get away with being dishonest and for how long. It’s about honesty as a psychological selling tool. First, let’s start out with a very important premise.
 Consumers are very smart—smarter than you think and smarter collectively than any single one of us. With all the experience I have in marketing products and with all the product knowledge I’ve gained over the past 35 years, you can take my word for it, the consumer is quite sharp.
 The consumer can also tell whether people are truthful in what they are trying to communicate. And the more truthful you are in your advertising, the more effectively your message will be accepted by your prospects.
 Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself. Your copy will say what you think you wanted it to say, but it will also say what you thought you covered up. Even a reader who hurries over your copy can feel the difference.
 When I wrote a JS&A ad, I would include many of the negative features of my products. I would point out the flaws up front. And of course, I would explain why the flaws really didn’t amount to much and why the consumer should still buy my product. Consumers were so impressed with this approach and had such trust in our message that they would eagerly buy what we offered.
 And it seemed that the more truthful and frank my ads were, the more the consumers responded. I soon realized that truthfulness was one of the best advertising lessons I had ever learned.
 Consumers really appreciate the truth. And since they are smarter than you or I, you can’t fake the truth. They’ll pick out a phony statement every time.

##### I learned to make every communication to my customers truthful, whether it be on national television or in my print ads. And the more truthful I am, the more responsive my customers.

# 3. Integrity

##### Not too far from honesty is integrity. An advertisement is a personal message from an organization or an individual and is a direct reflection of the writer’s personality and integrity. You can convey this integrity by the truthfulness of your message, the look of your ad, the image that you convey and even the typefaces that you use.
 Integrity can be reflected by the choices you make in the layout of your ad. Is it clean and neat? Or is it shouting out at you with color bars running in different directions and headlines screaming and words underlined and pictures exaggerated? You get the idea. The integrity of the person delivering the message is always amazingly clear to the recipient. And this integrity is often reflected by the appearance of the advertisement and the copy you write. Show good integrity and your advertising message will be well received. Don’t show it and join the ranks of those who are rarely successful.

# 4. Credibility

##### If you convey honesty and integrity in your message, chances are you’ve gone a long way toward establishing your credibility. However, credibility is not just honesty and integrity. Credibility is being believable. In an ad for a product whose price is exceptionally low, you’ve got to convey that the offer you are making, as great as it may seem, is indeed a valid offer.
 Let’s say you are offering something for $10 that everybody else is selling for $40. Your job is establishing credibility for your price. You might explain that you are buying a very large volume from the Far East and that you were able to buy the remaining stock from a major manufacturer for a very low price. In short, you’ve got to establish the credibility of your company and your offer.
 Credibility also means truthfulness. Does the consumer really believe you? Rash statements, clichés and some exaggerations will remove any credibility your offer may have had.
 One of the most important factors that could affect credibility is not resolving all the objections that are raised in your readers’ minds, such as hiding something or avoiding an obvious fault of the product or service. You need to raise all objections and resolve them.
 Products that require installation or assembly are good examples. If it is obvious that a product doesn’t just pop out of the box ready to use, you must explain that it does require assembly. You might say something like, “To make it easy, we provide you with the tools. In our tests, it only took five minutes for somebody with very little mechanical skill to put it together.” Once again, it is the anticipation of objections and their resolution that means so much to the credibility of an ad.
 You are in essence sensing the next question the consumer may ask and answering it in a straightforward, honest and credible way. The integrity of your product, your offer and yourself are all on the line, and unless you convey the highest credibility in your ad, your prospects will not feel comfortable buying from you.
 When I appear on QVC—the TV home shopping channel—it is easy to sell a difficult product that normally would require a lot of credibility. The reason: QVC already has a lot of credibility with their customers. If a

-----

##### product is being offered on QVC, it must be good. It must have the quality that customers have come to expect, and chances are the product will be bought by somebody who has bought products before from QVC and already feels that the company is a very credible concern. In short, I’ve piggybacked my product onto QVC’s credibility, and the combination of QVC’s credibility and my product’s credibility is pretty powerful.
 The effect of credibility also extends to the magazines or newspapers in which you advertise. If you advertise your product in the Wall Street Journal, you are piggybacking onto their credibility and their constant vigilance, making sure their readers aren’t being taken advantage of. On the other hand, place that same ad in the National Enquirer and you then take on the lack of credibility that this publication has established in the mind of the reader. Again, credibility is affected by the environment in which you place your advertisement.
 You can enhance credibility through the use of a brand name product. For example, if I’m offering an electronic product by the name of Yorx with the exact same features as one whose brand name is Sony, which one has more credibility? The Sony would probably sell better if both were at the same price.
 Adding an appropriate celebrity endorser is another effective way to enhance credibility. The name of a company can, too. For example, there was a company by the name of The Tool Shack selling computers. This company’s name actually detracted from the credibility of the product it was selling. We once ran the same ad in the Wall Street Journal to test the effect of our JS&A name against a lesser-known name—Consumers Hero. In the test, the JS&A ad far outpulled the other ad. Only the name of the company was different. Sometimes a city or state can add credibility. That’s why some companies located in smaller cities have offices in London, Paris or New York. The various ways of adding credibility should be an important consideration in crafting your advertising.

# 5. Value and Proof of Value

##### Even if you are a multimillionaire, you want to know that you are not being taken advantage of, and even more importantly, that you are getting value for your financial investment.
 In an ad, the copywriter wants to convey, through examples or by comparison, that what the customer is buying is a good value. A typical example in one of my ads is where I compare my prices to products with similar features and point out that I’m providing a better value.
 By positioning your product and comparing it with others or by proving the value of something even though the value may not be apparent, you are providing the logic with which the prospect can justify the purchase.
 Simply educating the reader to the intrinsic value of your product is equivalent to lowering its price. In short, there is a value associated with the education you are providing your reader.
 The buying transaction is an emotional experience that uses logic to justify the buying decision. You buy a Mercedes automobile emotionally but you then justify its purchase logically with its technology, safety and resale value. So justifying its value is something that the consumer wants to do before making an emotional purchase.
 And with such intense competition in the world, there is a question in the mind of the consumer: “Am I buying the product at the best price?” Once again, you must resolve that question or you are not communicating effectively with your prospect.

# 6. Justify the Purchase
