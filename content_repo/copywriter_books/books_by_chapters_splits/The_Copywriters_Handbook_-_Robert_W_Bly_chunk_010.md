Sarah Jessica Parker’s commercials for Stella Artois beer position it as a sophisticated alternative to a cosmopolitan, martini, or other cocktail.
 Similarly, using Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek as a spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance conveys an image of a financial product that intelligent people would want to have.
 If you have millions to spend, you can use advertising to give your product a unique “personality” in the mind of the consumer. But even if your advertising budget is more modest, you can still use features and benefits to create a Unique Selling Proposition that sets your product apart from the rest.

### THE SECONDARY PROMISE

 Samuel Johnson was right: to break through the clutter and generate a profitable response, marketing must make a big promise. Some examples of big promises from classic promotions:

“Retire overseas on $600 a month.”
“Free money reserved for you.”
“John F. Kennedy had it. So did Princess Diana. Michael Jordan has it now. It’s the reason why
millions of people adore them. Look inside to find out what it is and how you can get it.”

### Testing shows that, at least in consumer direct marketing, small promises don’t work. To get attention and generate interest, you have to make a large, powerful promise.
 But there’s a problem. What happens if the reader is skeptical … because the big promise is so fantastic, it sounds too good to be true? In that case, use a secondary promise.
 The secondary promise is a lesser benefit that the product also delivers. Although not as large as the big promise, the secondary promise should be big enough so that, by itself, it is reason enough to order the product—yet small enough so that it is easily believed.
 This way, even if readers are totally skeptical about the big promise, they can believe the secondary promise and order on that basis alone.
 For instance, an investment promotion had a big promise in its headline: “Crazy as It Sounds, Shares of This Tiny R&D Company, Selling for $2 Today, Could Be Worth as Much as $100 in the Not-Too-Distant Future.”
 That’s a really big promise—having a stock go from $2 to $100 is a gain of 4,900 percent. On a thousand shares, your profit would be $98,000.
 The problem is, in a bear market, this gain may, to some readers, be too high to be believable. Yet, in this case, it was the truth: if the company’s medical device won FDA approval, a fifty-fold increase in share price was not out of the question.
 The solution: a subhead, placed directly under the big promise in the headline, made a secondary promise:

-----

I think this new technology for treating liver disease is going to work. And if it does, the stock
price could easily increase 50-fold or more.

But even if it doesn’t … and the company’s treatment is a total failure … the stock could
still earn early-stage investors a 500% gain on their shares within the next 24 months.

### The catch was this: even if the treatment did not win FDA approval, the company would still make a lot of money (though not as much as with the treatment being approved) using the same technology in a different application. So even if the big promise didn’t pan out, the secondary promise was enough to make the stock worth owning.
 There are many techniques you can use to prove your big promise when your reader is skeptical. These include testimonials, case studies, test results, favorable reviews, superior product design, track record, system or methodology, reputation of the manufacturer.
 All are good. But the trouble is this: if the big promise is so strong that readers are inclined to dismiss it as false, you find yourself arguing with them and going against their ingrained belief when you introduce all this proof.
 I would still present the proof, but an easier way to overcome doubt concerning the big promise is always to accompany it with a secondary promise that is also desirable yet smaller and more credible.
 The secondary promise is your “backup” promise. In a package with both a big promise and a secondary promise, the big promise will attract readers because it is so large—and if you offer enough proof, many of those readers will believe it.
 What about those prospects who are not convinced? Without a secondary promise, they simply toss your ad or mailing without responding.
 But when you add a secondary promise and make it prominent (which means featuring it in the headline or the lead), many of those who reject the big promise as being unbelievable will find the secondary promise credible —and appealing enough to sell them all on its own.
 Actually, with a secondary promise, prospects who don’t fully believe your big promise can still be sold by it. They think: “Hey, if this big promise happens to be true, this is a good product to buy; but even if it isn’t

### true, the product is more than worth the price just for the secondary promise —which I am sure is true—by itself. So either way, I can’t lose.”

 KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER

 Psychology Today reported on a study designed to uncover the characteristics of successful salespeople.
 “The best salespeople first establish a mood of trust and rapport by means of ‘hypnotic pacing’—statements and gestures that play back a customer’s observations, experience, or behavior,” wrote the author of the study. “Pacing is a kind of mirror-like matching, a way of suggesting: ‘I am like you. We are in sync. You can trust me.’”
 In other words, successful salespeople empathize with their customers. Instead of launching into a canned sales pitch, the successful salesperson first tries to understand the customer’s needs, mood, personality, and prejudices. By mirroring the customer’s thoughts and feelings in their sales presentations, successful salespeople break down resistance to sales, establish trust and credibility, and highlight only those product benefits that are of interest to the customer.
 Copywriters, too, must get to know the customers. Understanding the customers and their motivations for buying the product is the key to writing copy that sells.
 Too much advertising is created in a vacuum. The advertiser and the agency write copy based on the product features that catch their fancy, not on the features that are important to the customer. The result is copy that pleases the agency and the advertiser, but leaves the customer cold.
 In a survey published in a marketing newsletter, advertising agencies and buyers of high-tech products were asked which product features they considered important. The results showed that advertising agencies stressed features that were not important to buyers. The agencies also omitted information that was vital to the buyers. For example, both purchasing agents and engineers ranked price as the number two consideration when buying high-tech equipment. But the agencies said price was unimportant as a copy point. Agencies said high-tech ads should stress how the product

### saves the buyer time. But engineers and purchasing agents said this is far less important than product specifications and limitations.
 When you write copy, don’t write in a vacuum. Don’t just sit down at the keyboard and pick the features and benefits that suit your fancy. Instead, find out which benefits and features your readers care about—and write about the sales points that will motivate readers to buy the product.
 A good example of copy that “hits home” with the reader is a subscription letter I received some years ago from Inc. magazine. Here’s the opening of the letter:

A special invitation to the hero of American business

Dear Entrepreneur:
You’re it!

You’re the kind of person free enterprise is built on. The ambition, vision, and guts of small
business people like yourself have always been the driving force behind the American
economy.

Unfortunately, that’s a fact which the general business press seems to have forgotten. In their
emphasis on everything big, like conglomerates, multinationals, and oil companies the size of
countries, most business publications pay very little attention to the little guy.

### The letter is effective because it speaks directly to the pride entrepreneurs feel in being “self-made.” The letter writer has done a good job of empathizing with the reader and understanding how an entrepreneur thinks of himself.
 You, too, must get to know your reader. One way of doing this is to start paying close attention to your own behavior as a consumer.
 Once you start thinking as a consumer rather than a writer, you’ll have more respect for your reader. And you’ll write copy that provides useful product information and sales appeals rather than empty hype.
 Another way to understand your prospect is to observe consumers and be an active student of the marketplace. When you’re in the supermarket, watch other buyers. Which type of person picks the sale items and which type goes for the name brand?
 When you visit an automobile dealer, observe how the successful salespeople deliver their pitches and handle their customers. Listen to the

-----

### pitch you receive and think about why it did or didn’t sway you.
 Take an active interest in the world of e-commerce. When you are served an ad on Facebook, pay attention to subject matter, offer, and design.
 And talk to the businesspeople you trade with—store owners, the plumber, your lawyer, the gardener, the person who repairs your hot-water heater—to find out the techniques they use to promote their services and products. People who are close to their customers—and many small business people are—know more about the reality of selling than most ad agency account executives or corporate brand managers do. Listen to these people, and you’ll learn what makes the customer tick. (Chapter 5 provides additional tips on getting to know your reader.)
 There’s an old saying: “You can’t be all things to all people.” And it certainly applies to advertising and selling. You can’t create one ad or commercial that appeals to everybody, because different groups of buyers have different needs. So, as a copywriter, you must first identify your audience—the segment of the market you are selling to—and then learn which product benefits interest these buyers.
 Tailor both the content and the presentation of your information to the group of customers you’re selling to. Take frozen foods as an example. When you sell frozen foods to a dad or mom who does the cooking, he or she is most interested in nutrition and price.
 But a young, single professional person is primarily interested in convenience: he or she doesn’t want to spend too much time in the kitchen. Price is not as much of a factor because the young professional has more disposable income than the homemaker.
 Take photocopiers as another example. The large corporation buying a copier wants a machine that is fast and offers a variety of features such as color copies, collating, and two-sided copying. But the self-employed professional who works at home has different needs. His budget is limited, so the copier must be inexpensive. And, since he’s working from home, space is at a premium, so compactness is an important feature. But speed and capacity are not as crucial, since the work-at-home professional makes fewer copies than the corporate user.

-----

### Sometimes, the benefits to stress to various groups of buyers are obvious. In other cases, you must ask the advertiser or his customers which features should be stressed. I once had the assignment of selling a water purification system to two different types of customers: marine users (mostly commercial fishing vessels) and chemical industry users (chemical plants). Same product, two different buyers.
 By talking with a few customers in each group, I discovered that marine users put a premium on reliable operation, since they can’t afford to be without fresh water while at sea. Weight is also important, because the larger the equipment, the more fuel the boat consumes in hauling the equipment around.
 Chemical industry buyers, on the other hand, don’t care about weight, because the machine is placed on the plant floor. And, because they have many sources of water, reliability is not as crucial. The chemical industry buyers—all engineers by training—were more interested in technical features. They wanted to know every product specification down to the last nut, bolt, pump, and pipeline. I wouldn’t have known these differences existed unless I asked. Which is why it’s vital that you get to know your buyer.
 But how well do you really know your customers? Knowing that you are writing to farmers, information technology (IT) professionals, or plumbers is just the start. You have to dig deeper. But how?
 To write powerful copy, you have to go beyond the demographics to understand what really motivates these people: who they are, what they want, how they feel, and what their biggest problems and concerns are that your product can help solve. Your copy should reach prospects on three levels: intellectual, emotional, and personal.
 Intellectual is the first level and, while effective, not as strong as the other two. An intellectual appeal is based on logic, for example, “Buy the stocks we recommend in our investment newsletter and you will beat the market by 50 to 100 percent.”
 More powerful is to reach the prospect on an emotional level. Emotions that can be tapped include fear, greed, love, vanity, and, for fund-raising, benevolence. Going back to our example of a stock market newsletter, the

-----

### emotional appeal might be, “Our advice can help you cut your losses and make much more money, so you become much wealthier than your friends and neighbors. You’ll be able to pay cash for your next car—a Lexus, BMW, or any luxury automobile you care to own—and you’ll sleep better at night.”
 The most powerful way you can reach people is on a personal level. Again, from our example of a stock market newsletter: “Did you lose a small fortune in the 2008 stock market crash? So much that it put your dreams of retirement or financial independence on hold? Now you can gain back everything you lost, rebuild your net worth, and make your goal of early retirement or financial independence come true. A lot sooner than you think.”

 THE BDF FORMULA

 To reach your prospects on all three levels—intellectual, emotional, and personal—you must understand what copywriter Mark Ford calls the buyer’s “Core Complex.” These are the emotions, attitudes, and aspirations that drive them, as represented by the BDF formula, which stands for beliefs, desires, and feelings.

 • Beliefs. What does your audience believe? What is their attitude toward your product and the problems or issues it addresses?

 • Desires. What do they want? What are their goals? What change do they want in their lives that your product can help them achieve?

 • Feelings. How do they feel? Are they confident and brash? Nervous and fearful? What do they feel about the major issues in their lives, businesses, or industries?

 For instance, a marketing team did this exercise using IT people, for a company that gives seminars in communication and interpersonal skills for IT professionals. Here’s what they came up with in a group meeting:

-----

### • Beliefs. IT people think they are smarter than other people, technology is the most important thing in the world, users are stupid, and management doesn’t appreciate them enough.

 • Desires. IT people want to be appreciated and recognized. They also prefer to deal with computers and avoid people whenever possible. And they want bigger budgets.

 • Feelings. IT people often have an adversarial relationship with management and users, both of whom they service. They feel that others dislike them, look down upon them, and do not understand what they do.

 Based on this analysis, particularly the feelings, the company created a direct-mail letter that was its most successful ever to promote a seminar, “Interpersonal Skills for IT Professionals.” The rather unusual headline: “Important news for any IT professional who has ever felt like telling an end user, ‘Go to hell.’”
 Before writing copy, write out in narrative form the BDF of your target market. Share these with your team and come to an agreement on them. Then write copy based on the agreed-upon BDF.
 Occasionally insights into the prospect’s desires and concerns can be gleaned through formal market research. For instance, a copywriter working on a cooking oil account was reading a focus group transcript and came across this comment from a user: “I fried chicken in the oil and then poured the oil back into a measuring cup. All the oil was there except one teaspoon.”
 This comment, buried in the appendix of a focus group report, became the basis of a successful TV campaign dramatizing the selling point that food did not absorb the oil and therefore was not greasy when cooked in it.
 Veteran adman Joe Sacco once had an assignment to write a campaign for a new needle used by diabetics to inject insulin. What was the key selling point?
 The diabetics Sacco talked to all praised the needle because it was sharp. A nonuser would probably view being sharp as a negative. But if you have ever given yourself or anyone else an injection, you know that sharper needles go in more smoothly, with minimal discomfort. Sacco wrote a

-----

### successful ad campaign based on the claim that these needles were sharp, therefore enabling easier, pain-free insulin injections.
 Copywriter Don Hauptman advises, “Start with the prospect, not the product.” With BDF, you can quickly gain a deeper understanding of your prospects before you attempt to sell them something. Stronger marketing campaigns usually follow.
