As I’ve pointed out, different people buy products for different reasons. If I buy a car, I buy reliable transportation to get me where I want to go, and a used economy car suits me just fine. But the buyer of a Porsche or Mercedes-Benz is buying more than transportation—she’s buying status and prestige as well.
 Before you write your copy, it’s a good idea to review the reasons why people might want to buy your product. To help you, I’ve compiled the following checklist of “copy motivators”: twenty-two motivations people have for making purchases. This list is not comprehensive. But it will get you thinking about who you’re writing to and why you’re writing to them.
 Here, then, are twenty-two reasons why people might buy your product. Don’t just read the list; think about each of the reasons and how it might apply to the products you handle.

 To be liked To be appreciated To be right To feel important To make money To save money To save time To make work easier To be secure To be attractive To be sexy

### To be comfortable To be distinctive To be happy To have fun To gain knowledge To be healthy To gratify curiosity For convenience Out of fear Out of greed Out of guilt

 Think about the things you buy—and why you buy them. You buy cologne to smell nice. And you want to smell nice to attract a mate.
 You buy sports equipment to have fun. You join a spa to become healthy. You buy a gold-plated money clip to be distinctive and feel important.
 You buy insurance to be secure. You buy slippers to be comfortable. You buy a refrigerator with an ice maker for convenience.
 Once you understand what makes people buy things, you know how to sell—and how to write copy. The rest is just organization and good editing and a few simple techniques.

 LONG COPY VS. SHORT COPY

 The slogan from an old cigarette commercial was, “It’s not how long you make it; it’s how you make it long.” And that’s a good rule of thumb for determining the length of the copy you write.
 In other words, the question isn’t how many words you should write; it’s how much information to include for the copy to accomplish its sales mission.
 In general, the length will depend upon three things: the product, the audience, and the purpose of the copy. First, consider your product. Is there

### a lot you can say about it? And will giving these facts help convince the reader to buy it?
 Some products have a lot of features and benefits you can highlight in your copy. These include computers, Bluetooth speakers, cars, books, insurance policies, investment opportunities, courses and seminars, resorts and vacation trips, digital watches, smartphones, and home-exercise equipment.
 Many other products don’t have a lot of features and benefits, and there isn’t too much you can say about them. These include soft drinks, fast food, candy, chewing gum, beer, wine, liquor, jewelry, lingerie, cologne, perfume, soap, laundry detergent, cosmetics, linens, pet food, and shampoo.
 For example, there isn’t much you can say about a new ginger ale, other than it tastes good and costs less.
 But an automatic food processor has a lot of benefits you can highlight. It saves time. It eliminates messy chopping and cutting. It makes cooking easier and more pleasant. It can slice, dice, mash, peel, whip, blend, chop, and crush virtually any food. You can use it for desserts, appetizers, salads, and main courses. It can process fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, cheeses.
 So the length of the copy depends on the product and what there is to say about it.
 Second, the length of the copy depends upon the audience. Some customers don’t need a lot of information and are not accustomed to reading long text. Others seek out all the facts they can get and will devour as much as you can provide.
 A book club wanted to know how much copy to include in the direct- mail package it used to get new members to join the club. It tested sales letters of various lengths: one, two, four, eight, and twelve pages. The twelve-page letter pulled the most orders. Why? One of the reasons is that people who will join a book club are readers—and they will read twelve pages of text if it interests them.
 Businesspeople whose service or product revolves around intellectual property or technical methodology often write books outlining their approach to their service (e.g., investment management). Many have told me the same thing: “A prospect who has actually read the book becomes a

### better potential client and is much more likely to become a client. We prefer an educated client. They are easier to deal with and more likely to accept our recommendations.”
 The third factor in determining copy length is the purpose of the copy. If you want your copy to generate a sales lead, then there’s no need to go into complete detail because you’ll get a chance to provide more information when people respond to the lead. On the other hand, an ad that asks for the order by mail must give all of the facts the reader needs to make a buying decision and order the product.
 “This is all very nice,” you say, “but how do I determine the length that’s best for my product, my audience, and my purpose?”
 Fortunately, there’s an answer. I’ve developed a tool, which I call the Copy Length Grid (fig. 4.1), that can enable us to determine copy length in a somewhat more scientific and semiquantitative fashion.
 The Copy Length Grid says there are two major factors determining whether long or short copy will work best for your promotion: emotion and involvement.
 Emotion refers to the degree to which the purchase is emotional. Buying a diamond engagement ring is a highly emotional purchase. But you are moved very little emotionally when deciding which brand of paper clips to buy.

**Fig. 4.1: Copy Length Grid**

### Involvement refers to how much time, effort, and thought goes into the product purchase. As with most large purchases, a lot of consideration goes into the selection and purchase of a diamond engagement ring. But most of us grab the first box of paper clips on the shelf of the stationery store without giving it a second thought.
 To use this system for determining copy length, rate these two criteria— emotion and involvement—as high or low. This dictates what quadrant of the Copy Length Grid you end up in, which in turn gives you at least a rough guideline for copy length.
 For instance, the highly emotional purchase of a diamond engagement ring is a “considered purchase”—something you give a lot of thought to— so it rates high in involvement. As you can see in the diagram, this puts us firmly in the upper left quadrant of the grid, indicating that long copy is appropriate for this offer.
 On the other hand, paper clips are more of an impulse purchase: we go to the store and pick up the first box we see, providing it’s the right size. There’s no emotion and very little thought that goes into this purchase.
 This puts us in the lower right quadrant of the grid, which indicates that writing long, passionate copy about paper clips probably isn’t going to sell more of them.

### Of course, the Copy Length Grid is only a rough guide, not a precise analyzer. A number of other factors must also be taken into account when determining copy length. These factors include:

 • Price. The more expensive a product is, the more copy you generally need to sell it. Lots of copy is needed to build the case for value before asking for the order, so that when the price is finally given, it seems like a drop in the bucket compared to what the buyer is getting in return.

 • Purpose. Copy that sells the product directly off the printed page or screen (known as “one-step” or “mail-order” copy) usually has to be long, because it must present all product information and overcome all objections. Copy designed to generate a lead (“two-step copy”) can be short, since a catalog, brochure, or salesperson will have the opportunity to present product details and overcome objections later.

 • Audience. People who are pressed for time, such as busy executives and professionals, often respond better to short copy. (Business-to-business copywriter Steve Slaunwhite notes: “The B2B writing style tends to be clear, fact-based, conversational, and focused on down-to-earth performance expectations rather than overblown promises.”[2]) Prospects with more time on their hands, such as retirees, as well as those with a keen interest in your offer, such as hobbyists, are more likely to read long copy.

 • Importance. Products that people need (a refrigerator, an air conditioner) can be sold with short copy because … well, the prospect has to buy them. Products that people want but don’t have to buy (exercise videos, self-help audio programs, financial newsletters) must be “sold,” and require long copy to do so.

 • Familiarity. Short copy works well with products the prospect is already familiar with and understands. This is why vouchers and double postcards are used so frequently to sell subscriptions to popular, well- known magazines (Newsweek, Businessweek).

 Based on the Copy Length Grid and these other factors, it’s clear that long copy is not always better, and there are many instances when short or

### almost no copy works best. This is the case with items that “sell themselves,” such as staplers or garden hoses.
 But for items that have to be “sold”—life insurance policies, luxury automobiles, IT systems, collectibles, high-end jewelry, career training— long copy is often required because of the high degree of emotion and involvement.
 Don’t be afraid of long copy. Include as many facts as it takes to make the sale.
 At the same time, other factors also affect copy length. For instance, in a banner ad or Google pay-per-click ad, you are limited to short copy. When the user clicks the ad, he is taken to an online sales page where now you have room to say as much as you need to close the deal.

 GENERATIONAL MARKETING

 Today, perhaps more than ever, advertisers are targeting their marketing to specific generations, the most prevalent being baby boomers and millennials. Table 4-1 provides a quick overview of the various generations including their ages, interests, attitudes, and lifestyles.[3][,] [4][,] [5]
 Because of the accelerated pace at which technology is developing, the volatile economy, geopolitical instability, and longer life spans, the generations perhaps differ even more sharply than in decades past—and for that reason, marketing targeting specific generations has become commonplace and extremely effective.

### POSITIONING

 Al Ries and Jack Trout, authors of Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, write: “Today, positioning is used in a broader sense to mean what the advertising does for the product in the prospect’s mind. In other words, a successful advertiser today uses advertising to position his product, not to communicate its advantages or features.”
 For instance, Coors is positioned as a fresh, pure beer made from the water of the Rocky Mountains. Heineken is positioned as a premium beer “crafted by connoisseurs.”
 Positioning does not take the place of features and benefits and sales arguments; it complements them. If your product fills a special niche, positioning it against a well-known brand is a quick and effective way of establishing the product’s identity in the consumer’s mind.
 But your copy must do more than get the consumer to think about the product; it must also persuade him to buy it. And you can’t persuade consumers to buy unless you tell what the product can do for them and why the product does it better than other products can.

## GETTING READY TO WRITE

### Helmut Krone, the art director who helped create such classic campaigns as Avis’s “We Try Harder,” Volkswagen’s “Think Small,” and Mennen’s “Thanks, I Needed That,” had a basic approach to tackling advertising assignments: “I start with a blank piece of paper and try to fill it with something interesting.”
 But what exactly should the copywriter do to prepare himself for facing that blank piece of paper or empty screen? What information do you need before you’re ready to write your copy? How do you go about collecting this information? How do you develop advertising ideas?
 This chapter provides answers to these questions and outlines specific techniques you can use to gain familiarity with a product and its market before you tackle your copywriting assignment.

 COPYWRITING RESEARCH

 There are three basic steps I take to do research on the product, technology, competition, and market for my copywriting assignments.

 Step #1—Start with the client.

 Most have a wealth of material they can share with you. You simply have to know what to ask for … and it starts with this: https://www.bly.com/newsite/Pages/documents/HTPFAC.html

### Step #2—Hire an online researcher.

 Not to do all of your online research—but to save you time finding both ordinary statistics and obscure data.
 My online researcher has written an inexpensive e-book on this topic: http://www.fastonlineresearch.com/

 Step #3—Then do your own online research.

 In some cases, you don’t know that an article or paper provides useful information for your copywriting until you find it or even stumble across it —similar to browsing shelves at your local library and bookstore.
 Are there other steps you can take and resources you can explore to find great source material for copywriting assignments? Yes, many. But start with the three listed here.

 Note: The Word References feature makes it easy to add footnotes to all information you took from other sources, so if a statement in your copy is questioned, you have backed it up with proper attribution.

 ONLINE RESEARCH: A QUICK OVERVIEW

 The major search engines are those that have large indexes, are better known and heavily used. For researchers, well-known search engines generally mean more dependable results. When you find similar results in multiple sources, you have a higher degree of confidence. Because these major search engines are commercially backed, they are more likely to be well maintained, updated often, and keep pace with the ever-growing amount of online data.
 I assume that you have some familiarity with Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and other major search engines. So in this section, I’m not going waste your time on the basics. Rather, let’s focus on how to find information on the Web that you can trust as accurate and reliable.

### The Stanford (University, California) Persuasive Technology Lab and Makovsky Company Study about Web credibility[1] defines credibility as believability, and it points out that credibility is a perceived quality rather than a piece of information.
 Credibility perception results from evaluating multiple criteria simultaneously. These criteria reside within two categories: expertise of the Web site and its trustworthiness. Many considerations go into each of them.
 Some of the characteristics of a credible site are[2]:

 It acknowledges author’s name, institution, or organization with which the author is associated (if any), and current contact information. It gives author’s credentials and qualifications. It provides a complete list of citations. Additionally, you should ask yourself if the sources are authoritative. Its information is current (updated, no dead links, no old news, etc.). Clues of author’s bias are minimal: the author does not try to sell the product or service he’s talking about, and advertising on the Web site is minimal or absent. “Coverage” is not conditional: you can view the information without limitation of fees, browser technology for pay, or software requirement.

 Some of the most reliable sources on the Web include[3] sites that are maintained by institutions or professional associations. The professional Web site may include research, resources, fact sheets, white papers, reports, surveys, press releases, and more. These Web sites are usually credible, especially when the institution or the association is legitimate and even prestigious.
 When an online article provides only links to other sources, the credibility should be judged for each linked source separately, as it no longer reflects the original organization’s credibility. Among other trustworthy sources for researching market, application, and technology for writing assignments:

### Articles from peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals, found mostly with the aid of scholarly search engines Financial sites such as Yahoo!’s Major news sources such as the New York Times, USA Today Major business news sources such as Businessweek, Kiplinger’s Official government sources for statistical data Professional sites

 HOW TO PREPARE FOR A COPYWRITING ASSIGNMENT

 Here’s a four-step procedure you can use to get the information you need to write persuasive, fact-filled copy for your clients:

 Step 1: Get All Previously Published Material on the Product

 For an existing product, there’s a mountain of content the client can send to the copywriter as background material. This information includes:

 Tear sheets of previous ads Brochures Annual reports Catalogs Article reprints Technical papers Copies of speeches and presentations Audiovisual scripts Press kits Market research Advertising plans Web sites Letters from users of the product Back issues of e-newsletters Files of competitors’ ads and sales literature Internal memos

### Letters of technical information Product specifications, blueprints, plans Illustrations and photos of product prototypes Engineering drawings Business and marketing plans Reports Proposals Customer reviews
