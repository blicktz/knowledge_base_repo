That’s why we have signed ads sometimes — to give them a personal authority. A
man is talking — a man who takes pride in his accomplishments — not a “soulless
corporation.” Whenever possible we introduce a personality into our ads. By making a
man famous we make his product famous. When we claim an improvement, naming the
man who made it adds effect.

Then we take care not to change an individuality which has proved appealing.
Before a man writes a new ad on that line, he gets into the spirit adopted by the
advertiser. He plays a part as an actor plays it.

In successful advertising great pains are taken to never change our tone. That
which won so many is probably the best way to win others. Then people come to know
us. We build on that acquaintance rather than introduce a stranger in guise. People do
not know us by name alone, but by looks and mannerisms. Appearing different every
time we meet never builds up confidence.

Then we don’t want people to think that salesmanship is made to order. That our
appeals are created, studied, artificial. They must seem to come from the heart, and the
same heart always, save where a wrong tack forces a complete change.

-----

There are winning personalities in ads as well as people. To some we are glad to
listen, others bore us. Some are refreshing, some commonplace. Some inspire
confidence, some caution. To create the right individuality is a supreme accomplishment.
Then an advertisers growing reputation on that line brings him ever-increasing prestige.
Never weary of that part. Remember that a change in our characteristics would compel
our best friends to get acquainted all over.

 Negative Advertising

To attack a rival is never good advertising. Don’t point out others’ faults. It is not
permitted in the best mediums. It is never good policy. The selfish purpose is apparent.
It looks unfair, not sporty. If you abhor knockers, always appear a good fellow.

Show a bright side, the happy and attractive side, not the dark and uninviting side
of things. Show beauty, not homeliness; health, not sickness. Don’t show the wrinkles
you propose to remove, but the face as it will appear. Your customers know all about
wrinkles.

In advertising a dentifrice, show pretty teeth, not bad teeth. Talk of coming good
conditions, not conditions which exist. In advertising clothes, picture well-dressed
people, not the shabby. Picture successful men, not failures, when you advertise a
business course. Picture what others wish to be, not what they may be now.

We are attracted by sunshine, beauty, happiness, health, success. Then point the
way to them, not the way out of the opposite.

Picture envied people, not the envious.

Tell people what to do, not what to avoid.

Make your every ad breathe good cheer. We always dodge a Lugubrious Blue.

Assume that people will do what you ask. Say, “Send now for this sample.” Don’t
say, “Why do you neglect this offer?” That suggests that people are neglecting. Invite
them to follow the crowd.

Compare the results of two ads, one negative, one positive. One presenting the
dark side, one the bright side. One warning, the other inviting. You will be surprised.
You will find that the positive ad out pulls the other four to one, if you have our
experience.

The “Before and after taking” ads are follies of the past. They never had a place
save with the afflicted. Never let their memory lead you to picture the gloomy side of
things.

 Letter Writing

This another phase of advertising which all of us have to consider. It enters, or
should enter, into all campaigns. Every business man receives a large number of circular
letters. Most of them go direct to the waste basket. But he acts on others, and others are
filed for reference.

Analyze those letters. The ones you act on or the ones you keep have a headline
which attracted your interest. At a glance they offer something that you want, something
you may wish to know.

Remember that point in all advertising.

A certain buyer spends $50,000,000 per year. Every letter, every circular which
comes to his desk gets its deserved attention. He wants information on the lines he buys.

But we have often watched him. In one minute a score of letters may drop into
the waste basket. Then one is laid aside. That is something to consider at once. Another
is filed under the heading “Varnish.” And later when he buys varnish that letter will turn
up.

That buyer won several prizes by articles on good buying. His articles were based
on information. Yet the great masses of matter which came to him never got more than a
glance.

The same principles apply to all advertising. Letter writers overlook them just as
advertisers do. They fail to get the right attention. They fail to tell what buyers wish to
know.

One magazine sends out millions of letters annually. Some to get subscriptions,
some to sell books. Before the publisher sends out five million letters he puts a few
thousands to test. He may try twenty-five letters, each with a thousand prospects. He
learns what results will cost. Perhaps the plan is abandoned because it appears
unprofitable. If not, the letter which pays best is the letter that he uses.

Just as men are doing now in all scientific advertising.

Mail order advertisers do likewise. They test their letters as they test their ads. A
general letter is never used until it proves itself best among many actual returns.

-----

Letter writing has much to do with advertising. Letters to inquirers, follow-up
letters. Wherever possible they should be tested. Where that is not possible, they should
be based on knowledge gained by tests.

We find the same difference in letters as in ads. Some get action, some do not.
Some complete a sale, some forfeit the impression gained. These are letters, going usually
to half-made converts, that are tremendously important.

Experience generally shows that a two-cent letter gets no more attention than a
one-cent letter. Fine stationery no more than poor stationery. The whole appeal lies in
the matter.

A letter which goes to an inquirer is like a salesman going to an interested
prospect. You know what created that interest. Then follow it up along that line, not on
some different argument. Complete the impression already created. Don’t undertake
another guess.

Do something if possible to get immediate action. Offer some inducement for it.
Or tell what delay may cost. Note how many successful selling letters place a limit on an
offer. It expires on a certain date. That is all done to get prompt decision, to overcome
the tendency to delay.

A mail order advertiser offered a catalog. The inquirer might send for three or
four similar catalogs. He had that competition in making a sale.

So he wrote a letter when he sent his catalog, and enclosed a personal card. He
said, “You are a new customer, and we want to make you welcome. So when you send
your order please enclose this card. The writer wants to see that you get a gift with order
— something you can keep.”

With an old customer he gave some other reason for the gift. The offer aroused
curiosity. It gave preference to his catalog. Without some compelling reason for ordering
elsewhere, the woman sent the order to him. The gift paid for itself several times over by
bringing larger sales per catalog.

The ways for getting action are many. Rarely can one way be applied to two lines.
But the principles are universal. Strike while the iron is hot. Get a decision then. Have it
followed by prompt action when you can.

You can afford to pay for prompt action rather than lose by delay. One advertiser
induced hundreds of thousands of women to buy six packages of his product and send
him the trademarks, to secure a premium offer good only for one week.

 A Name That Helps

There is great advantage in a name that tells a story. The name is usually
prominently displayed. To justify the space it occupies, it should aid the advertising.
Some such names are almost complete advertisements in themselves. May Breath is such
a name. Cream of Wheat is another. That name alone has been worth a fortune. Other
examples are Dutch Cleanser, Cuticura, Dynashine, Minute Tapioca, 3-in-One Oil,
Holeproof, Alcorub, etc.

Such names may be protected, yet the name itself describes the product, so it
makes a valuable display.

Other coined names are meaningless. Some examples are Kodak, Karo, Sapolio,
Vaseline, Kotex, Lux, Postum, etc. They can be protected, and long-continued
advertising may give them a meaning. When this is accomplished they become very
valuable.

But the great majority of them never attain status.

Such names do not aid the advertising. It is very doubtful that they justify display.
The service of the product, not the name, is the important thing in advertising. A vast
amount of space is wasted in displaying names and pictures which tell no selling story.
The tendency of modern advertising is to eliminate waste.

Other coined names signify ingredients which anyone may use. Examples are
Syrup of Figs, Coconut Oil Shampoo, Tar Soap, Palmolive Soap, etc.

Such products may dominate a market if the price is reasonable, but they must to
a degree meet competition. They invite substitution. They are naturally classified with
other products which have like ingredients, so the price must remain in that class.

Toasted Corn Flakes and Malted Milk are examples of unfortunate names. In
each of those cases one advertiser created a new demand. When the demand was created,
others shared it because they could use the name. The originators depended only on a
brand. It is interesting to speculate on how much more profitable a coined name might
have been.

-----

On a patented product it must be remembered that the right to a name expires
with that patent. Names like Castoria, Aspirin, Shredded Wheat Biscuit, etc., have
become common property.

This is a very serious point to consider. It often makes a patent an undesirable
protection.

Another serious fault in coined names is frivolity. In seeking uniqueness one gets
something trivial. And that is a fatal handicap in a serious product. It almost prohibits
respect.

When a product must be called by a common name, the best auxiliary name is a
man’s name. It is much better than a coined name, for it shows that some man is proud
of his creation.

Thus the question of a name is of serious importance in laying the foundations of
a new undertaking. Some names have become the chief factors in success. Some have
lost for their originators four-fifths of the trade they developed.

 Good Business

A rapid stream ran by the writer’s boyhood home. The stream turned a wooden
wheel and the wheel ran a mill. Under that primitive method, all but a fraction of the
streams potentiality went to waste.

Then someone applied scientific methods to that stream — put in a turbine and
dynamos. Now, with no more water, no more power, it runs a large manufacturing plant.

We think of that stream when we see wasted advertising power. And we see it
everywhere — hundreds of examples. Enormous potentialities — millions of circulation
— used to turn a mill wheel. While others use that same power with manifold effect.

We see countless ads running year after year which we know to be unprofitable.
Men spending five dollars to do what one dollar might do. Men getting back 30 percent
of their cost when they might get 150 percent. And the facts could be easily proved.

We see wasted space, frivolity, clever conceits, entertainment. Costly pages filled
with palaver which, if employed by a salesman, would reflect on his sanity. But those ads
are always unkeyed. The money is spent blindly, merely to satisfy some advertising whim.

Not new advertisers only. Many an old advertiser has little or no idea of his
advertising results. The business is growing through many efforts combined, and
advertising is given its share of the credit.

An advertiser of many years standing, spending as high as $700,000 per year, told
the writer he did not know whether his advertising was worth anything or not.
Sometimes he thought that his business would be just as large without it.

The writer replied, “I do know. Your advertising is utterly unprofitable, and I
could prove it to you next week. End an ad with an offer to pay five dollars to anyone
who writes you that he read the ad through. The scarcity of replies will amaze you.”

Think what a confession — that millions of dollars being spent without
knowledge of results. Such a policy applied to all factors in a business would bring ruin in
short order.

You see other ads which you may not like as well. They may seem crowded or
verbose. They are not attractive to you, for you are seeking something to admire,

-----

something to entertain. But you will note that those ads are keyed. The probability is that
out of scores of traced ads the type which you see has paid the best.

Many other ads which are not keyed now were keyed at the beginning. They are
based on known statistics. They won on a small scale before they ever ran on large scale.
Those advertisers are utilizing their enormous powers in full.

Advertising is prima facie evidence that the man who pays believes that
advertising is good. It has brought great results to others, it must be good for him. So he
takes it like some secret tonic which others have endorsed. If the business thrives, the
tonic gets credit. Otherwise, the failure is due to fate.

That seems almost unbelievable. Even a storekeeper who inserts a twenty-dollar
ad knows whether it pays or not. Every line of a big store’s ad is charged to the proper
department. And every inch used must the next day justify its cost.

Yet most national advertising is done without justification. It is merely presumed
to pay. A little test might show a way to multiply returns.

Such methods, still so prevalent, are not very far from their end. The advertising
men who practice them see the writing on the wall. The time is fast coming when men
who spend money are going to know what they get. Good business and efficiency will be
applied to advertising. Men and methods will be measured by the known returns, and
only competent men can survive.

Only one hour ago an old advertising man said to the writer, “The day for our
type is done. Bunk has lost its power. Sophistry is being displaced by actuality. And I
tremble at the trend.”

So do hundreds tremble. Enormous advertising is being done along scientific
lines. Its success is common knowledge. Advertisers along other lines will not much
longer be content.

We who can meet the test welcome these changed conditions. Advertisers will
multiply when they see that advertising can be safe and sure. Small expenditures made on
a guess will grow to big ones on a certainty. Our line of business will be finer, cleaner,
when the gamble is removed. And we shall be prouder of it when we are judged on
merit.
