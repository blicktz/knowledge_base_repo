###### communication at three stages: before the copy is written, after the commercials are produced, and in test markets. But, unlike me, they do not believe that testing can measure persuasion.
 All their commercials include a ‘moment of con�rmation’. They show a woman squeezing the Charmin and attesting to its softness. They show a housewife observing that Era gets out grease spots.
 In 60 per cent of their commercials they use demonstrations, showing how Bounty absorbs more liquid, how Top Job cleans better than straight ammonia, how Zest leaves no �lm.
 Their commercials talk directly to the consumer, using language and situations that are familiar to her. If the product is for use in the bathroom, they show it in a bathroom, not in a laboratory.
 They go to great pains to communicate the brand name, verbally and visually. Most of their names are short and simple. They appear within the �rst ten seconds of the commercial, and an average of three times thereafter.
 Their commercials deliver the promise verbally, and reinforce it with supers. And they usually end with a repetition of the promise. They tend to use a lot of words, sometimes more than a hundred in a 30-second commercial.
 When Procter & Gamble uses a continuing character to sell a brand, he or she is always an unknown actor or actress, never a celebrity.
 Less than half their commercials include a ‘reason why’. They have come to think it su�cient to show consumers what the product will do for them, without explaining why it does it.
 Very often they also show the users of their products deriving some emotional bene�t. Like ‘You’ll be more appreciated if you use Dash.’
 They use television techniques which have been proved to sell – however much their agencies may regard them as old hat. Notably slices of life, user testimonials and talking heads.
 Until 1976, Procter & Gamble eschewed music, but they are now using it, albeit in only 10 per cent of their commercials. And they now use a touch of humor in some of their commercials.

-----

###### While their commercials are often extremely competitive, they do not spend their money naming competing brands. They refer to ‘the other leading detergent’.
 Once they have evolved a campaign that works, they keep it running for a long time, in many cases for ten years or more. But they continually test new executions of the ongoing strategy.
 Once they establish an advertising budget, they continually test higher levels of expenditure.
 Only 30 per cent of their budgets go into prime evening time. The rest is divided between daytime and fringe. Instead of using 30- second spots exclusively, they have been using an increasing number of 45s, �nding that the extra 15 seconds allows for better ‘situation development’ and ‘viewer involvement’.
 Almost all P&G brands are advertised throughout the year. They have found that this works better than ‘�ighting’ – running them six weeks on, six weeks o�. It also provides considerable cost savings.
 After competing with P&G in several categories for 30 years, my respect for their acumen knows no bounds. However, they are not infallible. They can be beaten, for all their research and all their testing. Some of their products have failed, including Teel liquid detergent, Drene shampoo, Big Top peanut butter and Certain bathroom tissues.
 Their Achilles’ heel is their consistency. They are always predictable. It helps to win battles when you can anticipate the enemy’s strategy.
 The best of all ways to beat P&G is, of course, to market a better product. Bell Brand potato chips defeated P&G’s Pringles because they tasted better. And Rave overtook Lilt in less than a year because, not containing ammonia, it is a better product. I cannot refrain from adding that both these giant-killers are advertised by guess who?

 18 Miracles of research

###### dvertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals. Before I became a

## A

###### copywriter, I was a researcher. I delivered the �rst paper on copy- testing in the history of British advertising. Later I ran Dr. Gallup’s Audience Research Institute in Princeton, predicting how many people would see movies before they were produced, measuring the ability of the stars to sell tickets at the box o�ce, and so on.
 The best fun I ever had was in the early days of Ogilvy & Mather, when I was both Research Director and Creative Director. On Friday afternoons I wrote research reports to the Creative Director. On Monday mornings I changed hats, read my reports and decided what to do about them – if anything. In due course I was able to a�ord the services of Stanley Canter, a far better researcher. It took Stanley only ten days to get me out of his department. Like I always say, hire people who are better than you are.

 Here are 18 of the miracles research can perform for you:

 1 It can measure the reputation of your company among consumers, security analysts, government o�cials, newspaper editors, the academic community.

 2 Using mathematical models, research can estimate the sales of new products, and the advertising expenditures required to achieve maximum pro�ts. The Hendry, Assessor, Sprinter, ESP and News models are su�ciently reliable to tell you whether your product warrants the expense of test marketing. (About 60 per cent of new products fail in test markets.)

-----

###### 3 Research can get consumer reactions to a new product when it is still in the conceptual state. After one of our clients had invested $600,000 in developing a line of food products for senior citizens whose digestions were deteriorating, our research found a notable lack of enthusiasm among the old parties concerned. When I reported this disappointing news to the client, I was afraid that, like most executives faced with inconvenient research, he would argue with our methodology. I underestimated him. ‘Dry hole’, said he, and left the meeting.

###### 4 Once a product is ready for market, research can tell you how consumers rate it compared with the products they are now buying. If they �nd your product inferior, send it back to your Research and Development people.

 5 Research can tell you what formulation, �avor, fragrance and color will appeal to most consumers.

-----

###### 6 Research can �nd out which of several package designs will sell best. While you’re about it, �nd out if people can open your package. I shall never forget Cornelia Otis Skinner demonstrating to a big food company that she could not open their products without a pair of pliers.

 7 Research can help you decide the optimum positioning for your product.

 8 Research can de�ne your target audience. Men or women. Young or old. Rich or poor. Education. Life style. Media habits.

 9 It can �nd out what factors are most important in the purchase decision, and what vocabulary consumers use when talking about your kind of product.

 10 Research can determine what ‘line extension’ is likely to sell best. After Dove carved out a pro�table niche in the soap market, Lever Brothers fell to wondering what other products could be marketed under the same name. Research revealed that a liquid for washing dishes stood the best chance, and it was successfully introduced.

 11 Research can warn you when consumers show signs of �nding an established product less desirable than it once was. Maybe they have noticed that you have been using cheaper ingredients; they usually do.

 12 Research can save you time and money by ‘reading’ your competitor’s test markets – even his cost of goods and pro�t margin. All the information is there to get, if you know where to �nd it.

 13 Research can determine the most persuasive promise. ‘Promise, large promise is the soul of an advertisement,’ said Samuel Johnson. When he auctioned o� the contents of the Anchor Brewery he made the following promise: ‘We are not here to sell boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice.’

-----

###### Dr. Johnson was right 200 years ago, and there is abundant evidence that he is still right today. Advertising which promises no bene�t to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever. (That is the most important sentence in this book. Read it again.)
 Only last year Starch reported that advertisements with headlines that promise a bene�t are read by an average of four times more people than advertisements that don’t.
 In my experience, the selection of the promise is the most valuable contribution that research can make to the advertising process. One method is to show the consumer a number of promises, telling him or her that each promise is for a new product. The consumer is asked to rate the promises for importance and uniqueness.
 Another technique, which I prefer, is not favored by researchers, perhaps because it is so simple and does not require their services. You write two advertisements for your product, each with a di�erent promise in the headline. At the end of the copy you o�er a free sample of the product. You then run the advertisements in a newspaper or magazine, in such a way that half the circulation gets one headline, and the other half gets the other headline. The headline which draws the more applications for a sample wins the test. This technique, which is called split-run, was invented by Richard Stanton. Its merit is that it tests promises in the context of advertisements, instead of the unreal context of an interview. But you can only test two headlines at a time.
 Try to �nd a promise which is not only persuasive, but also unique. For example, ‘makes a perfect cup of co�ee every time’ may get the highest score on persuasion, but it is not unique. You may �nd that ‘gets you clean’ is the winning promise for a soap, but I doubt if it is su�ciently unique to make the cash register ring.
 Sometimes you will �nd that the promise which wins your test is already being used by one of your competitors. Poor you.

 14 Research can tell you which of several premiums will work best. When thirty-�ve di�erent premiums were tested by Shell, steak

-----

###### knives won. Di�erent designs of steak knives were then tested. When I suggested that packets of shells from Sanibel Island should be o�ered to motorists who used Shell credit cards, I was coldly informed that shells had been tested and had received a very low score. In France, they were used as the premium without being tested, and �opped.

 15 Research can tell you whether your advertising communicates what you want it to communicate. Keep in mind E. B. White’s warning, ‘When you say something, make sure you have said it. The chances of your having said it are only fair’

 16 Research can tell you which of several television commercials will sell the most.
 What is the best technique for pre-testing television commercials? This is the most controversial issue in the advertising business, but there is common agreement among researchers that testing for recall is for the birds. Yet, for reasons which escape me, most advertisers still insist on using it. It has four shortcomings:

 A Nobody has been able to demonstrate a relationship between
 recall and sales.

 B Some commercials which score about average on recall, score
 below average on their ability to change the viewer’s brand preference. Celebrity commercials, for example, usually score above average on recall and below average on changing brand preference.

 C It is too easy for the copywriter to cheat. ‘When I want a high
 recall score,’ says my partner David Scott, ‘all I have to do is to show a gorilla in a jock strap.’

 D It is open to question whether recall tests even measure recall.
 I believe they measure the viewer’s ability to articulate what he or she recalls, which is a very di�erent thing.

-----

###### For all these reasons, I prefer testing methods which measure your commercial’s ability to change brand preferences.
 Research can measure the wear-out of your advertising. For �ve years, the theme of Shell’s commercials was mileage, and tracking studies recorded increasingly favorable attitudes to the product. When attitudes �nally stopped improving, the advertising was changed from demonstrations of mileage to consumer testimonials, and the upward trend was resumed.

 17 Research can tell you how many people read your advertisements, and how many remember them.
 What do grown-ups read in newspapers? The comic strips? The editorials? The weather? The stock market? The sports pages? The main news items? The columnists? Until Gallup came along, editors hadn’t the faintest idea who read what.
 Gallup invented a method of measuring readership. He interviewed representative samples of readers, took them through the newspaper and had them point to the things they had read. It came as a surprise to editors when he reported that more people read the comics then their editorials, and that captions under photographs were read by more people than the articles. When he repeated the same research in Britain, he got the same results. During World War II my brother Francis, then a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force, slept in the underground bunker which was the center of the high command. He told me that when the Generals, Admirals and Air Marshals came into breakfast, they looked at the comic strips in the Daily Mirror before they read the headlines in The Times.

###### When Raymond Rubicam got wind of Gallup’s research, he persuaded him to join Young & Rubicam and apply the same method to measuring the readership of advertisements. At about the same time, Daniel Starch started syndicating readership reports to agencies and advertisers, and his successors still do so. The day I spent watching a Starch interviewer at work in the �eld convinced me that the procedure is reasonably valid.

 18 Research can settle arguments. When Lord Geddes became Chairman of British Travel, he argued that we should feature trout �shing in advertisements – until I pulled out of a chart showing that �shing interested American tourists less than all the 49 other subjects we had tested.

###### Armed with this kind of information, it is di�cult not to defeat competitors who �y blind. But there are two vital questions that research cannot answer:

 Which campaign will make the biggest contribution to your
 brand over a period of years? Here you still have to rely on judgment.

-----

###### What price should you charge for your product? This is one of
 the most important questions which confront marketers, but, as far as I know, research cannot answer it.

 Given su�cient training, any intelligent person can learn to conduct surveys, but getting people to use the results requires salesmanship of a high order. When I did research for the motion picture industry, I had my reports set in type and printed. I found that the Hollywood producers were less likely to argue with printed documents than typewritten memos.

 Size of sample Surveys can produce reliable results with amazingly small samples. If you want to know whether the word obsolete is understood by housewives, you don’t need an answer which will be statistically reliable within two percentage points. Twenty housewives will su�ce. When, however, you are looking for trends over time, you had better use larger samples to be sure that any changes are statistically signi�cant. You must also hold the composition of your sample and the wording of your questions rigidly constant.

 Pitfalls of research Some interviewers �nd it more comfortable to answer questionnaires themselves than to accost strangers. An enterprising London pub used to cater to them by setting aside a private room where they could drink beer while �lling out questionnaires.
 Respondents do not always tell the truth to interviewers. I used to start my questionnaires by asking, ‘Which would you rather hear on the radio tonight – Jack Benny or a Shakespeare play?’ If the respondent said Shakespeare, I knew he was a liar and broke o� the interview.
 When Gone With the Wind was a runaway best seller, we asked a cross-section of the adult population whether they had read it. The number of yes replies was obviously in�ated; people did not want to admit that they hadn’t read it. The following week we put the
