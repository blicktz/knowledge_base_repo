##### My failures far outnumbered my successes. In fact, I have yet to find anybody who has experienced the number of failures I experienced during the early stages of my career. But it was through these failures that I received a very costly education that to this day has guided me through a successful career in advertising and direct marketing.
 To the public, I was a big success. Babe Ruth is remembered for his home run record and not for the fact that he also held the record for the most strikeouts. And so it was with me. Most people just saw my successes, as they were quite visible. And they just saw my successful innovations because they were the ones that worked. So to the general public and to others in direct marketing, it appeared that I had the Midas touch.
 I didn’t see myself running seminars. I was busy enough running my business. And to share my secrets with the industry was only asking for competition. But it was a series of coincidences that prompted me to offer seminar courses and I’m glad I made the decision to do them. And many of my participants are glad, too—people whose seminar experience made an enormous difference in their lives.
 My seminar was different. First, I was an actual practitioner—not an educator or a consultant who never had to make a major marketing gamble or cover a payroll. I was out there on the firing line, making sure each day that the copy I was writing and the marketing decisions I was making were going to be accepted by the marketplace.
 Second, it was during a time when my success was reaching a peak. Our mail order ads were appearing everywhere. They appeared in newspapers and magazines and on airplanes and with such regularity and frequency that the format was attracting a great deal of attention and creating an entire flock of imitators.
 Finally, I realized what people were willing to pay just to hear me as a speaker or talk to me as a consultant. Bernie Pargh, an entrepreneur and owner of B.A. Pargh, a business equipment sales company, flew from Nashville to Los Angeles one day just to hear me speak to a direct marketing group. “Joe, I’ve spent over $1,000 just to hear you speak for 45 minutes,” he told me.

##### I would also get calls from people who had marketing problems and would want to fly to visit me in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, where our company was based, just to sit and talk to me for 15 minutes.

# The Fateful Visit

##### But the seminar would never have taken place had it not been for a small vacation I took up to northern Wisconsin to visit my sister and her family.
 It was during that trip that I discovered the beauty of the north woods and made the decision, with my family, to find a second home there. The home I eventually found was a 10,000-square-foot, two-story building on a 16-acre site overlooking one of the most beautiful lakes I had ever seen. The property was filled with virgin timber—tall, stately pines and oak trees that had escaped the lumbermen who cleared most of the trees from northern Wisconsin during the 1800s.
 But the home was costly and at the time something I couldn’t afford. The price in 1977 was $350,000 and I couldn’t really justify it until my lawyer and close personal friend, George Gerstman, suggested I could use the facility as a seminar site. “Hold marketing seminars at the place, turn it into a business and you could write off the entire property and even make a profit,” he suggested.
 The idea really appealed to me. It was a very unique setting. It was isolated and quiet, and the fresh northern Wisconsin air at Minocqua was stimulating and invigorating.
 I spent a great deal of the summer going up there with my family and furnishing the facility for a seminar. I cleared away a number of the odd buildings that dated back to the 1800s but were in such disrepair that I had no choice but to remove them. My wife at the time, Wendy, helped pick out the furniture and dishes. She also hired a cook, housekeepers and the support staff needed to run the seminars while Mary Stanke, my operations chief at JS&A, assisted with registering the participants and preparing all the materials for the seminar. And so within a few months the facility was transformed into an enchanting seminar site—a learning center that I called “Nature’s Response.”

# The Most Expensive Seminar

##### Back in 1977, I was charging $2,000 for five days—a price that made it, at the time, the most expensive seminar in the direct marketing business. For my seminars 10 years later, I charged $3,000. I announced the seminar in Advertising Age and Direct Marketing magazines in the format of one of my typical ads. And the response was immediate. If Bernie Pargh was willing to spend $1,000 to fly to Los Angeles to hear me speak for 45 minutes and several people were willing to fly from different parts of the United States to talk to me for just 15 minutes, I had a value that certainly was worth $2,000 for five full days.
 Within a few weeks, I had a full class with participants from all over the world. We had somebody from Germany, several from California and quite a few from the East Coast. We had a farmer from Texas and a dentist from Carmel, California. Richard Viguerie, the conservative Washington fund- raiser, enrolled and of course Bernie Pargh attended. I actually had more participants than I wanted so I created a reservation list for my next seminar.
 To get to Minocqua, the seminar participants had to fly to Chicago, board a commuter plane there and fly to the town of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where they then took a bus for the 40-minute ride to their motel. To get to the seminar site, the participants took a pontoon boat from the motel and landed at our boathouse where they walked up a path to the house.
 And at the house, they would find several rooms outfitted as classrooms, a large dining room, a kitchen and a very large wooden balcony where they could look out at the lake, relax and enjoy the clean north-woods air.
 It was an idyllic setting in a remote part of America—a place where my students would learn a form of copywriting and marketing that they could not learn anyplace else.

# The Book Contains Many Lessons

##### This book shares many of the lessons and experiences that were taught at these seminars. You’ll learn how to mentally prepare yourself to write copy, how to write effective copy, and how to present your product, concept or service in a novel and exciting way. You’ll learn what really works and what doesn’t and how to avoid many of the pitfalls that marketers fall into —and much more.
 I convey my unique approach to copy by demonstrating my thought process on everything from how copy should flow to the elements every ad should have—from the psychology of copy and its motivational triggers to the emotions generated by words. But the seminar was certainly more than learning about copy and marketing.
 The seminar turned into a motivational experience for many who went on to become quite successful. Others, who were already successful, couldn’t wait to get back to work and implement their new knowledge. And they too grew in the process.
 You too will understand how to relate what you’ve learned about copywriting to other forms of marketing and you’ll see how many of the same principles apply.

# The Goal of Copy

##### Throughout this book, I talk about the eventual goal of writing effective copy, namely: “To cause a person to exchange his or her hard-earned money for a product or service.” It’s really as simple as that.
 Direct marketing is truly the tool of this century. Using it, you can move millions of people to reach into their pockets for millions of dollars—all from the power of your pen or the message you convey in print, on TV, on radio or on a computer screen.
 For most of what I teach in this book I use a print ad as a reference point. Print ads are among the most difficult of all forms of direct marketing. On a single page, in two dimensions, located in a medium with hundreds of competing messages and without sound or motion, you’ve got to entice a person to start reading your ad, convey the complete story of your product or service and then convince the person to reach for the phone and order. To understand this process and to effectively implement it requires a lot of experience and skill. But once you have mastered the skills, you will have the ability to build a business from just the power of your pen and with very little capital.
 When Mike Valentine attended my seminar, he was operating his radar detector company out of his garage. Later, using many of the skills I taught him, he grew his company, Cincinnati Microwave (developer of the Escort Radar Detector), to a $140 million public company. Jimmy Calano was a young 20-something entrepreneur who had been giving small management seminars when he attended my course. He eventually became a major force in the seminar business with CareerTrack—a multi-million-dollar company. Victoria’s Secret sent two of their top marketing people when the company consisted of just two stores and a catalog. They eventually were acquired by The Limited and became a powerful retail chain throughout the country.
 From a UPS driver who had a fascination with direct marketing and came to the seminar with his last $2,000 to Joe Karbo, author of The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches, who already was a very successful mail order entrepreneur —they all came with great anticipation and they all left with valuable knowledge that helped them continue to grow and prosper.

# 17 Seminars Given

##### I had 312 students attending 17 seminars—from the first one in the summer of 1977 to the last one given in Maui, Hawaii, in the spring of 2000. The rest of my writing and marketing insights come from several years of experience since then in the visual medium of TV—infomercials, TV spots and home shopping.
 Regardless of your current educational level or knowledge of marketing, this book will give you fresh insights into the world of copywriting, marketing, human behavior, the Internet, public relations and other lessons taught at my seminar.
 Even if you are not interested in writing copy, you’ll have a better appreciation and understanding of the copywriting process—so much so that you will be confident that you too can write good copy or, at a minimum, critique copy.
 So pull up an easy chair, prop your feet up and sink into one of the most comprehensive contemporary books on the subject of copywriting, marketing and creative expression—a treasure chest of insights that will entertain as it teaches.

 Understanding the Process

# Preview

##### This handbook is based on a book I wrote in 1998 called Advertising Secrets of the Written Word. The book consisted of the lessons I had taught at exclusive seminars I conducted beginning in 1977.
 My challenge was to take the first book, revise it to make it current and add many of the copywriting techniques to be considered when you write for the Internet, direct mail, public relations releases and other copywriting tasks. In the revision process I had to reread my book chapter by chapter and revise it where necessary. What I discovered in this process was that all the principles remained the same regardless of changes in the way we communicate that have occurred since I wrote it.
 The modifications were primarily to update certain facts and figures that had changed over time or to cite a few examples that were more contemporary. Regardless of the media, however, one fact emerged. You should always first express whatever product or service you are selling in a print direct response ad. It is in this format that you can develop the real essence of your product or service.
 That’s exactly what I do. If I have to sell something on the Internet, in a catalog, or on TV, I first produce a print ad. And from the print ad, if I do my job correctly, I will find the clues and the concepts that best reflect the strong selling points that I can use in any other media.
 With a print ad, you won’t have the interactive nature of the Internet or the motion of TV images. You’ll need to sell your product or service on a flat piece of paper with no sound, no motion—just your words.
 In the first section of this handbook, I take you through the step-by-step creative process of writing that print direct response ad. I think you will be surprised at how easy it will seem once you read the simple steps involved and learn about the thinking process you have to develop.
 I take the mystery out of the process and at the same time show you how you can create great copy even if you’ve never written any direct response copy before.
 In fact, the most often heard comment I’ve gotten from those who read my book is simply “I now realize how easy it is to write great copy.”

##### I have built several businesses from the power of my pen. Being able to write copy for your own business is a powerful tool that will serve you for the rest of your life. And to learn how, let me guide you through the steps you will follow as you quickly master this skill.

# Chapter 1

 General Knowledge

##### The preparation to become a copywriter involves knowledge. There are two types. The first is a very broad or general knowledge and the second is a very specific or targeted knowledge. Let me explain.
 The best copywriters in the world are those who are curious about life, read a great deal, have many hobbies, like to travel, have a variety of interests, often master many skills, get bored and then look for other skills to master. They hunger for experience and knowledge and find other people interesting. They are very good listeners.
 Look at my background. I’m an instrument-rated multi-engine commercial pilot, an amateur radio operator, and a professional photographer; I love computers, music, reading, movies, travel, art and design. I’ve done the complete catalog for my company including everything from setting the type to doing the layout. I’ve done all the photography and even some of the modeling. (My hand became quite famous, but more on that later.) I’ve tried many sports—golf, tennis, football, baseball, basketball, scuba diving, skiing, and snowmobiling. I’ve traveled to every continent on the globe with the exception of the Antarctic and I know I’ll eventually get there. I’ve mastered a second language— German—during the three years I spent with the military in Germany. I’ve had hundreds of failures and many successes, with each representing a learning experience.

 The best copywriters have a variety of interests and master many skills.

##### The thirst for knowledge, a tremendous curiosity about life, a wealth of experiences and not being afraid to work are the top credentials for being a good copywriter.
 If you examine the lives of some of our greatest writers, you will see that they experienced a great deal and wrote about their experiences. Hemingway, Steinbeck—both lived and then wrote about their adventures. The more we experience and the more knowledge we have, the easier it is to come up with that big copy idea or marketing concept.
 But more significantly, it is important to experience as much in life as possible and not to fear failure. It’s not whether you win or lose in life that’s important but whether you play the game. Lose enough and eventually you will win—it’s only a matter of time. Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid camera, said it best when he described his definition of a mistake: “A mistake is a future benefit, the full value of which is yet to be realized.”
 I can remember when I was very young and would fail at something I had tried very hard to accomplish. I’d often say to myself, “No big loss—it’s in my back pocket. One of these days I’ll use what I’ve just experienced simply by reaching into my back pocket, and presto, I will have the answer just when I need it.”
