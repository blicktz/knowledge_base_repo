### About the Author

##### Joseph Sugarman is recognized as one of the most effective and prolific advertising copywriters in America. As CEO of JS&A Group, Inc., he introduced hundreds of space-age electronics products in the 1970s and 1980s, setting the standard for other copywriters and marketers.
 He was born and raised in the Chicago area and attended the electrical engineering college of the University of Miami for three and a half years before being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1962.
 He then spent over three years in Germany where he served with the Army Intelligence Service and later with the CIA. Returning home, he formed a company to market Austrian ski lifts in the United States and then later formed his own advertising agency to service ski resort accounts.
 In 1971, after six years of running his own ad agency, he saw microelectronics as an exciting opportunity and formed a company to market the world’s first pocket calculator through direct marketing—all from the basement of his home in Northbrook, Illinois.
 His company, JS&A Group, Inc., soon grew to become America’s largest single source of space-age products, and he eventually introduced dozens of new innovations and concepts in electronics during the 1970s and 1980s, including the pocket calculator, the digital watch, cordless telephones, computers and a variety of other electronic items. Each product introduction was made in large, full-page advertisements, which became the recognized signature of his creative work.
 In 1973, Sugarman’s company was the first in the United States to use the 800 WATS line service to take credit card orders over the telephone— something that direct marketers had never done before.
 In 1986, JS&A concentrated solely on its line of BluBlocker[®] sunglasses, which he sold in direct mailings, mail order ads and catalogs and on TV through infomercials, TV spots and QVC, the home shopping channel. BluBlocker Corporation is currently celebrating 20 years in business with 20 million pairs sold worldwide.
 In 1979, Sugarman was selected as the Direct Marketing Man of the Year in an award ceremony in New York. In 1991, he won the prestigious
