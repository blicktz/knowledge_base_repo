Have you ever noticed how certain commercial organizations refer to their customers,
subscribers, or followers as members of the “XYZ community?” I think it’s for the same reason other
such organizations cite membership in the “ZYX _family” Each designation recruits a powerful,_
primordial sense of “we”-ness.
17. The evidence of willingness to answer a survey, follow the recommendation of an Amazon
product reviewer, overestimate one’s home state’s role in history, oppose the war in Afghanistan, and
desert one’s military unit comes from Edwards, Dillman, & Smyth (2014), Forman, Ghose, &
Wiesenfeld (2008), Putnam et al. (2018), Kriner & Shen (2012), and Costa & Kahn (2008),
respectively. According to Levine (1997), Sugihara’s visas salvaged the lives of up to ten thousand
Jews, the majority of whom found asylum in Japanese territory. The events attendant to the Japanese
decision to shelter them have been described by several historians (e.g., Kranzler, 1976, and Ross,
1994); but the most detailed account is provided by Marvin Tokayer, the former chief rabbi of Tokyo
(Tokayer & Swartz, 1979). My own account is modified from a more academic version that appeared
in a coauthored textbook (Kenrick et al., 2020).

Observant readers may have noticed that when describing the murderous policies of the
Holocaust, I referred to them as Nazi, not German. That is the case because of my view that it is not
accurate or fair to equate the Nazi regime in Germany with the culture or people of that country, as is
sometimes done. After all, we don’t equate the culture and people of Cambodia or Russia or China or
Iberia or the United States with the brutal programs of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot, Stalin after
World War II, the Gang of Four during the Cultural Revolution, the conquistadores after Columbus,
or the Manifest Destiny enactors of adolescent America (the list could go on). Government regimes,
which often arise from temporary and powerful situational circumstances, do not fairly characterize a
people. Hence, I don’t conflate the two in discussing the time of Nazi ascendency in Germany.
18. For a review of the various types of behavioral-science data supporting the role of response
synchrony on feelings of unitization, including self–other identity confusion (e.g., Milward &
Carpenter, 2018; Palidino et al., 2010), see Wheatley et al. (2012). The tendency to coordinate
movements in time with rhythmic sounds appeared in our evolutionary past even earlier than the
Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras; chimps sway together in response to acoustic beats, something that
suggests the presence of the response in a common ancestor of approximately six million years ago
(Hattori & Tomonaga, 2020). One researcher described the groupings resulting from coordinated
movement among humans as temporary “neighborhoods,” in which members exert high levels of
influence over one another’s direction (Warren, 2018). The case for societal mechanisms designed to
foster collective solidarity is made particularly convincingly by Kesebir (2012) and Paez et al.

(2015). Demonstrations of the effects of acting together on “we”-ness, as well as on video-game
performance and brain-wave patterns, were provided by Koudenburg et al. (2015), von Zimmermann
& Richardson (2016), and Dikker et al. (2017), respectively. Consistent with the idea that aspiring
influencers might be able to benefit greatly from the unitizing effect of synchrony, consider the
sweeping summary statement of renowned world historian William H. McNeill (1995, p. 152):
“Moving rhythmically while giving voice together is the surest, most speedy, and efficacious way of
creating and sustaining [meaningful] communities that our species has ever hit upon.”
19. Studies of the homogenizing effects of coordinated movement via finger tapping, smiling, and
body shifting were conducted by Hove & Risen (2009), Cappella (1997), and Bernieri (1988),
respectively. The water-sipping experiment was done by Inzlicht, Gutsell, & Legault (2012), who
also included a third procedure in the study, in which subjects were required to imitate the watersipping actions of in-group (White) actors. That procedure produced the typical prejudice for Whites
over Blacks to a somewhat exaggerated degree.

Interestingly, there is one form of synchronous activity that has an additional benefit: when
directing attention to a piece of information, people do so with increased intensity (i.e., allot it greater
cognitive resources) if they see that they are attending to it simultaneously with someone else.
However, this will only be the case if they have a “we” relationship with the other person. It seems
that the act of paying conjoint attention to something along with a closely related other is a signal that
the thing warrants special focus (Shteynberg, 2015).
20. My statement that the gold standard of social influence is “supportive conduct” is not meant to
dismiss the importance of altering another’s feelings (or beliefs or perceptions or attitudes) within the
influence process. At the same time, it does seem to me that efforts to create change in these factors
are almost always undertaken in the service of creating change in supportive conduct. The tapping
study was performed by Valdesolo & DeSteno (2011), whereas the marching research was done by
Wiltermuth & Heath (2009). Marching in unison is an interesting practice in that it is still employed
in military training, even though its worth as a battlefield tactic disappeared long ago. In a pair of
experiments, Wiltermuth provides one compelling reason. After marching together, marchers became
more willing to comply with a fellow marcher’s request to harm members of an out-group; and this
was the case not only when the requester was an authority figure (Wiltermuth, 2012a) but also when
the requester was a peer (Wiltermuth, 2012b).
21. As evidence for the idea grows, there is increasing acceptance of the conception of music as a
socially unitizing mechanism that creates group solidarity and comes about via self–other merger
(Bannan, 2012; Dunbar, 2012; Harvey, 2018; Loersch & Arbuckle, 2013; Oesch, 2019; Savage et al.,
2020; Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014). Scholars aren’t alone in recognizing the unitizing function of
music, sometimes to comedic extents; it would be hard not to laugh at this one:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=etEQz7NYSLg. The study of helping among four-year-olds was done
by Kirschner & Tomasello (2010); conceptually similar results were obtained by Cirelli, Einarson, &
Trainor (2014) among much younger children: fourteen-month-old infants. A study of adults offers
an explanation for the helpfulness. Singing together leads to feelings of self-other merger with fellow
singers (Bullack et al.,2020).
22. Kahneman’s book, _Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011) is the source for the most complete_
exposition of System 1 and System 2 thinking. Evidence for the validity of the distinction between
the two systems is available there but also in less-fully-presented form from Epstein et al. (1992,
1999). The “I think” versus “I feel” evidence can be found in Clarkson, Tormala, & Rucker (2011)
and Mayer & Tormala (2010). But, in general, the wisdom of having a good match between the
emotional-versus-rational basis of an attitude and a persuasive argument can also be seen in Drolet &
Aaker (2002) and Sinaceur, Heath, & Cole (2005).
23. Bonneville-Roussy et al. (2013) review and contribute data showing that young women view
music as more important to them than clothing, films, books, magazines, computer games, TV, and
sports—but not romance. There’s solid scientific evidence that music and rhythm operate

-----

independently of rational processes (e.g., de la Rosa et al., 2012; Gold et al., 2013). The Elvis
Costello quote comes from an interesting article by Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis (2010), who added
her own piece of evidence to the mix by showing that giving audience members prior structural
information about musical pieces (excerpts from Beethoven string quartets) then reduced their
enjoyment of experiencing them.

The study of popular song content over a recent span of forty years, found that 80 percent
featured romantic and/or sexual themes (Madanika & Bartholomew, 2014). The French guitar-case
experiment (Guéguen, Meineri, & Fischer-Lokou, 2014) recorded the following percentages of
successful phone-number requests: guitar case = 31 percent, sports bag = 9 percent, nothing = 14
percent. Armstrong’s description of the effects of music on advertising success is presented on pp.
271–72 of his 2010 book.
24. The Mandy Len Catron _New_ _York_ _Times_ piece can be retrieved at
www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html, along
with a link to the thirty-six questions. The interview with Elaine Aron is available at
www.huffingtonpost.com/elaine-aron-phd/36-questions-for-intimacy_b_6472282.html. The scientific
article that served as the basis for the Catron essay is Aron et al. (1997). Evidence for the functional
importance of the reciprocal, turn-taking feature of the thirty-six-questions procedure is provided by
Sprecher et al. (2013). The procedure has been used in modified form to reduce prejudice between
ethnic groups, even among individuals with highly prejudiced initial attitudes (Page-Gould,
Mendoza-Denton, & Tropp, 2008).
25. Probably the most informed retelling of the Ernst Hess saga is that of historian Susanne Mauss
(Mauss, 2012), who discovered Himmler’s “letter of protection” in official Gestapo files and has
verified it through other documents. There is some debate among scholars as to whether Hitler
personally instructed Himmler to construct and send the letter or whether that was done by Hitler’s
personal adjutant, Fritz Wiedemann, on Hitler’s behalf. Although Hess’s untouchable status lasted
only a year (he was then placed in several forced-labor stations during the war, including a work
camp, a construction company, and a plumbing firm), he was never sent to a death camp as were
other members of his family, such as his sister who was gassed at Auschwitz. After the war, he
became a railroad executive, eventually rising to the presidency of the German Federal Railways
Authority in Frankfurt, where he died in 1983.

The researchers who analyzed the effects of shared suffering on fused in-group identity after the
Boston Marathon bombings performed a similar analysis on the effects of the prolonged conflict
between Northern Irish Unionists and Republicans and obtained similar results (Jong et al., 2015).
The work showing the impact of submerging one’s hands in ice water also demonstrated its effects
when using other kinds of pain-producing procedures such as eating a hot chili pepper and doing
repeated leg squats together with group members (Bastian, Jetten, & Ferris, 2014). For additional
research detailing the role of shared adversity in bringing about fused identities and subsequent
supportive and self-sacrificial conduct, see Drury (2018) and Whitehouse et al. (2017). For reviews
indicating that the concept of collective emotion is different in nature from that of individual
emotion, see Goldenberg et al. (2020) and Parkinson (2020).

More detail on the saga of Irish–Native American unity is available in various news accounts
(see, e.g., www.irishpost.com/news/irish-donate-native-american-tribes-hit-covid-19-repay-173-yearold-favour-184706; and https://nowthisnews.com/news/irish-repay-a-173-year-old-debt-to-nativecommunity-hard-hit-by-covid-19) and in an episode of the highly informative podcast _The Irish_
_Passport (www.theirishpassport.com/podcast/irish-and-native-american-solidarity). The extent of the_
wretchedness of the Trail of Tears ordeal is revealed in a little publicized fact. Its original label,
gleaned from a portrayal by a Choctaw chieftain, was “Trail of tears and death” (Faiman-Silva, 1997,
p. 19).
26. Aldo Leopold’s manifesto, A Sand County Almanac, which was first published in 1949 and has
since become a must-read primer for many wilderness groups, is the source of my treatment of his

-----

birch-versus-pine musings (see pp. 68–70 of the 1989 paperback edition). His strong belief that
wilderness management is best accomplished through an ecology-centric rather than a human-centric
approach is illustrated in his arguments against government predator-control policies in natural
environments. Stunning evidence supports his position in the case of predator wolves. A visual
presentation of that evidence is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q; you’ll be
glad you watched it.
27. The IKEA-effect research was performed by Norton, Mochon, & Ariely (2012). The study of
the evaluations of one’s coworkers and cocreated products was conducted in collaboration with
Jeffrey Pfeffer (Pfeffer & Cialdini, 1998)—one of the most impressive academic minds I know. The
effects of collaboration on three-year-olds’ sharing were demonstrated by Warneken et al. (2011).
The positive results of cooperative-learning techniques are summarized in Paluck & Green (2009)
and in Roseth, Johnson, & Johnson (2008); educators looking for information on how to implement
one such approach (“The Jigsaw Classroom” as developed by Elliot Aronson and his associates) can
find that information at www.jigsaw.org.

The survey study of the effects of asking for consumers’ advice on subsequent consumer
engagement was published by Liu & Gal (2011), who found, instructively, that paying consumers an
unexpectedly high amount for their advice eliminated any increased favoritism toward the brand;
although the researchers didn’t investigate why this was the case, they speculated that the unexpected
payment focused the participants away from the communal aspect of giving their advice and toward
an individuating aspect of it—in this instance, their own economic outcomes associated with a
financial exchange. For some examples of how various brands are employing cocreation practices to
enhance customer engagement, see www.visioncritical.com/5-examples-how-brands-are-using-cocreation, and a pair of links within: www.visioncritical.com/cocreation-101 and
www.greenbookblog.org/2013/10/01/co-creation-3-0. There’s a good reason brands use techniques
such as cocreation to bond consumers’ identities with their brand. Consumers who have a strong
feeling of shared identity with a brand (e.g., Apple) are more likely to ignore information about that
brand’s product failures in determining their attitudes and loyalties toward the brand (Lin & Sung,
2014).
28. The question of how kinship is determined by members of various species has been the subject
of myriad scientific investigations (e.g., Holmes, 2004; Holmes & Sherman, 1983; Mateo, 2003).
Although fewer in number, investigations of how humans go about the process have been particularly
informative for our purposes (Gyuris et al., 2020; Mateo, 2015). For instance, Wells (1987) reported
that the concept of “honorary kin”—unrelated individuals who are present in the home and who
acquire family-like titles as a result—exists in _all human cultures. Most instructively, see the_
landmark analysis of kin detection among humans by Lieberman and her associates (Lieberman,
Tooby, & Cosmides, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2016), as well as its brief summary in Cosmides & Tooby
(2013, pp. 219–22). My recommendation for parents to treat out-group visitors to the home as family
rather than guests gains support from research showing that children pick up and follow adults’
nonverbal signals toward social group members (Skinner, Olson, & Meltzoff, 2020).
29. Nai et al. (2018) collected the data showing the positive effects of living in a diverse
neighborhood on benevolence toward strangers and on identification with all humanity. Conceptually
similar effects have been found in more ethnically diverse regions and countries (Bai, Ramos, &
Fiske, 2020). Evidence of the favorable consequences of cross-group friendships on intergroup
attitudes, expectations, and actions for both majority and minority group members comes from a
variety of sources (Page-Gould et al., 2010; Pettigrew, 1997; Swart et al., 2011; Wright et al., 1997).
For example, in South Africa, “Colored” junior high school students who had cross-group friendships
with Whites held more trusting attitudes and less harmful intentions toward Whites in general
(Stewart et al., 2011). The version of the thirty-six questions that reduced prejudice among
individuals with hardened prejudicial attitudes was developed by Page-Gould et al. (2008). The

-----

significant role of self-disclosure in the beneficial effects of cross-group friendships appeared in
work by Davies et al. (2011) and Turner et al. (2007).
30. The unitizing effect of an American identity was found by Riek et al. (2010) and Levendusky
(2018), whereas a similar effect of genetic identity was confirmed by Kimel et al. (2016); Flade, Klar,
& Imhoff (2019) uncovered the comparable impact of a mutual enemy; see also Shnabel, Halabi, &
Noor (2013). The research on psychopaths’ susceptibility to the effects of shared identity was
conducted by Arbuckle & Cunningham (2012). McDonald et al. (2017) provided the evidence that
the regrettable tendency of groups to dehumanize rival groups (Haslem, 2006; Haslam & Loughnan,
2014; Kteily et al., 2015; Markowitz & Slovic, 2020; Smith, 2020) could be countered through the
shared experience of basic human emotions.

Evidence that perspective-taking can enhance the sense of self–other overlap with another is
considerable (Ames et al., 2008; Čehajić & Brown, 2010; Davis et al., 1996; Galinsky & Moskowitz,
2000); the Ames et al. (2008) research offered particularly creative support by showing that
individuals who used perspective-taking to think about another experienced greater activation of the
brain sector (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) associated with thinking about oneself. The work
implicating perspective-taking in approval of favorable political policies toward minority groups was
conducted by Berndsen & McGarty (2012), Čehajić & Brown (2010), and Broockman & Kalla
(2016). The finding that recognizing that another has taken our perspective prompts us to feel greater
solidarity with that person was obtained in six separate experiments by Goldstein, Vezich, & Shapiro
(2014).
31. Although the waves, leaves, and flowers quote is typically attributed to Seneca, he probably
didn’t author it. Most likely, it is from Bahá’u’lláh the founder of the Baha’i faith.
