### The message is: we’re telling you first because we think you’re special. And what reader of direct mail doesn’t think he or she is special?

 15. Sweepstakes

 A sweepstakes can greatly increase the response to a direct-mail campaign. One sweepstakes mailing I received began:

American Family Publishers Announces America’s First By-Mail GUARANTEED
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SWEEPSTAKES OFFER: R BLY, A LOCAL NY RESIDENT,
MAY HAVE ALREADY WON ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

### There are three ways of structuring a sweepstakes:

-----

### YOU MAY WIN …

 YOU MAY HAVE WON …

 YOU HAVE WON …

 The “you have won” sweepstakes generates the most entries because the consumer is guaranteed a prize. This sweepstakes is expensive to run because you must award the consolation prize to everyone who claims it.
 The “you may have won” is the second most effective sweepstakes. Here the reader is told that the winning entry number has been preselected by computer—and that you just may hold that winning entry number in your hand.
 Sweepstakes mailings have declined dramatically over the past few decades. However, I am beginning to notice a slight uptick in sweepstakes promotions again.
 These are fifteen common ways of starting your sales letter. There are others. Read the direct mail you receive and keep a file of effective direct- mail leads and letters to use as a reference in your own work.
 Marketing tactics are often cyclical. Reason: When too many marketers use a tactic, it becomes less special and more commonplace. So the market is flooded with look-alike promotions using the tactic, and with all the noise it becomes less effective.
 When the marketing tactic becomes less effective, marketers abandon it in droves. Soon, it is scarce rather than overused. And when that happens, some smart marketers begin using it again, and find that it is once again working.

 SHOULD YOU USE AN ENVELOPE TEASER?

 The outer envelope is the first thing the reader sees when receiving your mailing package. It is here that the selling starts. If the outer envelope fails to entice the reader to open the letter or, worse, if it prompts him to throw the letter away, the brilliant copy of your sales letter will be wasted.

-----

### There are two basic approaches to outer envelopes. The first is to start your sales pitch right away with headlines and copy printed on the outer envelope. This copy, known as “teaser copy,” is designed to entice the reader to open the envelope by arousing curiosity or promising a strong reward for reading the package.
 The problem with this strategy is that teasers are labels that instantly identify the package as containing advertising matter. Large headlines and copy lines printed on an envelope shout at the reader, “This is advertising … it’s worthless … throw it away!”
 My rule is: use a teaser only if it contains an irresistible message that will compel the reader to open the envelope. But don’t feel you must use a teaser; a weak teaser can actually reduce response versus a package with a plain envelope!
 We know that people always open their personal mail before they open direct mail. We also know that many people throw away every “teaser” envelope they receive without a second glance.
 Teasers are effective only when the message is compelling. For example, I’d have a hard time ignoring an envelope with the teaser, “Inside: The Secret to Living Longer and Feeling Better … Without Dieting or Special Exercise.”
 On the other hand, you’d probably save yourself the trouble of opening an envelope that began, “Sawyer Life Insurance Announces Its 50th Year of Operation … Quality Service to the Community for over Half a Century.”
 Teasers can take many forms. You can have a headline only. Or a headline plus copy.
 You can use an envelope with a window so the teaser is copy that shows through the window.
 You can mail the package in a clear plastic bag so the whole package shows through to tease the reader.
 You can even print illustrations, graphics, and photos on the outer envelope.
 However, most teasers seem to follow one of three basic formats:

 1. THIS IS THE BEST WIDGET EVER MADE

-----

### 2. THIS WIDGET MAY SAVE YOU UP TO $500 3. ENCLOSED IS YOUR FREE WIDGET

 The third teaser works best because it promises a reward for opening the envelope. (The promise of a prize inside has sold millions of dollars’ worth of Cracker Jacks and breakfast cereals.) Even though you know you hold advertising material in your hands, teaser #3 overcomes your resistance to junk mail by making you wonder what’s inside.
 Teaser #1 is the worst. It’s pure boasting, and the reader’s reaction to the smug claim will be to throw the mailing away.
 Teaser #2, though not as effective as #3, is still an improvement over #1 because it makes the promise of a benefit. This promise says to the reader, “Yes, you hold junk mail in your hands. But it might be worth your while to open the envelope and see what we can do for you.”
 A “blind” envelope—one with no teaser—is often more effective than one with a teaser. The idea behind the no-teaser approach is to make the direct-mail package resemble personal mail. When the reader sees the envelope, he’s not sure whether the envelope contains personal mail or advertising material—and so he opens it, just to be sure. Once the mailer is opened, the battle is half won; if the letter contains a strong, compelling lead, you will hook the prospect and get him to read the body copy.
 When using the no-teaser approach, take pains to make the letter look like personal mail. Use a plain white or off-white envelope. Don’t let any brightly colored sales literature show through the window, if there is one. And don’t embellish the envelope with a company logo; just have the return address set in plain type.

 THE LETTER SELLS, THE BROCHURE TELLS

 Many direct-mail packages do an effective selling job with a letter and reply form only.
 Every direct-mail package should contain a letter; flyers and brochures are optional. As the writer, you must decide whether a flyer is needed.
 Here are some helpful suggestions.

-----

### Use a flyer when you are selling products that are colorful or visually impressive: subscriptions to colorful magazines, flowers, fruit, fine foods, coins, collectibles, sports equipment, consumer electronics.
 Some products are most effectively sold through demonstration. But you usually can’t demonstrate by mail. The next best thing is to take step-by- step photos of a demonstration and put them in a flyer to be included in the mailer.
 Sometimes the offer is so strong that the writer decides to devote the letter solely to benefits. The features of the product itself can then be covered in an accompanying flyer.
 Use a flyer for transmitting technical data or product information that is too detailed to be explained or listed in the letter.
 In writing direct mail to sell books, I list a detailed table of contents in a flyer separate from the letter. This way, the small percentage of readers interested in some esoteric topic can scan the contents to see if it is included. And if it is, the flyer will have tipped the odds in favor of a sale.
 You are not limited to one flyer or one letter or one order form. You can include whatever you think it will take to make the sale.

 HOW TO INCREASE RESPONSE TO YOUR MAILINGS

 In direct mail, response is the name of the game. Building brand awareness or getting people to remember your message is not important. The only thing that counts is how many sales or inquiries your mailing generates. The more responses, the more successful the mailer.
 Reaching the right audience with the right offer and the right copy is the key to successful direct mail. But a number of response-increasing techniques have little to do with copywriting skill or common sense. Here are a few that you can use:

 Always include a response mechanism. This can be a business reply card, reply envelope, order form, sales page URL, or toll-free number. Use self-addressed, postage-paid envelopes and reply cards (known as business reply envelopes and business reply cards). They generate

-----

### more response than cards or envelopes that require a postage stamp from the prospect. Order forms and reply cards with tear-off stubs or receipts generate more response than those without. The letter should be the first thing the reader sees when he opens the envelope. The package should have a natural flow from outer envelope to letter to flyer to reply card. Offer a premium: a gift to prospects who respond to the mailing. The premium should be something that they want, and it should ideally relate to the product or the offer. Offer something of value in return for responding to the letter: a free brochure, booklet, catalog, demonstration, survey, estimate, consultation, or trial offer. Allow for a negative response. And turn it into a positive. The reply card for a letter promoting my freelance copywriting services gives the reader the option of checking off a box that reads, “Not interested right now. But try us again in ______.” Even if the reader doesn’t need my services now, she can still respond to the mailing. Use physical objects in the mailing. An envelope that feels bulky almost always gets opened. These objects can include product samples, premiums, 3-D pop-ups, and other gimmicks. (I’ve received direct-mail packages that contained instant coffee, chili powder, a set of coasters, a calendar, pens, pencils, a flashlight, and a magnifying glass.) Although costly, mailings with objects enclosed can really stand out in a mailbox or in a basket full of flat envelopes containing regular letters and flyers. Put a time limit on the offer. Once the reader puts the letter aside, she probably won’t come back to it, so you’ll get the most response if you urge her to act now … by putting a time limit on the offer. You can put a real date limit on the offer. (“Remember, Beethoven’s Violin Concerto is yours to keep just for taking advantage of this offer within the next 10 days.”) You can hint that the offer won’t last forever (“But hurry—supplies are limited”).

-----

### Or you can add a sense of urgency to your call for action (“Remember —the time to buy insurance is before tragedy strikes. Not after”). Make the outer envelope resemble an invoice or other “official- looking” document. People almost always open such envelopes. Use a plain outer envelope with no copy, not even a return address. The mystery of such a mailing is irresistible. Use a P.S. in the letter to restate the offer or reemphasize a sales point; 80 percent of readers will read a P.S. Guarantee the offer. When you sell by mail, make a money-back guarantee good for 15, 30, 60, or even 90 days. When you are generating leads, tell the prospect that he’s under no obligation and that no salesperson will call (unless he wants one to). Envelopes addressed with labels attached to the reply device and showing through a glassine window on the envelope are often as effective as envelopes individually typed with the recipient’s address. Addressing envelopes by hand can reduce response, perhaps because it looks amateurish. If your mailing list contains titles but not names, print a description of the person you’re trying to reach on the outer envelope (“Attention Buyers of Electronic Components—Important Information Inside”). An envelope with live stamps or a postage-metered envelope outpulls an envelope with a preprinted indicia. An order form printed in color, or designed as an elaborate certificate, or printed with a lot of information outpulls a clean, ordinary-looking order form. Letters with indented paragraphs, underlined words, and portions of the text set in a second color outpull plain letters. Letters with a lot of “bells and whistles”—arrows, fake handwritten notes in the margins, spot illustrations, highlighting—can increase response when mailed to lower- and middle-class consumer audiences. Avoid these techniques when writing to business executives, professionals, or upper-class consumers. A form letter with a headline can often be just as effective as a form letter with the recipient’s name and address typed in by hand.

-----

### A package with a separate letter and brochure does better than a combination letter/brochure. Repeat the offer on the reply card. Use action words in the first sentence of the reply card and restate the offer in the body copy. (“YES, I’d like to know how I can cut my phone bill in half. Please send a free selection guide on your long- distance services. I understand I’m under no obligation and that no salesperson will call.”) Avoid intimidating, legal-type wording. State your offer, terms, and guarantee in plain, simple English. Make it easy to respond to the mailing. This means having a simple offer and an easy-to-complete order form. And be sure to leave enough space on the form for the reader to fill in the required information (a surprising number of reply cards and coupons don’t). Keep in mind the buyer’s level of interest in your product so you don’t oversell or undersell. (Prospects whose names were taken from the Nintendo Force magazine mailing list probably have a greater interest in video games than the subscribers of Field and Stream.)

 Writing direct mail is the best education I can recommend for novice and experienced copywriters alike. Within a few weeks of your mailing, you know whether your copy is successful or not. No other form of copywriting, except for online marketing, yields such immediate or precise feedback on your work.

 ALTERNATIVE DM FORMATS

 The traditional package described above has long been the workhorse of direct mail. But there are many other direct-mail formats, and they increasingly outperform standard direct-mail packages.
 These include bookalogs, magalogs, tabloids, digests, trifold self- mailers, billboard mailers, tear sheets, oversize postcards, impact mailings, video brochures, and shock-and-awe packages. Here are some of the most popular mail formats being used today:

-----

### Brochure-style self-mailer—11 x 17–inch sheet folded once to form four panels. Slim-jim—8½ x 11–inch “letter-size” sheet folded twice to form six panels. Slim-jim with extra panel—8½ x 14–inch “legal-size” sheet folded three times to form eight panels. Broadsides—an oversize sheet of paper printed in color on one or both sides and folded for mailing. Faux newsletter—a direct-mail piece designed to look like an informational newsletter. Magalogs—a multipage direct-mail piece designed to look like a magazine. Digests—similar to magalogs but the pages are half the size, made by folding 8½ x 11–inch sheets of paper once vertically and saddle- stitching them. Bookalog—a long-copy direct-mail promotion in the form of a small paperback book enclosed in a 6 x 9–inch or other envelope with a cover letter and reply form. Snap Pack Mailers—mailers that are made of multiple plies or pages, and sealed at the edges and at the top. You have to tear off the perforated seals before you can open the snap pack and leaf through the pages. Tabloids—similar to magalogs but larger, with the pages approximately the same size as in a newspaper. “Shock-and-awe” package—a box filled with multiple components (e.g., cover letter, product brochure, reply form, DVD or audio CD), plus miscellaneous premiums such as pencils, pens, pads, small toys, posters, candy, and many others. Video brochures—an expensive mailer that when opened shows one or more product-related videos. Audio mail—a mailer with a built-in sound chip that plays when you open the letter or brochure. Structural mailing—a mailer that unfolds and expands into a 3-D structure such as a sphere or miniature building.

-----

### Impact mailing—a mailer sent with an attention-getting enclosure such as a bag of shredded money or a brick silkscreened with the sender’s business card. Oversize postcards—color promotional postcards measuring 6 by 9 inches or larger. And many more …

## WRITING BROCHURES, CATALOGS, AND
 OTHER PRINTED AND PDF SALES
 MATERIALS

### Promotional literature has been around for a long time. According to Ripley’s Believe It or Not, the first brochure was written by Hernán Cortés almost five hundred years ago. It was circulated as a broadside to the people of Spain by Charles V, and it advertised a sale on turkeys.
 Even in the digital era, many businesses still use printed sales literature: travel agents, supermarkets, banks, residential contractors, department stores, insurance companies, medical practices, colleges, and many other types of organizations distribute brochures, circulars, flyers, catalogs, and other printed advertising matter to help make the sale.
 That’s convenient when a salesperson calls on prospects at their home or office, or when the prospects visit the marketer’s trade show booth. Also, print brochures have a tactile appeal that PDFs don’t. And they’re easier to file for future reference.
 In addition, brochures are also often available as PDF downloads from the marketers’ Web sites. Whether print, electronic, or both, advertisers need sales literature for two reasons. First, credibility—people expect a “real” company to have product literature. Anyone can spend $50 on letterhead and business cards and call themselves a corporation. But a brochure, in particular a hard copy, proves you are in business and shows you’re more than a fly-by-night operation.
