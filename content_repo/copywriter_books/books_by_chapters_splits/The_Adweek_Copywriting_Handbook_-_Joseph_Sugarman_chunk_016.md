##### Our minds are like giant computers. Every experience that goes into your brain—both good and bad—becomes more program material and data to recall and assemble in new ways in the future. Remember when the first Apple computers came out with their big 64K memories? You might also remember the slow speed and the poor graphics compared to the high- powered personal computers we have today. Today’s computers are faster, are more efficient, can accomplish more and can interrelate information faster and more easily. So it stands to reason, the more we’ve experienced, the more we can draw upon when it comes time to relate those experiences to new problems or opportunities.
 There is nothing really new in life. It’s simply a matter of taking previous pieces of knowledge and putting them together in a unique and different format. Matter is not created and destroyed. Everything on earth that was here a billion years ago is pretty much here now. The only difference is that it has taken new forms.
 The more you have stored in your brain from experiences and knowledge and the more you are able to interrelate that knowledge and come up with new combinations of old material, the greater an idea person you will be and the more powerful your capabilities as a copywriter will be.
 There is a saying that goes, “If all you have is a hammer, you look at every problem as a nail.” The more tools you have to work on a problem in the form of experiences or knowledge, the more new ways you can figure out how to solve it.

# Lateral Thinking for Ideas

##### Edward de Bono, one of the great creative thinkers of our time, coined the term lateral thinking to describe the process of coming up with ideas by not focusing or thinking of just the problem. Often, by relating the problem to something that has nothing to do with the problem, a new idea emerges.
 De Bono created a product that he called his “Think Tank,” which encouraged people to think more laterally and consequently more creatively. It was an eight-inch sphere mounted on a platform. Through a small window you could see a selection of 14,000 words printed on small plastic pieces. You shook the Think Tank and then looked into it and wrote down the first three words you saw.
 You then tried to relate the three words to your marketing problem, to come up with a fresh perspective toward solving the problem. For example, let us say I wanted to sell my airplane. Typically, I would run an ad and focus on just the airplane, its features and equipment. But in using the Think Tank for lateral thinking, I might draw three totally unrelated words, farm, salesman and compassion and have to create an ad incorporating those three words. This process would cause me to search my brain, my data bank, and all my past experiences for some way to relate the three words while keeping in mind that I had to sell the airplane.

# The Dictionary as a Tool

##### Lateral thinking is simply a tool. So is your dictionary. And so is your mind. Probably one of the most important keys in copywriting and conceptualizing is the ability to relate totally divergent concepts to create a new concept. Once again, the more data you have to work with from your life experiences and the more your mind can relate this data to a problem, the better you are going to be at coming up with that really great idea.

# Running Your Own Company

##### Another factor that makes a great copywriter is the experience of running your own company and being responsible for every word you write. The really great direct marketing copywriters often don’t work for advertising agencies, but rather run their own companies and experience their own successes and failures. Ben Suarez, Gary Halbert, the late Gene Schwartz and dozens of others recognized as top copywriters have owned their own companies and learned over years of trial and error—years of both big mistakes and great success. You can’t beat that type of experience.
 In my case, I have been presented with thousands of products, have written ads for hundreds of them and have had to come up with that big idea hundreds of times a year. Even as I look back at my advertising, I see a learning curve that would not have been possible had it not been for that immense wealth of broad experience. You’re going to read about many of those experiences throughout this book. You’ll be able to avoid many of the pitfalls and mistakes I made climbing my way up the ladder and you’ll understand why these mistakes were indeed learning experiences.
 The preparation for becoming a great copywriter is a lifestyle. It’s a hunger for knowledge, a curiosity and a desire to participate in life that is broad-based and passionate. If you have this personality, you are already well on your way. If you don’t, simply being aware of it is often enough to start a mental process and movement that will take you to where you would like to be. But being a great copywriter is more than just having a lot of experience in life. What you will learn in the next chapter is just as important.

# Chapter 2

 Specific Knowledge

##### I was sitting in the laboratory of the Sensor Watch Company in Dallas, Texas, looking through a microscope and learning everything I could about how a new digital watch was designed, produced and assembled.
 I was becoming an expert on digital watch technology, on integrated circuits, quartz crystals and oscillator circuits. “Why are all the contacts gold-plated?” I asked the engineer. “They’re gold-plated in every integrated circuit. It’s part of the technology,” was the reply.
 The conversation continued. It had been two days and I was still delving into every aspect of this new digital watch I was planning to introduce. I still hadn’t reached the point where I could write an ad on the advantages of the new product. At the time, most digital watches had liquid crystal displays, and in order to see the time, you had to press a button to illuminate the display. On the new Sensor watch, the display glowed constantly, thanks to an inert but radioactive substance that was placed in a small flat capsule behind the display.

# New Technology Required
 Powerful Presentation

##### This new technology meant that you could glance down at your watch and, in an instant, tell the time—even at night—without pressing any buttons. But I felt that there had to be a powerful way of presenting the product and I still wasn’t comfortable with what I had.
 The Sensor 770 was very expensive to make and sell. So I knew that I needed something that made the watch I was selling really different and special.
 “Why didn’t somebody think of this radioactive material for watches before?” was my next question.
 The engineer looked at me, paused for a second and then said, “We haven’t had the technology to seal the radioactive material in a transparent capsule without it leaking out until somebody developed a technique with a laser. The laser is what seals the capsule. Without the laser, there is no way you could completely seal the capsule.”
 That was all I needed. The concept was clear. And the ad headline that I wrote for the new Sensor digital watch was, “Laser Beam Digital Watch.”
 The story told of how the watch was made possible thanks to a laser beam and how its new technology benefited the consumer. That single concept resulted in millions of dollars in profitable sales for the digital watch.
 When I had reached the point about the laser beam sealing the capsule, I knew I had found that unique headline concept that made the watch stand out from the competition. But it took a few days of very intensive learning and study before the concept emerged. Sometimes this can happen in a few minutes, sometimes it can happen in a few hours and sometimes it may take weeks. This time it took a few days of patience along with specific knowledge.

# You Must Become an Expert

##### You need to become an expert on a product, service or anything you write about to really be effective. Becoming an expert means learning enough about a product to obtain enough specific knowledge so you can communicate the real nature of what you are trying to sell. Say to yourself, “I am an expert or have learned enough to be able to effectively communicate this product to the consumer.” That’s what we mean by “specific knowledge.”
 This doesn’t mean that you have to learn everything there is to know about a subject every time. There have been times when I simply looked at a product or service and came up with the big idea from my own past experience or specific knowledge in a particular category. Remember, I’m a pilot, ham radio operator and photographer. I already had not only vast knowledge of the gadgets I would sell in my business, but knowledge of my customer, as well. I myself was my typical customer. I was the type of individual I had to sell products to because I was as gadget-oriented as the person I was trying to appeal to.

# You Must Know Your Customer,
 Too

##### And that’s another point. In addition to knowing your product or service, you’ve really got to know your customer. You’ve got to be an expert on who your customer is by gathering specific information on whom you are selling to. You may already be an expert by virtue of being a typical customer. You know your likes and dislikes, what excites you and what you yourself would expect from a company selling you a product. But if it is your assignment to write copy for a product or service that you really don’t have a feel for, then you have a great deal of studying to do to make sure you understand who your customer is and what motivates him or her.

# You Must Understand a Product’s
 Nature

##### And even if you understand your customer and understand your product, you must realize one more thing. There is a specific way that each product should be presented to your customer. In short, the product has a nature of its own and it’s up to you to discover what the nature of that product is in the mind of the consumer.
 Let me cite a good example. Back when I first started JS&A in the basement of my home, I met Howard Franklin. Howard was an insurance salesman from Chicago who bought his first calculator from me from an ad I ran in the Wall Street Journal. He loved his calculator and stopped by one day to buy a few more of them. After that, Howard would stop by every once in a while and buy more calculators as gifts for his better clients.
 One day, Howard stopped by and said that since JS&A was a growing concern, I should buy insurance. “You want to protect your family because if anything ever happened to you, there may be quite an estate and lots of taxes to pay before your family would realize anything.”
 “Thank you, Howard. I appreciate the offer, but I don’t really believe in insurance,” was my standard reply.
 But Howard was a good salesman. Every once in a while Howard would clip out an article on calculators from a local paper or an article from some magazine on some new gadget and send it to me with his card. And every once in a while, Howard stopped by and picked up a calculator and again dropped the comment, “Joe, you should really have insurance.”
 “Thanks, Howard. I appreciate the advice,” was my typical comment. Then one day I heard a siren in front of my next-door neighbor’s house. I looked out the window and within a few minutes, my neighbor was being carried out of his home on a stretcher with a white sheet over him. He had died that morning from a massive heart attack. He was only in his 40s. I was 36 at the time.
 The next day I called Howard on the phone. “Howard, remember our many discussions on insurance and protecting your family and stuff? Well, I

##### think that we should sit down and work out some sort of program for an insurance plan for my family and me.”
 I had finally made the plunge. Was it Howard’s salesmanship? Was it his persistence? Maybe. But I realized from that experience a really effective way to sell a whole series of products. Howard succeeded because he had planted enough seeds in my mind for me to realize what insurance was for, who should sell it to me and who was a good friend and customer. When it came time to buy, only I, Joseph Sugarman, would know. And only when there was an immediate experience that hit close to home would I see the value of insurance. I went through the experience and I responded.

 It took an event close to home to make me take action.

 Some of the implications from this example will be referred to later in this book, but the point concerns the nature of a product. Every product has a nature to it that you must understand to be successful when creating a marketing concept behind that product. For example, from the insurance experience, I soon realized how to sell burglar alarms and became one of the largest burglar alarm sales companies in the country, protecting more homes than any other company.
 The alarm was called the Midex and my thoughts went back to Howard as I created the ad. I knew that to scare people into buying a burglar alarm was like Howard coming into my basement and saying, “Joe, when you die, are you going to leave your wife and kids in financial disaster?” That would never sell me insurance. Nor would a similar technique of quoting crime statistics work to sell burglar alarms.
 I realized that if I were to buy a burglar alarm, I would first have to recognize a need for one: perhaps if my neighbor was robbed or crime in my community was on the rise or I had recently purchased something expensive.

-----

##### Once I had a need for a burglar alarm, I would look for one that really made sense for my situation. The first thing I would insist on is that it worked. After all, the first time I really need my alarm to work may be the only time it would be called upon to work, and I’d want to make sure it worked flawlessly.
 The second thing that would be important to me is the ease of installation. It would have to be so easy to install that it wouldn’t require any outside person stringing wires all over my house. So when I wrote the ad on the Midex burglar alarm, I made sure that I spent several paragraphs on the reliability of the product and the testing each unit went through before it was shipped. And I used astronaut Wally Schirra as my spokesperson for the alarm. He was quoted as saying, “I’m very pleased with my unit.”
