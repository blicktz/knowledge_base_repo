Increasingly, robots and artificial intelligence (AI) software are taking over tasks and jobs once performed by human beings. Can this happen with writing?
 According to an article in Popular Science, published just recently as I write the updates for this new edition,[2] a computer program coded by Sverker Johansson has written 2.7 million articles, accounting for 8.5 percent of the entries in Wikipedia.
 Persado, an AI software company, has created algorithms that compare e-mail subject lines and their click rate. From this data, the software creates new subject lines. Based on data analysis, Persado subject lines almost always outperform those written by humans.[3]

 WHY SOME CLIENTS DON’T RESPECT THEIR COPYWRITERS

-----

### Copywriters and their work are frequently criticized, and some writers get offended. Why do many copywriters “get no respect”? I can think of two reasons.
 First, writing is more subjective than most other fields. An accountant can point to a ledger and prove that the books balance. A lawyer can back up her case with legal precedents and logical arguments.
 Writing copy is not so cut-and-dried. There may be dozens of ways of writing an ad, each with merit. The copywriter can say he thinks his way is best. But he can’t prove his ideas are superior. The client has to take it on faith … and few do.
 Of course, there are guidelines for effective copy, presented earlier in this book, among other places. Unfortunately, many clients and writers are not aware of these rules. And without a clear idea of what makes good copy, how can the copywriter defend his work and say that it’s good?
 The second reason clients don’t respect writers is that, way down deep, many clients fancy themselves better writers than their copywriters.
 Doctors, lawyers, accountants, plumbers, mechanics, and software engineers deal in areas so technical and complex that their clients don’t know enough to interfere. But everybody can write. (Even parrots and mockingbirds use language!) So there is less mystery to the copywriter’s work, and clients are more confident that they could write the ad or letter “if only I had the time.”
 If you’re hiring outside copywriters, here’s a three-step recommendation to improve the relationship:

 1. Hire the right copywriter for the job: someone who fits in with the product and your company.
 2. Work with the writer on a professional basis. Treat the writer with the same respect you would your lawyer, accountant, or doctor. Stand back, and let the writer do her job.
 3. Establish logical guidelines for reviewing copy. Base your review on these concrete standards, not on subjective or aesthetic judgments. And, above all, be specific in your criticism.

### Let’s look at each step of the plan in more detail.

 HOW TO HIRE A STAFF OR FREELANCE COPYWRITER

 How do you go about finding copywriters to hire on a staff or freelance basis? And how do you know which writer is right for your business? Here are ten tips for finding and selecting the best copywriter for the job at hand.

 1. Ask around

 Need to find a writer? The best way to find one is through referrals. Ask your friends, colleagues, and acquaintances to recommend writers they have used in the past.
 The people most likely to know the name of a good copywriter include:

 Local advertising agencies and PR firms Magazine space reps and editors Printers, photographers, graphic artists, design studios, and other outside vendors Communications managers of nearby manufacturing and service firms

 LOOKING FOR COPYWRITERS ONLINE

Most copywriters I know have Web sites, so you can find plenty with a Google Search.

_The most important things you should look for: online portfolio of copywriting samples,_
copywriter’s bio and credentials, client list, client testimonials, content (e.g., a blog or
newsletter) displaying knowledge of marketing, and a sample agreement for copywriting
assignments.

There are also a number of specialty “freelance Web sites” that help connect copywriters
with clients. In my experience, these sites tend to attract hungry newbie copywriters who
need assignments, and clients whose main concern seems to be finding writers who charge
the lowest price.

### 2. Choose a writer with experience in your industry

-----

### There are three advantages to using a writer who knows your business. First, you’ll spend less time briefing her and bringing her up to speed in your technology and your markets.
 Second, because the writer already speaks the jargon of your industry, your employees will accept her more readily than they would an “outsider” who doesn’t speak their language. This may be important if you want your managers and engineers to work closely with the writer.
 Third, the writer may be able to vet your strategy or suggest new ideas based on her experience working with clients whose products are similar to your own.
 Clients have asked me, “Do you have to be a software engineer to write copy on a computer account?” You don’t, and many great computer ads have been written by writers who didn’t know Pascal from Python when they started. On the other hand, a writer with programming experience does have a head start over the writer who has never written code.
 The writer you hire doesn’t have to be an expert in your particular product. (She won’t ever know as much about your business as you do.) But she should have a feel for your industry and a knack for writing the type of copy you need.
 For example, if you need a writer to write a brochure on your new Caribbean cruise package, don’t insist that the writer have a portfolio full of color brochures or Web sites on Caribbean cruises. Chances are you won’t be able to find such an individual. But you should look for a copywriter specializing in travel rather than one who is more at home with subscription mailings, annual reports, or fashion advertising.
 In other words, don’t insist that the writer have specific experience in your product line. Do look for a writer who specializes in your kind of advertising, be it travel, high-tech, home furnishings, or pharmaceuticals.

 3. Hire someone in your league

 Not all copywriting assignments require the same level of skill. Writing a bulletin board notice to sell your used Chevrolet doesn’t take the same level of copywriting sophistication that writing a corporate ad campaign for Exxon does.

-----

### Copywriters also operate on different levels. There are high-paid specialists, middle-level generalists, and beginners to handle the easy stuff. These writers charge according to their level of skill, and you can save money by not overhiring for the job.
 A marketing manager at a small industrial firm needed a cover letter to accompany a new brochure he was mailing to customers, sales reps, and regional offices. Because I have experience writing shorter letters and e- mails for B2B firms, my copy is often successful for these firms, and I charge accordingly—$1,500 minimum for a one-page letter.

 4. Pick a writer whose style is somewhat in sync with your own

 The conservative company, thinking that it’s time to improve its image, hires the most creative digital marketing or branding agency in town.
 The first ads come in. They’re what you’d expect from a creative agency —creative. “A little too far out for us, though,” says the conservative client. “Can you come up with something a little more dignified. We’re just not sure about the dancing chemical drums.”
 “You’re stifling our creativity!” screams the agency, which picks up the presentation, stamps out of the conference room, sends a bill, and refuses to work with the barbaric client anymore.
 Moral of the story: an ad agency or freelancer is unlikely to convince the client to make a radical change in their way of doing business. So clients would do well to select copywriters whose approach and style are in tune with their own.
 If you like hard-sell ads—ads with coupons, with benefits in the headlines, with price and where-to-buy information, with straightforward body copy that sells the features and benefits of the product—you probably won’t like the ads you get from a copywriter trained on splashy “image” campaigns for national brands. After all, this writer may believe that an ad should have a “clever” headline and a glossy color visual, and that people “don’t read long copy.”
 Well, he’s not going to convert you to his point of view. And you’re not going to waste your hard-earned ad dollars so he can win creative awards. The best bet is to stay away from each other in the first place. Hire a writer

-----

### whose portfolio is full of your type of fact-filled ads. Let a company who wants “showplace” ads hire the creative guy.
 Do you like long-copy ads or short-copy ads? Fancy color photos or plain-Jane graphics? Informational copy or emotional copy? Plain language or purple prose? Choose a copywriter whose style and “advertising philosophy” fit in with your own. You’ll both be happier with the working relationship—and with the copy it produces.

 5. Taking the first step

 Let’s say you have the name of a copywriter you want to hire. The first step is to phone or write her and ask to see background material on her copywriting services.
 At the very least, you want to see samples of her work, a résumé or capsule biography, and a list of clients. Many experienced copywriters already have a standard information package prepared that contains all of this and more. Novices often have to be told what to send you.
 Here are the things to look for when evaluating the freelancer’s information package or Web site:

 • Is it well written? If the freelancer can’t promote himself effectively, how can he write copy for services and products with which he’s not intimately familiar?

 • Do you like the sample work? The samples represent what she considers to be her best copy. If you don’t think they show promise, keep looking. This isn’t the right writer for you, and asking to see more samples isn’t going to change anything.

 • Look at the client list. Make sure the copywriter has experience in your industry or in related fields. Don’t hire a straight technical writer to write your new perfume ad. Find a writer who likes doing perfume ads and is good at it.

 • Did the copywriter include information on his fee rate and structure? A true professional will give you his rates up front. He doesn’t want to waste your time—or his—if you can’t afford to pay him.

-----

### • What related writing and communications experience does the copywriter have? A well-rounded copywriter does more than write copy. What else has your copywriter written? Any books? Articles? Papers? Speeches? Seminars? Teaching experience?

 • What overall feeling do you get from the whole thing? You’ve looked over the writer’s material and chatted with her over the phone. Do her package and presentation say “professional” or “amateur”? Do you feel comfortable with the writer and confident that she can handle the job? Gut feelings are important. Go with your instincts.

 6. Don’t expect something for nothing

 An amazing number of smaller companies will call me up and say, “We’re a small manufacturer in South Jersey. We don’t do much advertising, but we saw your ad and may need a one-page press release to announce our president’s retirement next month. We’d like to meet with you to check you over. Can you come over this afternoon?”
 I have news for you. Unless you’re a major advertiser or ad agency with a large project in hand, you are not going to see me. And why not? Because if I jumped in the car and spent the better part of the day visiting every small business that wanted a $750 press release, I’d have no time to write copy for my dozens of regular and higher-paying clients.
 My point is: the copywriter, like a lawyer or doctor, is a professional. If you want his time, you must be willing to pay for it. Few copywriters give free house calls these days.
 You may object and say, “But I want to hire you! Isn’t a meeting the next step?”
 It doesn’t have to be. We can handle the assignment by e-mail, Skype, or Zoom.
 “But I want to meet you!” Fine. Come to my office and there is no charge. If I have to leave the office, though, I have to charge you for my time—if it’s just an exploratory meeting. If you have an assignment for me, I’ll include the meeting as part of my fee, provided we’ve already agreed that I’m going to handle the project for you.

-----

### As I’ve said, I may make an exception if you’re a big advertiser or if you’re dangling an attractive project in front of me. But it’s unreasonable for most clients—smaller companies with infrequent copywriting assignments—to expect the copywriter to come running without compensation. The few projects they have to offer don’t justify the time spent in travel and meetings.
 Most copywriters will be glad to chat with you over the phone or in their office. But don’t expect the copywriter to make an out-of-office trip to your plant or office unless you’re willing to pay for a consultation. A writer who earns $1,000 to $2,000 a day or more isn’t going to spend half a day chasing down a $500 assignment.
 In the pre-Internet days, the major reason for copywriters to visit clients was to drop off their portfolio case of copywriting samples. But today many copywriters, myself included, post our samples on our Web sites (mine is www.bly.com), where anyone can see them at the click of a mouse.

 7. Discuss fees up front

 There’s no point in talking if you can’t afford the writer’s rates. Save yourself a lot of time and find out fees up front.
 Most writers can give you rough estimates of what they charge for different jobs: so much for an ad, so much for a sales letter, more for a brochure. Ask to see the copywriter’s fee schedule, if she has one.
 These estimates are “ballpark” figures only. The exact fee depends on the specific assignment. But the ballpark figures give you a good idea of what you’ll pay for the copy you need.
 If the copywriter charges by time instead of project, find out her rate for a week, day, half day, or hour. Ask how long she thinks your project will take. Multiply the number of days by the day rate to get the total cost estimate.
 Also discuss deadlines up front. The top copywriters are often booked weeks in advance and cannot always handle rush jobs. Some prospects are shocked to learn that I can’t write their ad overnight. They don’t realize that I already have six jobs on my desk, all due in a few weeks.

-----

### Find out how much time the writer normally takes to do small projects (ads, letters) and large ones (Web sites, white papers, autoresponder e-mail sequences). If your deadlines are short, say so, and ask the writer if she can meet them.
 Copy revisions should also be discussed up front. Are they included in the copywriter’s initial fee or do they cost extra? How many drafts are included in the basic project price? How quickly can the writer make revisions? What happens if there is a change in the nature of the assignment? Are revisions still included? Is there a time limit in which revisions must be assigned?
 Make sure you understand the writer’s policy for revisions. Otherwise, it can become a problem area later on.

 8. Provide complete background information on the project

 Send the writer all the background information you can. With this material in hand, the writer can give the most accurate estimate as to what the job will cost. Without it, he is “flying blind” because he doesn’t know how much research is involved, and his high estimate will reflect this degree of uncertainty.
 You’ll get the best price by giving the writer whatever information he needs to make an informed, accurate estimate of what the copy will cost.

 9. Get it in writing

 Put the fee, terms, deadlines, and a description of the assignment in a purchase order or letter of agreement.
 A written agreement eliminates confusion and spells out what the client is buying and what the writer is selling. Too many buyers and sellers in all fields of business have gone to court because they made their deals orally. Don’t make the same mistake. A written agreement protects both the client and the writer. So don’t just shake hands on it. Put it in writing.

 10. Stand back

-----

### Once you’ve hired the writer and given her the background material, stand back and let her do her job. Don’t interfere; don’t ask to “take a look at the first few pages”; don’t badger the writer with constant “how’s it going?” phone calls.
 You’ve hired a professional. Now let the professional work. You’ll get your copy by the deadline date or sooner. And it will be copy that pleases you and is effective in selling your product. If you need changes, the writer will make them. After all, that’s what you’re paying for.
 One veteran copywriter says: “On the first draft, the client gets what he needs. On the second draft, the client gets what he wants. On the third draft, the client gets what he deserves.”
