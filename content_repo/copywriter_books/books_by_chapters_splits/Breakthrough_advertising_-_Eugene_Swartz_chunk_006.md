Throughout the copy, definition and re-definition take place.
Spark firing is the "most wasteful and power consuming way" as
opposed to "the most efficient way to get a big powerful spark."
Misfiring means "loss of power plus . . .," while maximum gas explosion means full power, full economy. . . ." (Notice the parallel
sentence structure here sharpening the contrast.)

And, in a beautiful image, the fire injector actuallv "breaks
in"—a masterpiece of redefinition by analogy.

Of course, almost every benefit has its documentary- mechanism. The air gap in ordinary plugs gets bigger "because the
electrode is burning away." The spark plug gets dirtv "because of
inefficient firing." And so on.

Let me point out again the general structure of this sequence
It is: Bad.
Good.
Bad.
Good.
Bad.
Good.

And so on. It thus offers repeated, direct, one-for-one contrast. It explores a number of performance factors of vital interest in the prospect—showing the bad and then the good side of
each of them.

**A Second Strategy**

This is one way of accomplishing your Concentration. But,
of course, it is not always feasible, because the points you wish
to contrast mav not be so easily and clearly broken down, one
bv one. You may be dealing, instead, with a time sequence—a
recurring, unpleasant experience with which the prospect is familiar, and which you wish to sharpen before you provide him
with the antidote.

In this case your Concentration copy would adopt a different structure. Something that looks more like this:

What happens to you now. with the product or products you
are using presentlv.

What will happen when vou switch to the new product.

Here is such a structure, for an ad selling a reducing pill.
Let's look first at the negative copy:

For years doctors have known that ordinary reducing
plans—that vou pay S5, $10 and even 815 for in the stores—
_are completely passive! That they depend strictly on your_
own will power—on vour ability to starve that fat off your
bodv. All that these ordinary reducing plans are able to
give' vou ... for vour $5 or 810 or S15—are HUNGERAPPEASING PRODUCTS—pills, powders and liquids that
do nothing more than swell up in your stomach—that do
nothing more than "dull" your hunger a little.

But not one of these products could do anything to
ACTIVELY help you reduce your weight. To take the strain
off that starvation diet. To actually help vou BURN UP
that uglv fat. . . OXIDIZE that fat. . . MELT IT AWAY—
FOREVER!

So what happened? If you were overweight, you struggled to do the job of reducing BY YOURSELF! You took
vour hunger-appeasing pills religiously. You pushed away
the foods vou love. You spent week after week of torture.
And finally, if vou were lucky; you carved off 5, 10, or even
12 precious pounds.

_And then your will power snapped! You broke your_
terrible diet. You discovered that your little pills were use

-----

1 8 2 SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CONCENTRATION

less to keep you away from the foods vou loved. And the
_fat flowed back—heavier and uglier and more deadhj than_
_ever before!_

Again, let's glance at the means the writer used to get his
total effect. b

In the first and second paragraphs—Definitions and Redefinition. Ordinary reducing plans are passive. They depend on vour
own will power. They can do nothing to actively bum up fat.

And in the third paragraph, the equating of taking ordinarv
reducing pills with "doing the job of reducing yourself."

^ Next, logic—cause and effect. Given the acceptance of these
definitions by the reader, the third and fourth paragraphs become
a logical necessity. This tone of cause and effect is conveved in
the phrase: "So what happened?"

Now, of course, the third and fourth paragraphs condense
an experience which is all too common to everv woman who has
ever tried to reduce. She has lived through this herself, time after
time. She recognizes each of the symptoms. And so she finds herself nodding her head, agreeing with each in its turn, building
up a stream of acceptances which carries more and more conviction as she finds her own experiences more and more thoroughly described.

And then, at the climax, in the last line of the fourth paragraph, the destniction of the old methods of reducing is complete.
Notice the use of the word "And" to tie this final indictment in
structurally with the stream of sensory experiences that have gone
before it. There is no doubt that the fat has come back again in
this woman's life—if it hadn't, she wouldn't have read this much
of the ad. But here the inevitable implication buried in a sentence
_with which no woman could disagree—is that it icas the failure_
_of the pills that caused the failure of the diet._

Thus the stage is set for the hero-product to emerge. It has
already been foreshadowed in the second paragraph—in the negative accusations that these ordinary methods can do nothing
"actively" to "burn awav" fat.

-----

SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CONCENTRATION 1 8 3

Now the copv goes on, from failure to promise, like this:

And so vou tried another passive plan. And another.
And another. And then if vou were like the men and women
whose fantastic case histories w ere reported by leading medical journals—perhaps vou went to vour doctor and asked
him for an easy way out—without torture—and without
_sliding hack!_

These doctors had the answer in a tiny grey pill—and
a common-sense plan.

In their hands—so tinv that thev could balance it on
the tip of their little finger—was perhaps the greatest
weapon ever discovered against deadlv, excess fat. It was
a miraculous compound called LECITHIN—brandnew—whose amazing fat-dissolving properties had been
discovered bv a Nobel prize winner—the co-discoverer
of insulin. . . .

Because this product was perfectly safe—and as easy
to take as an aspirin—main had used it themselves when
they wanted to lose weight. . . .

Thev were not given am starvation diets . . . thev never
experienced a single hungry moment . . . they reported, in
case after case, that thev felt more pep. more energy, more
youth and vitality than thev had known in years!

And then, dav after dav faster and easier and safer
than thev had ever known before, the ugly excess fat around
their bodies melted awav! While thev were eating three delicious meals a dav, thev were shedding as much as 5 pounds
a week. While thev were feasting on mouth-watering
steaks. . . .

And so on. Right back into Intensification copy, with its strong
picture-image sell.

Here are vour contrast—vour mechanization—your documentation—your reference to authority—and then your return to
promise, in the form of case history, which now has many times
its original power, based on both the elimination of alternate channels of fulfillment, and the strong supporting mechanism which
documents its claims.

**One Final Word on Concentration**

**I have purposely chosen extreme examples to illustrate each**
mechanism. These copy blocks are longer than Concentration
need logically be. The same effect may be boiled down into two
or three sentences, or even a single phrase, as in this classic
headline:

"SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."

Here is contrast—implied weakness in other products—compensating promise in vour own.

Again, it is not the content, nor is it the length of copy used
in a mechanism that makes it effective. It is simply and solelv
the problem it solves for you in the development of your copy—
by the emotional reaction it produces on your reader when he
encounters it.

If, in this case, vou have caused him to question a habit . . .
shift a lovalty . . . take a chance on your product—you have done
your job, no matter how few or how many words vou have used
to do it.

### THE SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFLAGE

**How to Borrow Conviction for Your Copy**

We have now discussed five separate wavs to build believabilitv into vour copv. I do not think
we should leave this subject without at least mentioning one other,
entirely different, approach—that oi borrowing believabilitv from
all the places in our society where it is stored up.

The process bv which vou do this is quite simple. As vou
know, people do not bin' a newspaper, or a magazine, or anv
other medium of communication for its ads at all. They buv this
publication—or thev turn on their radio and television set—to
_keep in touch icith the world around them; to learn what's hap-_
pening, and whv it's happening. To be entertained, or enlightened, or simplv kept up to date.

Now, when a person chooses one of the publications (and
for a moment we'll disregard radio and television), he does so
because he believes that that publication is telling him the truth.
He has faith in that publication. He believes in it.

185

1 8 6 SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFLAGE

And, as long as he has faith in that publication (as any space
buyer can tell you) it remains an excellent medium for advertis_ing—because some of his trust carries over from the editorial_
_pages to the advertising pages. He simply assumes that his pub-_
lication wouldn't carry the ad if it weren't true.

And, on the other hand, when he loses faith in that publication, the effectiveness of its advertising just goes to pieces. If
he no longer believes in the publication, he won't believe in the
advertising it carries. This factor—the believability in the medium
itself—I think is a far more important consideration in buying
space than mere circulation.

All this is of vital interest to the space buyer, of course, but
we have to go a step further. You see, not only does this reader
come to believe in the publication which he buys repeatedly, but
after a while he becomes used to receiving his tmth couched in
the style and format and phraseology of that particular publication.

In other words, a conditioned reflex has been formed here.
The man believes in the publication. The publication phrases its
material in a certain way. After a while, that phraseology begins
_to carry an aura of truth all by itself no matter what material_
_it embraces._

Thus, you have waiting for your ad—if it is adapted the right
way—a stored believability. A believability reflex. Which you can
tap by adopting this particular publication's phraseology when you
address its audience.

**Let's Look at a Few Examples**

**I'll try to show you the three different ways you can borrow**
this built-up believability:

First, of course, and most obvious, is Format. Each publication has its own look. You have your copy. Your job is to merge
both of them into a combination that will:

1. Allow the reader to enter into your ad with the least
possible mental shifting of gears from "editorial" to "advertisement."

-----

SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFLAGE _Vr> I_

2. Carrv along the greatest possible amount of believability
through every sentence of the ad.

I have not discussed layout in this book, because I do not believe layout is nearly as effective as copy in determining the results of your ad. Here, however, layout is important. A single change
in format can add 50% to your readership, and your results.

Your job here, once again, is to approximate as closely as
possible the format of the medium in which you are advertising.
This means, ideally, letting them set vour ad . . . using their kind
of headline-to-body-copy transition . . . using their illustrations,
their sub heads, their break-up of space.

On the following pages are two ads for the same book on
handling people. The first is an all-purpose, house-set magazine
ad that was shotgunned over twelve or fifteen media. It was mildly
successful.

The second is the same ad. adapted feature for feature for
the Wall Street Journal. It was enormously successful—so much
so that it has been repeated i at the time of this writing) nineteen times, once a month, with no drop-off in pull.

Let's look at the changes that give this adapted format such
continued believability:

1. The headline, set by the journal in journal type. There
is no difference between this old-fashioned, upper-and-lower-case
headline and any other headline in the editorial content of this
issue. Therefore, it does not immediately signal the reader: "This
is an ad: beware!" To have made it bolder, or more modern, or
in all caps, would simply diminish its effectiveness.

2. The sub headlines—two of them, one following directly
on the other. Verv Nineteenth Century, really. Abandoned years
ago by 99% of all American newspapers. But the Journal uses it,
and therefore the ad uses the same treatment. And the very fact
that it is so unusual, and so old-fashioned, makes its adaptation
that much more belief-carrying in this context.

190 SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFL A(.I

3. The two bars directly above and below the first sub head
One of those small touches that defines individualitv. The ac
would lose some of its atmosphere without them. And atmosphere (believabilitv, trust) is what you're seeking with these
adaptations.

4. The placement of subheads to the extreme left of the column. Another minute detail. Bad lavout according to the a^encx
art director. But again, in perfect harmony with the format of
the editorial content.

5. The line drawing of the author. An uglv rendering. Far
less attractive than the photograph of the same man in the magazine ad. And yet the Journal does not use photographs of the
men they picture in their editorial columns. And so this ad must
do the same, even at the cost of harrowing screams of pain from
its authors (until they see their rovaltv checks).

Thus, what has been done by these adaptations, is that a
corny, old-fashioned, rather ugly advertisement has been developed for this specific medium—which has about twice the believability, twice the pulling power, and twice the staving power
of the same exact copy and illustration presented the massproduced wav.

Is it worth the extra cost? Yes. Should it be done for each
important medium in turn? Yes.

Why? Because in so doing, you are tapping the ingrained
trust that the reader has for each medium in turn, and channeling at least part of it, unconsciously, onto vour product.

This, then, is the first method of borrowing this built-in believability: adopting format.

**The Second Way to Borrow Believabilitv**

The second—slighth- less specific—is adopting phraseology.
This method stems from the fact that certain media, or classes
of media, use certain stereotyped phrases over and over again,
which after a while take on a believabilitv of their own.

-----

SEVENTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CAMOUFLAGE 1 9 1

In newspapers, to take the most obvious example, there is
usually an issue date, a city of origin, and perhaps a by-line. Each
of these news-indicators may be picked up by the copv writer to
add believability to his opening, as in this extremely successful
example:

SKIN SPECIALIST DEMONSTRATES

HOW TO RINSE AWAY YOUR BLACKHEADS
Bv Claire Hoffman
New York, N.Y.—A leading doctor today
showed an audience of men. women and skintroubled teenagers how to clean oily skin and
shrink enlarged pores with a lO-minute home medical treatment he has perfected. . . ."

And so on. The news tone has been set by the opening phrases.
The entire remainder of the copy has been given the atmosphere
of a report rather than a sales story by these first few sentences.

The same principle can be used for each of the other classes
of media vou employ. In direct mail, look for the key correspondence your prospect receives that are opened instantly
without exception. Some examples would be refund checks, government correspondence, dividend notices, confidential reports,
high-priced newsletters, etc.

In radio and TV, adopt the news format and the news phraseology'. Even, if possible, adopt the news "sound"—the clipped
phrase of the newscaster, the insider tone of the analyst, the documentary feel of the news, hand-held camera.

Study the channels of communication that people believe in.
Adopt their tone, their feel, their style, their sincerity. Make your
ads blend in, so there is no jarring transition. Camouflage them.

**Believability-Borrowing Strategy #3**

In a later chapter, we'll deal with mood directly. However,
as the last method of borrowing believability, I want to mention

-----

192 SEVENTH T E C H N I Q I E OK BHKAKTIIROl•(;H COPY: CAMOl IT,A(.l

two mood adaptations that rightly belong j„ this discussion.
We've seen that you borrow vour publications format and
your publications phraseology or stvle. These two methods ol
adding confidence to your copy depend directly on the particular medium you are using at am particular moment.

You pick up that publications appearance and idiom, as it
were, because people have come to contrast that editorial manner of presentation with ••advertising language" in general and
because they automatically trust the first, and automatically approach the second with an ingrained skepticism.

In other words, advertising language, which is .mite naturalK
biased language and emotionally-charged language, tends to produce a counter-reaction in its prospects bv its verx appearance.

To overcome this instant and automatic skepticism—besides
borrowing our host publications idiom—we also have two other
idioms which allow us to escape the -hard-sell" stereohpe.

The first is _Understatement._ Simplicity. A lack'of color
words. Fewer adjectives than the reader would expect \o superlatives. Short sentences, that fall rather than rise in tone at
their end.
