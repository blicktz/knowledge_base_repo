# WHY MOST MARKETING
 IS A MONEY PIT

###### CHAPTER 1

## THE KEY TO BEING SEEN, HEARD,
 AND UNDERSTOOD

### Most companies waste enormous amounts of money on marketing. We all
###### know how mind-numbing it is to spend precious dollars on a new marketing effort that gets no results. When we see the reports, we wonder what went wrong or, worse, whether our product is really as good as we thought it was.
 But what if the problem wasn’t the product? What if the problem was the way we talked about the product?
 The problem is simple: the graphic artists and designers we’re hiring to build our websites and ad campaigns have degrees in design and know everything about Photoshop, but they haven’t read a single book about writing good sales copy. How many of them know how to clarify your message so customers listen? Even worse, these companies will gladly take your money regardless of whether you see positive results.
 The fact is, pretty websites don’t sell things. Words sell things. And if we haven’t clarified our message, our customers won’t listen.
 If we pay a lot of money to a design agency without first clarifying our message, we might as well be holding a bullhorn up to a monkey. The only thing a potential customer will hear is noise.
 Still, clarifying our message isn’t easy. I had one client say that when he tried to do so, he felt like he was inside the bottle trying to read the label. I understand. Before I started StoryBrand I was a writer and spent thousands of hours staring at a blank computer screen, wondering what to say. That soul-wrenching frustration led me to create a communication framework

-----

###### based on the proven power of story, and I swear it was like discovering a secret formula. Using the framework, my writing got easier and better. I ended up selling millions of books. After using the framework to create clear messages in my books, I used it to filter the marketing collateral in my own small company. Once we got clear, we doubled in revenue for four consecutive years. I now teach that framework to more than ten thousand businesses each year.
 Once they get their message straight, our clients create quality websites, incredible keynote presentations, emails that get opened, advertising that gets clicked, social media posts that get noticed, and sales letters that people respond to. Why? Because nobody will listen to you if your message isn’t clear, no matter how expensive your marketing collateral may be.
 At StoryBrand we’ve had clients double, triple, and even quadruple their revenue after they got one thing straight—their message.
 The StoryBrand framework has been just as effective for billion-dollar brands as it has for mom-and-pop businesses. It is just as powerful for American corporations as it has been for those in Japan and Africa. Why? Because the human brain, no matter what region of the world it comes from, is drawn toward clarity and away from confusion.
 The reality is we aren’t just in a race to get our products to market; we’re also in a race to communicate why our customers need those products. Even if we have the best product in the marketplace, we’ll lose to an inferior product if our competitor’s offer is communicated more clearly.
 So what’s your message? Can you say it easily? Is it simple, relevant, and relatable? Can your entire team repeat your company’s message in such a way that it is compelling? Can you and your team easily remember the talking points they can use to describe what the company offers and why every potential customer should buy it?
 How many sales are we missing out on because customers can’t figure out what our offer is within five seconds of visiting our website, seeing our ads, reading our lead generators, or opening our emails?

##### WHY SO MANY BUSINESSES FAIL

-----

###### To find out why so many marketing and branding attempts fail, I called my friend Mike McHargue. Mike, often called “Science Mike” because he hosts a successful podcast called Ask Science Mike, spent fifteen years using science-based methodologies to help companies figure out how their customers think, specifically in the tech space. Sadly, he left advertising when a client asked him to create an algorithm predicting the associated buying habits of people with diabetes. Translation: they wanted him to sell junk food to diabetics. Mike refused and left the industry. He’s a good man. I called, though, because he still has incredible insight as to how marketing, story, and behavior all blend together.
 At my request, Mike flew to Nashville to attend one of our workshops. After two days learning the StoryBrand 7-Part framework (hereafter called the SB7 framework), we sat on my back porch and I grilled him with questions. Why does this formula work? What’s happening in the brains of consumers as they encounter a message filtered through this formula? What’s the science behind why brands like Apple and Coke, who intuitively use this formula, dominate the marketplace?
 “There’s a reason most marketing collateral doesn’t work,” Mike said, putting his feet up on the coffee table. “Their marketing is too complicated. The brain has to work too hard to process the information. The more simple and predictable the communication, the easier it is for the brain to digest. Story helps because it is a sense-making mechanism. Essentially, story formulas put everything in order so the brain doesn’t have to work to understand what’s going on.”
 Mike went on to explain that, among the million things the brain is good at, the overriding function of the brain is to help an individual survive and thrive. Everything the human brain does, all day, involves helping that person (and the people that person cares about) get ahead in life.
 Mike asked if I remembered that old pyramid we learned about in high school, Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. First, he reminded me, the brain is tasked with setting up a system in which we can eat and drink and survive physically. In our modern, first-world economy, this means having a job and a dependable income. Then the brain is concerned with safety, which might entail having a roof over our heads and a sense of well-being and power that keeps us from being vulnerable. After food and shelter are taken care of, our brains start thinking about our relationships, which entail everything from reproducing in a sexual relationship, to being nurtured in a

-----

###### romantic relationship, to creating friendships (a tribe) who will stick by us in case of any social threats. Finally, the brain begins to concern itself with greater psychological, physiological, or even spiritual needs that give us a sense of meaning.
 What Mike helped me understand is that, without us knowing it, human beings are constantly scanning their environment (even advertising) for information that is going to help them meet their primitive need to survive. This means that when we ramble on and on about how we have the biggest manufacturing plant on the West Coast, our customers don’t care. Why? Because that information isn’t helping them eat, drink, find a mate, fall in love, build a tribe, experience a deeper sense of meaning, or stockpile weapons in case barbarians start coming over the hill behind their cul-de- sac.
 So what do customers do when we blast a bunch of noise at them? They ignore us.
 And so right there on my back porch, Mike defined two critical mistakes brands make when they talk about their products and services.

 Mistake Number One
 The first mistake brands make is failing to focus on the aspects of their offer that will help people survive and thrive.
 All great stories are about survival—either physical, emotional, relational, or spiritual. A story about anything else won’t captivate an audience. Nobody’s interested. This means that if we position our products and services as anything but an aid in helping people survive, thrive, be accepted, find love, achieve an aspirational identity, or bond with a tribe that will defend them physically and socially, good luck selling anything to anybody. Surviving and thriving are the primary concerns of every healthy human being on the planet. We can take that truth to the bank. Or to bankruptcy court, should we choose to ignore it as an undeniable fact.
 Mike said our brains are constantly sorting through information, so we discard millions of unnecessary facts every day. If we were to spend an hour in a giant ballroom, our brains would never think to count how many chairs are in the room. Meanwhile, we would always know where the exits are. Why? Because our brains don’t need to know how many chairs there are in the room to survive, but knowing where the exits are would be helpful in case of a fire.

-----

###### Mike helped me understand that, without knowing it, the subconscious is always categorizing and organizing information, and, as it relates to growing our businesses, when we talk publicly about our company’s random backstory or internal goals, or worse, when we are vague and confusing about what problem we solve for the customer, we’re positioning ourselves as the chairs, not the exits. In other words, the way most of us talk about our brand and our products causes the very customers we want to engage us to ignore us.
 “The reason many businesses—and for that matter, leaders, are ignored,” Mike continued, “is because processing information demands that the brain burn calories. And the burning of too many calories processing information we do not need in order to survive acts against the brain’s primary job: to help us survive and thrive.”
 The point is this: most of our messaging collateral is elusive, confusing, or unrelatable, which means that God has literally designed our customers’ brains to ignore us.

 Mistake Number Two
 The second mistake brands make when they talk about their products and services is they require their customers to burn too many calories in order to understand their offer.
 When having to process too much seemingly unnecessary information, people begin to ignore the source of that information in an effort to conserve calories. In other words, there’s a survival mechanism within our customers’ brains that is designed to tune us out should we ever start confusing them.
 Imagine every time we talk about our products to potential customers, they have to start running on a treadmill. Literally, they have to jog the whole time we’re talking. How long do you think they’re going to pay attention? Not long. And yet this is very close to what’s actually happening in our customers’ minds as we talk to them about our products. When we start our elevator pitch or keynote address, or when somebody visits our website, they’re burning calories to process the information we’re sharing. And if we don’t say something (and say something quickly) they can use to survive or thrive, they will tune us out.
 These two realities—that people are looking for brands that can help them survive and thrive, and that communication must be so simple that a

-----

###### person doesn’t have to burn too many mental calories to understand what we’re saying—explain why the SB7 framework has helped so many businesses grow their revenue and influence. The key is to create a message that reveals how we help our customers survive and to do so in language so simple that they understand the message without having to, burn too many calories.
 Not long ago, I helped a major pet-supply brand nearly double their revenue by adding only three words to their packaging and signage: kids love aquariums. Spectrum brands had been wildly successful in the home aquarium and fish supply market at American pet stores for years; however, they were having trouble selling aquariums to anybody other than fish enthusiasts and hobbyists. Despite their efforts, they were not able to move into the family market. As we spoke, I recalled that my young daughter loved aquariums. In fact, on a recent trip to London she asked me to stand in front of the aquarium in the lobby for long periods of time until we could find Nemo! She loved the aquarium so much I actually took a video of it with my phone so she could watch the video before we read bed-time stories. When I recommended that Spectrum simply add three words to their packaging, Kids Love Aquariums, they weren’t convinced the answer could be that easy. But think about it: if parents are walking into a pet store looking for something their kids will love (part of the human survival dynamic involves building a family tribe, creating family bonds, and passing love and nurture to our children), then the “Kids Love Aquariums” tagline would position their products as the very solution parents are looking for.
 The result of the three-word campaign in a test market? A 99 percent increase in overall sales. The results were so good that Spectrum is currently rolling out the messaging strategy nationwide.
 The truth is, you don’t need an expensive ad campaign or a beautiful style guide to grow your business; you just need a few sound bites customers immediately understand so they quickly realize you have a solution to their problem.
 But what kind of sound bites should we use, and how do we come up with them?

##### STORY TO THE RESCUE

###### Story is the most powerful tool we can use to organize and communicate our offering so people don’t have to burn many calories to understand us. I discovered this during my years as a memoirist. My first book, which I wrote before understanding story and story structure, sold only about ten thousand copies. But after studying and incorporating a story-based formula, my next book ended up on the New York Times bestseller list for nearly a year. Story, it turns out, is a sense-making device readers can follow without having to burn very many calories.
 What is a story? A story identifies an ambition or objective the hero wants to accomplish, then defines the challenges that are keeping the hero from getting what they want, then provides a plan to help the hero conquer those challenges so they can survive and thrive. It’s an age-old formula, but it works. And it doesn’t only work to entertain us; it works to get our attention. Here, then, is the thesis of this book: when we define the elements of a story as it relates to our brand, we create a mental map customers can follow to engage our products and services.
 In the years since the first edition of this book came out, hundreds of thousands of business owners have used the framework to invite their customers into a story, and the results are compelling. Thousands of business owners and leaders have told us that, after simply clarifying their message, sales have grown exponentially.
 Still, when I talk about story to business leaders, they immediately put me in a category with artists, thinking I want to introduce them to something fanciful. But that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about a concrete formula we can use to garner attention from otherwise distracted customers. I’m talking about practical steps we can take to make sure people see us, hear us, and understand exactly why they simply must engage our products.

##### THE FORMULA FOR CLEAR COMMUNICATION

###### Formulas are simply the summation of best practices, and the reason we like them is because they work. We’ve been given great formulas for

-----

###### management, like Ken Blanchard’s Situational Leadership, and ones we can use in manufacturing like Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing. But what about one for communication? Why don’t we have a formula we can use to effectively explain what our products offer the world?
 The StoryBrand framework is that formula. We know it works because some variation of this formula has been actively used over thousands of years to get people to pay attention to plays, books, and more recently movies and television shows. Talk about a summation of best practices. Story formulas have been tested by the entertainment industry since antiquity. When it comes to grabbing people’s attention, this proven formula will be your most powerful ally.
 I will warn you though. Story formulas are just that—they are formulaic. Once you know the formulas screenwriters and novelists use to hook a reader, you can predict the path most stories will take. I’ve learned these formulas so well that my wife hates going to movies with me because she knows at some point I’m going to elbow her and whisper something like, “That guy’s going to die in thirty-one minutes.”
 Story formulas reveal a well-worn path in the human brain, and if we want to stay in business, we need to position our products along a path they are designed to follow.
 The good news is these formulas can work just as well at growing your business as they do at entertaining an audience.

##### THE KEY IS CLARITY

###### The narrative coming out of a company (and, for that matter, being spoken inside a company) must be clear. In a story, audiences must always know who the hero is, what the hero wants, who the hero has to defeat to get what they want, what tragic thing will happen if they don’t win, and what wonderful thing will happen if they do. If an audience can’t answer these basic questions, they’ll check out and the movie will lose millions at the box office. And if a screenwriter breaks these rules, they’ll likely never work again.
 The same is true for the brand you represent. Our customers have burning questions, and if we aren’t answering those questions, they’ll move
