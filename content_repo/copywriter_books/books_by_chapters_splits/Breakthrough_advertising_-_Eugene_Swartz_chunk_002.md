2. To show how this full acceptance—this willingness to believe without question-can gradually be built up, layer by laver
agreement by agreement, by use of the proper structure.' '
Let us now state formally some of the rules we have dis
covered in this analysis, and some of the devices vou can use
time after time, to create the maximum structural believabiliti,
tor each of your advertisements.
Here are the basic principles:
_Gradualization is the art of stating a claim in such a wav_
that it will receive the greatest possible acceptance and/or believabilitv from your prospect.

Belief ultimately depends upon structure. Just as desire depends upon promise, so belief in that promise depends upon the
_amount of preparation that promise has been given before vour_
reader is asked to accept it.

One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power often partially-believed promises. Most copy writers try to strengthen
ads by piling promise upon promise. What thev usually get for
their troubles is greater sales resistance from their prospects and
trouble from the ETC. They could far better invest the same
time in strengthening the believabilitu-structure of the original
justifiable promise.

Now, how do you strengthen this believability-structure*
What are the devices you can choose from to add believabilitv
to any promise, in any ad?

Here are at least a few of them. Once vou get the feel of
using them, you'll probably develop a whole armorv of vour own.

**1. The Inclusion Question**

Designed to permit immediate identification with vour storv.
To show the prospect that you're talking about him—not about
someone else who would answer No to the question. Therefore,
once he's identified with the questions—once he's made his first
agreements with you and placed himself in the Yes-answer group—
then your recommendations will have special meaning for him.

This is perhaps the most direct wav of building agreement
at the beginning of the ad. It's used everv day. For example, in
this advertisement—highly successful—for a book called The Art
_of_ _Selfishness:_

ASK YOURSELF THESE NINE QUESTIONS

1. Do you find it increasinglv difficult to cope with
the world around you. . . .

2. Is your business or career a source of annoyance
and frustration. . . .

3. Are you tormented by inadequacies, fear and embarrassments in your sex life. . . .

And so on.

**2. Detailed Identification**

Another device used at the beginning of the ad, to establish
immediate, and deep, agreement between the reader and the
copy. Here, instead of asking questions to set up your Yes-train,
you detail symptoms or problems that are your prospect's reasons
for desiring your product. Thus, again, your reader knows that
vou are talking about him—that vou "have been there vourself"—
and therefore that your recommendations will help answer these
problems, his problems, that you have catalogued so well.

For example, in this ad for a course to improve the prospect's
child's grades in school:

Let me explain. I don't care whether your child is six
years old or twenty—boy or girl—in grade school high
school or college. It makes no difference how badly that
child is doing in school today—how difficult it is for him
to concentrate . . . how poor his memory mav be . . . howmuch a prisoner he is of crippling mental habits . . . how
terrified he mav be of mathematics, or grammar, or social
studi es, or even the hardest science course.

Of course, here—as in the Inclusion-Question—vour copv
must be accurate. You must know enough about the reader's
problems to make every word you write ring true. If vou don't,
you'll shatter your believability-net, and he'll simply' turn the
#### page.

So—before you write—research. Learn to know vour customer. This is alwavs the essential first step, in anv kind of copv

**3. Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs**

Again, used at the beginning of the ad. And again used to
prepare a foundation for strong claim-statements that the reader
might never accept raw. Here, you come bluntly out and say, "I
know you think this is true; but I'm going to show YOU it's false."

Best used, of course, in conjunction with strong authority strong
enough to contradict present (unpleasant) beliefs, and get away
with it.

For example, in an ad for cosmetics invented by a famous
plastic surgeon:

From this moment on, forget everything you have ever
heard or read about what age "must do" to your appearance. Forget anything you have ever believed about how
"old" you must look at thirty . . . forty . . . fifty ... or even
sixty. ...

Here vou are not looking for agreement as much as you are
for a loosening of previous beliefs. You are saying that the old
limitations are passing, and your next paragraph should be your
first introduction of your positive claims, in somewhat the same
way that this ad goes on:

Because—starting with this moment—you are about
to enter into a new world of beautv! A world where ordinary fruits are transformed into anti-wrinkle cosmetics.
Where a. . . .

And so on.

**4. The Language of Logic**

So far, the devices we have discussed have been used to
build belief at the beginning of vour ad—to serve in the crucial
transition from vour headline to the stream of intensified promises that vou are going to use to close the sale.

We have discussed the process of intensifying desire in
