Chapter 7. We now turn to the simultaneous, and equally important, task of maintaining belief in each new statement as you

present it.

Here again, your objective is to build belief at the same exact
time that vou build desire. To do this, you interlace each new
_promise tcith language-signals that show that it logically follows_
_from everything that has been proved before. And that it there-_
_fore can be believed without hesitation._

What are these language-signals? They are, of course, the
vocabulary of logic. They are the words we use when we reason:
when we argue; when we prove our point in anv discussion, and
force others to agree with us that we are right.

They are among the most powerful words in the English language—for the verv simple reason that they give the flavor of
conviction to the promises into which we weave them.

These words have been used for centuries in court, in politics,

-----

148 THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION

in science—even in that most-loved form of American fiction,
detective stories—to show others that proof has been offered.
that reason has been used, that one statement logically and inevitably follows from another.

Therefore, after centuries of conditioning, the words themselves—regardless of the content of the statements to which thev
are attached—now carry conviction. Therefore, thev should be
woven throughout your ad, wherever thev logically apply.

For example, let's look at some individual lines, in a number of different ads. Let's see how each of these words (which
I'll italicize) gives a tone of reason and logic to those sentences
in which they're incorporated.

For example, in the famous Sherwin Codv ad:

Why do so many find themselves at a loss for words
to express their meaning adequately[0] The reason for this
deficiency is clear. . . . Most persons do not write or speak
good English simply because thev have never formed the
habit of doing so. . . .

Or, in this ad for a book on how to manage difficult people:

Take, as an example, the man who hahitualhj refuses
to follow your instructions. There is a basic, underlying rea_son for this. Mr. Given shows you how to find that reason_
and then explains the means of correcting it. The whole
_solution can be surprisingly easy once you hate realized the_
_underlying causes. . . ._

Or, for a book on learning how to learn:

. . . but simply by putting your LOCKED-UP LEARNING POWERS to work—today—as easily and logically as
_this. ..._ ' " '

And so on. There are dozens of such phrases for vou to use.
Among them are:

_"This has been proved In/ thousands. . . ."_
_"Sound impossible?_ Not at all. _It's actually_ _as_
_simple. . . ."_

-----

THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION 1 4 9

_"Here's whtj. . . ."_
"And, most important of all. is the fact that. . . ."

_"Therefore . . ."_
"This was, without a doubt, the most thorough. . . ."
"Thev discovered—in case after case—that. . . ."

This, again, is the language of logic. It is a language equally
as filled with emotion as the language of desire. Interwoven into
your promises, so subtly that the reader never even notices that
it is there, it gives vour claims the invaluable air of conviction.

**5. Svllogistic Thinking**

Now we go from the language of logic to the mechanisms
of logic. This is the role that reason plays in your ad. This is the
moment when you prove that your product works, through the
mechanism of logical reasoning.

For example, in one of the most successful automotive accessory ads of all time, the copywriter wanted to prove that his
spark plug was superior to the ordinary plug—even though it
costs twice as much. Since the point of difference was simply
that his plug delivered a larger spark, the copywriter built up his
case in this way:

Your car runs because gasoline is fed into the cylinders where a spark causes it to fire. This action causes the
gas to explode . . . this explosion pushes down the piston.
Now here is the important thing to you. The larger the
_spark is, the more powerful the explosion. The more pow-_
erful the explosion, the more power you get from your
gasoline.

Poor explosion means wasted gas—loss of power, poor
getaway, bad starting, a sluggish car.

Good explosion means more miles per gallon—more
horsepower; a more exciting car to drive!

Notice the power of these three simple paragraphs. Power
derived as much from their underlying formal structure as from

-----

1 5 0 THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CRADUALIZATION

their claims. One statement inevitably leads into another. Evenword is logical. There is a constant process of equation: spark to
power, power to performance. Size equals power—and his plug
delivers the largest size.

Such structure—and the copv based on such a structure—
develops the feeling of inevitability. The reader feels that the
product must work. He has not onlv been told it works; he has
been shown proof that it works.

Such structure—though hidden behind the words it clothes
itself in—is actually a physical entity. You can seek it out of hundreds of ads, if you look beneath the words themselves. You can
trace it, codify it, and then repeat it. Once learned, it becomes
a powerful tool in selling hundreds of products.

We will explore these structures in more depth in the next
two chapters—on Redefinition and Mechanization.

**6. Other Belief Forms**

Once you grasp the fundamental idea that form—structure—
determines believabilitv, then all sorts of opportunities open up
to you. You realize that simply by the arrangement of i/our claims,
you can add to their believabilitv.

For example:
_Contingency Structures—such as "If. . . then . . .", or "Wis_
your...then...."

_Repetition of Proof: Echoing—such_ as "These experts
found. . . . These experts found. . . . These experts found. ..."

_Promise—Belief—Promise Variation. Where every sentence_
of promise is followed (ideally) with another of proof, or verification, or documentation. So that the reader never has the breathing space to question.

_Paragraph Parallelism. Where the same word structure used_
in an accepted statement is then picked up exactly, and used to
borrow acceptance for a fresh claim.

There are manv more, of course. Some are words, some are
chains of reasoning, some are merelv the physical arrangement
of the copy on the page.

All have the same objective. To gain continued acceptance.
To prevent rejection. To build conviction. Belief is the goal.

Now let us look at some other methods of reinforcing it.

### THE FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION

**How to Remove Objections to Your Product**

Time and time again, you are
going to have to sell a product that has built-in handicaps. That—
along with its promises and its functions—also has certain aspects
to it that actually repel the prospect.

No product, of course, is perfect. If only for the reason that
he must pav money for what you have to sell, your prospect starts
with a basic minimum of resistance against buying your product.

But this resistance is intensified by certain drawbacks in some
products, often to the point where—unless you take definite action in your ad to redefine them—these drawbacks will actually
kill your sale.

Let us now look at the three general categories of drawback,
and then at the three types of redefinition that eliminates them.

First, of course, there is the product that is (or that sounds)
too complicated—too hard to use.

153

1 5 4 FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION

Second, there is the product that is not important enough—
whose basic appeal doesn't have a statistically broad enough
market.

And third, there is the product that just costs too much. Its
price is so much above the price of other products in its class
that people simply turn away when it's mentioned.

It's amazing how many products fall into one or all of these
categories. Fortunately, the same mechanism—redefinition—helps
you deal with all three.

_Redefinition is the process of giving a new definition to your_
product. It says that the product is this rather than that. Its objective is to remove a roadblock to your sale—if possible, before
the prospect even knows it exists.

Perhaps the classic case of redefinition is that of Lifebuov
soap in the Thirties. Lifebuoy was a good soap that did a good
cleaning job. But it had one overwhelming drawback—a horrible
medicinal odor.

Since the odor couldn't be removed without removing the
clet amng power, the problem became one of redefinition. Put simply: how do we change this odor from a liability into an asset?
The answer, of course, was the famous B.O. campaign. The
prospect's attention was focussed on the odor of his own bodv—
an odor which he was told would drive away people (and which
does).

He was then told this odor must be eradicated—not with an
ordinary soap, which was not powerful enough to do the job
but with a soap with the odor-destroying power to make a longshoreman acceptable at a society ball. Lifebuov was this superpowerful soap. And the overwhelming proof—that von could smell
the moment you opened the wrapper—was the strong medicinal
_odor built into every cake._

This is the simplest, and often the most effective kind of redefinition. A simple concept-judo. A complete reversal. Turning
a liability into an asset, with a single idea.

Wherever you can use this flip-flop method, do so. But most

FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION _lOO_

problems of redefinition are more complicated, and demand more
complicated means of dealing with them—using many of the devices we have just examined in the process of Gradualization.

Let us now turn to these devices, and see how they can present an entirelv different image of the product to the prospect
than vou would have imaginetl, had you not thought them through
beforehand.

**1. Simplification**

Our first category is the overcomplicated product—the product that sounds too hard. To see how to replace this image with
a more favorable one, let's look again at the Television Repair
Book ad that we discussed in the last chapter.

As vou remember, the original ad for this product failed because it promised "Do your own TV repairs" in its headline. This
was considered too difficult by the average set owner (even though
the ad said "It's easy, its simple, it's quick" in the next paragraph).
Therefore—since the ad confronted the prospect with the fact
that he would have to make repairs before it made those repairs
easy and simple and quick—he simply- turned the page and tuned
the ad out.

The second ad did not discuss repairs. It discussed breakdowns and expenses. And, as we have seen, it spent its first several paragraphs showing that these breakdowns and expenses did
not have to occur at all, if the sets were given the proper care.

Up to this point, the ad has talked about the prospect's
world—and compared it with a far more promising world where
expert care produces trouble-free TV viewing. Now the two worlds
_must be joined through_ _the product._
This joining is called by the pitchman, "the turn." It is a
transition of great delicacy. It must be accomplished without a
jar. In this ad, it begins in this paragraph:

And most important, these experts have discovered
that vou do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in

-----

156
FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION

order to coax this performance out of vour set! Here's
why. ...

We have already seen how the repetition ( . . . these experts
have discovered . . . ) and the paragraph parallelism tie this statement into the stream of belief that has been built up before it.
Now, however, we are going to look at this same paragraph from
another point of view—to see how it provides the first step in
eliminating any fear of making your own repairs.

Notice, of course, that the very fear of the average owner.
that he is not a repairman, is here brought out in the o p e n specifically stated—but now framed as a promise.

Notice too that there is no mention of the word, "repair," at
this point. It is still too early at this point. Though the average owner might be willing to accept the idea that he could "coax" better
performance out of his set, it would still be too much to ask him
to believe that he could make repairs on that set at this point.

This leads to the final step. The ad must now redefine what
_the reader thinks of when he hears the word "repairs." It must_
now lay a new foundation of feet—showing that almost all the
repairs the owner will have to make are actually only minor external adjustments.

It now proceeds to do this, in the following three paragraphs
which we have already studied in the last chapter, and which we
will now look at again to see the second process of persuasionredefinition—which is also occurring in them.
Here are the paragraphs again:

Five Minutes a Week for Perfect Reception.
These TV experts have discovered that vour TV set is
a great deal like vour body in this respect—that it gives you
warning signals before it has a major breakdown.' For'instance, after your set was installed, 'it probably plaved perfectly for the first week. But then it began to suffer from the
vibration, the jarring, the interference of other electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to
flop over or flicker—lines may appear on vour screen.

-----

FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION 1 5 7

Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of vour set. then vou could correct those symptoms. you could keep that set playing perfectly, and you
could prevent major breakdowns in exactly die same way
thev were prevented in these manufacturers' tests.

If you do not have this knowledge . . . if you do not
make these adjustments, then your set will weaken, you
will get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call
a repairman.

Now, what occurs in these four paragraphs is actually a redefinition of the term, "repairs" in the reader's mind. This is done
in three separate, but integrated, wax's:

1. By immediately comparing the television set to the human
body, and therefore minor maladjustments in the set to warning
signals given off bv the body before it becomes seriously ill.

By "making this comparison, the copy relates the intricate,
technical working of a television set to something as commonplace
and familiar as the running nose that warns you of an approaching cold. Because of this comparison, some of the mystery of the
set is explained away; and the owner gains a new feeling of confidence in dealing with it himself, as something he understands.
And, at the same time, this comparison distinguishes between the relatively rare major breakdowns, and the far more
frequent minor maladjustments, which he can now treat himself
as easily as he'd take a cold tablet to stop his running nose.

2. 'By continuously describing these minor maladjustments
as 'warning signals" and "symptoms" rather than "breakdowns"
or "repairs." This makes them sound easily corrected—-before real
trouble, which might require technical skill and complicated tools,
can develop out of them.

3. And finally, by stating outright that these minor adjustments can be corrected by "making a few minor adjustments, on
the outside controls of your set."

Therefore, "repairs" are redefined as "adjustments." Troubles
on the TV screen are redefined as 'warning signals" or "symp

1 5 8 FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION

toms." And "repair calls" or "breakdowns" are carefully segregated
into the least-likely-to-occur 5% of all possible TV troubles.

Therefore, with this redefinition in mind—with this reorganization of facts accomplished by the copy—there is no longer any
_reason for the average set owner not to make his oivn minor ad-_
_justments, rather than pay a repairman to make them for him._

The objective has been accomplished. The ad can now go
on to specifically state how much monev the owner will save by
making these adjustments—and where he can buv the book that
tells him how.

In exactly the same way, whenever there is a process which
is difficult. . . whenever there is a product which is hard to use,
or difficult to apply—the copywriters first task is to simplify that
application in his prospect's mind.

This holds especially true for new inventions which actually
simplify processes which formerly were too difficult for the average prospect. A new breakthrough is not merely accepted because its manufacturer says so. Its claims for ease and simplicity
must be proved, in the ad, or the reader will simply shrug his
shoulders and say "it's just another copywriter gone wild."

Such a situation is one of the most frustrating experiences
you can have. Here is a product which vou know is far easier to
use than anything ever introduced in this field before—because
_you've used it! But no matter how loud you scream EASY in your_
ads, people just seem to ignore vou.

What do you do? The answer is twofold:
1. Redefine (as this chapter shows vou).
2. Mechanize the new simplicity (as you'll see in the next
chapter).

Remember, innovation without acceptance is valueless. The
more people know that something is difficult, and the more revolutionary (and therefore different) your product is—the more
resistance you will meet from them in accepting it.

You must, therefore, lay a base for acceptance by redefining
_the entire field for them, before vou bring in vour product._
