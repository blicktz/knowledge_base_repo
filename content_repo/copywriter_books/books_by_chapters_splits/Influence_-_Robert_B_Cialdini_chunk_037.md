#### acquiring what they don’t much favor simply because the time to do so is dwindling. The adept merchandiser makes this tendency pay off by arranging and publicizing customer deadlines that generate interest where none may have existed before. Concentrated instances of this approach often occur in movie advertising. In fact, I recently noticed that one theater owner, with remarkable singleness of purpose, had managed to invoke the scarcity principle three separate times in just five words of copy: “Exclusive, limited engagement ends soon!”
 A variant of the deadline tactic is much favored by some face-to-face, high-pressure sellers because it carries the ultimate decision deadline: right now. Customers are often told that unless they make an immediate decision to buy, they will have to purchase the item at a higher price later or they won’t be able to purchase it at all. A prospective health-club member or automobile buyer might learn that the deal offered by the salesperson is good for that one time only; should the customer leave the premises, the deal is off. One large child-portrait photography company urges parents to buy as many poses and copies as they can afford because “stocking limitations force us to burn the unsold pictures of your children within 24 hours.” A door-to-door magazine solicitor might say that salespeople are in the customer’s area for just a day; after that, they, and the customer’s chance to buy their magazine package, will be long gone.
 An in-home vacuum-cleaner-sales operation I infiltrated instructed its sales trainees to claim: “I have so many other people to see that I have the time to visit a family only once. It’s company policy that, even if you decide later that you want this machine, I can’t come back and sell it to you.” This, of course, is nonsense; the company and its representatives are in the business of making sales, and any customer who called for another visit would be accommodated gladly. As the company’s sales manager impressed on his trainees, the true purpose of the “can’t come back” claim has nothing to do with reducing overburdened sales schedules. It is to “keep the prospects from taking the time to think the deal over by scaring them into believing they can’t have it later, which makes them want it now.”[2]

### SWINDLED

#### New York Times

## NEW YORK-Daniel Gulban doesn’t remember how his life savings disappeared.

He remembers the smooth voice of a salesman on the telephone. He remembers
dreaming of a fortune in oil and silver futures. But to this day, the 81-year-old retired utility
worker does not understand how swindlers convinced him to part with $18,000.

“I just wanted to better my life in my waning days,” said Gulban, a resident of Holder,
FL. “But when I found out the truth, I couldn’t eat or sleep. I lost 30 pounds. I still can’t
believe I would do anything like that.”

Gulban was the victim of what law enforcement officials call a “boiler-room
operation,” a ruse that often involves dozens of fast-talking telephone salesmen crammed
into a small room where they call thousands of customers each day. The companies snare
hundreds of millions of dollars each year from unsuspecting customers, according to a U.S.
Senate subcommittee investigation, which issued a report on the subject last year.

“They use an impressive Wall Street address, lies and deception to get individuals to
sink their money into various glamorous-sounding schemes,” said Robert Abrams, the New
York State Attorney General, who has pursued more than a dozen boiler-room cases in the
past four years. “The victims are sometimes persuaded to invest the savings of a lifetime.”

Orestes J. Mihaly, the New York Assistant Attorney General in charge of the bureau of
investor protection and securities, said the companies often operate in three stages. First,
Mihaly said, comes the “opening call,” in which a salesman identifies himself as
representing a company with an impressive-sounding name and address. He will simply
ask the potential customer to receive the company’s literature.

A second call involves a sales pitch, Mihaly said. The salesman first describes the great
profits to be made and then tells the customer that it is no longer possible to invest. The
third call gives the customer a chance to get in on the deal, he said, and is offered with a
great deal of urgency.

“The idea is to dangle a carrot in front of the buyer’s face and then take it away.”
Mihaly said. “The aim is to get someone to buy it quickly, without thinking too much about
it.” Sometimes, Mihaly said, the salesman will be out of breath on the third call and will
tell the customer that he “just came off the trading floor.”

Such tactics convinced Gulban to part with his life savings. A stranger called him
repeatedly and convinced Gulban to wire $1,756 to New York to purchase silver, Gulban
said. After another series of telephone calls the salesman cajoled Gulban into wiring more
than $6,000 for crude oil. He eventually wired an additional $9,740, but his profits never
arrived.

“My heart sank,” Gulban recalled, “I was not greedy. I just hoped I would see better
days.” Gulban never recouped his losses.

**Author’s note: Look at how the scarcity principle was employed during the second**
and third calls to cause Mr. Gulban to “buy quickly without thinking too much about it.”
