##### If somebody is reading a magazine and sees your advertising format— something they have seen many times before—and recognizes your logo or company name, there is a feeling of familiarity. They see a friend in an environment of foreign advertisers and to them you’re not foreign. You are familiar and as a result there is an attraction to your offering just as I was attracted to my supplier in Hong Kong.
 Advertise enough times or sell a product whose name is familiar to your prospect and you will create the same attraction. That is why brand names are so important; that is why the familiarity of a shopping environment is also important.
 When I first appeared on QVC, the home shopping channel, we sold out our entire inventory of BluBlocker sunglasses within minutes. When our sunglasses first appeared on retail shelves in the Walgreens drugstore chain, they quickly sold out within a few days. In short, our product was well known to the consumer. Each time we introduced our product to a familiar shopping environment, the combination of brand name familiarity and a familiar selling environment caused an immediate sellout.
 The words familiar and familiarity have the word family in them. People feel most comfortable within their own family. They feel confident and trusting and allow themselves to be more vulnerable. So it is with anything people are familiar with. They trust a brand name, are more confident that they are buying the right product and are more inclined to do so.
 One of the biggest mistakes traditional advertisers make is to kill campaigns they have been using a long time because they are tired of them. “Fly the friendly skies of United” and “You deserve a break today, at McDonald’s” are but two examples familiar to consumers. In addition, consumers often sang along during these commercials. Too often in traditional advertising, the client gets tired of the commercial long before the public does.
 In direct marketing, a decision to drop a commercial approach is not arbitrary. You keep running your product or service ad until the public tells you when to stop by virtue of lower sales. The orders simply stop coming in or you have replaced your ad with something that pulls more response. Good direct-marketing technique calls for continually revising or tweaking

##### your ad until it does better. But you never drop a campaign because you are tired of it. Drop it only when the public stops exchanging their hard-earned dollars for your product or service.
 Now the traditional agencies will tell you something like, “Well, we asked a focus group what they thought about our slogan and they said that they were getting tired of it, so we are going to pull it.” This is a major fallacy, too. There is no real way to test the effectiveness of a commercial except by virtue of sales. Focus groups only tell you what they think you want to hear and not how they would act themselves. If the product isn’t selling, then look at the campaign. Maybe it isn’t even the campaign but rather competition or some other element in the marketing mix.

## Use Familiar Words

##### There are certain words that are more familiar to most people and to the human consciousness. For example, if you ask somebody to give you a number from 1 to 10 right off the top of their head, chances are the number 7 will be chosen more often than any other number—often dwarfing the next choice. Therefore, using the number 7 in a book title such as “The Seven Ways to Improve Your Relationships” or “The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success” is utilizing the most common and familiar integer of the first 10. You are therefore vibrating with the familiar and harmonizing with your reader.
 Ask somebody for a color off the top of their head and the answer will be “red” the majority of the time. Ask them to name a piece of furniture and the answer will likely be “chair.” There are familiar words that can create a very subtle harmony with your reader and it’s up to you to find them and use them. Where do you find them? Many books have been written on the effective use of words that really draw response. Books by David Ogilvy or John Caples are good ones to read. A list can be found in Appendix D. There are some powerful words such as sale or free. And then there are the not so obvious words—the ones that relate specifically to your product and which you, as a passionate devotee of your product, inherently already know. Finally, there are words that aren’t in your own consciousness and aren’t singled out in any books but will be discovered only by testing. Sometimes, changing just one word in a thousand-word ad will double response.
 As a copywriter, be aware of the powerful force of familiarity to make a person comfortable with your product or service. Realize the importance of a familiar brand name, a logo that appears many times and becomes well known, a layout that people instinctively know is yours, familiar phrases (not clichés) and words that your public can harmonize with—all of these reinforce the bond that familiarity creates between you and your prospect.

# 31. Hope

##### Hope can be a great motivator in the buying process. A woman buys a new face cream that offers the hope it will make a difference in her wrinkles. An intense golfer buys a new golf ball that offers the hope it may take a few strokes off a golf game. In short, there is an implied possibility that using a product or service will provide a future benefit. The future benefit is not assured, nor is it guaranteed; it is a dream, a fantasy or, at the most, a possibility. The hope replaces the reality of an already-delivered benefit or guarantee that you receive when you buy other products such as a radio or a computer. Let me cite a few personal experiences and describe how hope applies to specific products.
 I was introduced in 1996 to a very successful scientist. He had supposedly invented a formula that cured a great many human ills. The formula contained what he called “biological repair machines” that went to the source of a malfunction in your body and repaired it. If an organ was damaged, these miniature “machines” would repair the organ even if it meant regenerating a new one.
 You placed a few drops of this product under your tongue twice a day and it was absorbed into your body.
 In a discussion with the scientist, it occurred to me that if people took this product they would never die, if indeed it repaired any defective body part. He agreed. “I’m taking it and honestly feel I am getting younger. Look, my gray hair is starting to turn black again.”
 The scientist continued claiming that there was no reason why his formula couldn’t keep us alive until the age of 300. This sounded incredible to me. If this was true, this man had indeed discovered the fountain of youth.
 The scientist appeared to be very credible. He had several Ph.D.’s, and I honestly thought he was one of the smartest people I had ever met. He had three manufacturing facilities in different parts of the world. He had a reputation that extended all the way to Europe and Asia, and he told me how he helped an Asian country cure many of its citizens of a specific form of cancer.
 His discovery of the biological repair machines came to him from uncovering formulas that were hidden in coded ancient artifacts and through

##### the process of what he called “sacred geometry.” He had apparently cracked the code and opened up a wealth of information. He spent two hours showing me photograph after photograph to substantiate the information he had received from the artifacts.
 I had a health problem that was not serious but, for whatever reason, doctors did not know its cause or cure. The problem was a few small growths beneath the surface of my skin. They were not cancerous, others hardly noticed them and they posed no health threat. But they were there and they were not normal.

####

## Surgery Was the Only Way

##### The only method doctors had for eliminating these growths was to cut open the skin and surgically remove them—a relatively easy procedure that was done on an outpatient basis.
 I was told by this scientist that indeed his formula could eliminate the problem completely. “In just a few months they’ll be gone,” he said. In short, I received from him an explicitly clear time frame during which my growths were going to melt away and disappear. The promise wasn’t in the form of a hoped-for result or a dream or even a possibility. It was a definite warranty that they would disappear.
 I was so impressed by him and his discoveries and he seemed so credible that I decided to put his product to a test. A 750 milliliter bottle (the size of a wine bottle) of his formula sold for $600. It was rather expensive but it lasted a long time as you used only a few drops each day and it was less costly than the surgical procedure.

## A Few Months Go By

##### After a few months, I noticed that the growths were not gone as I had been promised. I was then advised to buy his stronger formula—the one with a higher concentration of biological repair machines. I did, at a cost of $2,000. There was still no improvement after two more months.
 I was then told that there was a $20,000 bottle that would do the job (boy, they saw me coming) and believe it or not, I was tempted to get a bottle. I didn’t.
 Note: In all fairness to the scientist, there were clinical studies done on rats with his formula by a credible pharmaceutical company and there were very positive results with the rats. The research is continuing now on humans and he may have indeed created a powerful new medical concept.
 What did I learn from this experience? The doctor should have simply told me about how his formula improved his life. I trusted him. He had all the credibility I needed for me to ingest this foreign substance into my body. What if I could live to 300 years of age? What if indeed I could become younger? I would have gladly taken the formula and continued purchasing bottles of it with the hope that I was right about him.

## Scientist Made Fatal Error

##### But the scientist made a fatal error. Had he not made any claims to me about specific expected results, I would not have been disappointed but would have continued taking the product waiting and hoping that the stuff would kick in and dissolve those growths. I would, on the basis of hope, have continued taking it and buying more. But once a specific promise was made and I saw that the formula didn’t work within that time frame, I immediately refused to invest further. The scientist’s credibility was questioned even though he may have had a great product.
 When using the psychological trigger of hope, you must avoid the trap of making a specific claim that can be measured or guaranteed. You want to allude to what the product is used for without making any promises of an exact outcome.
 There are other products people buy repeatedly, on hope. Let’s take vitamins, for example. Can people tell if taking vitamins makes a difference in their health? Yes, some can. Interview a bunch of people and they’ll swear the vitamins are making a difference. Capture those interviews on TV and they are very impressive. Then prospects, impressed with the results shown on TV, start buying the product and continue to buy it regularly with the hope that it is making a difference in their lives. But the key here is not to make a specific promise but rather to imply results through testimonials.
 How does this apply to selling in print and on the Internet? There are some products that are sold using hope as a strong motivational tool. You need to determine the nature of your product and find something that you can imply about a future result without stating a specific guarantee (particularly if you want to stay in business for a long time).
 Many product categories lend themselves to the power of hope. The entire health food industry is a good example, including vitamins, food supplements and even brain enhancers. Lowering your golf score, finding a new relationship, preventing wrinkles, impressing your date—all are good opportunities to recognize the psychological trigger of hope at work.

## Focus on Credibility

##### One aspect to focus on when you create an ad using the power of hope is credibility. If you present yourself as a credible person representing a credible company, then what you say will elicit a feeling of confidence on the part of your prospect. Then, whatever you say your product did for you or for your previous customers will be taken as a possibility for your prospect, and the power of hope will compel your prospect to order. And reorder. It might be a book on relationships and how the information changed your life and those of previous readers. It might be a formula you take to live a long life and how wonderful you feel. Whatever you are selling, with the proper credibility, you will automatically engage the power of hope to sell.
 This chapter is very important in your understanding of the underlying reasons why people buy. Some of the 31 psychological triggers to buying may not have been obvious to you before. Nevertheless, an awareness of each of these points will give you a tremendous boost in becoming a great copywriter.

 Selling a Cure, Not Prevention

##### One of the least understood reasons why many products fail is due to one aspect of human nature. Understand this aspect and not only do you hold the key to creating a successful direct response ad, but you will also understand clearly why some products just plain don’t sell.
 The key to successfully marketing certain products lies in the nature of that product and the way that product is viewed in the marketplace. The guiding principle can be summed up very clearly: Always sell the cure and avoid selling prevention.
 Now what does this mean? Let me explain. If you were my prospect and I tried to sell you a magic pill that contained an extract of carrots and various tinctures of leafy vegetables because it would help prevent cancer, chances are it would be a difficult sale. However, if you suddenly discovered you had cancer and I said to you that I had a magic pill that would cure the disease, you would be not only willing to try it, but willing to pay considerably more. In the first instance, you might be willing to pay $20 a bottle to prevent the disease but in the other you might be willing to pay $1,000 if it would cure the disease.
