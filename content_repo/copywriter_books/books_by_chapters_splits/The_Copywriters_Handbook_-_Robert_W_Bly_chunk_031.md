### The first step in starting a pay-per-click campaign is to decide how much you are willing to spend and for what purpose. Do you want to capture a lead for future follow-up or do you need your traffic to generate instant sales?
 Figure out how much each click is worth to determine the maximum amount you are willing to pay—that will be your maximum cost per click (CPC). If you’re selling a single low-cost item, your CPC will need to be pretty low.
 On the other hand, when selling an item with a higher profit margin, you can afford a higher CPC. Likewise, if by capturing a lead you can sell to the same person over and over again, though you may not recoup your cost on the first sale, having the ability to sell to that customer over and over again will allow you to afford a higher CPC.
 Here is a simple example. If it takes twenty clicks to get one sale, and each click costs you $1, each order costs you $20. Is the profit on your product over that amount? If not, you need to make sure your clicks cost less or that you have a higher conversion rate or price point.
 Some people use PPC not to sell products but to build their list. The amount you can spend per click is based on the average value of names on your list. If you have $200,000 a year in online sales and twenty thousand names on your list, your average name is worth ten bucks a year.
 To find the best keywords for your product, first brainstorm them yourself. No one knows your product better than you. Think about what a person looking for your product might type into the search engine.
 Be specific. Don’t just come up with generic terms. Get as specific as you can. If you are a jeweler, it’s better to advertise for “gold loop earrings” than to use the more generic keyword “jewelry.”
 Another set of keywords that may gain high conversions are those that establish your product or service as an alternative to something else. For example, you may use the keyword “diamond” to advertise for cubic zirconium. Your ad would then give reasons why your product is a better deal than the word they searched on to begin with.
 Gain holiday and special occasion traffic. Use holidays or special occasions as your keywords, especially when you have a retail item that

### lends itself to gift giving. “Holidays,” “birthdays,” ‘‘weddings,” and “graduations”—all are great search terms. You may come up with phrases like “Mother’s Day gift,” “engagement ring,” or “anniversary present.”
 After coming up with your obvious keywords, start thinking of less obvious searches or related searches. You may think of “wedding vows” because someone interested in vows may also need a wedding ring or bridesmaid’s gifts. Be creative in coming up with your words. When using them, make sure you incorporate them in your title and body copy, such as “The Perfect Mother’s Day Gift.”
 If you can figure out a way to make them relevant, current events, popular celebrities, and hot topics all make good search terms. But make sure you can relate these terms to your landing page and offer; if you don’t, you’ll just get a lot of traffic but very few conversions.
 After you have selected your keywords, use Google’s keyword planner tool to see what kind of volume they get in number of searches and how crowded the competition is. Your best case is to see lots of searches and few bidders.
 But having competition isn’t all bad. When you have competition, you know it is a viable product that people are searching on and buying; otherwise no one would be advertising. This tool will also give you suggestions for similar words. Pull out the ones that you think are best.
 You’ll find an abundance of other keyword tools that can help you find the most cost-effective and productive keywords. Some are free; some cost a small fee.
 Now that you have identified your core keywords, you are going to write several ads for each group of keywords that you have made. Here’s how to structure your ad:
 Headline: The first line is your headline. Always use keywords in your headline.
 Your headline can be two lines of up to 30 characters long. That is not a lot, especially when so much of it is taken up with a keyword or two. Make your headline attention grabbing.

 Ask a Question: “Find Your Engagement Ring Yet?”

### State Superiority: “World’s Finest Diamond Engagement Rings” Appeal to Basic Emotions (love, greed, fear): “A Diamond That’ll Make Her Love You More”

 Body: The body is a descriptive line with a maximum of 80 characters. Display URL with Hyperlink: Your domain is the last line of the ad and is automatically extracted by Google from your final URL to ensure accuracy. The worst thing you can do is drive tons of traffic to your site at a high cost-per-click without converting that traffic into a sale or lead. Consider adding a qualifying word or phrase to your ad. For example, suppose you’re selling a fly-fishing guide for $19.99. By placing the price of the guide in your ad, you’ll discourage “tire kickers”—anyone who is looking for free information and is not willing to pay your price.
 If at all possible, use a Web address that includes your keywords, even if you have to create it. The best method is to buy a dedicated domain name specifically for each landing page.

 ADVERTISING IN E-NEWSLETTERS

 All types of e-zine ads can be valuable to you. This section will explain the three different types of e-zine ads and how they can work for you.
 Solo Ad: A solo ad is when an e-zine sends your content to its mailing list all by itself. In other words, the e-mail is solely your content and not part of the regular newsletter.
 Sponsorship Ad: E-zines can feature any number of sponsorship ads and often break down their pricing by the position the ad is given within the body of the newsletter. A Top Sponsor ad is positioned at the beginning of the e-mail and is usually the most expensive ad.
 Whenever an ad is placed anywhere after the first article, it is referred to as a Middle Sponsor. A newsletter can have any number of Middle Sponsor ads. The most effective Middle Sponsor ads are those that appear next to articles on topics related to the product being advertised, e.g., a Middle Sponsor ad selling grass seed positioned next to an article on lawn care.

### A Bottom Sponsor ad is the last ad in the e-zine. It appears after all the regular content but before the classified ads. These ads are generally the least expensive sponsorship ads.
 Text ad: A text ad is usually between three and five lines long and 60 to 65 characters per line. In the e-zines with the largest readership, these ads are fairly cheap, anywhere from $5 to $25 per issue.
 Some newsletters allow you to place FREE ads with them in exchange for being placed on their e-mailing list. This is one way they grow their lists. But because it doesn’t cost you anything (except your time and a cluttered e-mail box), any response you get is good.
 Don’t forget that because e-zines are often archived, you will have a permanent link pointing to your Web site. Even if customers aren’t accessing your site, the search engine spiders are.

 The design of your ad will depend greatly on the newsletter it will be placed in and what type of ad you are running. Check the newsletter’s specifications. Many are strictly text with no graphics so they are low in bandwidth and can easily pass spam filters. You may also ask the e-zine publisher what works best. After all, they know their audience better than anyone.
 When running a solo ad, your content should be similar to the publisher’s regular newsletter. Make your ad seem like the kind of information normally seen in the e-zine. In other words, make it appear to be newsworthy and avoid hype. Solo ads allow you the opportunity to educate your consumer and expand upon the benefits of your product.
 Here a killer headline is imperative to attract attention. The headline’s job is to get the reader’s attention and then draw him into the ad copy. It will do that if it contains the words your prospect has on his mind, so be sure to include one of your keywords if possible. The following is an example of a solo online ad (it ran before 9/11 and the war in Iraq):

### For sponsorship and classified ads, you don’t have the luxury of space and you don’t have the reader’s undivided attention. You are limited to a half dozen lines or less with fewer than 70 characters per line. Because of this your ad must carry a greater impact.
 When push comes to shove, when creating an effective e-zine advertisement, the same rules for all advertising apply: have a strong headline, state a need, show how your product can fulfill that need, and provide a strong call to action.

### FACEBOOK ADS

 Currently Facebook has well over 2 billion users; LinkedIn, the network for professionals, boasts a user base of 630 million. Again, you want to put your attention where your audience is congregating, so one of the other social sites—Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter—may have advertising potential for your business.
 Facebook’s Advertising Guide (https://www.facebook.com/business/ads- guide) describes the specifications for three ad formats: video, image, and collection formats. As image ads are a reasonable starting point in Facebook advertising, this section focuses on this format. Due to the popularity of videos online, video ad specifications will follow.
 Basically pay-per-click advertising, the average cost of a click, is about $1.25. If you’re going this route, you’ll quickly find that there are many design and content options. Here are the basic requirements for single image ads: run in the right-hand column (as opposed to single-image ads running in the Facebook feed). The specifications below date from March 2019.

 Image Specifications
 Recommended image dimensions are 1200 x 628 pixels. Minimum width and height of 600 pixels. Recommended aspect ratio is between 9:16 and 16:9, but crops to 1.91:1 with link. Recommended image formats are JPG and PNG. Images with 20% text or more could increase chances of failed delivery. Size: 1,200 x 628 pixels. Ratio: 1.91:1 (the proportional relationship between its width and its height; it is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9). Facebook suggests you use minimal or no text on the image.

 Copy Limitations:

### WRITING FACEBOOK IMAGE ADS

 What makes an effective Facebook image ad? Two things: bright, eye- catching images and compelling, persuasive content. But, according to the ad experts at Facebook, it’s the image that does the “heavy work.” Research found images are so important that they’re responsible for some 75 to 90 percent of an ad’s performance. It’s smart, they say, to test ten to fifteen images (keeping the ad copy the same across all variations).
 Facebook actually recommends de-prioritizing copy; copywriters know better. Always give the words the attention they deserve. Here’s an ad with an offer directed at Facebook marketers. Picture this: a distressed, frustrated writer sitting in front of a blank computer screen. Top-level ad content reads:

_Let me show you how easy it is to write a Facebook ad. You see the tricks, tips, and gotcha you_
_need to know. Great for the newer marketer!_

**_Get the checklist for writing Facebook ads_**

_This downloadable checklist takes away all the frustrating mystery of “figuring out” how to_
_write a great Facebook ad._

### In writing Facebook ads, success is more about capturing attention and inspiring viewers not only to respond to the call to action, but also to “like” and share what they’ve seen. Since the image is what draws their eyes, it’s suggested you put key messages within the image. However, Facebook won’t allow you to use an image where copy takes up more than 20 percent of it. “Text” includes copy you’ve overlaid on an image as well as text- based logos, watermarks, and even text in your video’s thumbnail images.
 Facebook ads with photos, first and foremost, are usually small. And given that they have an image, copy must be kept to a minimum.
 WordStream has a simplified formula for writing Facebook ads that I think is right on the money. The ad has to tell the reader these three basic things:

 What you’re offering

### How it benefits them What to do next

 And AdEspresso offers these eight sensible guidelines specifically for Facebook ad headlines:

 1. Use numbers. There’s plenty of copywriting research that all points to
 one conclusion: headlines that start with numbers are often winners. 2. Create a sense of urgency. 3. Be clear and precise. 4. Keep your headlines short. 5. Emphasize the benefits. 6. Include a call to action. 7. Ask a question. 8. Use powerful words.

 Specifics on these points are covered earlier in the book; see chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### FACEBOOK VIDEO ADS

 In November 2018, Hootsuite noted that 71 percent of people had increased their online video viewing during that year. And 60 percent expect to watch more social video in the coming year. Another point of interest: Facebook users look at ads five times longer when they’re consuming video. People gaze five times longer at video than at static posts on Facebook.
 The Facebook ad specs of single videos ads are:

 Format—.MOV or .MP4. Aspect Ratio—16:9. Resolution—720p at minimum. File Size—2.3 GB maximum. Length—120 minutes (Facebook), sixty seconds (Instagram) Thumbnail Image—1,200 x 675 pixels, 16.9 ratio. Caption—2,200 characters maximum.

 Facebook offers a few simple suggestions for making engaging videos, including:

 Create Facebook Video Ads with mobile in mind. Create for mobile by using a vertical or square video format. Capture viewer attention. Mobile users move quickly, so it’s imperative that the video engages them immediately. Include your brand or product early. Design for silent viewing. Many people silence their phones as a point of courtesy when in public.

 Other suggestions from marketers skilled in creating successful Facebook video ad campaigns include:

 Adding text to your videos Using imagery that makes sense without sound Upload subtitles with your videos

### The most effective length for Facebook ad titles is four words, with fifteen-word link descriptions. Here’s an example:

 Create Stunning e-Books, Reports, Lead Magnets

 and Whitepapers from Your Blog, Word, Google …

### FACEBOOK VIDEO VS. YOUTUBE: WHICH IS BETTER?

 According to a recent survey, 47 percent of consumers state that they now get most of their video content on Facebook, versus 41 percent who say they usually watch YouTube. And 71 percent of those who watch marketing videos on Facebook state that the ads they view are relevant. Even more important to brands is that between 60 and 70 percent of those who view a company’s Facebook video then proceed to visit that company’s Web site.

### ADDITIONAL FACEBOOK ADVERTISING FORMATS

 There are other Facebook ad formats, including slideshow carousel and canvas ad formats. The carousel format allows you to use a combination of all other ad types, running up to ten images, slideshows, or videos in one single campaign. Each element can even be linked out to different landing pages.
 The slideshow format is as it sounds: it creates a looping video ad out of up to ten different images. The Facebook ads let you create a full-screen interactive experience for the viewer. As there are separate specs for each individual element you’ll choose, you’ll need to consult the Facebook Advertising Center (https://www.facebook.com/business) for detailed specifications.

 BOOSTED POSTS AND PROMOTED POSTS

 A boosted post is the most basic advertising you can do on Facebook. It is created by allocating advertising budget to a post already on the businesses’ page. By clicking the button in the top right corner of the post, you have the option to choose pushing the post to either “People who like your page and their friends” or “People you choose through targeting.” You’ll also be able to set your budget.
 Promoted Posts is an advertising option from Facebook that enables you to make sure the posts you want to market get seen in the News Feeds of more people. The advertising value of boosting your posts has been debated. Some argue it’s smarter to go with Promoted Posts instead. What that does is push your post into the news feed. The benefit of this strategy is that you have more targeting, pricing, and bidding options.

### HOW MUCH DOES FACEBOOK ADVERTISING COST?

 Your ad cost depends on many factors: time of year, time of day, audience gender, and ad position. Truthfully, Facebook ads cost anywhere from less than a dollar to over $5, depending on such factors as ad quality and competition. Fortunately, you can get started for as little as $10 to $20.
