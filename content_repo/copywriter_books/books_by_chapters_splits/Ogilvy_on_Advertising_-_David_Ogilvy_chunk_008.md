‘If a company rests its policy of not letting its agencies serve competitors on the need for security of information, it does not have a very solid base. As a matter of realism, the interests of competing clients would not be harmed by an almost complete exchange of information among the people serving the two competing companies. Of course, no responsible personal service �rm would do that – and indeed they go to great lengths to avoid even inadvertent exchanges. Nevertheless, as one who has been a repository of con�dential information over many years, I am convinced that the history, makeup, ways of doing business, attitudes of people, operating philosophy and procedures of even directly competing companies are ordinarily so di�erent that information could be exchanged between them with no harm to either’

 If I were you, I would think twice about �ring my agency when it committed bigamy; another agency might not give you such good advertising. Amour propre can be an expensive luxury.

 PS. If your account is too small to interest a good agency, �nd an
 experienced copywriter who has retired and pay him to do your advertising. He will enjoy getting back into harness, and welcome the money.

 Wanted: a renaissance in print advertising

###### If their own talents are modest, the �lm producers can make them look good. In winter, they enjoy going on location at glamorous resorts, while their print colleagues are left behind in cold solitude.
 The other day I read a cri de cœur from a senior executive in a food company:

 ‘TV is so devouring a medium that you need to comb the agencies to �nd the old sweat who knows how to put together half-way decent print advertisements for food. The others invent food advertising all over again, without knowing which way is up.
 The silly thing is that there are just about infallible formulae for constructing advertisements which grab a woman’s attention and don’t let go of it until the message has been fully planted. Once these formulae are understood, even junior brand managers can assemble the makings of a hard-working food advertisement, while the bright ones will have women tearing out your ads and shoving them into kitchen drawers in a way you wouldn’t believe.
 Try telling this to agencies. They’ve never heard of the fundamentals of food advertising. Mention formulae to them

###### and their frail creative souls shrivel.’

 The shortage of print know-how presents a serious problem to cigarette manufacturers and others who are not allowed to use television. It also presents a golden opportunity for copywriters and art directors who take the trouble to acquire the know-how.
 In this chapter I will uncork what I have learned about print advertising. But I cannot do so without repeating some of the things – still valid – I have written elsewhere. I never cease to be struck by the consistency of consumer reactions to di�erent kinds of headline, illustration, layout and copy – year after year, country after country.
 The principal sources of my information are the factor analyses which I commission from Gallup and Robinson, the Starch Readership Service, the results of direct response tests, and my own observation.

 Headlines On the average, �ve times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy. It follows that unless your headline sells your product, you have wasted 90 per cent of your money.
 The headlines which work best are those which promise the reader a bene�t – like a whiter wash, more miles per gallon, freedom from pimples, fewer cavities. Ri�e through a magazine and count the number of ads whose headlines promise a bene�t of any kind.
 Headlines which contain news are sure-�re. The news can be the announcement of a new product, an improvement in an old product, or a new way to use an old product – like serving Campbell’s Soup on the rocks. On the average, ads with news are recalled by 22 per cent more people than ads without news.
 If you are lucky enough to have some news to tell, don’t bury it in your body copy, which nine out of ten people will not read. State it loud and clear in your headline. And don’t scorn tried-and-true words like amazing, introducing, now, suddenly.

_Ads with news are recalled by 22 per cent more people than ads without news. It does not have to be the announcement of a_

_new product. It can be a new way of using an old product, as in this advertisement._

_I used the word ‘darling’ in the headline for this ad because a psychologist had tested hundreds of words for their emotional_

_impact and ‘darling’ had come out top. I was not aware that it is dangerous to use a telephone when you are taking a bath._

###### Headlines that o�er the reader helpful information, like HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE, attract above-average readership.

-----

_When you advertise in local newspapers, you get better results if you include the name of each city in your headline. People_

_are mostly interested in what is happening where they live._

###### I advise you to include the brand name in your headline. If you don’t, 80 per cent of readers (who don’t read your body copy) will never know what product you are advertising.
 If you are advertising a kind of product which is only bought by a small group of people, put a word in your headline which will �ag them down, like asthma, bedwetters, women over thirty-�ve.

-----

_On the average, long headlines sell more merchandise than short ones. This one-word headline is the exception that proves the_

_rule._

###### Starch reports that headlines with more than ten words get less readership than short headlines. On the other hand, a study of retail advertisements found that headlines of ten words sell more merchandise than short headlines. Conclusion: if you need a long headline, go ahead and write one, and if you want a short headline, that’s all right too. The famous headline Lemon contributed a lot to the success of Volkswagen in the United States.

###### Speci�cs work better than generalities. When research reported that the average shopper thought Sears Roebuck made a pro�t of 37 per cent on sales, I headlined an advertisement Sears makes a pro�t of 5 per cent. This speci�c was more persuasive than saying that Sears’ pro�t was ‘less than you might suppose’ or something equally vague.

_Speci�cs are more credible and more memorable than generalities. That is why I speci�ed that Sears’ pro�t is less than 5 per_

_cent._

###### When you put your headline in quotes, you increase recall by an average of 28 per cent.
 When you advertise in local newspapers, you get better results if you include the name of each city in your headline. People are most interested in what is happening where they live.
 A psychologist �ashed hundreds of words on a screen and used an electric gadget to measure emotional reactions. High marks went to darling. So I used it in a headline for Dove.
 Some copywriters write tricky headlines – double meanings, puns and other obscurities. This is counter-productive. In the average newspaper your headline has to compete with 350 others. Readers

-----

###### travel fast through this jungle. Your headline should telegraph what you want to say.
 Some headlines are ‘blind.’ They don’t say what the product is, or what it will do for you. They are about 20 per cent below average in recall.
 Since headlines, more than anything else, decide the success or failure of an advertisement, the silliest thing of all is to run an ad without any headline at all – ‘a headless wonder’
 If you would like more guidance on writing headlines, I commend you to John Caples’ book Tested Advertising Methods (Prentice-Hall).

_On average, helpful information is read by 75 per cent more people than copy which deals only with the product. This ad told_

_how Rinso gets out stains. It was read and remembered by more people than any detergent ad that had ever been researched,_

_but it should never have run because it was ‘o� strategy’ – it did not deliver the agreed selling promise that ‘Rinso Washes_
_Whiter.’ The photograph shows di�erent kinds of stains. The blood was my own; I am the only copywriter who has literally_

_bled for his client._

 Illustrations A picture, they say, can be worth a thousand words. The cowboy photographs for Marlboro, and Elliott Erwitt’s photographs in the ads for Puerto Rico and France are examples.

 Here are 15 ways to make your illustrations work for their living:

 1 The subject of your illustration is all important. If you don’t have a remarkable idea for it, not even a great photographer can save you.

 2 The kind of photographs which work hardest are those which arouse the reader’s curiosity. He glances at the photograph and says to himself, ‘What goes on here?’ Then he reads your copy to �nd out. Harold Rudolph called this magic element ‘Story Appeal,’ and demonstrated that the more of it you inject into your photographs, the more people look at your advertisements.

_As ex-chef..._

-----

_...I assumed that housewives would �nd the Rinso photograph as interesting as I did. They didn’t._

###### 3 When you don’t have a story to tell, it is often a good thing to make your package the subject of your illustration.

 4 It pays to illustrate the end-result of using your product. Before-and-after photographs seem to fascinate readers. In a study of 70 campaigns whose sales results were known, Gallup did not �nd a single before-and-after campaign that did not increase sales.

-----

###### 5 When I arrived on Madison Avenue, most advertisements were illustrated with drawings. Then it was found that photographs attracted more readers, were more believable, and better remembered. When I took over the ‘Come to Britain’ advertising, I substituted photographs for the drawings which the previous agency had used. Readership tripled, and so did tourism to Britain. Direct-response advertisers �nd that photographs pull more coupons than drawings, and department stores �nd that they sell more merchandise. However, photographs reproduce so badly in some newspapers that you can get a more lifelike picture by using a line drawing. I found that scratch-board drawings sold more Thom McCan shoes than photographs.

_When you don’t have a story to tell in your photograph, make your product the subject of your illustration. This photograph_

_was taken by Irving Penn, for Philippe Saalburg of FCB-Impact in Paris._

###### 6 The use of characters known to people who see your television commercials boosts the recall of your print advertisements.

-----

###### 7 Keep your illustrations as simple as possible, with the focus of interest on one person. Crowd scenes don’t pull.

 8 Don’t show human faces enlarged bigger than life size. They seem to repel readers.

 9 Historical subjects bore the majority of readers.

 10 Do not assume that subjects which interest you will necessarily interest consumers. Being a former chef, I assumed that everyone found chefs interesting – until I used them in an advertisement. I got miserable readership among the housewives who were the target audience. A friend at Campbell’s Soup told me that he too had observed that housewives were turned o� by chefs.

_Before-and-After photographs fascinate readers, as in this advertisement from the Milan o�ce of Ogilvy & Mather. The plant_

_on the left has not been treated with Baysol, while the plant on the right has._

_The eyepatch injects the magic element of ‘story appeal.’ The model was Baron Wrangell, who had a habit of swaying in front_

_of the camera, so that we had to strap him to an iron pipe._

###### 11 My brother Francis once asked a Cockney editor of the Daily Mirror (London) what kind of photographs most interested his readers. He answered, ‘Babies with an ’eart-throb, animals with an ’eart-throb, and what you might call sex.’ This is still true today.

 12 When I worked for Dr. Gallup, I noticed that moviegoers were more interested in actors of their own sex than actors of the opposite sex. People want to see movie stars with whom

-----

###### they can identify. The same force is at work in advertisements. When you use a photograph of a woman, men ignore your advertisement.

 13 Advertisements in four colors cost 50 per cent more than black-and-white, but, on the average, they are 100 per cent more memorable. A good bargain.

 14 I cannot resist the temptation to quote a verse which gives valuable advice on illustration:

 When the client moans and sighs,
 Make his logo twice the size. If he still should prove refractory
 Show a picture of his factory.
 Only in the gravest cases Should you show the clients’ faces.

 15 When you advertise products for use in cooking, you attract more readers if you show a photograph of the �nished dish than the ingredients.

 Warning My former partner Douglas Haines has recently demonstrated that the illustrations in advertisements are often misunderstood. In a pilot study, he came across a woman who thought that the photograph of a luxurious hotel foyer in a cigarette advertisement was a hospital ward for cancer patients.

 Body copy ‘Nobody reads body copy.’ True or false? It depends on two things. First, on how many people are interested in the kind of product you are advertising: a lot of women will read copy about food products, but few will read copy about cigars. Second, on how many people have been enticed into your ad by your illustration and headline.

-----

###### The average readership of the body copy in magazine ads is about 5 per cent. That does not sound like a lot until you remember that 5 per cent of readers of the Reader’s Digest adds up to 1,500,000 men and women.
 Do not, however, address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are writing each of them a letter on behalf of your client. One human being to another, second person singular.
 Queen Victoria complained that Gladstone talked to her as if he were addressing a public meeting. She preferred Disraeli, who talked to her like a human being. When you write copy, follow Disraeli’s example.
 It isn’t as easy as you may think. Aldous Huxley, who was once a copywriter, said, ‘It is easier to write ten passably e�ective sonnets than one e�ective advertisement.’
 You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it.
 It pays to write short sentences and short paragraphs, and to avoid di�cult words. I once wrote that Dove made soap ‘obsolete,’ only to discover that the majority of housewives did not know what the word meant. I had to change it to ‘old-fashioned.’ When I used the word ine�able in copy for Hathaway, a reporter telephoned to ask me what it meant. I hadn’t the faintest idea. Nowadays I keep a dictionary beside my telephone.

_Note the editorial layout, and the story form – both plus factors. This advertisement promised ‘If it ever fails to work, we’ll �x_

_it free.’ Every morning hundreds of old and battered Zippos arrived in the mail. They were returned the same day, in perfect_

_working order – and no charge._

-----

_John Caples’ famous direct-mail advertisement for the U.S. School of Musk deployed story-appeal at its most e�ective._

###### When copywriters argue with me about some esoteric word they want to use, I say to them, ‘Get on a bus. Go to Iowa. Stay on a farm for a week and talk to the farmer. Come back to New York by train and talk to your fellow passengers in the day-coach. If you still want to use the word, go ahead.’
 Copy should be written in the language people use in everyday conversation, as in this anonymous verse:

-----

###### Carnation Milk is the best in the land,
 Here I sit with a can in my hand.
 No tits to pull, no hay to pitch, Just punch a hole in the son-of-a-bitch.
