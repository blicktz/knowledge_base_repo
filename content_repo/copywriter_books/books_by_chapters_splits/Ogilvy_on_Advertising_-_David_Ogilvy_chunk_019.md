###### He was the �rst to make research part of the creative process, by bringing in Dr. Gallup from Northwestern University and paying him to measure the readership of advertisements. From this research emerged guidelines which enabled Young & Rubicam to produce advertisements which were read by more people than any other agency’s. Rubicam used to say, ‘The way we sell is to get read �rst.’
 Observing that the e�ect of his campaigns was often negated by the marketing incompetence of his clients, he hired �rst-class sales managers to teach them their business.
 During the �rst year of Young & Rubicam, their advertisements were notable for the excellence of their copy, but their graphics – illustrations, layouts and typography – were as hideous as any other agency’s. When this dawned on Rubicam, he hired Vaughn Flannery, the best art director in America. From that day forward, Young & Rubicam’s advertisements set a standard of taste which was new in American advertising.
 But the achievement of which Rubicam was most proud was a larger one. In old age he told me, ‘Advertising has a responsibility to behave properly. I proved that you can sell products without bamboozling the American public.’ While he had no monopoly on this virtue, he had more right than anyone to boast about it.
 His de�nition of a good advertisement was that ‘its public is not only strongly sold by it, but both the public and the advertiser remember it for a long time as an admirable piece of work.’
 In the eternal battle for power which goes on in agencies between the creative people and the account executives, Rubicam – himself a copywriter – came down heavily on the side of the creative people. He called account executives by the old-fashioned and now pejorative word ‘contact men’ and insisted that their only function was to get clients to approve the ads.
 He taught me to resign accounts when they were spoiling the morale of my sta� He resigned the huge American Tobacco account because he disliked being bullied by the notorious George Washington Hill. His letter is before me:

-----

###### ‘Young & Rubicam and American Tobacco were both successful companies for some time before our association began. I trust both will continue to be successful companies after our association ceases, which it is doing as of now.’

 The early success of Young & Rubicam was due more than anything else to the fact that General Foods was their biggest client. One day Rubicam told the head of General Foods that his account had grown too big for any one agency; he should hire a second and later a third. This is how Benton & Bowles got their �rst major account, and it is why General Foods came to trust every recommendation Rubicam made to them.
 At the end of World War II, when I was a Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Washington, I suggested to the Foreign O�ce in London that they nominate Rubicam to head the public relations function at the �edgling United Nations, only to be told that he should �ll out an application form!

###### O� duty, he was less conservative then Stanley Resor. In 1946 he contributed an article to McCall’s deploring the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan. He believed that a demonstration of the bomb would have convinced the Japanese to surrender, and made the United States the moral leader of the world.
 In the early days of radio he proposed that the programs should be paid for by the government and carry no advertising. When he was made a member of the Advertising Hall of Fame in 1974, he said in his acceptance speech, ‘The national obsession with television is decreasing the literacy of the nation’s children and making the job of the schools much tougher. It is also obsessing the country with crime. Industry and advertising could perform a huge

###### During World War II he was a special assistant to the chairman of the War Manpower Commission in Washington, but the environment did not �t him.
 Like all the other giants, Rubicam was a perfectionist and had a habit of vetoing advertisements when the account executive was on his way to present them to the client. He used to say, ‘The client remembers an outstanding job years after he has forgotten that it was two months late.’ He worked non-stop – until he found happiness in his second marriage. He then retired, aged 52, and went to live in Arizona, where he speculated in real estate and served as consultant to Campbell Soup Company, a role in which I was to succeed him.
 He had been at his agency for only 21 years, compared with Stanley Resor’s 45 years at J. Walter Thompson and Albert Lasker’s

 The present President of Young & Rubicam has said that ‘Rubicam played a marvelous dirty trick on the rest of us – he didn’t leave behind a list of rules.’
 He did, however, leave behind an aphorism which appeals to the present generation at Young & Rubicam: resist the usual. Or, as his copy chief Roy Whittier put it, ‘In advertising, the beginning of greatness is to be di�erent, and the beginning of failure is to be the same.’ A point of view which was shared by Bill Bernbach.
 I knew Rubicam for 40 years, longer than any of my other giants, and loved him more.

###### LEO BURNETT 1891-1971

 The �rst thing that struck you about Leo Burnett was his extraordinary appearance. Carl Hixon describes it perfectly: ‘He was short and slope-shouldered, with a paunch. His lapels were sprinkled with cigarette ash. A large double chin gave him a faintly froggy aspect. When he spoke, his voice was a gru� rumble. But his most memorable feature was his prominent lower lip.’

-----

_Leo Burnett personi�ed the Chicago school of advertising. ‘Isn’t making ads the most fun you ever had in your life?’_

-----

_A typical Leo Burnett advertisement. Note the posterized layout._

###### After working his way through college writing show cards for a department store, Leo landed a job as a reporter on the Peoria Journal. Later, he joined the advertising department of Cadillac, from which he went to an agency in Indianapolis. After ten years there, he joined Erwin Wasey as copy chief, and in 1935 set up his own agency in Chicago. But it wasn’t until he was 60 that Leo hit his stride. It was as if he suddenly turned on his after-burners. By the time he died, 20 years later, his agency had become the biggest in the world outside New York.

-----

###### He was the leader of the ‘Chicago school’ of advertising – which was his invention. Here is how he told the story:

 ‘In the Michigan town where I was raised, you could hear the corn growing on hot nights. I snuck up on Chicago slowly, by way of outlying cities. When I �nally got here I was 40 years old and con�rmed in my colloquial ways.

 ‘People in my home town thought of Chicago as a kind of Rome to which all roads led – beckoning, majestic, maybe a touch or two wicked.

 ‘Unlike New York, however, which was a mythical place, Chicago was real. Everyone had an Uncle Charlie or Aunt Mabel living here, in Glen Ellyn or somewhere. Whether people approved of Chicago or not, it was “family”, rather like a son who had gone o� and made good in an impressive but controversial way. So my little town had a proprietary feeling about Chicago, and when we rubes came �ocking in from all quarters of the cornbelt, we recognized each other and knew we were home.

 ‘I guess what I’m getting at is that Chicago is the Midwest – the heart, soul, brains and bowels of it. Its ad-making ranks are �lled with folks whose heads are stocked with prairie-town views and values.

 ‘Now I don’t intend to argue that Chicago is in any way a worthier city than, say, New York. But I am suggesting that our sod-busting delivery, our loose-limbed stand and our wide-eyed perspective make it easier for us to create ads that talk turkey to the majority of Americans – that’s all.

 ‘I like to think that we Chicago ad-makers are all working sti�s. I like to imagine that Chicago copywriters spit on their hands before picking up the big, black pencils. I like to think that the language of our ads has been ventilated in the fresh Chicago breezes and rinsed in the clear waters of Lake Michigan.

-----

###### ‘It seems to me that Chicago Advertising draws up a lot of nourishment from the richness of American folklore, restores it, and perpetuates it in a keen and lively sense.

 ‘I like to think that hereabouts a man can write ain’t into his copy when ain’t is precisely what he means. Remember Will Rogers counseled: “A lot of people who don’t say ain’t…ain’t eatin’!” ’

 The greatest compliment Leo ever paid me was to tell the Chicago Tribune that there was one agency in New York which belonged to the Chicago school – Ogilvy & Mather. He suggested we merge.
 His attitude to the creative process can be summed up in three things he said:

 1 ‘There is an inherent drama in every product. Our No. 1 job is to dig for it and capitalize on it.’

 2 ‘When you reach for the stars, you may not quite get one, but you won’t come up with a handful of mud either.’

 3 ‘Steep yourself in your subject, work like hell, and love, honor and obey your hunches.’

 He set high standards for his copywriters and art directors, and applied them through his Creative Review Committee. He once likened the ordeal of appearing before it to being ‘nibbled to death by ducks’. At the end of his life he wrote: ‘Looking back over our greatest achievements, I recall that few of them were generated in an atmosphere of sweetness, light and enthusiasm, but rather one of dynamic tension, complicated by o�-stage muttering.’
 He did not admire originality for its own sake, and used to quote an old boss of his: ‘If you insist on being di�erent just for the sake of being di�erent, you can always come down in the morning with a sock in your mouth.’
 Instead of assigning a project to one creative group, he had a habit of putting several groups in competition. It was enough, he once said, ‘to send strong men staggering to buy a goat farm.’

-----

###### Without any doubt, Leo’s greatest monument is his campaign for Marlboro. It made an obscure brand the biggest-selling cigarette in the world. And it is still running, 25 years after he created it.
 Print was always the medium which interested him most. Never having worked in direct response, he did not put much stock in long copy. Most of his ads looked like miniature posters.
 He liked earthy, vernacular phrases, and kept a folder on his desk labeled Corny Language. ‘I do not mean maxims, gags or slang in its ordinary sense, but words, phrases and analogies which convey a feeling of sod-buster honesty and drive home a point. I sometimes run across these phrases in a newspaper story or in a chance conversation. I chuck them into the folder and one of them might show up in an ad years later.’
 When he saw somebody on his sta� using the product of a competitor, he issued this memo:

 ‘As you well know, your income and mine are derived 100 per cent from the sale of the products of our clients.

 ‘During the 36 years I have been in the agency business I have always been naïvely guided by the principle that if we do not believe in the products we advertise strongly enough to use them ourselves, we are not completely honest with ourselves in advertising them to others.

 ‘I recognize the unconscious spirit of rebellious independence that exists in all of us, and the compulsion you or I may have to demonstrate that we wear no man’s yoke. I have always felt, however, that there are better and more rewarding ways of doing this than in conspicuously avoiding or �outing the products of the people who pay our way.

 ‘I guess my feeling is pretty well summed up in the remarks of the vice president of a competitive agency. When asked why he was smoking a not-too-popular brand of cigarette which his company advertised, he replied: “In my book there is no taste or aroma quite like that of bread and butter.” ’

-----

###### Leo deplored the tendency of mega-agencies to put their own aggrandizement ahead of service to their clients. Not long before he died, he told his sta�:

 ‘Somewhere along the line, after I’m �nally o� the premises, you may want to take my name o� the premises, too.

 ‘But let me tell you when I might demand that you take my name o� the door. That will be the day when you spend more time trying to make money and less time making advertising.

 ‘When your main interest becomes a matter of size just to be big, rather than good, hard, wonderful work.’

 I wish I had written that.
 He had two sons, a geologist and an architect, and one daughter, a poet. He lived on a farm outside Chicago, but worked 364 days a year, except for occasional visits to the Arlington race-track, where he had a box. He had a passion for wild �owers, trees – and charades.

 CLAUDE C. HOPKINS 1867-1932

 By exorcizing the pseudo-literary pretentions endemic in British copywriters of my vintage, and concentrating my thoughts on the obligation of advertising to sell, Claude Hopkins’ book, Scienti�c Advertising, changed the course of my life.
 At 17 Hopkins was a lay preacher, but he rebeled against his family’s hardshell Baptist brand of religion, and got a job as a bookkeeper. Not long afterwards, he joined the Bissell Carpet Sweeper Company, and invented selling strategies which gave Bissell a virtual monopoly. Then to Swift as Advertising Manager, followed by Dr. Shoop’s patent medicine company, where he persuaded his agency to let him write the copy not only for Dr. Shoop’s but for Montgomery Ward and Schlitz Beer as well.
 When he was 41, he was hired by Albert Lasker to write copy for Lord & Thomas. Lasker paid him $185,000 a year – equivalent to

-----

###### $2,000,000 in today’s money. He stayed at Lord & Thomas for 18 years.
 Hopkins was a prodigiously hard worker, seldom leaving his o�ce before the early hours of the morning. Sunday was his favorite day, because he could work without interruption.
 From his typewriter came campaigns which made many products famous, including Pepsodent, Palmolive and six di�erent cars. He invented ways to force distribution for new products. He invented test marketing. He invented sampling by coupon. He invented copy research.

_Nobody should be allowed to have anything to do with advertising until he has read this book seven times. It changed the_

_course of my life._

-----

###### He held that nobody with a college education should be allowed to write copy for the mass market. I know what he meant.
 He was an uncompromising practitioner of the experimental method, forever testing new ideas in search of better results – even if, as Politz has pointed out, he did not always indicate ‘the boundaries between direct �ndings from experimentation and conclusions arrived at by general observation and reasoning.’
 A few of his conclusions have been disproved by later research. We now know, for example, that he was wrong when he said, ‘In every ad consider only new customers. People using your product are not going to read your ads.’ The fact is that users of a product read its advertisements more than non-users.
 He was a shy, mousy little man and spoke with a strong lisp. His nickname was Thee-Thee, that being the way he pronounced his initials C.C. But he was a good raconteur and after-dinner speaker. He always wore a fuchsia in his buttonhole, chewed licorice root, and spat profusely on the person he was talking to.
 Rich as he became, Hopkins was notoriously stingy, and never paid more than $6 for a pair of shoes. But his second wife persuaded him to buy an ocean-going yacht, to employ an army of gardeners on their estate, and to buy Louis XVI furniture. She �lled their house with an endless procession of guests, and played Scarlatti to Hopkins for hours at a time.
 He thought illustrations were a waste of space. Perhaps they were less important 60 years ago, when magazines and newspapers were thinner, and competition for the reader’s attention less severe. But few experienced practitioners of advertising would now argue with these dicta:

 ‘Almost any question can be answered, cheaply, quickly and �nally, by a test campaign. And that’s the way to answer them – not by arguments around the table.’

 ‘Ad writers forget they are salesmen and try to be performers. Instead of sales, they seek applause.’

###### ‘Whenever possible we introduce a personality into our ads. By making a man famous we make his product famous.’
