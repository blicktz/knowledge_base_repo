##### Never did I try to scare the prospective customer with crime statistics. It would look as ridiculous as Howard screaming or warning me in my basement to get insurance because I may die. All I did was realize the nature of the product I was selling, bring out the points in the product that were important to the consumer and then wait until the consumer saw the ad enough times or was threatened close enough to home before he or she bought.
 We received many orders from people who had cut out the ad and put it in a file. When indeed they were threatened, they then called and placed their orders. Fortunately, there were enough people who wanted a unit when they saw the ad to earn us a nice profit, but we also received orders months after we stopped running our ads. And despite the fact that many of the electronic products of the time were obsolete just a few months after they were introduced, we managed to run our ad for over three years before sales slowed down.
 I have one other example on the importance of becoming an expert on the product you sell by gaining specific knowledge in order to write outstanding copy on a subject. It happened in 1975, right at the start of the citizens band (CB) radio boom in the United States. Back then, the U.S. government had imposed a reduced nationwide speed limit of 55 miles per hour to conserve fuel. The lower speed limits really affected those 18-wheel long-haul truck drivers. Truck drivers responded by buying CBs to communicate with each other.
 The truck drivers would travel in caravans and truckers ahead of the caravan would signal if there was a “Smokey” (police officer) in the area. Soon CBs became so popular that the average motorist started buying them and a whole new fad emerged in the United States—a fad so big that songs, movies and a variety of products were created to capitalize on it. The CB units themselves were in such demand that you couldn’t even get one without a wait, and thieves were stealing them out of cars and turning a very hefty profit reselling them.
 As a ham radio operator, I knew of the fun in radio communications and the advantages of having a unit in my car. This was my general knowledge.

##### So I wanted to experience the fad and I decided to get a CB radio. I then became somewhat of an expert on it. There was a lot less to master with CB than there was with ham radio, where I had to learn the Morse code at 13 words per minute and a great deal of technical information before passing my operator’s test.
 During the early stages of the fad, I was attending the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago when I bumped into Mike Weschler, a salesman, who showed me a new product. “Joe, here is a miniature walkie- talkie.”

# The Product Was Not Unusual

##### I looked at the small sliver of a product he handed me and realized that a small walkie-talkie was no big deal. You could get them at any RadioShack store. But Mike then pointed out that the unit had an integrated circuit—it was one of the few units using this new type of technology and it indeed was smaller than any of the other products on the market.
 The product seemed a little more interesting after Mike explained its features. It was so small that it could easily slip into a shirt pocket. “What frequencies can you broadcast on and what is the power?” I asked, calling on my knowledge of ham radio.
 “The unit has two frequencies. One takes a crystal for any of a number of frequencies and the other would be permanently set to a frequency around 27 megahertz.”
 I looked up at Mike as he was demonstrating the unit and asked him, “Mike, isn’t 27 megahertz near one of the CB frequencies?”
 “Right. It’s channel 12 but don’t worry, there is not that much radio traffic on channel 12. It’s normally reserved for walkie-talkies,” Mike assured me rather sheepishly as if I had discovered a fault with the unit.
 “No, Mike, I think that will turn out to be an advantage.” And indeed it was. I took the unit, called it a Pocket CB and sold over 250,000 of them at $39.95. It was a huge success and fully attributable to my general knowledge combined with the specific knowledge of the unit and the discovery of that unique feature that might have been overlooked by somebody else.
 Realize how important it is to know your product and know your customer. It is this specific knowledge that will make a dramatic difference in your ability to communicate your thoughts in copy.

 Practice, Practice, Practice

##### One of the first things I would ask my seminar students to think about was the definition of good copywriting. Is it the skill of being able to accurately put words on paper? Can it be taught? What sort of background do you need to be a good copywriter?
 We would then talk about both general knowledge and specific knowledge. But I explained that there was more to the art of copywriting.
 Copywriting is simply a written form of communicating facts and emotions. It is a mental process. Some copywriters will tell you that many of their greatest works were well thought out in their minds even before they put them on paper.
 Joe Karbo wrote one of the most successful income opportunity ads ever written for his book, The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches, in one draft and without corrections. It just poured out of his mind onto a sheet of paper. And it was one of the few ads he ever wrote.
 Some copywriters will tell you that they just sit down and start writing. Some find that sitting in front of a computer does the trick and others need something like a pen and a pad of paper.
 My greatest ads were written during a variety of circumstances. Many were well thought out before I put the first word to paper and they flowed out with hardly a correction. Other times they would flow but you wouldn’t recognize the first draft from the last because of the number of corrections I made. Sometimes I would sit in an airplane and just write from takeoff to landing and come up with great copy. And other times, I used my computer with great success.

# It’s All a Mental Process

##### The bottom line for all these approaches is that copywriting is primarily the mental process of first getting your thoughts organized in your mind and then eventually transferring them onto paper. There is no best method—just what works for you.
 But the best place to start, without question, is to start. That’s right. Pick up a piece of paper and a pen, and start. Do enough of it over a long enough period of time and I guarantee you, you’ll improve each year. Write articles for a local newspaper. I started writing for my high school paper. It gave me experience and confidence. Write letters, write postcards—just plain write every opportunity you can.
 I look over my very first JS&A direct response ads and can’t believe I wrote them. They were horrible. But I matured and I learned with each ad I wrote. In my first ads, I used clichés—“It’s the product the world has been waiting for.” And my sentences weren’t flowing as they do now. Sheer volume and experience will do wonders. As they say to anybody wanting to make it to Carnegie Hall, “Practice, practice, practice.”

# Don’t Worry about the First Draft

##### Another fact to realize about writing copy is that the first draft of an ad is often terrible and the real skill in copywriting is taking that rough draft and polishing it. You might add words, delete entire sentences, change the order of sentences or even paragraphs. It’s all part of the copywriting process. I often pointed out to my students that if everybody in the class were given the assignment of writing a draft of an ad for a product, the first draft of my ad would quite likely be terrible compared to everybody else’s. It is what I do with the copy after my first draft that really makes the difference.
 In that first draft the goal is to put something—anything—on paper, the emotional outpouring of everything you are trying to convey about your product or service. Don’t worry about how it reads. Just get it down onto something you can work with like a computer screen or a piece of paper and then go from there.
 To define exactly what copywriting is, I often presented the following axiom:

 Axiom 1

**_Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of_**
**_all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that_**
**_information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or_**
**_service._**

##### And in this book you will learn some of the valuable techniques to use to expand your knowledge of the copywriting process so you can write copy that motivates people to take an action—specifically to take their hard- earned money and exchange it for your product or service.
 Copywriting is the key to any successful direct marketing venture. You can have the world’s best product or service, but if you can’t communicate your ideas, you have nothing. I will give you the skills and insights you need to successfully write copy. I’ve already personally taken the most expensive course ever. If you would add up my failures and their cost to me, add the insights I received mostly from my failures, and then add the experiences I’ve had in copywriting and marketing, you would see that it has indeed been an expensive education. And you’re about to share in it.

# Chapter 4

 The Purpose of All the Graphic
 Elements of an Ad

##### You are now ready to start to learn the techniques I use to write copy. You already understand the importance of having a broad general knowledge. This takes time and is a lifelong quest. And you understand the importance of obtaining specific knowledge on a project you are working on. This I hope is quite clear from Chapter 2.
 But what you are about to learn in this chapter and the chapters that follow is the specific knowledge you will need to understand my copywriting approach and to become a top copywriter.
 In these chapters, I present several axioms. Each one is in bold type and each one is critical to your understanding of my philosophy. The axiom presented in this chapter is very important and very difficult to believe at first. Understand this concept, believe in it and it will give you a good foundation for your future writing skills. Don’t believe in it and you’ll fall into the trap that many copywriters typically fall into.
 To introduce the concept, let’s look at the CB radio ad on the next page, which ran from 1975 through 1977. The ad has all the elements you would expect any space ad to have. And to understand this first axiom, I would ask my students to define the purpose of each of the 10 elements in an advertisement. The following is what we finally decided:

-----

##### 1. Headline: To get your attention and draw you to the subheadline. 2. Subheadline: To give you more information and further explain the attention-getting headline. 3. Photo or Drawing: To get your attention and to illustrate the product more fully. 4. Caption: To describe the photo or drawing. This is an important element and one that is often read. 5. Copy: To convey the main selling message for your product or service.

-----

##### 6. Paragraph Headings: To break up the copy into chunks, thereby making the copy look less imposing. 7. Logo: To display the name of the company selling the product. 8. Price: To let the reader know what the product or service costs. The price could be in large type or could be buried in the copy. 9. Response Device: To give the reader a way to respond to the ad, by using the coupon, toll-free number or ordering information, usually near the end of the ad. 10. Overall Layout: To provide the overall appearance for the ad, by using effective graphic design for the other elements. After they clearly understood each of the elements that comprise a direct response ad, I then told the class that there is a singular purpose for all the elements in an ad—a purpose so important that it constitutes one of the essential concepts in my approach to copy.
 When you were first attracted to the ad you might have looked at the photo at the top of the page or the other photos. You might have then read the headline, read the subheadline and then glanced down to the name of the company selling the product. You may have read the captions to both the pictures and the sketches and you may have noticed the toll-free number indicating that you could order the product on the phone.
 When you looked at the ad overall, you may have noticed the layout, the paragraph headings scattered about the layout and the attractive graphic and typographic presentation.
 There are plenty of elements that can draw your attention before you start reading the copy. But one of the most important axioms you will learn for becoming a great copywriter is my second axiom. Here it is:

 Axiom 2

**_All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing_**
**_only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy._**

##### At this point, there was usually a confused look on the faces of my students. They thought that each of these elements had its own reason for existence. But I was saying, “No, they are there strictly for the sole purpose of getting you to read the first sentence.”

 Each element should lead you to the first sentence.

-----

##### I know what you’re thinking. “What about the headline? Isn’t it supposed to have a benefit, be 16 words long and what about . . .” Stop. Just accept my word at this point that each element has a single purpose and that is to get you to read the first sentence. Don’t question me. Don’t jump to any conclusions. Just remember this axiom.
 This means if somebody asks you, “With the Sugarman approach to copywriting, what is the purpose of the subheadline in the ad?” don’t answer, “A subheadline is designed to give you more information and to further explain the attention-getting headline.”
 Neither of the above reasons is as important as the fact that the subheadline is designed to get the reader to read the copy.
 If somebody asked you for the main purpose of the logo in an advertisement, you could answer, “To establish the corporate identity of the company selling the product,” or you could answer, “To provide a degree of continuity.” But the real answer is to get you to read the copy. Really.
 If you don’t believe it, have patience and I will prove it to you. But if you’ll open your mind and just accept what I tell you, you will eventually realize that what I am saying is correct. Most importantly, though, when you realize this and start writing with this in the back of your mind, you’ll be amazed at the change in your results—whether your copy is in a print ad or on a web site. But like I said, just take my word for it now and let me prove it to you later in this book.

# Chapter 5

 The First Sentence

##### If the purpose of all the elements in an ad is therefore to get you to read the copy, then what we are really talking about is reading the first sentence, aren’t we? What does this tell you about the first sentence? Pretty important, isn’t it? And if the first sentence is pretty important, what do you hope the person who looks at your ad does? Read it, of course. If the reader doesn’t read your very first sentence, chances are that he or she won’t read your second sentence.
 Now if the first sentence is so important, what can you do to make it so compelling to read, so simple, and so interesting that your readers—every one of them—will read it in its entirety? The answer: Make it short.
 If you look at many typical JS&A ads, you’ll notice that all of my first sentences are so short they almost aren’t sentences. Some typical ones might be:
 Losing weight is not easy. It’s you against a computer. It’s easy. It had to happen. Hats off to IBM. Each sentence is so short and easy to read that your reader starts to read your copy almost as if being sucked into it. Think about the analogy of a locomotive. When the locomotive starts to chug from a standing start, it really works hard. The amount of commitment and energy that the train must exert is monumental. But once the train starts to move, the next few feet become easier and the next few even easier. So it is with copy.
