Telling a story is a powerful tool to create a bond between you and your prospects.

 Think of the public speaker who starts his speech with a story or uses stories throughout his presentation. It makes for an interesting presentation and often holds the interest of the audience. In fact, very often, after I’ve been listening to a boring speaker and my mind starts to wander, I become alert when I know a story is about to be told.

## Stories Have Lessons to Teach

##### Stories usually have lessons to teach or experiences to share or even endings that can excite, surprise or bring out emotion. And so it is with good copy. If you tell a story in your copy that is relevant either to selling your product, to creating the environment for selling, or to getting the prospect to read your copy, you are using this wonderful and powerful trigger in a very effective way to sell your product or service.
 Finally, some stories add a unique human element that allows you to relate to and bond very closely with your prospects.
 Kathy Levine, formerly one of QVC’s top salespersons, wrote in her book, It’s Better to Laugh (Pocket Books, 1995), “I realized early on that selling is a matter of capturing people’s attention and holding it with a good story.”
 The most interesting salespeople I know always have a story to tell. It is their way of relating to their customers and entertaining them as well. One in particular has a repertoire of hundreds of jokes—each targeted to his prospect, to the selling environment and what he has to sell. As you can imagine, he is very effective.
 My most successful advertising campaigns all used stories as the basis for my presentation. Here is one example of this technique from one of my most successful ads. I wrote an ad for BluBlocker sunglasses that will give you a flavor of how a story can be very helpful in creating human interest that will cause your prospects to read your entire message.
 Headline: Vision Breakthrough Subheadline: When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I could not believe. Nor will you. Byline: By Joseph Sugarman Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain. Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so incredible,” he said, “when you first look through a pair, you won’t believe it.”

##### “What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?” Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision improves. Objects appear sharper, more defined. Everything takes on an enhanced 3-D effect. And it’s not my imagination. I just want you to see for yourself.” The story continues as I personally look through the sunglasses and learn more about them from Len. It uses a conversational tone, but still covers all the important points about the sunglasses, the danger from ultraviolet (UV) rays, and the advantage of screening out blue spectrum light rays. A story is used very effectively to build curiosity and cause the reader to read all the copy, and eventually to read the final sales pitch.
 That ad for BluBlocker sunglasses launched a multimillion-dollar company that eventually sold 20 million pairs of sunglasses and has recently celebrated 20 years in business.
 When writing copy for your product, think about using a few stories that might be of interest to your prospect and assist in the sale of your product: stories about a new development and how you discovered it—stories about yourself that would be of interest to your prospects.
 Timing is also important in the storytelling process. It is nice to start with a story, because it holds attention and engages the prospect. Telling stories is an art form and using it effectively in a print ad grows with experience. Simply being aware of its potential and its effectiveness is a good start. You’ll be surprised at how many stories you’ll be able to come up with once you put your mind to it.
 A good story should capture a person’s attention, relate the product or service in the copy and help you bond with the prospect.

# 27. Mental Engagement

##### Have you ever gone to a movie and known how it was going to end after watching the first few minutes? Or a movie where every action can be easily anticipated? These movies tend not to be very enjoyable.
 However, the opposite is true when you watch a movie that keeps you in suspense until the very end when it reaches a credible but surprise ending. Any movie that is not predictable is more enjoyable. I recently saw a movie called Inside Man about what I thought was a bank robbery but turned out to be what I least expected. And the identity of the robbers was also a surprise at the end of the movie. I loved that film.
 What forces in our minds make us perceive one movie as a lot better than another?
 I have a theory that I strongly believe comes pretty close to the answer: The more the mind must work to reach a conclusion that it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoyable, or stimulating the experience.
 I taught this concept at my seminar for many years, and one day one of my students brought me a copy of a media newsletter that confirmed what I had been teaching. The article claimed that a missing element was responsible for advertising failure—a lack of whole-brain appeal.
 It then went on to explain how science is rapidly discovering that different parts of the brain perform different functions. Some brain researchers suggest that human beings experience the most pleasure when all these parts of the brain are engaged in agreeable levels of stimulation and activity.
 The four brain parts discussed were those that control thought, intuition, sensation, and emotion. The article suggested that advertising that pleasurably engages the senses, emotions, and thought process, as well as our innate intuition, will tend to be successful.
 Advertising that merely grabs the attention of the senses will tend to be only temporarily attractive. Most advertising tests today reflect the power of day-after recall but fail to predict the response from whole-brain advertising.
 Let’s look at how whole-brain advertising applies to writing effective advertising copy. If you make your copy too obvious, the reader feels either

##### looked down on or bored. Provide a little suspense so that the reader has to come to a conclusion on her own using intuition, thought, sensation, and emotion, and you’ve got a very good force working for you. Let me cite an example from an ad I wrote on digital watches.
 The ad was for an alarm chronograph digital watch for which we were charging $99. At the time, Seiko was the standard of comparison for this type of watch. Seiko was the first out with the new technology. The following paragraph from the ad best exemplifies what I’m talking about:
 The Seiko chronograph alarm sells for $300. The watch costs jewelers $150. And jewelers love the item, not only because of the excellent reputation of the Seiko brand, but because it’s probably America’s best- selling new expensive digital watch. And Seiko can’t supply enough of them to their dealers. Now, note what I didn’t say but what was still rather obvious. Read the quote again to see if you pick it up. Give up? What I didn’t say was that the jewelers were making a small fortune each time they sold a Seiko. I didn’t have to say it, yet the readers could come to their own conclusion all by themselves using their intuition, thought, and emotions. Had I made it too obvious, by adding the line “and jewelers are making a small fortune,” it would not have been as powerful. The mind had to work a little to reach a conclusion through its own thought processes. And when the reader compared our $99 watch with the Seiko, it appeared that the jewelry stores and Seiko were soaking the consumer.
 This is a very subtle but powerful concept. It’s the difference between talking down to prospects and making prospects feel you are talking directly to them. And it is one of the most difficult theories to understand.

## Working Hard Brings Appreciation

##### To get a better appreciation for the theory, think back in your life to times when you had to work hard to achieve something and how much more you appreciated what you achieved. I remember all the work I had to go through to get my instrument rating after getting my private pilot’s license. It took me months of flying and study, not to mention thousands of dollars in expense. When I finally received my instrument rating, it was a thrill.
 In contrast, when I took my commercial rating test, it was simple. Not that much study, very little flying, and within a few weeks I had the rating. Sure, I was proud that I was finally a commercial pilot, but nowhere near as proud as I was of my instrument rating. Working hard for a successful conclusion results in a great deal of personal satisfaction.
 The same holds true for the mind and the thinking process. Anything that causes the mind to work hard to reach a conclusion creates a positive, enjoyable or stimulating effect on the brain. The opposite is true if the mind does not have to work because the conclusion is obvious.

 Anything that causes the mind to work hard to reach a conclusion creates a positive, enjoyable or stimulating effect on the brain.

 You appreciate that sale to a difficult client a lot more than a sale that is a pushover and takes only a minute. When a very difficult product is given to

## Vague Descriptions Encourage
 Thinking

##### When Ernest Hemingway described beautiful women in his books, he was never very specific. He used general terms and let his readers imagine the women.
 If you make your intentions too obvious, the prospect will feel either patronized or bored. Make the prospect think in order to come to a conclusion, and you create a very stimulating mental effect.
 Too often we write too much. We reveal too much of the pitch without allowing the prospect’s mind and intelligence to become engaged. Simply realizing how this powerful psychological trigger works will help you craft copy that causes your prospects’ brains to experience an enjoyable and stimulating time by allowing them to reach—on their own—the conclusions that you want them to reach.

# 28. Guilt

##### Have you ever received mailings from charities that include a small gift? The gifts are usually address stickers, colorful stamps or some other inexpensive token. Or how about those mailings with surveys that include a dollar bill or a reply envelope with a return stamp? In both cases you may have experienced a slight touch of guilt. After all, you’ve received something of value and you feel an obligation to take some action in return, such as sending in a donation or answering the survey. These are good examples of the use of guilt. But how do you use this technique in a print ad when you can’t include stickers or a dollar bill?
 Many people have told me that after they read one of my ads, they not only are compelled to buy my product, but would feel guilty if they didn’t. Instead of giving them stickers or a dollar bill, I give the reader plenty of compelling information and reading entertainment—so much so that they sense an obligation to respond. In a print ad, often the mere repetition of seeing an ad in several magazines works to create a slight sense of guilt.
 Repeated mailings also create guilt. Keep sending somebody mailings and after a while, they may feel guilty that they haven’t responded. I used this technique when I sold ski lifts for a company called Ski Lift International. Each week I sent out a small mailing with a premium gift enclosed. One mailing would have a button, another an unusual mailing piece and still another an involvement device. After a while, many of the recipients felt guilty and responded. Some even apologized for not responding earlier.

# 29. Specificity

##### Being specific in your explanations is very critical and can establish your credibility. Let me first give you an example. If I were to say, “New dentists everywhere use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste,” it sounds like typical advertising lingo—puffery designed to sell a product. It’s so general that it will probably cause a viewer to discount the statement I have just made and maybe everything else I say. But if I said, “Ninety-two percent of new dentists use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste,” it sounds much more believable. The consumer is likely to think that we did a scientific survey and that 92 percent was the result.
 When people perceive certain general statements as puffery or typical advertising babble, those statements are at best discounted or accepted with some doubts. By contrast, statements with specific facts can generate strong believability. In an ad I once wrote for a collectibles company I created called Battram Galleries, I stated the exact cost of running the ad and the exact cost of the product. I clearly demonstrated through specific figures that we weren’t making any profit from the offering. It was so successful, it was oversubscribed. I’ve used this technique on video as well.
 In my BluBlocker infomercials, I state the specific reasons why screening out blue spectrum light rays improves your vision. I explain that blue light rays focus in front of the retina (which is the focusing screen of the eye) and not on the retina as do the other colors. So when you block blue light, you block those rays that don’t focus on your retina and therefore objects appear clearer, sharper and more defined. I’m specific. It sounds believable. And the statement is a lot better than just saying, “BluBlocker sunglasses let you see clearer, sharper and with more definition.”
 If you’re describing a product that is designed for the circulatory functions of the body, you can talk about “242 miles of blood vessels” instead of “miles of blood vessels.” When you talk about the bottom of your feet, instead of saying, “There are a lot of nerve endings at the bottom of your feet,” you can say, “There are 72,000 nerve endings at the bottom of your feet.” You are stating a fact as opposed to a general or vague statement. You are more believable.

## You Sound More like an Expert

##### There’s one other benefit to being specific. By being specific you sound like you’re an expert on your product—you’ve really investigated it and are very knowledgeable. And, this too, builds trust and confidence.
 People, in general, are very skeptical about advertising and often don’t believe many of the claims stated in ads. But when you make a specific claim using the exact facts and figures, your message is much more credible and often trusted.

# 30. Familiarity

##### The Kowloon section of Hong Kong is an exotic part of the city. Its storefronts, hordes of people and many sounds and smells make for a very unique and exciting place to visit. It is different. And when you are in Kowloon, America seems awfully far away.
 I was walking down the street absorbing the energy of the area and stopping occasionally to look in a store when suddenly, right in front of me, I saw one of my American suppliers walking down the sidewalk.
 What a surprise! It was a wonderful feeling to see somebody I knew in a foreign place like Hong Kong.
 Although previously I hadn’t been that friendly with the supplier, I suddenly felt close. I asked if he was available for dinner and I made an appointment for that evening to get together and spend some time with him. As a result, he ended up selling me a lot more than I normally would have bought. The contrast of seeing somebody with whom you are familiar in a totally foreign setting creates a strong attraction. And so it is with advertising.
