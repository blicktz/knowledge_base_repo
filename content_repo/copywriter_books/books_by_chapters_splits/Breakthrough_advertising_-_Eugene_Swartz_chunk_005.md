Millions of women do it everv week. Thev've given
up washboards for good. ThevYe freed themselves forever
from the hard work and reddened hands of washdav.

Now thev just soak—rinse—and hang out to drv! In
half the time, without a hit ol hard rubbing, the wash is
on the line—whiter titan ever!

Notice how the original promise in the headline has been
taken and intensified in these first thi'ee paragraphs of copv. The
promise is repeated, in different words and from different perspectives, over and over again in those first three paragraphs.

But notice too that—as the copv builds desire—it also builds
a growing reaction on the part of the woman reading it. This reaction can be expressed in one word: "Hoic?" This promise sounds
better and better . . . it begins to sound too good to be true . . .
now she needs reassurance fast.

So the whiteness claims stop. The copv shifts direction—and
now begins to sell the mechanism, like this:

Dirt floats off—stains <jo.
The secret is simplv Rinso—a mild, granulated soap
that gives rich, lasting suds even in the hardest water.

Just soak the clothes in the ereamv Rinso suds—
and the dirt and stains float off. Rinse—and the wash is
spotless.

Even the most soiled parts need onlv a gentle rub between the fingers to make them snowv. Thus clothes last
longer, for there's no hard rubbing against a board.

Notice, first of all, that this mechanism—the suds that float
off dirt—is sold just as hard as the whiteness storv it is brought
in to prove. The first rule of mechanism copv is that it is not

scientific discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or
merelv factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in good copy—including mechanism copy—
sells. Only in these paragraphs, the copy is selling a secondary
claim (dirt floating off) that proves the primary claim (a whiter
wash). But still—it sells.

Secondly, of course, you'll immediately notice how simple
the mechanism is in this 1926 copy, as compared with the same
field today. In those days it was enough to mention the facts that
the suds floated off the dirt; the reader accepted, as an evident
truth, the fact that they would do so.

Today, of course, in our much more sophisticated and exploited market, she would no longer do so. Todav vou would need
far more mechanism. You would have to explain more, promise'
deeper, perhaps even invent a miracle ingredient to do the work
for vou.

**Stage Three: Feature the Mechanism**

Which brings us to case #2 and the difficult problem of what
to do when vour market is highly sophisticated . . . when promises sound alike . . . when price competition becomes suicidal?

This takes us back to Chapter 3, where we discussed marketsophistication from another perspective. Here we discovered that
mechanism—strong mechanism—saleable mechanism—is not onlv
a way to build belief, but may actually become so important to the
success of your product that you must put it into the headline.

These headlines are all mechanism headlines:

"FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY."

"FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING."

"RUN YOUR CAR WITHOUT SPARK PLUGS."

"SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."

"TOMMY ARMOUR SAYS SMACK HELL OUT OF
THE BALL WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND."

And hundreds more. Even/ one of them offers i/oti a new
_way to get what i/ou've been wanting. A NEW[7] WAY: a new mech-_
anism; a new chance to satisfy your desire—even if everything
else vou've tried has failed vou.

Mechanism, therefore, can he inside vour ad, to prove vour
main claim, or on top of the ad. elevated bv the state of your
market to becoming the main claim.

If people assume that thev know how vour product works.
or if vour claim is so new that thev don't care, then all the mechanism you need can be summed up in a word or a phrase.

If people are not quite sure how it works, describe the mechanism—in selling language—until thev have enough reason-whv
to believe vou.

If you have, however, an exceptionally strong or dramatic
mechanism, or if you want to establish definite superiorih" to
other competing products, then sell hell out of that mechanism.

We'll see some expert examples of how to do this in our next
chapter, on Concentration- when we're sliown how to compare
your product with the rest of vour field.

**On the Importance of Mechanism When You Want**

**to Convince Your Reader That You're**

**Giving Him a Bargain**

One of the sad truths of our time—and profession—is that
our readers do not always beliexe the truth when we tell it to
them. Everv copy writer has had. at one time or another, a perfectly marvelous product that just couldn't be sold—because people
wouldn't believe that it could do what he knew it could do.

In the same way manv manufacturers, and their agencies,
are startled when thev cut a price—advertise the reduction—and
see no increase in sales.

What happened? No one believed them. A price cut—like
a product advantage—is only as good as vour words, and vour
strategy, makes it.

-----

1 7 2 FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION

Price cuts must be justified. There must be a reason for
them. A mechanism behind them. Without such a mechanism—
without such a reason-why you should give this bargain—you are
going to get only a fraction of its real sales power.

The great master of price-cut mechanization was Robert Collier. His book—The Robert Collier Letter Book—is one of the
great classics of copvwriting know-how. Here is just one example
of how Collier made his price-cuts, not only believable, but
dramatic:

Before the Price Goes Up!
Dear Sir:
A short time ago one of the old, reliable mills that
makes the finer qualities of woven Madras for shirts began
sending out S.O.S. calls.

They had kept their plant going steadily for months,
thinking that the usual demand would easily take care of
their excess output.

But, with the weather so generally unseasonable, the
usual demand didn't materialize. And there thev were, heavily overstocked—and needing money.

If we would take all their surplus stock of the finer
grades of woven Madras, amounting to a quarter of a mil_lion yards, they offered to let us have them at wav below_
any price we had ever paid for shirtings in all our years in
business—at far less than they could make the materials
and sell them for today.

We took them—the whole quarter-million yards—at a
tremendous savings in cost. . . .

A Bargain You May Never Get Again. . . .

Let me point out the difference between this logical.
carefully-prepared introduction to the price slash, and a simple.
bare announcement of that slash. Here, the copy writer not onlv
emphasizes bargain over and over again, but brings in qualiti/
as a counter-desire time after time. He thus uses a mechanism
_within a mechanism: (1) the unseasonable weather causing (2[1 ]_

the factory to become overstocked resulting in the primary markdown—to build belief upon belief.

-----

FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION 173

Here the copv starts with the mechanism, and onlv goes into
the bargain claims six paragraphs later. Again, he has taken the
Creative Gamble: in this case, that he could hold the reader's interest for those six paragraphs. And. because of this gamble, lie
reaps ten times the believabilitv for even word he said about the
bargain-value of his offer from that point on.

**THE SIXTH TECHNIQUE**
**OF BREAKTHROUGH**
**COPY: CONCENTRATION**

How to Destroy Alternate Ways for
Your Prospect to Satisfy His Desire

As vou know, in the final analysis,
no successful copy ever sells a product. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire. And its power to sell ultimately comes
from the intensity of that desire.

If the desire is commercial—that is, if it is shared by masses
of people, and if each of these people want that satisfaction enough
to pay the price required for a mechanism to satisfy it—then it
is highly probable that many firms will try to deliver that mechanism, or product, to them.

The almost universal condition of commercial life is competition. No one who sells am'thing, of course, can avoid it. As you
write, one eye is fixed on your market, and the other on your
competitors.

We have described in this book several different ways of

-----

```
beating competition. Let's stop for a moment and review them:
First, of course, is superiority of product. This is the ultimate weapon in the war for the consumers dollar. If you produce the best product, your advertising has a hundred times the
chance of success than if you produce only a fair product. Most
great ads have been associated with great products. Most great
copy claims come from the assembly line. If vours does not. if
your copy is better than your product, then send it to vour client
instead of your prospect, and tell him to make it a reality.

But even the best product needs equally as effective cop\
to induce people to try it. Otherwise, the excessive cost of getting the first purchase may drive the product off the market, before the repeat sales can build up high enough to earn- it through.
So we come to our second weapon to beat competition—superiority of promise. A stronger promise, that evokes more desire. A wider promise, that causes more people to buv. A more
believable promise, that brings in the skeptics as well as the susceptible. This entire book has been a blueprint for developing
such promises.

Third, we have the weapon of product-role. The role the
product allows its consumer to plav. The personality, the identification, the prestige, the status, the excitement vou can bring
out of your product, or graft onto it.

Fourth, we have response and reaction as a competitive
force—the ability to one-up the competition: to escalate claims
when necessary; to shift mechanisms; to invade new markets.

And fifth—the technique we will discuss in this chapter—is
direct attack.

Direct attack—the mechanism of Concentration— differs
completely from the other four methods we have discussed above.
All these techniques have the common element of ignoring the
competition. They concentrate on your storv,,/our proniises^/o//;benefits, your product. They act as though'there is no other winpossible of gaining the satisfaction your prospect desires.

Therefore, they are most effective when vou dominate a

SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CONCENTRATION 1 7 7

field, when vour primary problem is to protect your customers'
lovalty against the claims of your competitor, or when your story
is so powerful, so different, or so fresh that the competition has
nothing to match it. In these cases, it's better not to give him
the prestige of attack, not to mention his claims or his product,
even invidiously, in the space which costs you such a dear dollar.
But in many other cases—especially where your advertising
budget is much less than his—especially where the bulk of your
prospects are already customers of his—your first problem may
be to crack his image, to shatter their loyalty, before you can
rechannel their desire around to vou.

**What Concentration Is**

But this process of Concentration—this careful, logical, documented process of proving ineffectual other ways of satisfying
vour prospect's desire—is much more than mere attack. If you
_can only attack another product—without showing at the same_
_time, by comparison, how your product provides what the other_
_lacks—then say nothing at all! Never attack a weakness unless_
_you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!_

The reason for this is simple. Your prospect knows that your
attack is biased. If, therefore, you are attacking another product
onlv for your own good—in other words, to win the sale by disparaging your competitor—what you will probably evoke in his
mind is skepticism and dislike, and very little else.

But—and this is the critical point in this process—if you can
show your customer that this attack is for his own good, in his
sendee, because your product will eliminate this weakness, then
you have a sales story he will accept. Then you will make him
question even the most ingrained loyalty.

_Concentration, therefore, is the process of pointing out weak-_
nesses in the competition . . . emphasizing their disservice to your
prospect . . . and then proving to him that your product gives him
what he wants without them.

-----

1 7 8 SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CONCENTRATION

Notice that all the techniques that we have developed in the
last few chapters are used here. Intensification to show the penalties of continuing with the old product. Gradualization to show
the logical cause of the weaknesses and how thev can now be
cured. Mechanization to prove that your product removes the
weakness. And so on.

_Concentration is therefore a complicated process, taking up_
sizable space to do its job properlv, and combining almost every
trick you have learned in this book. To see how incredibly effective it can be, however, let us look at two masterful examples.

The first is our spark plug ad again. As vou remember, in
the copy, the copy writer has told his prospect that he can run
his car without spark plugs, that he can get more gas mileage
and more power if he puts "fire injectors" into his car instead of
the old-fashioned plugs.

Now he goes on to:
1. Provide the mechanisms which prove his own claim; and
2. To destroy the prospect's confidence in plugs forever, in
this brilliant piece of interweaving copy:

MECHANICS AND ENGINEERS
READ THIS CAREFULLY

And for you mechanics and engineers let me tell vou
why fire injection must give vou these results.

_A spark plug jumps a spark of electricity across an air_
_gap. This is the most wasteful and power consuming wav_
to get electricity from one place to another and it limits
the size of the spark.

_Afire injector fires on the surface of an electrical con-_
_ductor This is the most efficient wav to get a big power-_
ful spark into your cylinder.

_On ordinary spark plugs the air gap between the elec-_
_trode and the firing point is always getting bigger because_
the electrode is always burning awav. This means vou have
misfiring which means loss of power plus wasted gas plus
raw gas to damage the cylinders and piston rings. On fire
_injectors there is no air gap and no electrode to burn away._
That means maximum gas explosion which means full

-----

SIXTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CONCENTRATION 179

power, full economy and no raw gas to wash away the oil
protection from cylinder walls and pistons.

A spark plug accumulates filth and carbon because oi
inefficient firing. This means vou need regular cleaning,
setting and expensive replacement!

A fire injector never needs cleaning or setting. It actually- "breaks in" and becomes more efficient with use. It
will actually outlast your car, delivering maximum efficiency
without servicing or replacement.

A spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark that actually blows out under pressure of less than 120 pounds.

_A fire injector gives you a heavy powerful flame that_
will not blow out at pressures far heavier than those created bv even the highest compression engine. . . .

_With ordinary spark plugs you are using, or should_
_he using premium gas which costs from 4 to 8 cents more_
than ordinary gas, and despite this you're getting inefficient, wasteful gas consumption.

_With fire injectors regular gas will give you up to 8_
_more gas miles per gallon, up to 31 more horsepower, plus_
easier starting in all weather. Add these savings together
and see for yourself whv I sav that fire injectors will pay
for themselves every single month that you drive your car.

_Ordinary spark plugs have to he replaced regularly._
In some of the new high-compression cars, a set of plugs
will burn up in a couple of months.

_Afire injector installation is guaranteed for the life of_
_your car without cleaning, servicing, or replacing._

These are some of the reasons that the U.S. Air Force
_pays premium prices for surface supported injectors for_
_their aircraft and why vou will ultimately find fire injec-_
tors in all automobiles. . . .

**Let's See How He Does It**

**I hope that by now you have spotted many of the techniques**
he uses to gain his effects . . . to build the overall power of this
sequence. Let's just check off a few of them right now:

First, of course, is the interweaving contrast. A weakness in
the operation of the spark plug is pointed out, and then immedi

ately counteracted by the benefit the injector gives you. Bad—
good; bad—good; bad—good: this is the underlying structure of
this sequence.

But this is only one use he makes of parallelism. He repeats
words to contrast the inherent weakness of the plug with the inherent strength of the injector. "A spark plug jumps a spar*.
_"Afire injector fires on. . . . " Spark is a weak word; fire is much_
stronger visually And he later intensifies this contrast of image
by saying: "A spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark.
against "A fire injector gives you a heavy, powerful _flame_ "
You can picture the difference.
