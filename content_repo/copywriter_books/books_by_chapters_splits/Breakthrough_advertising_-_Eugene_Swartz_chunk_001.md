Chapter 2—and break down its structure step by step. What we

are looking for here is not content, nor promises, nor claims; but
_the way these promises and claims arc arranged in the ad, to_
_help each one of them gain full acceptance when it is encoun-_
_tered in turn by the prospect._

This ad was written in 1951. Its purpose was to sell a Television Repair Manual. Theoretically, every TV owner who was
having anv trouble with his set (and almost all of them were at
that time) was a prospect. But, before the prospect could be
turned into a customer, he had to believe two things:

1. That he could save money by making his own TV repairs;

and

2. That he was capable of making them.
Both these statements were matters of fact. The average TV
owner certainlv could save money if he had made his own repairs; and about 80% of those repairs were simple enough for
him to make himself.

But the overwhelming majority of prospects simply didn't

realize these facts. Most of them thought of themselves as nonhandymen, even in relation to far simpler devices than a television set. And, in 1951, the TV set was considered a complicated
mechanical monster, far beyond their poor powers to understand
let alone correct.

These two factors blocked the use of the obvious powerclaim headline for this product. Such a headline was written and
tested—"Save up to $100 a Year on Your TV Repairs!"—but it
failed to make a profit. The obvious was unsuccessful. Power
alone could not move the product.

Two tasks faced the copy writer in revising this ad. First, he
had to reach all his prospects in this market, and not just those
among them who considered themselves handymen. And second,
he had to convince all these non-handymen prospects that their
sets weren't really such fragile, complicated monsters after all,
and that they themselves could easily correct most troubles that
arose.

Once these two statements were believed by the prospect
and only then—could the previous headline claim of "Save up to
$100 a year on your TV repairs" be brought in at full power. Let
us see, acceptance by acceptance, how this new ad built to that
point:

The headline, first of all, would have to be a general statement, crystallizing and exploiting the universal resentment against
the high TV repair bills, the $60-a-vear TV service contracts that
were then in existence, and the outright thievery that occurred
in only a small fraction of the TV repair shops, but that had stigmatized the entire industry. From there—from this universallyaccepted resentment—the ad could then build toward the two
goal conclusions listed above. Let us see how this was done, statement by statement.

Here is the new headline:

_"WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD_
_THESE FACTS?"_

-----

THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION 1 3 7

No claim. No promise—except that of disclosure. But here
is an implication of foul plav, which echoed the existing suspicion in the TV owner himself. Here is a crystallization and outright expression that the average owner felt toward being taken.
Facts have been withheld. This is something he can agree with!

Thus, having achieved its first acceptance by its suspicionheadline, the ad reinforces that effect by an inclusion-question.
It asks a questions which, in form, seems to limit the market; but
which, in content, actually assures the correct answer by the overwhelming majority of it:

_"Was i/our set purchased after the spring of 1947?"_

95% of television owners would answer Yes. Thus the ad has
built two acceptances in its first two sentences. It has started a
Habit of Agreement in its reader. It now exploits that agreement
by making its first definite promise in the third sentence:

_"Then here is the full, uncensored stonj of how yon_
_can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60_
_a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear_
_pictures you've dreamed about!"_

**How Belief Was Built Into the Opening**

This is the ad's first claim. Its content alone is extremelv
powerful. But that powerful content—which otherwise might drive
many readers awav as being just too fantastic to be believed—
has been given extra belief—has been loaned, as it were, extra
belief—not only by the first two sentences that preceded it—but
by these deliberate constructions in the statement itself:

1. By the grammatical construction, "Was your. . ." in the
second sentence, and "Then . . ." in the third which by its very
_form generates belief. It does this by implying exclusion. It says_
that the promise will come true only in certain cases; that it will
only work for television sets purchased after 1947; that the ad
cannot make this promise for sets purchased earlier. Thus it adds

-----

138 THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION

credence to whatever statement follows it. Yon can feel this added
believability yourself by taking out the lead-word "Then" from
the sentence and reading it again. Immediately, it loses half its
force—force added to the content of the statement by the
grammatical-bridge tying it in to the first two acceptances.

2. The second attempt at adding believabilitv is bv the descriptive nature of the promise. It is not onlv a promise of reward (the money saved), but a catalog of almost-universal symptoms (repair bills and service fees). Since the overwhelming
majority of set owners are suffering from these problems, their
descriptions evoke two more "Yes—I have them" reactions from
the reader, and carry these reactions over to the save-monev
claims that immediately follow them. If these descriptions were
eliminated, the money-saving claims would be much weaker:
_"Then here is the full, uncensored story of liow you can save_
_$15-$20—save $30-$60—save $90-$ 100 on your' TY set—and_
_still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you've dreamed about!"_

3. And finally, even though the causes of the set owner's
problems are specifically described, the cures for them are deliberately left ambiguous. The fact that thev will save otherwise
wasted money, that they will get improved reception, is included—
how they will do this is not. The mechanism bv which these goals
will be accomplished is left out. It is left out because the reader
has not yet been prepared for it. If he were to learn, at this moment in the ad, that he had to make repairs on his set to save
this money, the average reader would turn the page. So he is
given specific symptoms, that he will agree he has, and specific
savings by eliminating them, that are certainly logical to expect.
He may or may not accept all these three claims in the sentence
completely; but the strength of their promise, the two or three
or four acceptances that he has already given, and the implied
disclosures still remaining in the body of the ad, should be enough
to carry him on, to this next paragraph:

_"How many times this week have you had to get up to fix_

-----

THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION 1 3 9

_a jumpy TV picture? . . . How many times have you had to put_
_up with ghosts? . . . How many times. . . ."_

Here again is reinforcement of belief—the description of
universal symptoms—the coaxing out of a stream of agreements.
"Yes . . . Yes . . . Yes"—he must answer if he has had trouble with
his set. A habit of acceptance is being built inside him. Trust is
being formed, layer by laver—as each question poses a test, and
each ves answer proves to the reader that the ad is talking about
him.

Already the ad is beginning to weave its pattern of promise
and belief and then promise again. Now, with as many as seven
or eight agreements behind it to establish a firm foundation of
belief, the ad moves on to its next great promise:

"90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!"
_"All of these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to_
_you at the moment they happened—but here is the real_
_tragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you now_
_have in your front room . . . has been playing in manu-_
_facturer's test rooms for months—and playing perfectly!"_

**Goal Conclusions**

The ad is now laving the[1] basis for the first of its two goal
conclusions—that TV sets are not fragile—that they have amazing endurance if they are properlv cared for. Only when the
reader accepts this fact, can the ad go on to its second conclusion—that whatever minor breakdowns do occur can be easily
handled bv the owner himself.

But the ad is still five paragraphs awav from any mention of
the owner touching his set. First it must establish the dependability of the set; and it does this bv two methods. At the start,
in the following two paragraphs, it gives graphic descriptions of
the manufacturer's own tests used to establish this dependability:

_"These sets have been subjected to 'Breakdown Tests'_
_that would seem incredible to the average owner. They have_

-----

140 THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION

_been tamed on for 24 hours a day—7 days a week_ _4_
_iceeks a month. Some of these sets have been naming with-_
_out a moment's pause for as much as 17 months._

_"These sets have been tested against almost every con-_
_ceivable type of viewing hazard. . . up to 120 miles away_
_from the station . . . against the interference of an entire_
_warehouse of electrical appliances . . . in special, steel-ribbed_
_buildings, which ordinarily would produce several distinct_
_ghosts._

_"And in almost every one of these cases, these sets_
_have produced perfect, movie-clear pictures—without major_
_breakdowns—for as much as one full year! Here are some_
_of the reasons why:"_

Then, when the reader has fully visualized the impact of
these test reports, the ad now turns to expert authority and log_ical construction to reinforce this belief. Notice in the next few-_
paragraphs how the ad picks up the already-accepted condition.
_"If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were . . .", and_
uses that now-established condition to prove the series of statements that follow it:

_"What TV Experts Have Learned About Your Set!"_
_"If your set were properly cared for—as these sets_
_were cared for in these tests—it need break down only once_
_during the entire year! In other words, you may actually_
_have to call in a repairman only once during the entire_
_year You can save the $30-$60 'service fees you are now-_
_paying—and you can save most of the SI OS 15 repair bills."_
_"If your set was properly cared for. if can actually give_
_you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days a year._
_It can give you this perfect reception without special 'elec-_
_tronic equipment—without the help of a repairman—up to_
_100 miles away from your station."_

Notice that in these two paragraphs, the ad returns to the
claims made in the third sentence—repeats them almost word for
word—and then gives logical proof, in logical form, for each of
them. As we have pointed out before, these claims—"you can avoid
_those $15-420 repair bills—avoid those_ _$30-$60 a year service_

-----

THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION 141

_fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear picture ijou've dreamed_
_about!"—were stated in the third sentence without supporting proof_
at that time; but with strong implication—"Here is the full, un_censored. story . . ."—that such proof would follow._

That proof is now submitted, in an extremely formal and logical structure. Thus the ad again weaves proof into promise—repeating previous claims in a new context of full documentation,
where it could only suggest that they would be proven before.

Notice also that this logical proof—"If your set were cared
_for. . . it need break down only once a year. . . you need call a_
_repairman only once a year. . . you save the service fees and most_
_repair bills."—is, in itself, solidly grounded in the test-proof pre-_
sented in the paragraphs before it—"being subjected to Break_down tests . . . against almost every type of viewing hazard . . ._
_and produced perfect pictures,_ _without breakdowns, for as much_
_as one full year" Thus a chain of proof upon proof is constructed—_
each new statement repeating the heart of the proof before it.

Thus the ad has now proved—bv using the Mechanism of Intensification—by repeating the same theme-content seven different times in seven different wavs—that vour TV set is dependable.

**The Ultimate Objective**

This was the first goal-conclusion. At this point the reader
is convinced that it is true. The ad is now ready to go on to prove
the second goal conclusion: that the owner can correct minor
breakdowns himself.

It begins this proof in the verv next paragraph, in this way:

_"And, most important, these experts have discovered_
_that you do not have to he a handyman or a mechanic in_
_order to coax this performance out of your set! Here's why"_

Notice that it is in this paragraph that the entirely-new (to
the reader) assumption—that vou can fix your own minor breakdowns—is first introduced. Yet its novelty is deliberately con

142 THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: GRADUALIZATION

cealed; it is presented as though it were simply another rephrasing
of the bv-now already accepted dependability conclusion. There
is therefore no break in the logical flow of proof. Acceptance is
built into this entirely new statement in these four different ways:

1. By paragraph parallelism. By framing the statement as the
last of a series of similar paragraphs—all the others of which have
already been accepted—instead of physically setting it off as a
new point with its own sub head and a different construction, as
the reader would ordinarily expect.

2. By the lead word, "And," a tie-in phrase, which indicates
that the sentence accompanying it is the same as those that have
gone before.

3. By immediately following "And" by a second tie-in phrase,
"most important," which again implies that the remainder of the
statement is part of the series that has gone before.

4. And finally, by repeating the phrase, "these experts have
discovered," which echoes the identifying subhead at the beginning of the series, and carries on the acceptance-momentum of
the series as a whole.

All these deliberate constructions combine to give this short,
but vital, transitional paragraph the acceptance, and therefore the
believability, of all the careful planning that has gone before it.
They allow the reader to make what otherwise might be a jarring transition from already-established proof to an entirely new
promise with a minimum of effort.

Now the ad builds its final step—showing that the only repairs that the average owner will have to make are actually minor
external adjustments on his set. Notice how it integrates this newextension of its previous thought into what has gone before bv
starting with the phrase, once again, "These experts have discovered ..."

Here are the next three paragraphs:

_"Five Minutes a Week for Perfect Reception."_
_"These T\[r] experts have discovered that ipur 7T set_
_is a great deal like your body in this respect—that it gives_

-----

THIRD TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: CRADLALIZATION 1 4 3

_you learning signals before it has a major breakdown. For_
_instance, after your set was installed, it probably played per-_
_fectly for the first week. But then it began to suffer from the_
_vibration, the jarring, the interference of other electrical ap-_
_pliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to_
_flop over or flicker—lines may appear on your screen._

_"Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge_
_to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside_
_controls of your set, then you could correct those symp-_
_toms, you could keep that set playing peifectly, and you_
_could prevent major breakdowns in exactly the same way_
_they were prevented in these manufacturers' tests._

_"If you do not have this knowledge . . . if you do not_
_make these adjustments, then your set trill weaken, you will_
_get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call a_
_repairman."_

The second goal-conclusion of the ad has now been reached.
At this stage of the copy, the reader now knows:

f. That his set is dependable enough to ayoid major breakdowns during by far the greatest majority of the time he will playit; and

2. That if he obtains the proper knowledge, he can correct
minor breakdowns himself, and help prevent the gradual formation of major breakdowns, by making a few simple adjustments
to the outside controls of his set.

Therefore, the stage has now- been set for the final conclusion—the pay-off conclusion—a conclusion with all the inevitable
logical force of a syllogism—that:

3. The owner should obtain this knowledge—make these
minor adjustments himself—and therefore save the money he is
paying today for sen-ice contracts, and save by far the greatest
majority of the money he is paying for repair bills.

Here is how this final conclusion is phrased by the copy:

_"It's as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for_
_his work—but for his knowledge. If you had that knowl-_
_edge yourself—then you would not have to pay him at all."_

**A Restatement of Our Basic Theory**

We have taken a great deal of space to analyze, in exact detail, one ad, and the structure of believabilitv that underlies the
effectiveness of its claims.

We have done this for two reasons:
