When I have my answer to question number 3, I know the key selling proposition I want to feature in the headline. Then it’s simply a matter of stating this benefit in a clear, compelling, interesting fashion, in a way that will make the reader take notice and want to know more about the product.
 Sometimes I’ll use a how-to headline. Sometimes I’ll use a question or a reason-why format. Other times I do something that doesn’t fit any of these categories. The point is, I don’t try to force-fit the selling proposition into a formula. I start with a sales message and write headlines that do the best job of illuminating this message.
 I usually write six to eight headlines out of which a winner or two emerges. Other copywriters I know write dozens of headlines for a single ad. If writing a lot of headlines works best for you, fine. You can always use some of the strongest discarded headlines as subheads or sentences in your body copy.
 When writing a new ad for an existing product, I go through the file of previous ads to see what sales points were covered in those ads. Often, the sales message for my headline will be buried in the body copy of one of the existing ads.

-----

### Sometimes when I am unable to produce a lively headline, I make a list of words that relate to the product. I then mix and match the words from this list to form different headlines.
 For instance, a client asked me to write an ad on a new type of dental splint used to keep loose teeth in place. The old-type splints were made of stiff strips of metal; the new splint was made of braided wire that could more easily twist to fit the patient’s teeth.
 My word list looked something like this:

Twist Easy

Splint Technology

Teeth Invented

New Revolutionary

Developed Contour

Dental Bend

Braided Dentist

Wire Introducing

Steel Flexible

Fit Loose

### Mixing and matching words from this list produced half a dozen good headlines. The one I liked best was “Introducing a New Twist in Splint Technology.” The client liked it and used it in a successful ad.
 If you cannot come up with a headline, don’t let it result in writer’s block. Put it aside and begin to write the body copy. As you write the copy and go over your notes, ideas for headlines will pop into your head. Write them down as they come, and go back to them later. Much of this material will be inadequate, but the perfect headline might just be produced this way.

 A FINAL WORD ON HEADLINES

-----

### The headline is the part of the ad that gets attention. And getting attention is the first step in persuading your reader to buy your product.
 Showmanship, clever phrases, and ballyhoo do not, by themselves, make for a good headline. Creating headlines that are wonderfully clever is worthwhile only if the cleverness enhances the selling message and makes it more memorable. Unfortunately, many copywriters engage in creativity for creativity’s sake, and the result is cleverness that obscures the selling message.
 If you have to choose between being clever and obscure or simple and straightforward, I advise you to be simple and straightforward. You won’t win any advertising awards. But at least you’ll sell some merchandise.
 Jim Alexander, president of Alexander Marketing Services, also believes that headlines should sell. Here are a few of Jim’s thoughts on the subject:

We believe in dramatizing a product’s selling message with flair and excitement. Those are
important ingredients of good salesmanship in print. But simple statements and plain-Jane
graphics often make powerful ads.

For example, the headline “Handling Sulfuric Acid” might sound dull or uncreative to you.
To a chemical engineer who’s forever battling costly corrosion, that simple headline implies
volumes. And makes him want to read every word of the problem-solving copy that follows.

So before we let our clients pronounce an ad dull, we first ask them, “Dull to whom?” Dull
to you, the advertiser? Or dull to the reader, our potential customer? It’s easy to forget that the
real purpose of an ad is to communicate ideas and information about a product. Too many ads
are approved because of their entertainment value. That’s a waste of money.

### Later in the book, we look at how to write effective headlines for specific digital media including Web sites, e-mail marketing campaigns, and online ads (see chapters 11, 13, and 14).

## WRITING TO COMMUNICATE

### An article published in the Harvard Business Review described experiments designed to measure advertising effectiveness. The experiments showed, not surprisingly, that advertising is most effective when it is easy to understand. In other words, you sell more merchandise when you write clear copy.
 In theory, it sounds easy. Advertising deals, for the most part, with simple subjects—clothing, soda, beer, soap, CDs. But in practice, many advertisements don’t communicate as effectively as they could. Here’s an example from an ad that appeared in Modern Bride magazine:

**THEY LOVED MY DRESS ON QUIRIUS 3**
They smiled politely when Harry showed them our late model telestar, but when he opened the
hood of our auto-drive one of their children burst into a shrill laugh and was boxed on his
starfish-shaped ears.…

### The students in my copywriting seminars call this one “What did she say?” This is an example of a “borrowed interest” ad: The writer didn’t have faith in her ability to make the product interesting, so she hid behind a made-up scenario involving a conversation on the planet Quirius 3. The result? Maximum confusion and minimum communication.
 “Borrowed interest” is a major cause of confusing copy. There are others: lengthy sentences, clichés, big words, not getting to the point, a lack of specifics, technical jargon, and poor organization, to name a few.
 The following tips will help you write copy that gets its message across to the reader.

### 11 TIPS FOR WRITING CLEAR COPY

 1. Put the Reader First

 In his pamphlet “Tips to Put Power in Your Business Writing,” consultant Chuck Custer advises executives to think about their readers when they write a business letter or memo.
 “Start writing to people,” says Custer. “It’s okay that you don’t know your reader! Picture someone you do know who’s like your reader. Then write to him.”
 Think of the reader. Ask yourself: Will the reader understand what I have written? Does he know the special terminology I have used? Does my copy tell her something important or new or useful? If I were the reader, would this copy persuade me to buy the product?
 One technique to help you write for the reader is to address the reader directly as “you” in the copy, just as I am writing to you in this book. Copywriters call this the “you-orientation.” Flip through a magazine, and you’ll see that 90 percent of the ads contain the word you in the body copy.
 On here, the column at left shows examples of copy written without regard to the reader’s interests. The right gives revisions that make the copy more you-oriented.

### 2. Carefully Organize Your Selling Points

 The managers at a bank in the Midwest wanted to know if people read booklets mailed by the bank. So they included an extra paragraph in a booklet mailed to a hundred customers. This extra paragraph, buried in forty-five hundred words of technical information, offered a free ten-dollar bill to anyone who asked for it.
 So how many bank customers requested the free money? None. Obviously, the organization of your material affects how people read it. If the bank had put “FREE $10!” on the brochure cover and on the outside of the mailing envelope, many customers would have responded to the offer.
 When you write your copy, you must carefully organize the points you want to make. In an ad, you might have one primary sales message (“This car gets good mileage”) and several secondary messages (“roomy interior,” “low price,” “$500 rebate”).
 The headline states the main selling proposition, and the first few paragraphs expand on it. Secondary points are covered later in the body copy. If this copy is lengthy, each secondary point may get a separate heading or number.
 The organization of your selling points depends on their relative importance, the amount of information you give the reader, and the type of copy you are writing (letter, ad, commercial, blog post, or news story).
 Terry C. Smith, a former communications manager with Westinghouse, has a rule for organizing sales points in speeches and presentations. His rule is: “Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Tell them. And then, tell them what you told them.” The speechwriter first gives an overview of the presentation, covers the important points in sequence, and then gives a brief summary of these points. Listeners, unlike readers, cannot refer to a printed page to remind them of what was said, and these overviews and summaries help your audience learn and remember.
 Burton Pincus, a freelance copywriter, developed a unique organizational pattern for the sales letters he writes. Pincus begins with a headline that conveys a promise, shows how the promise is fulfilled, and

### gives proof that the product is everything the copy says it is. Then he tells the reader how to order the product and explains why the cost of the product is insignificant compared to its value.
 Before you create an ad or landing page, write down your sales points. Organize them in a logical, persuasive, clear fashion. And present them in this order when you write your copy.

 3. Break the Writing into Short Sections

 If the content of your ad can be organized as a series of sales points, you can cover each point in a separate section of copy. This isn’t necessary in short ads of 150 or fewer words. But as length increases, copy becomes more difficult to read. Breaking the text into several short sections makes reading easier.
 What’s the best way to divide the text into sections? If you have a series of sections where one point follows logically from the previous point, or where the sales points are listed in order of importance, use numbers.
 If there is no particular order of importance or logical sequence among the sales points, use graphic devices such as bullets, asterisks, or dashes to set off each new section. If you have a lot of copy under each section, use subheads (as I’ve done in this book).
 Paragraphs should also be kept short. Long, unbroken chunks of type intimidate readers. A page filled with a solid column of tiny type says, “This is going to be tough to read!”
 When you edit your copy, use subheads to separate major sections. Leave space between paragraphs. And break long paragraphs into short paragraphs. A paragraph of five sentences can usually be broken into two or three shorter paragraphs by finding places where a new thought or idea is introduced and beginning the new paragraph with that thought.

 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE 4 S FORMULA

Here are 4 simple writing principles that can do more than any other writing techniques to
make your copy clear and easy to read:

Short words.

-----

Short sentences.
Short paragraphs.
Short sections.

### 4. Use Short Sentences

 Short sentences are easier to read than long sentences. All professional writers—newspaper reporters, publicists, magazine writers, copywriters— are taught to write in crisp, short, snappy sentences.
 Long sentences tire and puzzle your readers. By the time they have gotten to the end of a lengthy sentence, they don’t remember what was at the beginning.
 D. H. Menzel, coauthor of Writing a Technical Paper, conducted a survey to find the best length for sentences in technical papers. He found that sentences became difficult to understand beyond a length of about 34 words. And the consumer has far less patience with wordiness and run-on sentences than does the scientist studying an important report.
 Rudolf Flesch, best known for his classic books Why Johnny Can’t Read and The Art of Plain Talk, said the best average sentence length for business writing is 14 to 16 words. Twenty to 25 words is passable, he added, but above 40 words, the writing becomes unreadable.
 Because ad writers place a premium on clarity, their sentences are even shorter than Flesch’s recommended: 14- to 16-word average.
 Now, let’s take a look at how you can reduce sentence length. First, you should break large sentences into two or more separate sentences whenever possible.

### Another method of breaking up a long sentence is to use punctuation to divide it into two parts.

One purpose is to enable you to recognize and
acknowledge the importance of people who
handle people from the company president
right down to the newest foreman.

The outcome is presentations that don’t do their
job and make others wonder whether you’re
doing yours.

### Copy becomes dull when all sentences are the same length. To make your writing flow, vary sentence length. By writing an occasional short sentence or sentence fragment, you can reduce the average sentence length of your copy to an acceptable length even if you frequently use lengthy sentences.

### Train yourself to write in crisp, short sentences. When you have finished a thought, stop. Start the next sentence with a new thought. When you edit, your cursor should automatically seek out places where a long string of words can be broken in two.

 5. Use Small, Simple Words

 Simple words communicate more effectively than big words. People use big words to impress others, but they rarely do. More often, big words annoy and distract the reader from what the writer is trying to say.

-----

### Yet big words persist, because using pompous language makes the reader or speaker feel important. Some recent examples of big words in action:
 In his sermon, a Unitarian minister says: “If I were God, my goal would be to maximize goodness, not to eternalize evil.”
 In a cartoon appearing in Defense News, a manager tells his staff: “I want you to focalize on your optionalizations, prioritize your parametrics, budgetize your expendables, and then schedualize your throughput.” Fred Danzig, writing in Advertising Age, asks why an E. F. Hutton executive says the market might “whipsaw back and forth” when he could have said it “will go up and down.”
 In advertising copy, you are trying to communicate with people, not impress them or boost your own ego. Avoid pompous words and fancy phrases. Cecil Hoge, the mail-order expert, says the words in your copy should be “like the windows in a storefront. The reader should be able to see right through them and see the product.”
