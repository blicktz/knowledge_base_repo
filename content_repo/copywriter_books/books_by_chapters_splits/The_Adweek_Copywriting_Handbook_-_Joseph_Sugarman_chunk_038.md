##### You have learned what it takes to be a great copywriter in Section One. You have learned in Section Two what works and why it works.
 In the first two sections of this book I have taught you most of the copywriting techniques I taught my seminar participants. You have learned techniques that took me many years to develop. You have learned concepts that I didn’t discover and personally use until well into my career. And most importantly, you have learned from my failures—an education that has cost me dearly but that you do not have to experience on your own. Finally, you did not have to pay $3,000 to get this knowledge as my seminar participants did.
 In Section Three we take all that you have learned and crystallize it into practical knowledge by examining many of the ads that were used as examples in our seminar. This is an important section, for here you see how all the pieces you have learned fit together. We also examine a few ads where the pieces didn’t quite fit together and we show you how they could have been done more effectively.
 In addition to examining a few ads from beginning to end, I also reproduce a few of the JS&A ads that show my principles in action.
 If you’ve had a problem understanding any of the principles, this is where you’ll get greater understanding and clarity. It was during this part of my seminar when participants would often comment, “Now I feel I can do a great ad myself.” And they often did.

# Preview

##### You’ve learned the principles and theory of copywriting and you’ve had a chance to see how it all works through my many personal experiences. Now it’s time to show you how these principles actually work in some of the complete ad examples that follow. This is the fine-tuning you’ll need to perfect your newly learned skills.
 During the course of my seminar I showed slides of various ads to illustrate the theories I was presenting. In my first seminars, the ads were mine and those of my competitors—the very companies that were copying my format. But as the course continued and more and more of my students succeeded with the knowledge I gave them, many of the ads I showed at subsequent seminars were created by my former students themselves.
 Finally, I used illustrations to show the best and the worst of mail order advertising and even non-mail-order advertising. By the end of the course, not only were my students able to tell me what was wrong with each of the ads that I showed but they were producing great advertising copy and even helping their fellow seminar participants in crafting and improving their advertisements.
 Hundreds of ads were presented during the seminar—all on slides. Several of the classic examples were duplicated and passed around. For the book I have selected only a few of the best ads to illustrate the principles I taught—examples that will solidify everything you’ve learned so far and add even more to your insights and copywriting skills.
 “But hey,” you might wonder. “What about those famous JS&A mail order ads that were the hallmark of mail order advertising in the 1970s and 1980s? Don’t they point out some really important principles and aren’t they good examples of the best in copywriting?”
 Shucks. Well, if you insist. Okay, I’ll include some of those as well. Starting in Chapter 28 are some of the JS&A ads that really drive home various points. Not only are they examples of successful copywriting but they are entertaining as well. The fact that I wrote them might come through in my enthusiasm and commentary, so please bear with me. Deep down, I’m really a modest kinda guy.

##### If your future is in TV marketing, these examples will help you understand marketing in that medium as well. For as you have already learned, my copywriting and marketing principles can be applied to any form of advertising communication.
 But now it’s time to solidify everything you’ve learned in Sections One and Two with some classic ad examples to prove many of my points.

# Chapter 23

 The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches

##### This is a classic example of a mail order ad. There are some people who spend their entire career creating hundreds of ads, and then there is Joe Karbo.

 This classic mail order ad sold 3 million books.

 Joe Karbo wrote only a few ads. He wrote the one I’ve featured here right off the top of his head. There was practically no editing involved. As he later claimed at my seminar, “I just sat down and wrote the ad in a matter of

##### a few minutes and then looked back at it, made a few changes, and that was it.”
 The ad Joe created ran in hundreds of magazines for many years. In later years, it was rewritten to reflect more current mail order approaches, but it was basically the same ad. And it has become a classic.
 First, a little background on Joe. Joe Karbo was discharged from the Army in 1945, and at age 20 with a wife and child, no money and only a high school education, he started his business career. Karbo was modestly successful in the scrap paper business and then he moved on to acting, followed by advertising, radio and finally television.
 Karbo had his own TV show in Hollywood and, along with his wife Betty, was on the air from midnight to 8 A.M. Since sponsors were hard to come by, Karbo started a direct mail business and sold a variety of products on his show. Joe soon mastered direct response advertising and flourished.
 In 1973 Joe formalized his personal philosophies in a book called The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches in which he shared his beliefs and principles both on success and on direct response advertising. The ad shown is the one he wrote to market his book.
 Let’s examine the ad, as it will confirm many of the things you have already learned. We’ll start at the headline and systematically work our way through the entire ad.
 Headline: The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches Subheadline: ‘Most People Are Too Busy Earning a Living to Make Any Money’ The headline is provocative. At the time, this was a novel approach and a novel headline. Prior to this, ads such as this were found only in the group of magazines classified as “income opportunity.” Magazines such as Income Opportunity, Success and Entrepreneur had dozens of offers such as the one Karbo was making, but the category of advertising hadn’t yet made it into the mainstream. Joe’s was one of the first to break through. The headline grabbed you and got you to read the subheadline. And the subheadline got you into the copy.
 Let’s start with the copy and see if he is creating that slippery slide. First, notice how he gets you into the copy by the use of short sentences. Notice how short the first sentence is and how short all his sentences are. Also notice how he is identifying with his prospect—the guy or gal who is

##### serious about succeeding and wants a good life but finds himself or herself working hard and not getting anywhere. The copy starts out as follows:
 I used to work hard. The 18-hour days. The 7-day weeks. But I didn’t start making big money until I did less—a lot less. The ad continues and you’re compelled to read further.
 For example, this ad took about 2 hours to write. With a little luck, it should earn me 50, maybe a hundred thousand dollars. Remember, this was written in 1973 and the equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars today might be close to a half-million dollars. Once again, Karbo is building curiosity. What is he offering? Why will this ad earn him so much money? You’ve got to read further. Notice also that there are no big words, no complicated long sentences. He’s leading his reader into the copy slowly and easily, building curiosity as he goes. He tells a story as he progresses.
 What’s more, I’m going to ask you to send me 10 dollars for something that’ll cost me no more than 50 cents. And I’ll try to make it so irresistible that you’d be a darned fool not to do it. Here Karbo is establishing trust with his readers. His honesty is almost disarming. He tells you up front that he has something he wants to sell you for 10 dollars that costs him only 50 cents. He’s also building curiosity. He’s using basic and simple statements, and the copy has you slowly slipping down his slippery slide right to the next paragraph. Then note how he justifies the purchase.
 After all, why should you care if I make $9.50 profit if I can show you how to make a lot more? What if I’m so sure that you will make money my Lazy Man’s Way that I’ll make you the world’s most unusual guarantee? And here it is: I won’t even cash your check or money order for 31 days after I’ve sent you my material. That’ll give you plenty of time to get it, look it over, try it out. Note the flow of the copy. Again he builds on the reader’s curiosity, justifying the $10 purchase even if he hasn’t yet told you about the offer. Now you are really curious. He wasn’t going to cash the check for 31 days, which at the time was a novel approach. It was what I call a “satisfaction

##### conviction” because your reaction might have been, “Boy, a lot of people are going to rip him off. They’re going to get his book, read it and then return it and get their uncashed check back in the mail.” You already know how important a good satisfaction conviction can be from Chapter 19, and Karbo uses it here, early in his copy. He also shows a degree of enthusiasm and confidence in his concept that raises your curiosity even more. He continues.
 If you don’t agree that it’s worth at least a hundred times what you invested, send it back. Your uncashed check or money order will be put in the return mail. The only reason I won’t send it to you and bill you or send it C.O.D. is because both these methods involve more time and money. And I’m already going to give you the biggest bargain of your life. Because I’m going to tell you what it took me 11 years to perfect: How to make money the Lazy Man’s Way. Again, Karbo is justifying the purchase without even telling you what it is. And he is justifying why accepting payment by check is the only way he’ll sell it to you, giving you an economic basis for his decision. The curiosity builds. But instead of telling you about his offer, he now changes direction completely to establish credibility for his offer by presenting himself as an example of how successfully this program has worked.
 O.K.—now I have to brag a little. I don’t mind it. And it’s necessary— to prove that sending me ten dollars...which I’ll keep “in escrow” until you’re satisfied...is the smartest thing you ever did. I live in a home that’s worth $100,000. I know it is because I turned down an offer for that much. My mortgage is less than half that, and the only reason I haven’t paid it off is because my Tax Accountant says I’d be an idiot. My “office,” about a mile and a half from my home, is right on the beach. My view is so breathtaking that most people comment that they don’t see how I get any work done. But I do enough. About 6 hours a day, 8 or 9 months a year. The rest of the time we spend at our mountain “cabin.” I paid $30,000 for it—cash. I have 2 boats and a Cadillac. All paid for.

##### We have stocks, bonds, investments, cash in the bank. But the most important thing I have is priceless: time with my family. And I’ll show you just how I did it—the Lazy Man’s Way—a secret I’ve shared with just a few friends ’til now. Here in these last paragraphs he is obviously whetting your appetite and telling you what the results of his system produced for him. But there is another very subtle thing he has done as well. He is trying to personally identify with his audience. He doesn’t talk about driving around in a Rolls- Royce but rather a Cadillac. He talks about having a mortgage, which most of his readers, if they own their own homes, probably have. He keeps his wealth to a modest level, for if it was too far out of the reach of his readers, they would not be able to relate to Karbo.
 He is also selling the sizzle, not the steak. He is relating a number of things, most of which sound pretty inviting to you and represent the results of buying his system—the many material things in life that most of his readers dream of having. He is identifying with his prospects. And then at the end of the list, he talks about the most priceless thing his system has created, “time with my family.” All of this resonates with the reader, who by now can’t stop reading and might be saying, “What does this guy have to offer that can make it possible for me to live the life of Joe Karbo?” So you read on. You read the secret that he’s shared with only a few friends.
 In the next paragraph you find one of the truly important highlights of his ad copy. He is very subtly trying to expand the appeal of his offer to the broadest possible segment of the market. Think about it. If he said that one person made millions, you might not identify with what he is saying if you honestly didn’t believe that you could earn millions. But you might relate to the little old lady who is now able to travel wherever she wants or the widow who is earning $25,000 extra a year. Or the guy who doesn’t have much of an education.
 As you read the following copy, see how he appeals to the mass market— probably the single reason that this ad had such widespread appeal and was not confined to just the income opportunity area. Also see where he again builds on his integrity when he talks about almost declaring bankruptcy— thus relating to many in his audience who may also be facing financial difficulty.
 It doesn’t require “education.” I’m a high school graduate.

-----

##### It doesn’t require “capital.” When I started out, I was so deep in debt that a lawyer friend advised bankruptcy as the only way out. He was wrong. We paid off our debts and, outside of the mortgage, don’t owe a cent to any man. It doesn’t require “luck.” I’ve had more than my share, but I’m not promising you that you’ll make as much money as I have. And you may do better: I personally know one man who used these principles, worked hard, and made 11 million dollars in 8 years. But money isn’t everything. It doesn’t require “talent.” Just enough brains to know what to look for. And I’ll tell you that. It doesn’t require “youth.” One woman I worked with is over 70. She’s travelled the world over, making all the money she needs, doing only what I taught her. It doesn’t require “experience.” A widow in Chicago has been averaging $25,000 a year for the past 5 years, using my methods. These last sentences are very important. In short, he appealed to a very broad segment of the opportunity market and even went beyond it to people who might not be looking for an opportunity but would find this message compelling. And Karbo comes across as being incredibly honest. Remember, he told you the cost of what he was going to send you and he seems to be very honest throughout his ad, even to the point of being disarming. Remember, honesty is a powerful psychological selling tool.
 Now comes the closing pitch, with complete and total enthusiasm for his concept and his book. Once again, Karbo realizes that many of his readers have jobs and at this point in the copy are wondering if they will have to give them up to learn what he has to offer. He uses a little sage wisdom given to him by a wise man he met. And then he wraps up the entire ad with a question that builds the final level of curiosity to a point that compels you to respond in order to find out what this man has to offer.
 What does it require? Belief. Enough to take a chance. Enough to absorb what I’ll send you. Enough to put the principles into action. If you do just that—nothing more, nothing less—the results will be hard to believe. Remember—I guarantee it.
