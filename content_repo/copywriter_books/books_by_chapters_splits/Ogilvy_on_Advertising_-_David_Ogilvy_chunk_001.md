 Overture

##### ‘Let us march against Philip’

###### do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don’t

## I

###### want you to tell me that you �nd it ‘creative.’ I want you to �nd it so interesting that you buy the product. When Aeschines spoke, they said, ‘How well he speaks.’ But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, ‘Let us march against Philip.’
 In my Confessions of an Advertising Man, published in 1963, I told the story of how Ogilvy & Mather came into existence, and set forth the principles on which our early success had been based. What was then little more than a creative boutique in New York has since become one of the four biggest advertising agencies in the world, with 140 o�ces in 40 countries. Our principles seem to work.
 But I am now so old that a French magazine lists me as the only survivor among a group of men who, they aver, contributed to the Industrial Revolution – alongside Adam Smith, Edison, Karl Marx, Rockefeller, Ford and Keynes. Does old age disqualify me from writing about advertising in today’s world? Or could it be that perspective helps a man to separate the eternal verities of advertising from its passing fads?
 When I set up shop on Madison Avenue in 1949, I assumed that advertising would undergo several major changes before I retired. So far, there has been only one change that can be called major: television has emerged as the most potent medium for selling most products.

-----

###### Yes, there have been other changes and I shall describe them, but their signi�cance has been exaggerated by pundits in search of trendy labels. For example, the concept of brand images, which I popularized in 1953, was not really new; Claude Hopkins had described it 20 years before. The so-called Creative Revolution, usually ascribed to Bill Bernbach and myself in the �fties, could equally well have been ascribed to N. W. Ayer and Young & Rubicam in the thirties.
 Meanwhile, most of the advertising techniques which worked when I wrote Confessions of an Advertising Man still work today. Consumers still buy products whose advertising promises them value for money, beauty, nutrition, relief from su�ering, social status and so on. All over the world.
 In saying this, I run the risk of being denounced by the idiots who hold that any advertising technique which has been in use for more than two years is ipso facto obsolete. They excoriate slice-of-life commercials, demonstrations and talking heads, turning a blind eye to the fact that these techniques still make the cash register ring. If they have read Horace, they will say that I am di�cilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti. Se puero, castigator, censorque minorum.[1] So what? There have always been noisy lunatics on the fringes of the advertising business. Their stock-in-trade includes ethnic humor, eccentric art direction, contempt for research, and their self- proclaimed genius. They are seldom found out, because they gravitate to the kind of clients who, bamboozled by their rhetoric, do not hold them responsible for sales results. Their campaigns �nd favor at cocktail parties in New York, San Francisco and London but are taken less seriously in Chicago. In the days when I specialized in posh campaigns for The New Yorker, I was the hero of this coterie, but when I graduated to advertising in mass media and wrote a book which extolled the value of research, I became its devil. I comfort myself with the re�ection that I have sold more merchandise than all of them put together.
 I am sometimes attacked for imposing ‘rules.’ Nothing could be further from the truth. I hate rules. All I do is report on how consumers react to di�erent stimuli. I may say to a copywriter,

-----

###### ‘Research shows that commercials with celebrities are below average in persuading people to buy products. Are you sure you want to use a celebrity?’ Call that a rule? Or I may say to an art director, ‘Research suggests that if you set the copy in black type on a white background, more people will read it than if you set it in white type on a black background.’ A hint, perhaps, but scarcely a rule.
 In 18th-century England, a family of obstetricians built a huge practice by delivering babies with a lower rate of infant and maternal mortality than their competitors. They had a secret – and guarded it jealously, until an inquisitive medical student climbed onto the roof of their delivering room, looked through the skylight and saw the forceps they had invented. The secret was out, to the bene�t of all obstetricians and their patients. Today’s obstetricians do not keep their discoveries secret, they publish them. I am grateful to my partners for allowing me to publish mine. But I should add that the occasional opinions expressed in this book do not necessarily re�ect the collegial opinions of the agency which employs me.
 This is not a book for readers who think they already know all there is to be known about advertising. It is for young hopefuls – and veterans who are still in search of ways to improve their batting average at the cash register.
 I write only about aspects of advertising I know from my own experience. That is why this book contains nothing about media, cable television or advertising in Japan.
 If you think it is a lousy book, you should have seen it before my partner Joel Raphaelson did his best to de-louse it. Bless you, Joel.

 How to produce advertising that sells

###### retend you started work this morning in my agency, and that you have dropped by my o�ce to ask for advice. I will start with

## P

###### some generalities about how to go about your work. In later chapters I will give you more speci�c advice on producing advertisements for magazines, newspapers, television and radio. I ask you to forgive me for oversimplifying some complicated subjects, and for the dogmatism of my style – the dogmatism of brevity. We are both in a hurry.
 The �rst thing I have to say is that you may not realize the magnitude of di�erence between one advertisement and another. Says John Caples, the doyen of direct response copywriters:

 ‘I have seen one advertisement actually sell not twice as much, not three times as much, but 19½ times as much as another. Both advertisements occupied the same space. Both were run in the same publication. Both had photographic illustrations. Both had carefully written copy. The di�erence was that one used the right appeal and the other used the wrong appeal.’[1]

 The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product. I am told that George Hay Brown, at one time head of marketing research at Ford, inserted advertisements in every other copy of the Reader’s Digest. At the end of the year, the people who had not been exposed to the advertising had bought more Fords than those who had.

-----

###### In another survey it was found that consumption of a certain brand of beer was lower among people who remembered its advertising than those who did not. The brewer had spent millions of dollars on advertising which un-sold his beer.
 I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests. Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree. It doesn’t.

-----

_Before I wrote this – the most famous of all automobile ads – I did my homework. It ran only in two newspapers and two_
_magazines, at a cost of $25,000. The following year, Ford based their multi-million dollar campaign on the claim that their_

_car was even quieter than a Rolls._

###### Do your homework You don’t stand a tinker’s chance of producing successful advertising unless you start by doing your homework. I have always found this extremely tedious, but there is no substitute for it.
 First, study the product you are going to advertise. The more you know about it, the more likely you are to come up with a big idea

-----

###### for selling it. When I got the Rolls-Royce account, I spent three weeks reading about the car and came across a statement that ‘at sixty miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock.’ This became the headline, and it was followed by 607 words of factual copy.
 Later, when I got the Mercedes account, I sent a team to the Daimler-Benz headquarters in Stuttgart. They spent three weeks taping interviews with the engineers. From this came a campaign of long, factual advertisements which increased Mercedes sales in the United States from 10,000 cars a year to 40,000.
 When I was asked to do the advertising for Good Luck margarine, I was under the impression that margarine was made from coal. But ten days’ reading enabled me to write a factual advertisement which worked.
 Same thing with Shell gasoline. A brie�ng from the client revealed something which came as a surprise to me; that gasoline has several ingredients, including Platformate, which increases mileage. The resulting campaign helped to reverse a seven-year decline in Shell’s share-of-market.

-----

_I resigned the Rolls-Royce account when they sent �ve hundred defective cars to the United States. Two years later we took_

_Mercedes, and sent a team to interview their engineers in Stuttgart. From this sprang a campaign of long factual_

_advertisements which increased sales from 10,000 cars a year to 40,000._

-----

_When I got a margarine account, I was under the impression that margarine was made from coal. Ten days reading the_

_literature taught me otherwise._

###### If you are too lazy to do this kind of homework, you may occasionally luck into a successful campaign, but you will run the risk of skidding about on what my brother Francis called ‘the slippery surface of irrelevant brilliance.’
 Your next chore is to �nd out what kind of advertising your competitors have been doing for similar products, and with what success. This will give you your bearings.
 Now comes research among consumers. Find out how they think about your kind of product, what language they use when they discuss the subject, what attributes are important to them, and what promise would be most likely to make them buy your brand.

-----

###### If you cannot a�ord the services of professionals to do this research, do it yourself. Informal conversations with half-a-dozen housewives can sometimes help a copywriter more than formal surveys in which he does not participate.

 Positioning Now consider how you want to ‘position’ your product. This curious verb is in great favor among marketing experts, but no two of them agree what it means. My own de�nition is ‘what the product does, and who it is for.’ I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin. This is still working 25 years later.

_I positioned Dove as a toilet bar for women with dry skin, and used a promise which had won in test: ‘Dove creams your skin_

_while you bathe.’_

-----

###### In Norway, the SAAB car had no measurable pro�le. We positioned it as a car for winter. Three years later it was voted the best car for Norwegian winters.
 To advertise a car that looked like an orthopedic boot would have defeated me. But Bill Bernbach and his merry men positioned Volkswagen as a protest against the vulgarity of Detroit cars in those days, thereby making the Beetle a cult among those Americans who eschew conspicuous consumption.

_Robert Townsend, the eccentric head of Avis, asked me to do his advertising. When con�ict with another client forced me to_

_refuse, Doyle Dane Bernbach created one of the most powerful campaigns in the history of advertising. ‘When you’re only_

_Number 2, you try harder. Or else.’ This diabolical positioning made life miserable for Hertz, who was Number 1._

_Doyle Dane Bernbach positioned Volkswagen as a protest against Detroit, thereby making the Beetle a cult among non-_
_conformists. The copywriter was Julian Koenig, the art director Helmut Krone. Sales of the car went up to 500,000 cars a_

_year._

###### Brand image You now have to decide what ‘image’ you want for your brand. Image means personality. Products, like people, have personalities, and they can make or break them in the market place. The personality of a product is an amalgam of many things – its name,

-----

###### its packaging, its price, the style of its advertising, and, above all, the nature of the product itself.

_An essay in the art of image-building. For 18 years I used the face of my client Commander Whitehead as the symbol of his_

_own product. It worked to beat the band on a peppercorn budget._

###### Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image. It follows that your advertising should consistently project the same image, year after year. This is di�cult to achieve, because there are always forces at work to change the advertising – like a new agency, or a new Marketing Director who wants to make his mark.
 It pays to give most products an image of quality – a First Class ticket. This is particularly true of products whose brand-name is visible to your friends, like beer, cigarettes and automobiles: products you ‘wear.’ If your advertising looks cheap or shoddy, it will rub o� on your product. Who wants to be seen using shoddy products?
 Take whiskey. Why do some people chose Jack Daniel’s, while others choose Grand Dad or Taylor? Have they tried all three and compared the taste? Don’t make me laugh. The reality is that these three brands have di�erent images which appeal to di�erent kinds of

-----

###### people. It isn’t the whiskey they choose, it’s the image. The brand image is 90 per cent of what the distiller has to sell.
 Researchers at the Department of Psychology at the University of California gave distilled water to students. They told some of them that it was distilled water, and asked them to describe its taste. Most said it had no taste of any kind. They told the other students that the distilled water came out of the tap. Most of them said it tasted horrible. The mere mention of tap conjured up an image of chlorine.
 Give people a taste of Old Crow, and tell them it’s Old Crow. Then give them another taste of Old Crow, but tell them it’s Jack Daniel’s. Ask them which they prefer. They’ll think the two drinks are quite di�erent. They are tasting images.

-----

_When you choose a brand of whiskey you are choosing an image. Jack Daniel’s advertisements project an image of homespun_

_honesty and thereby persuade you that Jack Daniel’s is worth its premium price._

###### I have always been hypnotized by Jack Daniel’s. The label and the advertising convey an image of homespun honesty, and the high price makes me assume that Jack Daniel’s must be superior.
 Writing advertising for any kind of liquor is an extremely subtle art. I once tried using rational facts to argue the consumer into choosing a brand of whiskey. It didn’t work. You don’t catch Coca Cola advertising that Coke contains 50 per cent more cola berries.

-----

_Leo Burnett’s campaign for Marlboro projects an image which has made it the biggest-selling cigarette in the world. It has_

_been running, almost without change, for 25 years._

###### Next time an apostle of hard-sell questions the importance of brand images, ask him how Marlboro climbed from obscurity to become the biggest-selling cigarette in the world. Leo Burnett’s cowboy campaign, started 25 years ago and continued to this day, has given the brand an image which appeals to smokers all over the world.

 What’s the big idea?
