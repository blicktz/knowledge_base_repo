**WOULD YOU PAY $1,000 TO SAVE $5,500?**
Last year, a local flower shop decided to hire an accountant to do their income tax returns.
They worried about the seemingly high fee, but realized they didn’t have the time—or the
expertise—to do it themselves.

You can imagine how delighted they were when they hired an accountant who showed them
how they could pay thousands of dollars less in income tax than they originally thought they
would owe.

I am their accountant, and I’d like to tell you how the flower shop—and dozens of other
firms whose taxes I prepare—have saved $2,000 … $3,500 … even $5,500 a year or more by
taking advantage of legitimate tax regulations, deductions, and shelters.

### This copy isn’t perfect. It needs some work. But it does get attention, highlights a major benefit (saving money), and shows that the service being advertised can satisfy the need.

 4. Prove Your Product Can Do What You Say It Can Do

 It isn’t enough to say you can satisfy readers’ needs—you’ve got to prove you can. You want the readers to risk their hard-earned money on your product or service. You want them to buy from or hire you instead of your competitors. How do you demonstrate your superiority over the competition? How do you get the readers to believe what you say?
 Here are a few proven techniques for convincing the readers that it’s to their advantage to do business with you:

 • Talk about the benefits of your product or service (use the features/benefits list as the source of your discussion). Give the readers reasons to buy by showing the benefits they’ll get when they own your product.

 • Use testimonials. In testimonials, others who have bought the product praise the product in their own words. This third-party endorsement is much more convincing than manufacturers praising their own product.

 • Compare your product to the competition’s. Show, benefit for benefit, how you are superior. But have documentation supporting your claim in

### case your copy is challenged.

 • If you have conducted studies to prove your product’s superiority, cite this evidence in the copy. Offer a free reprint of the study to interested readers. For dietary supplements, the proof is clinical studies—preferably randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials—published in peer- reviewed medical journals.

 • Show that your company is reliable and will be in business a long time. Talk about number of employees, size of distributor network, annual sales, number of years in business, growth rate.

 5. Ask for Action

 The last step in any piece of copy should always be a call for action. If the product is sold by mail, ask readers to mail in an order form, or go online to buy. If the product is sold retail, ask readers to clip the ad and bring it into the store.
 If your ad doesn’t sell the product directly, then find out the next step in the buying process and tell your readers about it. For example, you might offer a free brochure on the product, a demonstration, or a sample. At the very least, encourage the readers to look for the product in the future if they are not going to buy it today.
 Make it easy for the readers to take action. Include your company name, address, and phone number in every piece of copy you write.
 If you’re writing retail copy, include store hours and locations. If you’re writing copy for a hotel or tourist attraction, include easy-to- follow instructions on how to get there, along with a clearly drawn map of the area.
 If you want the readers to send in an order or write for a free brochure, include a handy coupon they can clip and mail.
 If you want the readers to call, highlight your toll-free number in large boldface type. And, if you take credit-card orders, be sure to say so and indicate which cards you accept.
 Put order forms in catalogs, reply cards in mailers, dealer lists in industrial sales literature, and response forms at the top of landing pages. Make it easy for your readers to respond.

-----

### Offer a Web response option, where the ad hyperlinks to an online form the prospects can use to request more information or place an order.
 And, if possible, give the readers an incentive for responding now: a price-off coupon, a time-limited sale, a discount to the first one thousand people who order the product. Don’t be afraid to try for immediate action and sales as well as long-range “image building.” Ask for the order, and ask for it right away.

 USE “FALSE LOGIC” TO MAKE THE FACTS SUPPORT YOUR SALES ARGUMENTS

 False logic, a term coined by master copywriter Mark Ford, is copy that, through skillful writing, manipulates (but does not lie about or misrepresent) existing facts. The objective: to help readers come to conclusions that these facts, presented without the twists of the copywriter’s pen, might not otherwise support.
 A catalog for Harry & David says of its pears, “Not one person in 1,000 has ever tasted them.” The statistic, as presented by the catalog writer, makes the product sound rare and exclusive—and that’s how the average reader interprets it, just as the copywriter intended.
 But a logician analyzing this statement might say that it indicates that the pears are not very popular—almost no one buys them.
 It’s possible to argue that some false logic borders on deception, but the marketer has to make that call for himself. A metals broker advertised “95 percent of orders shipped from stock” to indicate ready availability. But he ran his business out of an office and had a very small warehouse. How could he claim he shipped from stock?
 “We do ship 95 percent of orders from stock,” the marketer explains. “But not from our stock—from the metal supplier’s stock. We are just a broker. But we do not advertise that, since being a broker is perceived as a negative.”
 A promotion selling a stock market newsletter to consumers compares the $99 subscription price to the $2,000 the editor would charge if he were

### managing your money for you, based on a 2 percent fee and a minimum investment of $100,000.
 The copy implies that the subscriber is getting Mr. Editor to give him $2,000 worth of money management services for $99, and quickly glosses over the fact that the newsletter is not precisely the same as a managed account.
 A similar example is the promotion done by my friend Don Hauptman for American Speaker, a loose-leaf service for executives on how to give good speeches. In his promotion, he points out that this product can help you with your speeches all year long (it has periodic supplements), in contrast to the $5,000 it costs to have a professional speechwriter write just one speech. Of course, American Speaker is not actually writing your speech for you.
 There is an ongoing debate over whether people buy for emotional or for logical reasons, but most successful marketers know that the former is more dominant as a buying motive than the latter. It is commonly said, “People buy based on emotion, then rationalize the purchase decision with logic.”
 “Only five percent of our thought processes are fully conscious,” writes Dan Hill, president of Sensory Logic. “There’s neurological evidence that we make an emotional response—in effect, a decision—about a product or service within three seconds. So businesses need to make an emotional connection with consumers.”
 Because buying decisions are based on strong feelings and ingrained beliefs, marketers should provide justification and support for what the consumer already wants to do. Therefore, as long as the logical argument seems credible and sensible, your readers will accept it. They do not probe into it as scientifically or deeply as would, say, Ralph Nader, Michael Moore, or an investigative reporter for Consumer Reports or the LA Times.
 Some critics view direct marketing as a step below general marketing in respectability, ethics, and honesty. And perhaps they might reason that my advocating the use of false logic adds fuel to their argument. But in fact false logic is not just the purview of direct marketers: general marketers use it routinely, some with great success.

### McDonald’s advertises “billions sold”[1] to promote its hamburgers— leading customers to the false conclusion that just because something is popular, it is necessarily good. Publishers use similar logic when they trumpet a book as “a New York Times best seller.”
 Is all this unethical? You can draw your own conclusion, but in my opinion, no.
 Copywriters, like lawyers, are advocates for the client (or employer). Just as lawyers use all the arguments at their disposal to win cases, so do copywriters use all the facts at their disposal to win consumers over to the product.
 Certainly, we should market no products that are illegal, dangerous, or immoral, although one man’s Victoria’s Secret catalog is another man’s soft porn. But to not use all the tools at our disposal to persuade the buyer is either incompetence, failure to discharge fiduciary duties, or both—and false logic is among the most effective of those tools.

 THE UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION

 Samuel Johnson said, “Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement.”
 But how do you make a big promise in your advertising that is powerful enough to convince the consumer to buy your product instead of competing brands?
 One way is to develop a compelling USP, or Unique Selling Proposition. What is a USP? Rosser Reeves, author of Reality in Advertising, coined this term to describe the major advantage of your product over the competition. The idea is this: If your product is no different from or better than other products of the same type, there is no reason for consumers to choose your product over someone else’s. Therefore, to be promoted effectively, your product must have a Unique Selling Proposition: a major benefit that other products in its category don’t offer.
 According to Reeves, there are three requirements for a USP (and I am quoting, in the italics, from Reality in Advertising):

-----

### 1. Each advertisement must make a proposition to the consumer. Each must say, “Buy this product, and you will get this specific benefit.” Your headline must contain a benefit—a promise to the reader.
 2. The proposition must be one that the competition either cannot, or does not, offer. Here’s where the unique in Unique Selling Proposition comes in. It is not enough merely to offer a benefit. You must differentiate your product from other, similar products. The USP for M&M’s is that the chocolate is surrounded by a hard candy shell so it won’t melt in your hand.
 3. The proposition must be so strong that it can move the mass millions (i.e., pull over new customers to your product). The differentiation cannot be trivial. It must be a difference that matters to the reader.

 Why do so many advertisements fail? One reason is that the marketer has not formulated a strong USP for his product and built his advertising upon it. When you start creating advertising without first thinking about what your USP is, your marketing is weak because there is nothing in it to compel the reader to respond. It looks and sounds like everyone else, and what it says isn’t important to the reader.
 In general advertising for packaged goods, marketers achieve differentiation by building a strong brand at a cost of millions or even billions of dollars.
 Coca-Cola has an advantage because of its brand. If you want a cola, you can get it from a dozen soda makers. But if you want a Coke, you can only get it from Coca-Cola.
 Intel has achieved a similar brand dominance, at an extraordinary cost, with its Pentium line of microprocessors.
 Most businesses are too small, and have too strong a need to generate an immediate positive return on investment (ROI) from their marketing, to engage in this kind of expensive brand building. So we use other means to achieve the differentiation in our USP.
 One popular method is to differentiate your product or service from the competition based on a feature that your product or service has and they don’t.

-----

### The common error here is building the USP around a feature that, while different, is unimportant to the prospects, and therefore unlikely to move them to try your product or service.
 For example, in the chemical equipment industry, it is common for pump manufacturers to attempt to win customers by advertising a unique design feature. Unfortunately, these design twists often result in no real performance improvement, no real advantage that customers care about.
 In a classic industrial ad that ran in the twentieth century, Blackmer Pump, realizing that it could not differentiate based on a technical design principle, took a different approach: to create a USP based upon application of the product.
 Blackmer’s trade ads showed an ad ripped out of an industrial buying guide, full of listings for pump manufacturers, including Blackmer. The company name was circled in pen. The headline of the ad read, “There are only certain times you should call Blackmer for a pump. Know when?”
 Body copy explained (and I am paraphrasing here), “In many applications, Blackmer performs no better or worse than any pump, so we are not a particularly advantageous choice.”
 But, the ad went on, for certain applications (viscous fluids, fluids containing abrasives, slurries, and a few other situations) Blackmer has been proven to outperform all other pumps and is the logical brand of choice. Blackmer closed the ad by offering a free technical manual proving the claim.
 My old friend Jim Alexander of Alexander Marketing in Grand Rapids, Michigan, created this campaign and told me it worked extremely well.
 The easiest situation in which to create a strong USP is when your product has a unique feature—one that competitors lack—that delivers a strong benefit. This must be an advantage the customer really cares about. Not one that, though a difference, is trivial.
 But what if such a proprietary advantage does not exist? What if your product is basically the same as the competition, with no special features?
 Reeves has the answer here, too. He said the uniqueness can stem either from a strong brand (already discussed as an option 95 percent of marketers can’t use) or from “a claim not otherwise made in that particular form of

### advertising”—that is, other products may also have this feature, but advertisers haven’t told consumers about it.
 Going back to our example from packaged goods advertising: “M&M’s melt in your mouth, not in your hand.” Once M&M established this claim as its USP, what could the competition do? Run an ad that said, “We also melt in your mouth, not in your hand!”?
 To be successful marketers, we must create advertising that generates net revenues in excess of its cost. Reeves believed all advertising had to do this. He defined advertising as “the art of getting a USP into the heads of the most people at the lowest possible cost.” If I were to modify his definition, I would change it to “getting a USP into the heads of the people most likely to buy the product at the lowest possible advertising cost.”
 Herb Ahrend, founder of Ahrend Associates, Inc., once said, “A copywriter has to create perceived value. He has to ask, ‘What is the nature of the product? What makes the product different? If it isn’t different, what attribute can you stress that hasn’t been stressed by the competition?’”
 Malcolm D. MacDougall, former president and creative director of SSC&B, said there are four ways to advertise seemingly similar products:

 1. Stress an underpublicized or little-known benefit. Once a copywriter visited a brewery in the hopes of learning something that could set the brewery’s beer apart from other beers. He was fascinated to discover that beer bottles, like milk containers, are washed in live steam to kill the germs. Although all brands of beer are purified this way, no other manufacturer had stressed this fact. So the copywriter wrote about a beer so pure that the bottles are washed in live steam, and the brew’s Unique Selling Proposition was born.

 Study your list of product features and benefits. Then look at the competition’s ads. Is there an important benefit that they have ignored, one you can embrace as the Unique Selling Proposition that sets your product apart from all others?

### 2. Dramatize and demonstrate a big benefit in a compelling fashion. Flex Tape’s USP is that the tape makes watertight bonds. The company ran a TV commercial in which a metal boat was sawed in half. After taping the two halves together with Flex Tape, the boat was taken out on a lake. And it ran at high speeds without a leak.
 3. Dramatize the product name or package. Remember Pez, the candy that came in plastic dispensers made to resemble Mickey Mouse, Pluto, and other cartoon characters? Pez was an ordinary candy, but the package made it special.

 In the same way, the most unusual feature of the original L’eggs pantyhose was not its design, fabric, or style but the egg-shaped package it was sold in.
 Making your product name or package famous is one sure way to move merchandise off the shelves. But it’s also expensive. Unless your client is a major marketer with a million-dollar budget, this tactic will be tough to pull off.

 4. Build long-term brand personalities. Another tactic used by the manufacturers of major national brands is to create advertising that gives their brand a “personality.”
