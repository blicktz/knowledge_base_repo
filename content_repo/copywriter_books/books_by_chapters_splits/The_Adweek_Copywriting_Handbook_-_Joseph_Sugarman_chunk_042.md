##### To set the thermostat, you press just one button. A small LED light scans the temperature scale until you reach your desired temperature and then you release the button. You change the temperature naturally, throughout the day, up to six times. The unit responds and remembers that exact living pattern. The present temperature is displayed by a glowing red LED on the scale. The system also computes the ideal length the furnace should stay on to keep the temperature within a range of plus or minus one and one-half degrees. A battery backup lets you keep your stored program in its memory so power outages as long as eight hours won’t let your unit forget. And if something happens and your power is out for a few days, the unit will automatically maintain 68 degrees when the power is restored. Quite frankly, we were so impressed with the unit, its ease of installation and setting plus its many energy-saving features, we seriously considered advertising it until we realized that our customers would probably not want to trust their future comfort to a product called Magic Stat. What if something went wrong with the unit? How substantial was this Magic Stat outfit? Remember, a thermostat is something you live with as long as you live in your home, and they’re supposed to last ages. After all, your comfort depends on it. Well, we did our homework. We found the company to be a sound, well-financed organization. They have been in business for several years, and they back their products with a three-year limited warranty. In addition, the company has a policy of buying back your unit in one year if you haven’t saved its full cost in energy savings. We were satisfied with the company, the people, the product, its incredible features, the company’s commitment to the product and above all, the energy savings. We are so impressed now with the Magic Stat that we’re going to make buying one irresistible. Buy one from us for only $79. Install it yourself in a few minutes or hire a handyman to install it. Or order the new

# REALIZE SAVINGS

##### But we’re counting on a few things. First, you will realize an energy savings and a comfort that will far surpass what you are currently experiencing. Secondly, you probably will sleep better breathing cooler air yet wake up to just the right temperature. Beauty is only skin deep and a name doesn’t really mean that much. But we sure wish those guys at Magic Stat would have named their unit something more impressive. Maybe something like Twinkle Temp.

Your question might have been, “What’s the gimmick? Why is he knocking the product?”
 You started to read the ad. And then you discovered the one feature that we liked, which happened to be installation—the most difficult obstacle we had to overcome in selling this product.
 From then on selling the Magic Stat was all downhill as if on a slippery slide. Once we had the product installed, we could then discover its great features, raise and resolve the remaining objections (the name and the appearance) and then sell all the product’s benefits. And indeed we did for more than three years.

# Chapter 29

 Pet Plane

##### At JS&A we had three corporate aircraft. Like having a lot of cars, you can fly only one airplane at a time. So I decided to get rid of the plane I used the least—my Aerostar.
 I paid close to $240,000 for it and everybody told me that it was now worth only $190,000 at best. I couldn’t believe this fine aircraft had dropped so much in value, so I decided to take out a single ad in the AOPA Pilot—one of the private pilot magazines—and find out if I could get my asking price.
 The basic format of the ad was a story about my lack of use of the airplane and my concern for our mechanic/pilot Dave. And I use the story to weave in all the good features of the plane. Then, at the end, to add a little humor, I offered to give away a small steer to anybody who buys the plane. I finished the ad with a classic ending. In this ad the humor worked. My Aerostar sold quickly for $240,000—I got back exactly what I paid for it minus the cost of the ad, around $5,000. It was well worth the effort. Humor can work if it is done in a friendly sort of way. In essence I was poking fun at myself, but the serious message of the ad didn’t get overlooked. And, remember, I only needed to sell one to break even.

 They said I’d never get my asking price, but it took only one customer.

##### Headline: Pet Plane Subheadline: This advertisement has not been paid for by Piper nor do I own any Piper stock. Byline: By Joseph Sugarman, President, JS&A Group, Inc. Copy: I am a proud owner of a 1978 Aerostar 601P and have decided to sell it despite serious reservations. I bought 296PA in April of 1978. It was one of the last ones produced by Ted Smith before Piper bought the company. I also hired a full-time mechanic, Dave, who did nothing but keep the ship gleaming and in perfect flying condition. Instead of flying the Aerostar, Dave and I ended up flying the other corporate planes—our Grumman Tiger and our Beechcraft Bonanza— while the Aerostar was hangared, polished and looking pretty. In two full years, Dave and I have only put 350 hours on our pet plane —a lot less time than can justify owning this fine ship.

# DAVE IS A FARMER

##### Dave is also a farmer. In his early years he plowed the fields and milked cows at his parents’ farm in Illinois. Dave has always loved the farm— almost as much as Dave loves flying. In July of this year, Dave and I were talking. We weren’t using the Aerostar enough to justify keeping it, yet Dave, a loyal, hardworking and excellent mechanic, would not have enough to keep him busy to continue working for JS&A if we sold it and he only had the other two planes to work on. I personally love flying too. I am an instrument-rated commercial pilot with a multi-engine rating. Unlike Dave, I was born in the big city. I didn’t know what it was like to raise crops or work on a farm.

####

# DAVE GETS THE WORD

##### I sat Dave down and told him that I was planning to sell 296PA and I asked him if he wouldn’t mind going back to the farm. My idea was simply to buy a farm with the proceeds from the sale of the Aerostar, put in a landing strip and a small hangar, and Dave and his family could raise crops while he wasn’t working on the other two planes. Dave loved the idea, so I decided to part with our Aerostar and offer it for sale in this advertisement. 296PA is a fully pressurized light twin that gets an amazing 28 gallons per hour at a realistic cruise speed of 200 knots. It was aerodynamically designed to take jet engines, but its designer settled for two 290 HP Lycoming engines which provide great speed and fuel efficiency.

# ADVANCED AVIONICS

##### The avionics on the airplane remind me of many of the fine products our company sells. The fully computerized Bendix 2000 system includes radar, R-Nav, DME, a radar altimeter plus all the goodies we could possibly put on the beautiful panel. There’s an auxiliary hydraulic pump, surface de-ice plus a flight phone. The plane had to be fully equipped—after all, my reputation demanded it. A comparably equipped 1980 Aerostar currently sells for over $350,000 and doesn’t look nearly as pretty. Our Aerostar was a Ted Smith original—built by dedicated craftsmen who took great pride in their work. But with any new plane, there are always small bugs that surface. The JS&A Aerostar is so debugged that we doubt you’ll see one soon. Dave spent an enormous amount of time tightening, greasing, cleaning and examining every system in the plane. In addition to 100 hour inspections, Dave conducted 50 hour inspections. In addition to yearly inspections, Dave conducted semi- annual inspections. And if I mentioned I heard a strange creak on the plane, Dave would be there for days decreaking the plane. In short, 296PA is a beautiful, fully-equipped airplane that has been hangared and well taken care of for its short two-year life. And it’s for sale. JS&A is offering our 601P for only $240,000 complete (sales tax has already been paid on the plane) plus no postage or handling. It’s a genuine bargain that really has to be seen to be appreciated. Dave hangars the plane at the Waukegan airport, north of Chicago, and would be happy to arrange a showing. Simply call our toll-free number below to set up an appointment. If you’re not interested in our Aerostar but would like one of our most recent catalogs, call us on our toll-free number or drop us a line too. JS&A is America’s largest single source of space-age products and I’d be anxious to have fellow pilots as our customers. Dave has been looking at a lot of farms lately and is really excited about getting back into farming. And, of course, I’m anxious to sell my

##### Aerostar so I could own a farm and keep a loyal employee happy and productive. And if somebody purchases my Aerostar from this ad, I’ll also throw in, free of charge, a steer from our new farm. After all, as any airplane salesman will tell you, it’s hard to sell a plane without a little bull. Call early and see my Aerostar, today. As I mentioned, the plane sold very quickly. And for the asking price. It was only later, after a call from the FBI, that I discovered the plane was used for running drugs from South America and had been confiscated.

 Mail Order Mansion

##### After my success with the airplane, I had a chance to really push the mail order envelope. Could I sell a $6 million home? The exposure might find one buyer—just as it did with my airplane—and all I needed was one buyer.
 So in 1987 I created the ad as a complete story almost all the way to the end. The marketing strategy was to offer the house or a video. If the house didn’t sell, maybe I would sell enough videos to cover the space costs. But I didn’t sell enough videos and the ad was a loss, as the house did not sell, either.

 We accepted Visa, MasterCard and American Express. And even Japanese yen.

Byline: By Joseph Sugarman Copy: Have I got a deal. And even if you don’t buy this home, you’ll love the story. It all started with an invitation. I was invited by one of the top real estate developers in the country to attend a party at his home in Malibu, California. I didn’t know why. All the developer would say is, “Just come.” The jet was waiting for me at O’Hare Airport in Chicago and his chauffeur-driven limousine met me at Los Angeles for the drive to Malibu. It was class all the way. When I drove up to the home, there was a party going on. Rolls-Royces were lined up everywhere and the noise and music from the house made it clear that something special was going on.

# VERY FAMOUS GUESTS

##### After I entered and was introduced to the host and his wife, they took me around and introduced me to some of their guests. “This is Joe Sugarman, that famous mail order copywriter who writes all those interesting mail order ads.” I met a famous movie star, a nationally famous sports broadcaster, a soap opera TV star, a few famous baseball players and two famous California politicians. I recognized everybody and a few even knew who I was. In fact, some of them were my customers. But why was I there? I still didn’t know. I had a chance to look around the house. Now I’ve seen beautiful homes in my life but this one had to be the most impressive I’ve ever seen. First, it was on top of a 90 foot bluff overlooking a sandy beach and the Pacific Ocean. Secondly, it was night and I could see the entire shoreline of Los Angeles. It was as if I were on a cruise ship at sea and I could look over the Pacific and back at the city. Then I recognized the cliff. Was this the site of the most publicized wedding in show business where seven helicopters hovered above taking pictures? I found out later that it was. The home took complete advantage of the view. Practically every room faced the ocean. And the sliding glass doors completely opened so you had an unobstructed view of the ocean—no partitions, no supporting beams. The sound that filled the house with music first appeared to be live. But later I found that the home had the best acoustics ever designed into a personal residence with a sound system that rivaled a recording studio. And what a personal residence. There was a sunken tennis court, a swimming pool, whirlpool bath and solid state electronic lighting system that was controlled from any place in the house. The ceilings were 25 feet high and the interior decor was so tastefully done that I could easily understand why it won all sorts of awards. But why was I here? Why were all my expenses paid for? Then I found out.

-----

##### The developer and his wife set me up in one of the five bedrooms and after the guests had left invited me into the living room. “Joe, the reason we’ve invited you here is that we want you to write an advertisement to sell our house. You’re one of the nation’s top copywriters, and since this house is an award-winning world-class residence, we wanted a world- class copywriter to do it justice.” Now I’ll admit, I was flattered. “But I’m a mail order copywriter. How could I possibly sell a house this expensive?”

####

# VERY SPECIAL

##### “Easy,” replied the developer. “By its value. This property is very special. It’s on a peninsula that sticks out of the curved part that faces Los Angeles. When you look from the cliff you see Los Angeles as if it were rising out of the ocean. And because we are on a point, we do not get the harsh winds off the ocean but rather gentle breezes all year long. The property itself is so valuable that our next door neighbor paid close to 9 million dollars for his one bedroom house.” I was starting to feel uneasy. “I’m sorry, but there’s no way I can sell your home. I refuse to write anything except under my own company name. And I’m not in the real estate business.” But the developer persisted. “Joe, you really can be. This house is an investment. There’s a lot of foreign money out there. And all it takes is that special person looking for a celebrity-status world-class home on one of the best sites in America and presto, it’s sold.”
