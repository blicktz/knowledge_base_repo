### WRITING FRACTIONAL DISPLAY ADS

 As a copywriter, you will mostly be writing full-page ads in magazines and newspapers. But many mail-order advertisers get better results from half- page ads, usually but not always in a vertical layout to resemble a column of type in the paper.
 These are often designed and written as advertorial or native advertising, which means they are designed to look like articles and not advertisements. The logic of this approach is sound, as “editorial” content (articles) get higher readership and are trusted more than items that are obvious ads.
 To get prospects for the product to notice your ad, state in the headline either who the reader is (e.g., “prescription drug users”) or what their problem is (e.g., “wet basement”).
 Sales appeals that work in classified mail-order advertising include promises that the customer will obtain love, money, health, popularity, success, leisure, security, self-confidence, better appearance, self- improvement, pride of accomplishment, prestige, pride of ownership, or comfort; will receive entertainment; will save time; will eliminate worry and fear; will satisfy curiosity, self-expression, or creativity; or will avoid work or risk.
 Effective words and phrases to use in your small ads include: free, new, amazing, now, how to, easy, discover, method, plan, reveals, show, simple, startling, advanced, improved, and you.
 In a full-page ad, the advertisement is the only thing the readers see on that ad. So they are not distracted by any other ads on the page.
 But when you run a half-page ad, there are many other ads competing for attention. Again, proven effective techniques for attracting your target prospects to your ad include identifying the ideal reader in the headline (e.g., “heart patients”) or the problem the prospects want to alleviate (e.g., “memory loss”).

 WRITING CLASSIFIED AND TINY DISPLAY ADS

-----

### I urge you to test some classified and one- or two-inch display ads. Yes, they are small and seem almost insignificant. But they also cost little to run and test. Therefore, they can produce a profitable ROI. And classified ads that make money can be run for long periods and tested in multiple publications.
 One of my most successful mail-order ads, which ran continuously for many years in Writer’s Digest, reads as follows:

**MAKE $100,000/YEAR writing ads, brochures, promotional material for local/national**
client. Free details: CTC, 22 E. Quackenbush, Dept. WD, Dumont, NJ 07628.

### Here are some other examples of how to write classified mail-order ads:

**EXTRA CASH. 12 ways to make money at home. Free details …**

**MAIL-ORDER MILLIONAIRE reveals moneymaking secrets. FREE 1-hour cassette …**

**SELL NEW BOOK by mail! 400% profit! Free dealer information …**

**GROW earthworms at home for profit …**

**CARNIVOROUS AND WOODLAND terrarium plants. Send for FREE catalog.**

**ANCESTOR HUNTING? Trace your family roots the easy way. Details free …**

### The measure of a successful classified ad is the cost per inquiry. Therefore, if you can get your message across in fewer words, you pay less for the ad and, as a result, lower your cost per inquiry.
 Make your classifieds as short and pithy as possible. Here are some tips for reducing your word count:

 • Be concise. Use the minimum number of words needed to communicate your idea. For example, instead of “Earn $500 a Day in Your Own Home-Based Business,” write “Work at Home—$500/Day!”

 • Minimize your address. You pay the publication for every word in your classified, including your address. Therefore, instead of “22 E. Quackenbush Avenue,” I write “22 E. Quackenbush.” The mail will still be

-----

### delivered, and I will save one word. This can add up to significant savings for ads run frequently in multiple publications.

 • Use phrases and sentence fragments rather than full sentences.
 • Remember your objective. You are asking only for an inquiry, not for an order. You don’t need a lot of copy, since all you are asking the reader to do is send for free information.

 • Use combination words, hyphenated words, and slash constructions. For instance, instead of “GROW EARTH WORMS,” which is three words, write “GROW EARTHWORMS,” which counts as two words, saving you a word.

 In classified ads, the best way to generate a response is to ask for an inquiry rather than an order. This is done by putting a phrase such as “free details,” “free information,” “free catalog,” or similar phrase, followed by a colon and your address (e.g., Free Details: Box 54, Canuga, TN 44566).
 Should you charge for your information? Some advertisers ask the prospect to pay for the information either by sending a small amount of money (25¢, 50¢, $1, and $2 are typical) or by sending a self-addressed envelope with the postage already on it.
 The theory is that asking for postage or a nominal payment brings you a more qualified lead and therefore results in a higher percentage of leads converted to sales.
 My experience is that it doesn’t pay to charge for your information kit, because doing so dramatically cuts down on the number of leads you will receive.
 Whenever you offer information to generate an inquiry, I believe it’s best to make it free. The exception might be if you are offering a very expensive and elaborate catalog, for which you charge $1 or $2 to cover your costs.
 In your classified ads, put a key code in the address, so when you get inquiries, you can track which ad generated them. For instance, in my ad “MAKE $100,000/YEAR WRITING,” the key code “WD” refers to Writer’s Digest magazine. Since the ad runs every month, I don’t bother adding a code number to track the month. If you wanted to do so, you

-----

### could. For example, “Dept. WD-10” would mean Writer’s Digest magazine, October issue (the tenth month of the year). Keep track of the key code on each inquiry, and record the information in a notebook or spreadsheet to measure ad response.
 We have already discussed the two key measurements of two-step classified advertising: the cost per inquiry and the percentage of inquiries converted to orders. The bottom line is this: Did the sales the ad generated exceed the cost of the ad space? If they did, it was profitable. If they didn’t, the ad isn’t working, and a new ad should be tested.
 Place your classified ads in publications that have mail-order classified ad sections. Contact the magazines that interest you and ask for their media kits, which include details on circulation, advertising rates, and readership, and a sample issue of the publication. Ask if the publisher will send several sample issues.
 Look at the classified ad sections in the publications. Are the ads for products similar to yours? If so, that’s a good sign. See if these ads repeat from issue to issue. The advertisers would not repeat them unless the ads were working. If this publication is working for their offers, it can work for yours, too.
 Classified ad sections are divided by various headings. Place your ad under the appropriate heading. If you don’t see an appropriate heading, call the magazine and ask if it will create one for you.
 If you sell information by mail, avoid putting your classified under the heading “Books and Booklets.” This will reduce orders. Instead, put the ad under a heading related to the subject matter. For example, if you are selling a book on how to make money cleaning chimneys, place the ad under “Business Opportunities.”
 You can test a classified or small display ad by running it just one time in a publication. The problem is, most magazines, and even weekly newspapers, have long lead times—several weeks or more—for placing ads. If you place the ad to run one time only and the ad pulls well, you then must wait several weeks or months until you can get it in the publication again.

-----

### In a weekly newspaper or magazine, I test a classified ad by running it for one month—four consecutive issues. For a monthly publication, I test it for three months—three consecutive issues. If the first insertion is profitable, I will probably extend the insertion order for several months so the ad runs continuously with no interruption.
 With a full-page ad, you usually get the greatest number of orders the first time the ad runs in the magazine. Response declines with each additional insertion; at the point where the ad is not going to be profitable in its next insertion, you pull it and try another ad.
 The reason for this response pattern is that the first time the ad runs, it skims the cream of the prospects, getting orders from those most likely to buy. Those who buy from the first insertion of the ad will not buy when it runs again. Therefore, each time the ad runs it reaches a smaller and smaller audience of potential new buyers.
 While response to full-page ads declines with each insertion, the response to either a fractional ad or a classified ad can remain steady for many insertions. Indeed, some mail-order operators (and I am one of them) have run the same classified ad monthly in the same magazine for years at a time, with no decline in response.
 Response sometimes increases during the first twelve months the ad is run, as people see the ad over and over again and eventually become curious enough to respond. Some people who responded once, received your sales literature, and didn’t buy may respond several times, and get your literature several times, before they eventually break down and buy. Also, keep in mind that each issue reaches a number of new subscribers via subscriptions and newsstand circulation, so the total audience for a classified remains fairly constant.

 RESPONSE MECHANISMS

 You should always tell the interested prospect what the next stop is and give instructions on how to take action along with a reason to do so. Some of the more popular response options include:

-----

### Toll-free number. Standard postal mail. Business reply mail. E-mail. Web form. Chatbot. Quick response code (fig. 6.1). Visit to store or showroom. Visit from salesperson to consumer’s home. Text.

 Pick the response option that works best for your offer as your primary response mechanism. But also offer one or two alternatives, as different people respond in different ways (e.g., some do not text).

**Fig. 6.1: Quick Response Code (QRC). The prospect scans the graphic with her smartphone and is**

## WRITING DIRECT MAIL

### According to the Data and Marketing Association (DMA), the amount of money spent on direct mail in 2018 was $38.5 billion.[1] Today, more than 120 billion pieces of direct mail pass through the post office each year.[2]
 There are a number of factors that account for direct mail’s popularity as an advertising medium.
 First, you can measure the results by counting how many order forms or reply cards come back. With print ads and broadcast commercials you don’t always know how effective your efforts have been. But direct-mail advertisers always know whether a mailing is profitable or not.
 Second, direct mail frequently generates a higher ROI than other media. The copywriter for a small chain of furniture stores notes that direct mail draws more people to the stores than newspaper ads, TV commercials, even digital marketing. He says: “People walking into the store with the direct- mail piece, along with the burst in sales when they go out, makes it clear that they read direct mail and it works extremely well.”
 In its loyalty program, when Nordstrom stopped sending reward notes to customers via postal mail, the retailer saw a reduction in foot traffic in all of its stores.[3]
 Third, direct mail can be targeted to select groups of prospects through the careful selection of the proper mailing lists. The copy for each mailing can be tailored to the needs of the various groups of prospects you want to reach. And you can send as few—or as many—mailing pieces as your budget allows. Which makes direct mail cost-effective for both big corporations and smaller advertisers.

-----

### Fourth, direct mail gives you great flexibility in your presentation. Print advertising is limited by the size of the page, broadcast by the length of the commercial. Direct-mail writers can use as many words and pictures as it takes to make the sale. (I recently received a direct-mail piece that featured a sixteen-page sales letter!) Your mailing can even include a sample of the product or a gift for the reader.
 Because of these advantages, many advertisers use direct mail for a wide variety of applications:

 To sell products by mail To generate sales leads To answer product inquiries To distribute catalogs, newsletters, and other sales literature To motivate the sales force To keep in touch with former customers To get more business from current customers To follow up inquiries To tie in with other media such as telemarketing, print advertising, and broadcast (Publishers Clearing House, for example, used to run TV commercials alerting consumers to look for the Clearing House sweepstakes offer in the mail) To invite prospects to attend seminars, conferences, hospitality suites, and trade show exhibits To renew subscriptions, memberships, service contracts, and insurance policies To get customers to come to the store To distribute information, news, product samples To conduct research surveys To build goodwill To announce a sale

 Fifth, contrary to what you might think, direct-mail response rates are on the rise, having increased on average 14 percent since 2008. During that same period, e-mail response rates declined by a hefty 57 percent.[4]

### A PERSONAL MEDIUM

 The main difference between direct mail and space advertising is that mail is a personal medium. A letter is a one-to-one communication from one human being to another. An ad appearing in a magazine will be seen by thousands or millions of other readers. But a letter is for your eyes only.
 Now, it’s true that most direct mail is mass-produced and distributed in bulk mailings to thousands of prospects. Still, the reader views mail as more personal than a magazine or newspaper. The trick is to take advantage of this—by creating direct mail that captures the best characteristics of personal mail.
 Unlike an ad, a sales letter is signed. So the writer can use the first person—“I” writing to “you,” the reader—to personalize the sale message.
 The tone of the letter should also be personal. Successful direct-mail writers favor an informal, conversational style. They use contractions, colloquial language, and short, snappy sentences. Their letters brim with personality, enthusiasm, warmth, and sincerity.
 Unlike print advertising, which many newbie copywriters have limited experience with, direct mail should come easy; we all have experience in letter writing. But too many direct-mail letters sound like … well, like advertising. When you write direct mail, don’t suppress your natural style. Let the words flow in your own voice. Write the direct-mail letter as if you were writing a letter to a friend.
 Direct mail is almost always a response-oriented medium. It asks for the order (or at least for some type of action) now, not in a day or a week or a month. Direct-mail writers need to generate an immediate response from the reader. This is why most direct-mail packages include an order form, a reply envelope, and copy that tells you to “act now—don’t delay—send in your order TODAY!”
 As I mentioned, you have great flexibility in the elements you include in your mailing package. As the copywriter, you decide. Should the package contain a letter? A brochure? An order form? A reply card? A sample? A second letter? A second or third brochure?
 The “classic” direct-mail package contains an outer envelope, a letter, a brochure, and a reply card. But knowledgeable direct-mail writers vary this
