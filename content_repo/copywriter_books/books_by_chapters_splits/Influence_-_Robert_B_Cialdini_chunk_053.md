#### There is an added advantage to commitment-based compliance procedures. Mere reminders of past commitments can spur individuals to act in accord with those earlier positions, stands, or actions. Bring the commitment back to top of mind, and the need for consistency takes over to align related responding once again. Let’s take a couple of examples from the field of medicine to illustrate the point.
 Whenever I speak to health-care management groups about the influence process, I’ll ask the question “Which people in the system are most difficult to influence?” The answer is invariably and emphatically, “Physicians!” On the one hand, this circumstance seems as it should be. To get to their elevated positions in the health-care hierarchy, doctors go through years of training and practice, including medical-school specializations, internships, and residencies, that give them a great deal of information and experience on which to base their choices and make them understandably reluctant to be swayed from those choices. On the other hand, this kind of resistance can be problematic when physicians don’t adopt recommendations for changes that would benefit their patients. At the outset of their professional careers, most MDs take a version of the Hippocratic oath, which commits them to act principally for the welfare of their patients and, especially, to do them no harm.
 So why don’t they wash their hands before examining a patient as often as they are supposed to? A hospital study offers insight into the matter. The researchers, Adam Grant and David Hofmann, noted that even though hand washing is strongly recommended before each patient examination, most physicians wash their hands less than half as often as the guidelines prescribe; what’s more, various interventions aimed at reducing the problem have proved ineffective, leaving patients at greater risk of infection. The reason for the problem isn’t that physicians have abandoned their commitment to patient safety or aren’t aware of its link to hand washing. It’s that upon entering an examination room, the link isn’t as high in

#### consciousness as are all sorts of other factors, such as how the patient looks, what the attending nurse is saying, what the case notes show, and so on.
 Grant and Hofmann thought they could remedy this regrettable situation by reminding physicians of their commitment to their patients and its connection to hand hygiene when they arrived to do an examination. The researchers simply placed distinctive signs above examination-room soap and gel dispensers that announced “Hand hygiene protects patients from catching diseases.” Those reminder signs increased soap and gel usage by 45 percent.
 Another physician misstep involves the overprescription of antibiotic drugs, which is a growing health problem in the United States, contributing to the deaths of twenty-three thousand patients per year. As is the case for hand washing, several strategies for reducing the problem—education programs, electronic alerts, and payments—have had little effect. But a group of medical researchers have had remarkable success using a commitment-centered approach on physicians staffing a set of Los Angeles outpatient clinics. The doctors placed a poster in their examination rooms for a twelve-week period. For half of the MDs, the poster provided standard information to patients regarding antibiotic use. For the other half, it included, along with standard information, a photo of the doctor and a letter he or she signed pledging to avoid overprescription of antibiotics. During the remainder of the year, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions actually increased by 21 percent for doctors exposed daily to the standard information posters. But those whose posters consistently reminded them of their personal commitments to reducing the problem cut inappropriate prescribing by 27 percent.
 Reminders of existing commitments possess yet another bonus. They not only restore the commitment but also appear to strengthen it by augmenting one’s related self-image. Compared to consumers who had previously performed pro-environmental actions but were not reminded of them, those who did receive such reminders came to see themselves as more environmentally minded and then became uniquely more likely to purchase environmentally friendly versions of products—including light bulbs, paper towels, deodorants, and detergents. Thus, asking people to recall prior commitments to environmentalism isn’t just an easy way to stimulate consistent subsequent responding; it is also a particularly effective

#### way, because such reminders intensify one’s self-image as an environmentalist.[10]

## Defense

#### “Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Or, at least, so goes a frequently heard quotation attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson. But what an odd thing to say. Looking around, it is obvious that internal consistency is a hallmark of logic and intellectual strength, while its lack characterizes the intellectually scattered and limited among us. What, then, could a thinker of Emerson’s caliber have meant when he assigned the trait of consistency to the small-minded? A look back to the original source of his statement, his essay “Self-Reliance,” makes it clear the problem lay not in Emerson but in the popularized version of what he said. Actually he wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” For some obscure reason, a central distinction had been lost as the years eroded the accurate version of his assertion to mean something entirely different and, upon close inspection, entirely mistaken.
 The distinction should not be lost on us, however, because it is crucial to the only effective defense I know against the levers of influence embodied in the combined factors of commitment and consistency. It is the awareness that although consistency is generally good—even vital—there is a foolish, rigid variety to be shunned. We need to be wary of the tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of those who want to exploit the mechanical commitment and consistency sequence for profit.
 Since automatic consistency is so useful in allowing an economical and appropriate way of behaving most of the time, we can’t decide merely to eliminate it from our lives. The results would be disastrous. If, rather than streaming along in accordance with our prior decisions and deeds, we stopped to think through the merits of each new action before performing it, we would never have time to accomplish anything significant. We need even that dangerous, mechanical brand of consistency. The only way out of the dilemma is to know when such consistency is likely to lead to a poor

#### choice. There are certain signals—two separate kinds of signals—to tip us off. We register each type in a different part of our bodies.

**_READER’S REPORT 7.5_**

#### From a college student in New Delhi, India

I am writing to you about an incident where the consistency principle compelled me to
make a decision that I would not have made under ordinary circumstances. I had gone to
the food court of a mall where I decided to buy a small glass of Coke.

“One glass of Coke, please,” I said to the salesman at the counter.
“Medium or Large?,” he asked me as he was billing another customer.
“I’ve already eaten enough. There is no way I could gulp down a large glass of Coke,” I
thought to myself. “Medium,” I said confidently as I handed him the card for payment.

“Oh! Sorry,” said the salesperson with the impression of having made a genuine
mistake. “Small or Medium?”

“Uhm, Medium,” I said in line with the consistency principle, took my drink and left so
the next person could order, only to realize that I had been duped into buying the larger of
the two options.

I was caught off guard, and to be consistent with my previously placed order, I blurted
out “Medium,” without even processing the new information given to me.

A foolish consistency definitely seems to be the hobgoblin of little minds!

**Author’s note: I think the reader, who seems to have considered herself little-minded**
in the situation, is being too hard on herself. When we are rushed or not able to think
deeply about a choice, mechanical consistency is the norm (Fennis, Janssen, & Vohs,
2009).

### Stomach Signs
#### The first signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don’t want to perform. It’s happened to me a hundred times. An especially memorable instance took place on a summer evening when, as a young man well before I wrote this book, I answered my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dressed in shorts and a revealing halter top. I noticed, nonetheless, she was carrying a clipboard and was asking me to participate in a survey. Wanting to make a favorable impression, I agreed

-----

#### and, I do admit, stretched the truth in my interview answers to present myself in the most positive light. Our conversation went as follows:

**_Stunning Young Woman: Hello! I’m doing a survey on the entertainment habits of city_**
residents, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions for me.

**_Cialdini: Do come in._**

**_SYW: No, thank you. I’ll just stay right here and begin. How many times per week would you_**
say you go out to dinner?

**_C: Oh, probably three, maybe four times a week. Whenever I can, really; I love fine restaurants._**

**_SYW: How nice. And do you usually order wine with your dinner?_**

**_C: Only if it’s imported._**

**_SYW: I see. What about movies? Do you go to the movies much?_**

**_C: The cinema? I can’t get enough of good films. I especially like the sophisticated kind with_**
the words on the bottom of the screen. How about you? Do you like to see films?

**_SYW: Uh . . . yes, I do. But let’s get back to the interview. Do you go to many concerts?_**

**_C: Definitely. The symphonic stuff mostly, of course. But I do enjoy a quality pop group as well._**

**_SYW:_** _(writing rapidly). Great! Just one more question. What about touring performances by_
theatrical or ballet companies? Do you see them when they’re in town?

**_C: Ah, the ballet—the movement, the grace, the form—I love it. Mark me down as loving the_**
ballet. See it every chance I get.

**_SYW: Fine. Just let me recheck my figures here for a moment, Mr. Cialdini._**

**_C: Actually, it’s Dr. Cialdini. But that sounds so formal. Why don’t you call me Bob?_**

**_SYW: All right,_** _Bob. From the information you’ve already given me, I’m pleased to say you_
could save up to $1,200 a year by joining Clubamerica! A small membership fee entitles you to
discounts on most of the activities you’ve mentioned. Surely someone as socially vigorous as
yourself would want to take advantage of the tremendous savings our company can offer on all
the things you’ve already told me you do.

**_C_** _(trapped like a rat): Well . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . I guess so._

#### I remember quite well feeling my stomach tighten as I stammered my agreement. It was a clear call to my brain, “Hey, you’re being taken here!” But I couldn’t see a way out. I had been cornered by my own words. To decline her offer at that point would have meant facing a pair of distasteful alternatives: If I tried to back out by protesting that I was not actually the man-about-town I had claimed to be, I would come off a liar; trying to refuse without that protest would make me come off a fool for not wanting to save $1,200. I bought the entertainment package, even though I knew I had been set up. The need to be consistent with what I had already said snared me.
 No more, though. I listen to my stomach these days, and I have discovered a way to handle people who try to use the consistency principle on me. I just tell them exactly what they are doing. The tactic has become the perfect counterattack. Whenever my stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request merely because doing so would be consistent with some prior commitment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester. I don’t try to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity of foolish consistency. Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away guiltily or retreats in bewilderment, I am content. I have won; an exploiter has lost.
 I sometimes think about how it would be if that stunning young woman of years ago were to try to sell me an entertainment-club membership now. I have it all worked out. The entire interaction would be the same, except for the end:

**_SYW: . . . Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the_**
tremendous savings our company can offer on all the things you’ve already told me you do.

**_C: Quite wrong. I recognize what has gone on here. I know that your story about doing a survey_**
was just a pretext for getting people to tell you how often they go out and that, under those
circumstances, there is a natural tendency to exaggerate. And I refuse to allow myself to be
locked into a mechanical sequence of commitment and consistency when I know it’s
wrongheaded. No click, run for me.

**_SYW: Huh?_**

**_C: Okay, let me put it this way: (1) It would be stupid of me to spend money on something I_**
don’t want; (2) I have it on excellent authority, direct from my stomach, that I don’t want your
entertainment plan; (3) therefore, if you still believe that I will buy it, you probably also still

-----

believe in the Tooth Fairy. Surely, someone as intelligent as you would be able to understand
that.

**_SYW_** _(trapped like a stunning young rat): Well . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . I guess so._

### Heart-of-Hearts Signs
#### Stomachs are not especially perceptive or subtle organs. Only when it is obvious we are about to be conned are they likely to register and transmit that message. At other times, when it is not clear we are being taken, our stomachs may never catch on. Under those circumstances, we have to look elsewhere for a clue. The situation of my neighbor Sara provides a good illustration. She made an important commitment to Tim by canceling her marriage plans. The commitment has grown its own supports, so even though the original reasons for the commitment are gone, she remains in harmony with it. She has convinced herself with newly formed reasons that she did the right thing, so she stays with Tim. It is not difficult to see why there would be no tightening in Sara’s stomach as a result. Stomachs tell us when we think we are doing something wrong for us. Sara thinks no such thing. To her mind, she has chosen correctly and is behaving consistently with that choice.
 Yet, unless I badly miss my guess, there is a part of Sara that recognizes her choice as a mistake and her current living arrangement as a brand of foolish consistency. Where, exactly, that part of Sara is located we can’t be sure, but our language does give it a name: heart of hearts. It is, by definition, the one place where we cannot fool ourselves. It is the place where none of our justifications, none of our rationalizations, penetrate. Sara has the truth there, although right now she can’t hear its signal clearly through the static of the new support apparatus she has erected.
 If Sara has erred in her choice of Tim, how long can she go without recognizing it, without suffering a massive heart-of-hearts attack? There is no telling. One thing is certain: as time passes, the various alternatives to Tim are disappearing. She had better determine soon whether she is making a mistake.
 Easier said than done, of course. She must answer an extremely intricate question: “Knowing what I now know, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice?” The problem lies in the “knowing what I now
