It is often necessary in a line to learn the total expenditure. We must learn what a
user spends a year, else we shall not know if users are worth the cost of getting. We must
learn the total consumption, else we may overspend.

We must learn the percentage of readers to whom our product appeals. We must
often gather this data on classes. The percentage may differ on farms and in cities. The
cost of advertising largely depends on the percentage of waste circulation. Thus an
advertising campaign is usually preceded by a very large volume of data. Even an
experimental campaign, for effective experiments cost a great deal of work and time.

Often chemists are employed to prove or disprove doubtful claims. An
advertiser, in all good faith, makes an impressive assertion. If it is true, it will form a big
factor in advertising. If untrue, it may prove a boomerang. And it may bar our ads from
good mediums. It is remarkable how often a maker proves wrong on assertions he had
made for years.

Impressive claims are made far more impressive by making them exact. So, many
experiments are made to get the actual figures. For instance, a certain drink is known to
have a large food value. That simple assertion is not very convincing. So we send the
drink to the laboratory and find that its food value is 425 calories per pint. One pint is
equal to six eggs in calories of nutriment. That claim makes a great impression.

In every line involving scientific details a censor is appointed. The ad-writer,
however well informed, may draw wrong inferences from facts. So an authority passes
on every advertisement. The uninformed would be staggered to know the amount of
work involved in a single ad. Weeks of work sometimes. The ad seems so simple, and it
must be simple to appeal to simple people. But back of that ad may lie reams of data,
volumes of information, months of research.

So this is no lazy man’s field.

 Strategy

Advertising is much like war, minus the venom. Or much, if you prefer, like a
game of chess. We are usually out to capture others’ citadels or garner others’ trade. We
must have skill and knowledge. We must have training and experience, also right
equipment. We must have proper ammunition, and enough. We dare not underestimate
opponents. Our intelligence department is a vital factor, as told in the previous chapter.
We need alliances with dealers, as another chapter tells. We also need strategy of the
ablest sort, to multiply the value of our forces.

Sometimes in new campaigns comes the question of a name. That may be most
important. Often the right name is an advertisement in itself. It may tell a fairly complete
story, like Shredded Wheat, Cream of Wheat, Puffed Rice, Spearmint Gum, Palmolive
Soap, etc.

That may be a great advantage. The name is usually conspicuously displayed.
Many a name has proved to be the greatest factor in an articles success. Other names
prove a distinct disadvantage — Toasted Corn Flakes, for instance. Too many others
may share a demand with the man who builds it up.

Many coined names without meaning have succeeded. Kodak, Karo etc., are
examples. They are exclusive. The advertiser who gives them meaning never needs to
share his advantage. But a significant name which helps to impress a dominant claim is
certainly a good advantage. Names that tell stores have been worth millions of dollars. So
a great deal of research often precedes the selection of a name.

Sometimes a price must be decided. A high price creates resistance. It tends to
limit one’s field. The cost of getting an added profit may be more than the profit. It is a
well-known fact that the greatest profits are made on great volume at small profit.
Campbell’s Soups, Palmolive Soap, Karo Syrup and Ford cars are conspicuous examples.
A price which appeals only to — say 10 percent — multiplies the cost of selling.

But on other lines high price is unimportant. High profit is essential. The line
may have a small sale per customer. One hardly cares what he pays for a corn remedy
because he uses little. The maker must have a large margin because of small
consumption. On other lines a higher price may even be an inducement. Such lines are
judged largely by price. A product which costs more than the ordinary is considered
above the ordinary. So the price question is always a very big factor in strategy.

-----

Competition must be considered. What are the forces against you? What have
they in price or quality or claims to weigh against your appeal? What have you to win
trade against them? What have you to hold trade against them when you get it?

How strongly are your rivals entrenched? There are some fields which are almost
impregnable. They are usually lines which create a new habit or custom and which typify
that custom with consumers. They so dominate a field that one can hardly hope to
invade it. They have volume, the profit to make a tremendous fight. Such fields are being
constantly invaded. But it is done through some convincing advantage, or through very
superior salesmanship-in-print.

Other lines are only less difficult. A new shaving soap, as an example. About
every possible customer is using a rival soap. Most of them are satisfied with it. Many are
wedded to it. The appeal must be strong enough to win those people from longestablished favor.

Such things are not accomplished by haphazard efforts. Not by considering
people in the mass and making blind stabs for their favors. We must consider individuals,
typical people who are using rival brands. A man on a Pullman, for instance, using his
favorite soap. What could you say to him in person to get him to change to yours? We
cannot go after thousands of men until we learn how to win one.

The maker may say that he has no distinctions. He is making a good product, but
much like others. He deserves a good share of the trade, but he has nothing exclusive to
offer. However, there is nearly always something impressive which others have not told.
We must discover it. We must have a seeming advantage. People don’t quit habits
without reason.

There is the problem of substitution and how to head it off. That often steals
much of one’s trade. This must be considered in ones original plan. One must have
foresight to see all eventualities, and the wisdom to establish his defenses in advance.

Many pioneers in the line establish large demands. Then through some fault in
their foundations, lose a large share of the harvest. Theirs is a mere brand, for instance,
where it might have stood for an exclusive product. Vaseline is an example. That product
established a new demand, then almost monopolized that demand through wisdom at
the start. To have called it some different brand of petroleum jelly might have made a
difference of millions in results.

Jell-O, Postum, Victrola, Kodak, etc., established coined names which came to
typify a product. Some such names have been admitted to the dictionary. They have
become common names, though coined and exclusive. Royal Baking Powder and

-----

Toasted Corn Flakes, on the other hand, when they pioneered their fields, left the way
open to perpetual substitution. So did Horlick’s Malted Milk.

The attitude of dealers must be considered. There is a growing inclination to limit
lines, to avoid duplicate lines, to lesson inventories. If this applies to your line, how will
dealers receive it? If there is opposition, how can we circumvent it?

The problems of distribution are important and enormous. To advertise
something that few dealers supply is a waste of ammunition. Those problems will be
considered in another chapter.

These are samples of the problems which advertising men must solve. These are
some of the reasons why vast experience is necessary. One oversight may cost the client
millions in the end. One wrong piece of strategy may prohibit success. Things done in
one way may be twice as easy, half as costly, as when done another way. Advertising
without this preparation is like a waterfall going to waste. The power might be there, but
it is not made effective. We must center the force and direct it in a practical direction.

Advertising often looks very simple. Thousands of men claim ability to do it. And
there is still a wide impression that many men can. As a result, much advertising goes by
favor. But the men who know realize that the problems are as many and as important as
the problems in building a skyscraper. And many of them lie in the foundations.

#### Chapter 13

 Use of Samples

The product itself should be its own best salesman. Not the product alone, but
the product plus a mental impression, and atmosphere, which you place around it. That
being so, samples are of prime importance. However expensive, they usually form the
cheapest selling method. A salesman might as well go out without his sample case as an
advertiser.

Sampling does not apply to little things alone, like foods or proprietaries. It can
be applied in some way to almost every thing. We have sampled clothing. We are now
sampling phonograph records.

Samples serve numerous valuable purposes. They enable one to use the word
“Free” in ads. That often multiplies readers. Most people want to learn about any offered
gift. Tests often show that samples pay for themselves — perhaps several times over —
in multiplying the readers of your ads without additional cost of space.

A sample gets action. The reader of your ad may not be convinced to the point of
buying. But he is ready to learn more about the product that you offer. So he cuts out a
coupon, lays it aside, and later mails it or presents it. Without that coupon he would soon
forget. Then you have the name and address of an interested prospect. You can start him
using your product. You can give him fuller information. You can follow him up.

That reader might not again read one of your ads in six months. Your impression
would be lost. But when he writes you, you have a chance to complete with that prospect
all that can be done. In that saving of waste the sample pays for itself.

Sometimes a small sample is not a fair test. Then we may send an order on the
dealer for a full-size package. Or we may make the coupon good for a package at the
store. Thus we get a longer test.

You say that is expensive. So is it expensive to gain a prospects interest. It may
cost you 50 cents to get the person to the point of writing for a sample. Don’t stop at 15
cents additional to make that interest valuable.

Another way in which samples pay is by keying your advertisements. They
register the interest you create. Thus you can compare one with another ad, headline,
plan and method.

-----

That means in any line an enormous savings. The wisest, most experienced man
cannot tell what will most appeal in any line of copy. With a key to guide you, your
returns are very apt to cost you twice what they need cost. And we know that some ads
on the same product will cost ten times what others cost. A sample may pay for itself
several times over by giving you an accurate check.

Again samples enable you to refer customers where they can be supplied. This is
important before you attain general distribution.

Many advertisers lose much by being penny-wise. They are afraid of imposition,
or they try to save pennies. That is why they ask ten cents for a sample, or a stamp or
two. Getting that dime may cost them from 40 cents to $1. That is, it may add that to the
cost of replies. But it is remarkable how many will pay that addition rather than offer a
sample free.

Putting a price on a sample greatly retards replies. Then it prohibits you from
using the word “Free,” as we have stated, will generally more than pay for your samples.

For the same reason some advertisers say, “You buy one package, we will buy the
other.” Or they make a coupon good for part of the purchase price. Any keyed returns
will clearly prove that such offers do not pay. Before a prospect is converted, it is
approximately as hard to get half price for your article as to get the full price for it.

Bear in mind that you are the seller. You are the one courting interest. Then don’t
make it difficult to exhibit that interest. Don’t ask your prospects to pay for your selling
efforts. Three in four will refuse to pay — perhaps nine in ten.

Cost of requests for samples differ in every line. It depends on your breadth of
appeal. Some things appeal to everybody, some to a small percentage. One issue of the
papers in Greater New York brought 1,460,000 requests for a can of evaporated milk.
On a chocolate drink, one-fifth the coupons published are presented. Another line not
widely used may bring a fraction of that number.

But the cost of inquiries is usually enough to be important. Then don’t neglect
them. Don’t stint your efforts with those you have half sold. An inquiry means that a
prospect has read your story and is interested. He or she would like to try your product
and learn more about it. Do what you would do if that prospect stood before you.

Cost of inquiries depends largely on how they come. Asking people to mail the
coupon brings minimum returns. Often four times as many will present that coupon for
a sample at the store.

-----

On a line before the writer now, sample inquiries obtained by mail average 70
cents each. The same ads bring inquiries at from 18 cents to 22 cents each when the
coupons are presented at a local store.

Most people write few letters. Writing is an effort. Perhaps they have no stamps
in the house. Most people will pay carfare to get a sample rather than two cents postage.
Therefore, it is always best, where possible, to have samples delivered locally.

On one line three methods were offered. The woman could write for a sample, or
telephone, or call at a store. Seventy percent of the inquiries came by telephone. The use
of the telephone is more common and convenient than the use of stamps.

Sometimes it is not possible to supply all dealers with samples. Then we refer
people to some central stores. These stores are glad to have many people come there.
And other dealers do not generally object so long as they share in the sales.

It is important to have these dealers send you the coupons promptly. Then you
can follow up the inquiries while their interest is fresh.

It is said that sample users repeat. They do to some extent. But repeaters form a
small percentage. Figure it in your cost.

Say to the woman, “Only one sample to a home” and few women will try to get
more of them. And the few who cheat you are not generally the people who would buy.
So you are not losing purchasers, but the samples only.

On numerous lines we have for long offered full-sized packages free. The
packages were priced at from 10 cents to 50 cents each. In certain territories for a time
we have checked up on repeaters. And we found the loss much less than the cost of
checking.

In some lines samples would be wasted on children, and they are most apt to get
them. Then say in your coupon “adults only.” Children will not present such coupons,
and they will rarely mail them in.

But one must be careful about publishing coupons good for a full-size package at
any store. Some people, and even dealers, may buy up many papers. We do not
announce the date of such offers. And we insert them in Sunday papers, not so easily
bought up.

But we do not advocate samples given out promiscuously. Samples distributed to
homes, like waifs on the doorsteps, probably never pay. Many of them never reach the

-----

house or the housewife. When they do, there is no prediction for them. The product is
cheapened. It is not introduced in a favorable way.

So with demonstrations in stores. There is always a way to get the same results at
a fraction of the cost.

Many advertisers do not understand this. They supply thousands of samples to
dealers to be handed out as they will. Could a trace be placed on the cost of returns, the
advertiser would be stunned.

Give samples to interested people only. Give them only to people who exhibit
that interest by some effort. Give them only to people whom you have told your story.
First create an atmosphere of respect, a desire, an expectation. When people are in that
mood, your sample will usually confirm the qualities you claim.

Here again comes the advantage of figuring cost per customer. That is the only
way to gauge advertising. Samples sometimes seem to double advertising cost. They
often cost more than the advertising. Yet, rightly used, they almost invariably form the
cheapest way to get customers. And that is what you want.

The argument against samples are usually biased. They may come from
advertising agents who like to see all the advertising money spent in print. Answer such
arguments by tests. Try some towns with them, some without. Where samples are
effectively employed, we rarely find a line where they do not lessen the cost per
customer.
