Direct response advertising in magazines and television So far this chapter has been about direct mail. Now I am going to tell you what I have learned about a parallel science – advertisements in magazines and on television which invite people to send their orders direct to you, without going to a store.

-----

###### In print advertisements, your headline is the most important element. The other day I saw one headline produce �ve times as many orders as another. If your headline promises your strongest and most distinct bene�t, you are on your way to success.
 Good photographs of your product cost more than bad ones, but they also sell more. When you want to show something that cannot be photographed, like cutaways of the inside of your product, use a drawing.
 Long copy sells more than short copy, particularly when you are asking the reader to spend a lot of money. Only amateurs use short copy.
 Cross-heads give breathing space to your copy, and make it more readable. They should be written in such a way that skimmers get the main points of your sales story.
 Testimonials increase credibility – and sales. If one testimonial tests well, try two. But don’t use testimonials by celebrities, unless they are recognized authorities, like Arnold Palmer on golf clubs.
 Winston Churchill said, ‘Short words are best, and the old words when short are best of all.’ This applies in spades to mail order copy.
 Set your copy in black type on white paper. You will already know how much I loathe ‘reverse type’ – white on black – for the very good reason that it reduces readership. There are only two exceptions. People read theater programs in the dark, holding them up against the light coming from the stage, so they are easier to read when set in reverse. So are slides projected onto a screen.
 Readers often skip from the headline to the coupon, to �nd out what your o�er is. So make your coupons mini-ads, complete with brand name, promise and a miniature photograph of your product.
 Many readers tell themselves they will mail the coupon ‘later,’ but never get around to it. One survey showed that twice as much response is lost in this way as is received by the advertiser. Here are four ways to keep your prospects on the hook:

 ‘Limited edition’

 ‘Limited supply’

-----

###### ‘Last time at this price’

 ‘Special price for promptness’

 It used to be thought that the more cluttered your layout, the more you would sell. My observation has been the opposite. Tidy, well- organized layouts actually increase coupon returns.

 Where to advertise You know exactly how many inquiries, and ultimately how many orders you get from each insertion in each publication. One magazine may perform twice as well as another. Such variations can be enough to make the di�erence between pro�t and loss.
 Watch the media your competitors use, in particular the media they continue to use. Watch for editorial changes in magazines. They may attract your kind of reader, or may drive them away.
 Go easy on two-page spreads. They cost twice as much as single pages, but seldom produce twice as many orders. Test di�erent units of space, like a page and a business reply card versus a page alone. Although the card may double the cost, it can sometimes generate four times as many orders as the page alone.

###### When you advertise repeatedly in the same magazine, response rates almost always drop. In some magazines, your ad may make a pro�t six times a year, while you may be able to use other magazines twelve times before they become unpro�table.

 Television It may surprise you to know that the right kind of television commercial can persuade people to order products by mail or

-----

###### telephone – mostly telephone. The ‘right kind’ are those which set up a problem and demonstrate how your product can solve it; give a money-back guarantee; include the price; and ask for the order, explicitly and urgently.
 The demonstrations should promise not one bene�t, but several. (This runs counter to the Procter & Gamble formula.)
 My partner Al Eico� has had more experience than anyone in selling direct on television. He has almost never seen a commercial shorter than two minutes produce pro�table sales. These marathon commercials don’t seem to irritate people as much as a cluster of short ones – ‘like �ve salesmen knocking on the door, one after another.’
 You must allow 20 seconds to give information on how to order. This is long enough to give your toll-free telephone number and post o�ce box number, complete with supers; and to repeat the charge- free telephone number at least twice.
 Most advertisers measure their purchases on television time by cost per thousand viewers reached, but Eico� measures them by the number of orders he receives each time a station broadcasts one of his commercials. He then eliminates the time periods and the stations that don’t pay o�. The most productive times are early morning, late evening and weekends. January, February and March are the most pro�table months.
 The better the program on which your commercials appear, the fewer sales you make. When viewers are bored by an old movie, they are more likely to pick up the telephone and order your product than when they are riveted by an episode of Dallas.
 Remember, there is no correlation between the size of your audience and the number of orders you receive.

 Every chapter in this book is of necessity an over-simpli�cation of a more-or-less complicated subject, and no more so than this one. If you want to know more about direct response, start by reading

 Advertising for good causes

##### And raising money for charity

###### orty years ago, the advertising establishment in the United States set up the Advertising Council to provide free campaigns for

## F

###### US Savings Bonds, the Red Cross and other good causes. In 1979, the media gave $600,000,000 worth of free time and space to the Council’s campaigns, and the agencies charged nothing for their services. In 1980, the Council’s campaign to encourage co-operation with the Census received $38,000,000 worth of free time and space.
 This admirable system has one drawback: the success of each campaign depends on the generosity of the media, which cannot be predicted. The system in Britain is more controllable: the government provides the money.

 Here are six examples of advertising for good causes.

 World Wildlife Fund During a period of �ve years, Ogilvy & Mather begged $6,500,000 worth of free advertising from media for the World Wildlife Fund – in 16 countries.

 New York Philharmonic In 1957 the New York Philharmonic was low in the water. The musicians were demoralized, playing to half-empty houses. My simple solution was to buy a page in the New York Times and publish the complete schedule for the coming season, in advance.

-----

###### Years later, someone who was in a position to know told me that this had done as much as Leonard Bernstein to put the Philharmonic back on its feet.

 United Negro College Fund A letter was distributed in commuter trains leaving Grand Central Station for the a�uent suburbs. It began: ‘When this train emerges from the tunnel at 108th Street this evening, look out of the window’. What the commuters saw was the black slums of Harlem. In a single evening this letter produced contributions of $26,000 for the United Negro College Fund.

_personal methods of fund-raising._

###### Sierra Club Howard Gossage, the most articulate rebel in the advertising business, held that advertising was too valuable an instrument to waste on commercial products.

###### Teenage alcoholism in Norway In 1974 the Norwegian Government started an advertising campaign to reduce alcoholism among teenagers. The �rst advertisements were aimed at boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16, with headlines such as ‘I vomit almost every time I drink’. Readership was the highest ever recorded in Norway. Later, the campaign was modi�ed to address parents, explaining why children drink and the risks they run, with headlines like: ‘The average Norwegian 16/17

###### year-old drank 155 bottles of alcohol last year. Parents should know what damage their children are risking.’ More than 70 per cent of Norwegian parents read these advertisements, and the campaign triggered a massive discussion in the media. Drinking among teenagers decreased for the �rst time in many years.

_In 1966, a group of Arizona Senators proposed a Bill which would have approved the �ooding of part of the Grand Canyon_
_for an unnecessary hydroelectric project. Howard Gossage’s agency in San Francisco ran a campaign for the conservationist_

_Sierra Club who opposed it. His �rst ad pulled 3,000 applications for club membership – and the hydroelectric project was_
_scrapped. Gossage believed that advertising justi�ed its existence only when used for social purposes. The most articulate rebel_

_in the advertising business, he said things like-this: ‘I love the advertising business. I truly do, although it’s no business of a_

_grown man. I love it because it’s such a lovely Augean stable to clean up.’_

###### Cancer in India In 1978 a survey in Bombay revealed that knowledge of the causes, symptoms and treatment of cancer was abysmally low. Then the Indian Cancer Society asked my Indian partners to mount an advertising campaign. The purpose of the campaign was to change attitudes from ignorance and fatalism to understanding and optimism. Only then could people be persuaded to have regular check-ups at the free clinics of the Society. The theme was one of hope: ‘Life after cancer … it’s worth living’. The advertisements showed real people who had been cured. Within two months, the number of check-ups given by the clinics tripled. (See this page.)

_Two in a series of advertisements created by the Oslo o�ce of Ogilvy & Mather on the subject of teenage alcoholism. Left The_

_headline quotes a 14-year-old girl: ‘I vomit almost every time I drink.’ Readership was the highest ever recorded in Norway._

_the damage he risks.’ More than 70 per cent of Norwegian parents read these advertisements, and drinking among teenagers_

###### Raising money Before you rush o� to your favorite charity and volunteer to raise money by running advertisements, I must warn you that it is rare

-----

###### for any advertisement, however powerful, to bring in enough direct contributions to pay for the cost of the space.
 What advertising can do, is to ‘sensitize’ the market, thus making it easier to raise money by more personal methods of solicitation. It is di�cult to persuade people to give money to a charity unless they know something about it.

 Competing with Procter & Gamble

##### Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?

###### f you are going to advertise disposable diapers, fabric softeners, cleansers, toothpaste, soap or dishwashing liquids, you are going to

## I

###### �nd yourself up against Procter & Gamble. They have market shares of at least 40 per cent in all these categories, plus powerful positions in shampoo, cake mix, co�ee, anti-perspirants and home permanents. They spend $700,000,000 a year on advertising, more than any other company, and their sales are $12,000,000,000 a year.
 Your chances of competing successfully against this juggernaut will be improved if you understand the reasons for its overwhelming success, so I am going to tell you what my partner Kenneth Roman has learned about them.
 First, P&G is disciplined. Their guiding philosophy is to plan thoroughly, minimize risk, and stick to their proven principles.
 To get a broad trial quickly, they distribute home-delivered samples on a massive scale. In 1977 their Chairman said, ‘The largest part of our initial investment is usually in the form of introductory sampling.…Only when satis�ed customers have had �rsthand experience with the product will the elements of the marketing mix, such as advertising and selling, be fully productive.’
 They never enter small categories unless they expect them to grow, and they set out to dominate every category they enter. By building huge volume, they achieve lower manufacturing costs than

-----

###### their competitors, and this gives them higher pro�t margins, or permits them to sell at a lower price.
 They often enter more than one brand in a category, and allow each brand to compete with its sibling – with no holds barred.
 They use market research to identify consumer needs. Says Ed Harness, their former Chairman, ‘We are forever trying to see what lies around the corner.…We study the consumer and try to identify new trends in tastes, needs, environment and living habits.’
 Most important of all, they have a way of creating products which are superior to their competitors’. And, by blind in-home tests, they make sure that the superiority is apparent to the consumer. Says Harness, ‘The key to successful marketing is superior product performance.…If the consumer does not perceive any real bene�ts in the brand, then no amount of ingenious advertising and selling can save it.’
 When they launch new brands, they advertise them heavily, and they support their successful brands with large budgets – $29,000,000 for Crest, $24,000,000 for High Point, $19,000,000 for Pampers, $17,000,000 for Tide, and so on.
 Their test-marketing is unbelievably thorough – and patient. They tested Folger’s regional expansion program for six years before moving into the East. ‘Patience,’ says their President, ‘is one of the virtues of this company.’ They would rather be right than �rst. Only three products in the history of P&G have gone national without being test-marketed for at least six months. Two of them failed.
 My admiration for their advertising principles is boundless, not least because they are the same as my own. They use research to determine the most e�ective strategy, and never change a successful strategy. Their strategies for Tide, Crest, Zest and Ivory Bar have not changed for thirty years.
 They always promise the consumer one important bene�t. When they perceive that there is an opportunity to increase sales by promising more than one, they sometimes run two campaigns at the same time – often in the same medium.
 They believe that the �rst duty of advertising is to communicate e�ectively, not to be original or entertaining, and they measure
