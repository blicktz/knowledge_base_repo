Does it take your associates 15 minutes to compile all the information you need for your next patient? That’s just too long.

 And it is time and money wasted. You could be spending that time working with your patient instead.

 It’s not your associates’ fault. It is the tools they’re working with.
 In the last two years, we kept hearing about
 dentists and dental associates having problems with accessing too many databases to get the information they needed.

 Patient history was a nightmare to pull together.

 Treatments, recommendations, medical research, and office reports needed to be pulled daily. Too much time was involved, making office procedures very slow- moving.

 So we, at Biedermort, got to work to solve the problem and came up with PantherWorks. The platform runs fast and

### VIDEO SALES LETTERS (VSLS)

 Video sales letters originally were created on a type of whiteboard screen. This is where you see a sentence typed onto the page, while a voice-over speaks the text as well. It is usually one sentence, maybe two sentences at a time for each slide.
 These are presented as rather long videos and typically concern topics in the health or financial industries. They really can be about anything at all, but there is always a danger of making such a video carry on for too long, losing the viewer’s attention along the way.
 Video clips can be short, but for direct response marketing, video sales letters typically run fifteen to forty-five minutes or longer; the script is around 2,000 to 7,000 words.
 A key difference between video sales letters and static (landing pages or print) sales letters is this: a prospect may read a conventional text sales letter several times and can go back to reread portions if desired. And they often do. But the prospect can only watch an entire video sales letter straight through; she has no ability to choose the portions she views.

-----

### That in mind, here are some guidelines for writing effective video sales letters:

 1. The way to begin is to grab audience attention with a statement that
 breaks them out of their normal pattern. Surprise them. Shake them up. 2. Tell an engaging story that sweeps the listener along with it.
 Superstar marketer Michael Masterson calls this the “velvet slide.” 3. Keep is simple. The “information density”—the number of facts per
 page—should be about 20 percent less than a text-based promotion. 4. Use short sentences and especially short words. I don’t use any
 word longer than 9 letters. 5. Use short paragraphs—a couple of sentences is typical. This makes
 the text on the video easier to read. 6. If you want to dramatize or prove a copy claim or fact, you can
 insert a chart or graph into the video presentation. Even if the prospect has only a few seconds to view it, charts and graphs give the impression that your point is well backed up. 7. You can concisely state the problem your product solves in the lead
 of the video sales letter, but be sure to explain the solution within the first minute or two. If you wait too long to get to the solution, you risk having the prospect click away in boredom. 8. Don’t use more than two numbers in a sentence. If you do, round
 off at least one of them. 9. The tone of the copy should be positive and enthusiastic because
 the prospect hears a voice reading the text. But it should also sound authoritative.

 When I talk about video sales letters, invariably I hear the objection, “They’re too long! I always click away. Who would sit there for thirty minutes and watch?”
 But plenty of people do. How do I know? Testing shows repeatedly that video sales letters usually generate higher conversion rates than static landing pages.

-----

### If you still object to video sales letters because you just don’t like them, I quote this advice from ace copywriter Peter Beutel: “Don’t let personal preference get in the way.”

## WRITING FOR CONTENT MARKETING

### Content marketing—giving away free information to build your brand, increase response to marketing campaigns, convert more online traffic, and educate the prospect on your technology, methodology, products, and services—is one of the hot trends in marketing today.
 Other marketing methods also increasing in usage today include online video, social media, quick response codes (QRCs), search engine optimization (SEO), live online chat, and infographics. In August 2017, Apple announced that the company is making a $1 billion investment in original content.[1]
 The term “content marketing” may have been coined in 1996, at a roundtable for journalists held at the American Society for Newspaper Editors by John F. Oppedahl. That would mean the name “content marketing” is over twenty years old.
 But in fact content marketing has been used for far longer than that. It’s only a new name for a vintage method. I personally have been doing content marketing for nearly four decades, and some marketers have been at it even longer.
 I did my first content marketing campaign in 1980. At the time, I was advertising manager of Koch Engineering, an industrial manufacturing company owned and run by the late David Koch, who then, despite running for vice president of the United States on the libertarian party ticket, was relatively unknown. He later became a household name, one half of the infamous “billionaire Koch brothers.”

### One of the products we sold were various “tower internals,” and one type of internal was the “tray.” These are circular metal disks with capped openings on their surfaces. The trays are placed inside refinery towers to enhance the distillation of crude oil into kerosene, gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel, and other petroleum-based products.
 Specifying the correct configuration for the design of trays for your particular refinery is a highly technical task, and the engineers who worked in the refineries needed instruction on how to do it correctly.
 To assist and educate them, we produced a design manual that we dubbed the “tray manual.” It cost us several dollars per copy to print and bind. The manual had stiff covers, spiral binding, and fold-out blueprint- style drawings showing the configurations of various trays. By the way, the tray manual was neither my idea nor my creation; it was already in use when I joined the firm.
 The tray manual was wildly popular—by far our most requested piece of literature. The way it worked was this. First, by offering a valuable and relevant technical manual for free, we increased inquiries from the ad. Second, it helped the prospect specify the trade configuration he needed, and when he had done that following our design advice, naturally he ordered the tray from us, not from our competitors. Third, it helped establish Koch Engineering as a thought leader in refinery distillation.
 Back then, we didn’t call it “content marketing.” We called it “giving away free information.” The practice was the same. We just didn’t have a name for it.
 Content marketing has been used for well over a century. To test response to print ads, Claude Hopkins (1866–1932) offered free informational booklets in many of his ads.
 And in 1916, Campbell’s began promoting its soups with content marketing by offering free booklets of recipes that used Campbell’s soups in the dishes.[2]
 Back in those days, this free content was simply called “free booklets.” In the later part of the twentieth century, marketers referred to them as “bait pieces,” because the booklet or other free information offer helped “hook” prospects and turn them into leads.

-----

**Fig. 17.1: Free content offers are used as “bait” by many marketers to get leads from prospects. For**
this reason, free booklets and other free content were called “bait pieces.” Today they are known as
“lead magnets.”

### Today the preferred term for “free content” is “lead magnet,” the idea being that the tempting offer of valuable free information is like a magnet that draws people into your ad and gets them to respond and request the white paper or other free content.
 There are all sorts of published opinions and tests on the effectiveness of content marketing. But let me sum up my experience in just two simple points.
 First, I can’t remember the last time I did a B2B or B2C marketing campaign without a free content offer.
 For B2B, the lead magnet is often the primary offer and what drives prospects to respond. For B2C, the free content is often a bonus report given as an added gift with purchase of the product.
 Second, on average, adding the offer of a lead magnet to a B2B lead generation campaign can often double the number of inquiries—and often much more—versus the same campaign without the free content offer.
 Plus, according to an October 3, 2016, poll by FierceCMO, more than four thousand Forbes readers found that branded content was 9 percent more effective than paid advertising at getting consumers to consider buying a particular brand.
 In the good old days of B2B marketing, our primary offer was a “free color brochure” filled with sales copy about the product. It worked then. But today, prospects respond better if you also promise to send them free information that will be useful to them in their job.

### THE 7 MOST COMMON CONTENT WRITING MISTAKES

 1—Mediocre writing. Content writing is in many organizations at the bottom of the barrel as far as respect for those who do it and the value placed on it.
 The reason: the more technical a skill (e.g., software engineering), the fewer people who can do it. But writing is a soft skill: everyone writes, as Ann Handley claims in the title of her book Everybody Writes (Wiley, 2014). But can they? And at what level?
 Prolific author Harlan Ellison, who passed away in 2018, once said the following to me: “[People think] they can drive a car more brilliantly than Fangio, and everybody else on the road is inept; they can screw like Don Juan and delight the g-spot every time; and they can write. Better than King, better than Dickens, better than Homer. When in fact these are three of the most difficult things in the world to do, and only a very few people do even one with grandeur, much less all three well.”
 2—Mediocre research. Increasingly content is “Google goulash.” The writer uses Google to quickly research a few articles on the topic. He cobbles them together into a new article, one with no originality or firsthand knowledge, no wisdom, and no new thoughts or insights.
 It can make good clickbait in some cases. But really, what’s the point? All you are actually doing is adding to the cloud of “content pollution” growing out of control on the Web today.
 3—Taking the easy way out. There are four levels of content, which from lowest to highest are why, what, how, and done for you.
 The lowest form tells people why they should do something (e.g., “Why You Should Start an In-House Call Center”).
 The argument may be convincing and help readers make an important decision. But it provides no further help than influencing the reader’s yes- no decision.
 Next rung up on the content ladder is telling them what to do (e.g., “7 Steps to Planning and Implementing an In-House Call Center”). You get an action plan with the steps laid out. But you still have no idea how to do each step.

-----

### Climbing higher, our content tells them how to do it, though these are often tips rather than step-by-step instructions. Still, now we have actionable steps or ideas leading to a tangible result: a functional call center.
 At the top of the content hierarchy is done for you. For instance, if you tell the reader he needs prewritten scripts, you provide models or samples of telemarketing scripts that can be easily modified to fit the reader’s business, saving her time and money.
 So many content writers take the easy way out and tell the reader only what to do and why to do it. Stronger content shows the reader how to do it and, when possible, does some of the work for her.
 4—No interviewing or fact checking with subject matter experts (SMEs). Especially for technical content or content about your company’s proprietary methodology or systems, many content writers may have surface knowledge. But they often need a deeper dive to produce a particular content piece. SMEs can give them an explanation that is at least somewhat comprehensible and likely accurate.
 5—Content writers who do not understand the subject matter at hand. Content writers who have a degree, training, or background in the subject matter should probably be on the team working on a project where their expertise would enhance their contributions.
 For instance, I have a BS in chemical engineering, which gives me an advantage when writing in the chemical industry. I don’t know the client’s product in detail. But when I interview their SMEs, the engineers are immediately at ease with me because we have a common background and I speak their lingo.
 6—Not crediting your sources. If you say in your article that 35 percent of U.S. companies have an in-house call center, your client will want to know the source of that statistic. If you found it on the Web, credit the source with the full URL. You can do this either in the copy or with a footnote.
 Cite your source whether it is a trade journal, a technical paper presented at an association meeting, your client’s own Web site, or an interview with one of its SMEs. If someone you interview gives you the information, you

 7—The content is purely your subjective opinion. Of course you can give your opinion. But the best opinions are evidence-based and supported by statistics, graphs, examples, logical arguments, and facts. As marketers, we cannot merely make our points; we must prove our points, lest our readers remain unconvinced.

 THE 4 CONTENT FORMATS

 There are four modes by which your prospects absorb your content: reading, listening, watching, and doing. Yet you do not know which mode the prospect prefers.
 For that reason, you want to produce multiple pieces of content that, combined, cover all four modes of learning. That way, you have relevant content in the format your prospects like best. Many of these formats are listed in Table 17-1 according to the mode of learning they best serve.
