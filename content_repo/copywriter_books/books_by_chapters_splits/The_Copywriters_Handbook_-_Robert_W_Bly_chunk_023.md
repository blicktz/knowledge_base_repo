### These provide useful information that helps the reader do something better (“How to Choose the Right Lighting for Your Small Business,” “Seven Ways to Cut Energy Costs,” “A Guide to Ball-Bearing Selection”). How-to articles are also known as “tutorials,” perhaps because they tutor the reader in a new skill or area of knowledge.
 The how-to article is content marketing (see chapter 17). It does not discuss your product directly (your company shouldn’t even be mentioned, except in the byline). Instead, it promotes you indirectly by establishing your firm’s reputation as a leader in the field. Readers tend to clip and save how-to articles. So, although your article may not generate immediate business, some people will keep it and call on you when the need arises.

 3. Issue Articles

 In issue articles, industry experts speak out on some topical, controversial, or technical issue of the day. These articles help strengthen your company’s image as a leader in its field. Example: “Should Internet Users Be Prosecuted for Illegal Downloading of Movies, Music, and Other Copyrighted Materials?”

 4. News

 News articles are usually prepared by staff editors and reporters, not outsiders. Occasionally, though, a corporation with big news to report—a merger, an acquisition, a revolutionary new invention—will work with a reporter to develop a feature story. The reporter gets a scoop, while the company gets good press.

 QUERY LETTERS

 The first step in getting a feature story published in a magazine is to get an editor interested in the article topic. This means first suggesting the topic to the editor, either in a phone conversation or by letter, usually sent today as an e-mail.

-----

### Some editors will listen to your pitch over the phone. Most want to see the idea written up in a short proposal known as a “query letter.” This is a one- or two-page outline, in letter form, of the article you propose to write.
 The query letter explains what the article is about, what your “angle” is, why the magazine’s readers will be interested in the article, and what makes you qualified to write it. The letter is also a demonstration of your writing style. Boring query letters rarely result in an article assignment, because the editor assumes your article will be as boring as your letter.
 Here is a sample of a query that got me an assignment to write an article for Amtrak Express:

Mr. James A. Frank, Editor
AMTRAK EXPRESS
34 East 51st Street
New York, NY 10022

Dear Mr. Frank:
Is this letter a waste of paper?

Yes—if it fails to get the desired result.
In business, most letters and memos are written to generate a specific response—close a
sale, set up a meeting, get a job interview, make a contact. Many of these letters fail to do their
job.

Part of the problem is that business executives and support staff don’t know how to write
persuasively. The solution is a formula first discovered by advertising copywriters—a formula
called AIDA. AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.

First, the letter gets attention … with a hard-hitting lead paragraph that goes straight to the
point, or offers an element of intrigue.

Then, the letter hooks the reader’s interest. The hook is often a clear statement of the
reader’s problems, her needs, her desires. If you are writing to a customer who received
damaged goods, state the problem. And then promise a solution.

Next, create desire. You are offering something—a service, a product, an agreement, a
contract, a compromise, a consultation. Tell the reader the benefit he’ll receive from your
offering. Create a demand for your product.

Finally, call for action. Ask for the order, the signature, the check, the go-ahead.
I’d like to give you a 1,500-word article on “How to Write Letters That Get Results.” The
piece will illustrate the AIDA formula with a variety of actual letters and memos from
insurance companies, banks, manufacturers, and other organizations.

This letter, too, was written to get a specific result—an article assignment from the editor of
_Amtrak Express._

Did it succeed?

Regards,
Bob Bly

### Editors usually respond to query letters within a month or so. (If a month goes by and you haven’t heard, follow up with another letter or a phone call.)
 A positive response to a query is, “Your proposed article idea interests us. Send a manuscript.” This means the editor wants to see the article. It doesn’t mean a promise to publish it. The editor won’t make that decision until after reading it. A positive response to a query letter is no guarantee that your article will be printed.
 If the editor turns down your proposal, you can send your query letter to other publications. Few article ideas are restricted to one magazine only. Most are appropriate for at least half a dozen publications or more.
 In the twenty-first century, most publications want to receive digital queries. They either provide an e-mail address on their site to where you can send your query or else have an online submission form for proposing article ideas. When sent via e-mail, the query letter is pasted into the body of the e-mail, not transmitted as an e-mail attachment.

 HOW TO WRITE A SPEECH

 Business and association executives don’t always communicate by writing articles. Sometimes they make speeches. And, as with article writing, executives often hire ghostwriters to write their speeches for them.
 When I got my first speech-writing assignment, I was paralyzed with fear because I had no idea how long—in minutes or words—a speech should be.
 Now I do. The average speaker speaks at a rate of 120 words a minute. It follows that a twenty-minute speech should be 2,400 words long.
 For lunch and dinner talks, many speeches are brief, about twenty minutes. Less seems insubstantial. More can get boring. No speech, no matter how important, should last more than an hour.

-----

### Every speech should have a clear-minded purpose. Most speeches are given to entertain, to teach, to persuade, or to inspire.
 Speeches are effective at getting across ideas, opinions, and emotions. They are less effective at transmitting a large body of facts (print is the appropriate medium for that).
 Here are some additional tips for writing speeches that accomplish their goals without boring the audience to tears:

 1. Find Out What the Speaker Wants to Say

 Few writing assignments are as personal or as idiosyncratic as writing someone else’s speech. You’ll avoid headaches if you take the time to know the speaker’s requirements before you sit down to write.
 “You have to ask the right questions of your client to prepare a speech that he’ll deliver as if he really means it,” writes freelancer Nancy Edmonds Hanson. “Sometimes a lengthy discussion of the topic is necessary before the client himself clarifies his position on it. Your job is to probe, to ask him to carry his own thoughts a little further until he’s worked the topic through in his own mind.”
 Interviews with the client reveal the basic thrust of the speech and provide most of the facts. Information gaps can be filled in through library research or by browsing through the client’s private files on the subject.

 2. Know Your Audience

 Learn as much as you can about the group you’ll be speaking to. This will help you tailor your talk to their specific interests. For example, a speech on podcasting should be geared toward the professional interests of the audience. Engineers are interested in the technology: how it works. Advertising executives want to know more about podcasting as a marketing medium.

 3. Write a Strong Opening

 The first sentence uttered by the speaker is like the headline of an advertisement or the lead paragraph of a direct-mail piece. An engaging

-----

### opening grabs attention and gets the audience enthusiastic about your topic. A sample speech introduction:

Today, I would like to share with you some of my innermost thoughts and memories, which
have been locked away deep in my heart for the longest time. It has been seven years since the
passing of my husband, Joseph. This is the first time many of these memories and thoughts
will see the light of day. I have agreed to speak with you today in order to impress upon you
the importance of Sephardic Bikur Holim (SBH) and what it meant to my children. My story
starts with something we all know, yet very rarely face, and that is how vulnerable we all
really are.

Joseph was a wonderful husband, a caring father, and a successful businessman. He had such
a passion for helping others, and he took the plight of the unfortunate very personally. He was
instrumental in making SBH the organization that it is today, and it was always his dream to
become a social worker. To me it seemed like a natural progression for Joseph to trade in his
business career for college life.

### 4. Then, There’s Humor

 Speechwriters are always uncertain when it comes to using humor. They know that humor can quickly warm an audience to the speaker. But a joke that bombs can ruin the whole talk.
 My advice is to pepper the speech with little tidbits of warm, gentle, good-natured humor. Not big gags, old jokes, or nightclub-comic routines. Just a few well-chosen, humorous comments that make the speaker seem a bit more human. Audiences respond well to self-effacing humor.
 Leading off with a prepared joke is risky. Often jokes fall flat, because what is funny to some people is not to others. Worse, some audience members may think you are there to clown and have nothing important to say.

 5. Don’t Try to Cover Too Much

 Remember, a twenty-minute speech has only 2,400 words. Also, the spoken word is often not quite as compact as written English. Therefore, there’s only so much information you can put in your talk.
 Don’t try to cover your whole subject. Just break off a little piece of it and tell your story with warmth, wit, humor, and authority. Delete trivial information and limit your talk to the important key points.

-----

### For example, “Your Career” is too broad a topic for a speech. “How to Start Your Own Digital Agency” is a more manageable subject for an after- dinner talk.

 6. Write in a Conversational Tone

 Speeches are to be heard, not read. A speech is one person talking, and it should sound like talking, not like an academic thesis or a corporate memorandum.
 Write in a conversational tone. That means short words. Short sentences. Plenty of contractions. Even a colloquial expression every now and then.
 The best test of a speech is to read the draft aloud. If it doesn’t sound natural, rewrite it until it does.
 Use bullets, headings, and numbers to divide the speech into sections. The speaker can catch her breath during the pauses between sections.
 If the copy can’t be broken up this way, then indicate places where the speaker can pause between paragraphs. These stops give nervous speakers a chance to slow down.

 7. Keep It Simple

 A speech is not the appropriate medium for delivering complex ideas and sophisticated theories.
 For one thing, a speech is limited in the amount of information it can contain. For another, the listener can’t stop to ponder a point or go back to information presented earlier (as he can when reading an article, ad, or brochure).
 Ideally, your speech should be centered around one main point or theme. If a fact or observation doesn’t tie in with this point, throw it out.
 Give the listener easy-to-grasp tidbits of information and advice. Don’t try to get the audience to follow a rigorous mathematical proof, a complex argument, or a complicated process. They won’t.

 8. What About Visuals?

-----

### When I worked in the corporate world in the 1970s, slides were the rage. No speaker would think of giving a presentation without a carousel full of brightly colored slides to back him up. Today, PowerPoint presentations run on laptops and are projected onto screens large enough for everyone in the audience to see.
 In some cases, visuals can be useful. If you want to introduce the new corporate logo, you must show a visual of it; words alone can’t adequately describe a graphic concept.
 Avoid making text slides too wordy, as the more text on the slide, the smaller the words will appear on the screen. A good rule of thumb is to have a maximum of five bullets per slide with no more than five words per bullet.

 9. Handouts

 At conferences, attendees often get a thick binder containing the PowerPoint presentations from all of the speakers. When speaking to local groups, a reprint of an article you wrote makes a good handout. Or you can distribute a sheet summarizing your key points.

 10. Pick a Catchy Title for Your Speech

 When you speak, you’ll lead off with the first sentence, not the title. But the title will be used in mailings, flyers, and other promotions aimed at attracting an audience for your talk. The name of your speech can make the difference between an empty house and an attentive crowd.
 “Effective Management of Overseas Trade Show Exhibits” is a boring title. “How to Set Up a Booth at a Japanese Electronics Show—And Live to Tell About It” is much more enticing.

 WRITING PROMOTIONAL NEWSLETTERS

 Many organizations publish newsletters that they distribute free to customers, clients, prospects, employees, journal editors, and decision makers in their industries.

-----

### Most companies today use e-newsletters distributed as e-mails. They work. But a minority of marketers mail traditional paper newsletters (fig. 9.1). Because of their rarity, they stand out more than the electronic kind.
 Whether you use print or digital, the stories in these newsletters are similar in tone and content to the press releases and feature stories I’ve discussed—only the articles are usually shorter. Newsletters are designed to promote, either directly or indirectly, the organization and its activities, services, or products.
 The newsletter has less credibility than a story appearing in a magazine or on major media Web sites, because readers know it is self-published by the firm. On the other hand, a company can use the newsletter to say whatever it wants without fear of being censored, rewritten, or misquoted by an editor.
 Newsletters build your image and reputation with a select group of prospects (those who receive the newsletter) over a period of time.

**Fig. 9.1: Copywriter’s rough layout of a two-sided, 8½ x 11–inch newsletter.**

-----

### Many clients start out with ambitious plans to publish the newsletter on a regular basis—every quarter, every other month, every month. But when media costs run over budget for the new Facebook ad campaign, the marketing manager may make up the difference by skipping an issue or two of his newsletter.
 Companies try to lure freelancers and agencies to do their newsletters for a low price with the logic, “It’s not as key as advertising or online videos, so we can’t afford to spend a lot. But we’ll make up the difference with volume, since it’s a steady thing.”
 Writers and agencies should approach newsletters with caution. Often a promised assignment of six newsletters turns into two.
 The typical print promotional newsletter is four pages long. Text is set in two or three columns, and there is little or no white space. There are three or four major feature stories (about 200 to 500 words each), a few short items (two to three paragraphs), and a number of photos with captions.
 Most of the stories are not written especially for the newsletter but come from other sources: press releases, condensed feature articles, speeches, case histories, sales literature, ad campaigns, social media posts, and webinars. In this way, the newsletter gives additional exposure to messages you’re communicating in other media.
 For instance, a bank published a newsletter called “As a Matter of Fact: A Consumer Newsletter with Money Facts for You.” It was available from a rack display at local branches and filled with helpful information on personal finance. Articles included “The Mortgage Maze,” “The 10% Factor … the Facts Behind Withholding Taxes on Interest,” “Recovering from the Recession,” and “The Pathway to Investing.”
 The relationship between a bank and its customers is based on trust. By providing investment counseling at no cost through its newsletter, the bank was helping to cement that relationship.
 A local supermarket published a four-page newsletter on food, available at the checkout counter. It contained tips on nutrition, exercise, food shopping, and cooking. Each issue also featured a number of recipes.
 By helping me exercise and eat right, the supermarket gained my goodwill. By giving me recipes, it got me to come into the store to buy
