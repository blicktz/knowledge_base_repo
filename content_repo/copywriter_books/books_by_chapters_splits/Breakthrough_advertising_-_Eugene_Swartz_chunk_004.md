Let's look at one more example of such breakthrough ad
vertising, and see the solutions the copy offered that made the

product a success.

One of the great ads of all times, of course, is the Sherwin
Codv ad. Though most advertising men are familiar with the ad,
they do not realize that the course itself was a tremendous departure for the times—far easier and simpler than anything else
that had gone before.

But the prospects for such a course were absolutely convinced that good English was too hard for them. They had tried
to learn it before, and had failed. Therefore, any new course that
could be successfully sold to them would have to redefine English for them . . . redefine mistakes in English for them . . . and
certainly redefine the process of turning; bad English into good
English for them.

The Codv ad is a masterpiece of Gradualization. It should
be memorized—not merely studied—by every copywriter. However, within it, in four paragraphs, is contained another masterpiece of breakthrough redefinition—from hard to easy with a few
simple ideas—that goes like this:

Onlv 15 Minutes a Day.
Nor is there verv much to learn. In Mr. Cody's years
of experimenting, he brought to light some highly astonishing facts about English.

For instance, statistics show that a list of sixty-nine
words (with their repetitions) make up more than half of
_all our speech and letter-icritin<i. Obviously, if we could_
learn to spell, use and pronounce these words correctly,
we would go far toward eliminating incorrect spelling and
pronunciation.

Similarly, Mr. Cody proved that there were no more
than one dozen fundamental principles of punctuation. If
we mastered these principles, there would be no bugbear
of punctuation to hamper us in our writing.

Finally he discovered that twenty-five typical errors in
grammar constitute nine-tenths of our everyday mistakes.
When one has learned how to avoid these twenty-five

pitfalls, how readily one can obtain the facility of speech
which denotes the person of breeding and education!

When the study of English is made so simple, it becomes clear that progress can be made in a very short time.
No more than fifteen minutes a dav is required

Thus the complicated becomes simple—the hard becomes
easy. This is the first use of Redefinition. Now let's look at the
second:

**2. Escalation**

Here you are dealing with a product which works, and which
is acknowledged to be easy enough to use—but which simply
does not have an appeal broad enough to assure it of a mass
market.

Your job here is to escalate your product. To give it more
_importance in your prospect's eves._

You do this again by Redefinition. You broaden the horizon
of benefits of the product. You redefine the role that the product pla\ s in the prospect's life. You widen the area of reward that
your product yields to the prospect—showing him that it enters
into dozens of vital situations every day, paving off for him wherehe might least expect it.

For example, let's look at another ad for another English
course forty years later. By now people are not as sensitive to
their punctuation or grammar. Now the negative aspect has lost
its appeal; people want good English as a persuasion tool to win
over other people.

So good English must cease to be an end in itself. It must
be redefined, to become instead a means to a more important
end—one which is desired by far more people. And, since the
positive aspect must now be dominant, that part of good English
which lias the greatest value for persuading people—vocabulary—
must now be featured.

Here is the ad:

Revolutionary new Word Power Machine makes you
a master of English overnight.

Automatically gives vou a power-packed vocabulary—
to make your ideas crackle with excitement ... to hold others spellbound with the power of vour speech and your
written word.

Automatically spots embarrassing errors in grammar,
spelling, pronunciation vou didn't even know you were
making. Clears them up at once. Frees vour mind from
worrv . . . lets you feel at ease in am[-] company . . . gives
vou the blazing new self-confidence vou need to make anybody like you—to win people over irresistiblv to your point
of view. . . .

This approach redefines the benefits of the product, shifting
them from a less desirable area to one that will generate more
sales appeal.

But this use of escalation—to increase benefit appeal—is only
one of the ways it can serve vou. Another is to increase the im_portance of the product—showing that something the prospect_
wants very much hinges directh upon the performance of your
product.

For example, in an ad for spark plugs, this fact was pointed

out to the reader:

Yes. You pay $2,000 . . . 83.000 . . . $4,000 for your car.
_And a single 99c part robs i/ou of the real power and en-_
joyment that car should give you.

Or here, in an advertisement for a speed math course:

If you want to get ahead fast... if vou want a position of real importance and responsibility—then a knowl_edge of this kind of super-fast, super-accurate mathematics_
_is 'AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY for your future!_

Or escalation can be used to show the prospect that your
product is not something to be put to work just once or twice a

week—but that it will be needed, and used, by him almost even
waking minute. Here's how this was done, in a single sub headline, in an ad for a course on handling people:

Your Entire Life is Spent Trying to Get Others to Do
What You Want—Without Fricti Oil:

You must agree with this statement. And therefore you must
redefine the importance to yourself of a technique which allows
you to accomplish the all-pervading task more easily, more effectively and more rapidly

This is the second use of Redefinition—escalation. Now let's
look at the third.

**3. Price Reduction**

Here you have the product which, quite simply, costs too
much. Your job is to make that price seem less. You do it by a
very simple act of redefinition, like this:

Why does the product cost too much? Because it's being
_compared icith other products in the same field. And how do you_
whittle away, psychologically, at this price? Bij switching the com_parison, and relating it to some other, more expensive standard._

For example, here is an enormously successful mail order ad
for spark plugs, which sold for $1.49 each, or one and a half
times the standard for the field, and twice as much as the discount price. Did the copywriter therefore sav that "Thev mav
cost a little more, but they're worth every cent of it." Of course
not. He made them cheap, and he did it in these two paragraphs
of psychological redefinition:

Up to now these extraordinary SA FIRE INJECTORS
were practically made by hand and would have to sell for
as high as $5 each. But we knew that 30 or 40 dollars was
more than the average driver could afford—so we decided
to get the price down so low that these injectors would pav
for themselves 12 times in one year of driving. So here is

inv astonishing proposition. If you will check your cars performance before and after you install your SA Fire Injector System and then tell your friends and neighbors about
them, here is what I am prepared to do for TOIL

_You can have a set of SA FIRE INJECTORS for the_
_year and model of your ear for only a fraction of their_
_value. If you act now they are only SI.49 each. . . ._

Do you see how he does it? Do you see how many times
he does it in these two short paragraphs? As a last review of redefinition—because its techniques are so important to you—let's
just list the individual phrases that build up. again and again, the
feeling of value and bargain.

Here they are. Did vou catch them all?
_"practically made by hand . ._
_"would have to sell for as hi^h as So each . . ."_
_"30 or 40 dollars . . ." (Notice that he repeats the hand-made_
price twice. First he gives it to vou per plug; and then jor the
_entire set. Thus the new comparative price is reinforced; you_
practically wince at the $40 figure since vou want the plugs by
this time. And you're going to feel pretty good when he brings
in the now-lower figure in the next paragraph.)

_"pet the price down so low . . ." (Here is the magic word,_
"low"; now legitimatized in your exes by the description of the
hand-made set in the phrases that preceded it.)

_"that these injectors would pay for themselves 12 times in_
_one year of driving. . ." (Not only value, but reward. Not only_
low-priced, but gas-saving. And again, the comparison to a higher
figure—this time the money you'll save on gas.)

_"astonishing proposition . . ." (Now the price becomes so low_
that the mere statement of it may cause you surprise. It may
sound slightlv cornv as we dissect it here, but it is incredibly effective in the context of the ad. And most of it—perhaps all of
it—is never consciously noticed by the prospect. He simply realizes that he feels that a bargain is being offered to him.)

_"If you will check your car's performance. . . and tell your_

-----

1 6 4 FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION

_friends and neighbors about them . . ." (The introduction of a con-_
dition—an action you must perform—in order to get the nowlow price. Used before in the last chapter in a different context:
here we see how the same device works again to substantiate.
with equal power, the feeling of value.)

_"prepared to do . . ." (Again the connotation of favor, of al-_
lowance, of discount.)

_"You can have . . ." (Not, "You can buy." He is letting vou_
_have the plugs at the low price. Again, he is doing vou a favor._
You are getting a bargain.)

_"only $1.49 each . . ." (The classic modifier. The tenth bargain-_
phrase in these two paragraphs.)

Notice how similar Gradualization and Redefinition are. Notice how each operates below the surface of the conscious mind.
Gradualization by its structure—by its arrangement of facts and
phrases. Redefinition by its rearrangement of perspective.

Each is an extremely subtle and powerful wav of building
belief. Each deserves much more study than we can give it in
this book.

Let us now turn to some equally powerful but more apparent mechanisms that also build belief.

### THE FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION

**How to Verbally Prove That Your**
**Product Does What You Claim**

As we have observed repeatedlv,
good advertising copy exists simultaneously in two different places.

Part of that copy is words on a page. Or sounds carried by
radio waves. Or pictures and sounds coming out of a television set.

But the other part of that copy—the crucial part—takes place
in your prospect's brain. It is the series of reactions—planned reactions and anticipated reactions—that your copy causes in his
mind and his emotions.

Actually, when your prospect reads your copy, he is engaging in a silent dialogue with you. You are feeding him ideas and
images and emotions, in a planned pattern; and he is feeding
back to you reactions to these ideas and images and emotions.

You hope—you plan—that these reactions will be favorable.

165

-----

I b b FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION

That they will be controlled reactions. That he will see the images you are projecting. That he will understand and agree with
the ideas that you are advocating. That he will share the emotions you are suggesting he feel, and even embellish and intensify them.

But also, at the same moment, vou must be aware of the
fact that—included among these reactions—are also a number of
inevitable anticipations, or demands, or questions on his part. And
you must answer these questions or vour copv will fail.

What are these demands he is going to make from time to
time on your copy? Basically they fall into three classes:

1. Demands for more information, more image, more desire. You have whetted his appetite; now you've got to satisfy it.
He is saying to vou: "Tell me more."

2. Demands for proof. He knows he wants it; now he wants
to know that it's true. He is telling you: "Oh veah? Who savs so?"

3. Demands for a mechanism. He knows he wants the end
result; now he wants to know how you're going to give it to him.
He is saying: "How does it work?"

To write good copv, you have to play a dual role. At the
same time, you have to be copywriter and prospect. You have to
develop an almost foolproof sensitivity to these inevitable reactions. You have to know the exact point that they are going to
come in. You have to anticipate them. You have to switch copv
direction, fill in the wanted material, at the precise point that
your prospect loses interest in one theme and demands the other.

This is one of the most difficult parts of writing copv, and
the exact spot where many good ads break down and lose their
prospect. And—since such anticipation points occur several times
in a single ad—you will find yourself working over the same paragraph of "unimportant" copy hour after hour. All vou know is
that at this point something went wrong—at this point vour
prospect is dissatisfied.

We will discuss these problems of copy direction . . . antici_pation points . . . etc. in Chapter 14, on Interweaving. At this_

FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION 1 6 7

point, however, let's look more eloselv at the third demand: the
demand for Mechanism.

**Verbal Proof**

This is the vital question: "Hoiv does it work[0]" Your prospect
is asking you here to give him a mechanism. He likes what vou
promise—he wants what vou promise—but he has to be convinced that your product can aetuallv give it to him.

You have to demonstrate vour product, in words, logically,
so that he can understand exactly HOW it gives him the end result you promise.

Since the beginning of advertising, of course, the eopv that
furnishes this information—that provides this mechanism—has
been called "Reason YVhv" copv. Claude Hopkins was its master.
But there have been few great selling ads of anv period that do
not use it to convince their prospect that their product actually
works.

In fact, the basic question vou must ask yourself, about this
device, when you sit down to write a piece of copy, is not, "Should
I use it?" Or "Should I build a mechanism into this copv?" But
simply: "How much?"

How much mechanism does this copv need? This, of course,
depends—as so many other things in vour cop}'—on the State of
Awareness of your prospect. Is he familiar with the mechanism
by which this product works? Does he accept it? If so, then this
part of your job is done for vou. Other advertisers have spent
their money to make this mechanism familiar to vour prospect.

**Stage One: Name the Mechanism**

You ma}' now take advantage of their investment bv simply
_naming the mechanism, and going on to beat them with your_
price or other features.

For instance, in the conventional camera ad, to back the

-----

168 FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION

headline claim, all that you'd have to do is name your mechanisms, like this:

TAKE FOOLPROOF PHOTOS
WITH THE XENOPHON 1750

With Electronic Light Setter. . . Push-Button Zomar
Lens . . . Magazine Load . . . Only $135.

Here, the three mechanisms which insure the perfect pictures are simply named, and not described at all. The prospect
is already familiar with the way they work from the other ads he
has seen, and any further detailing of their nuts and bolts would
simply bore him. Therefore, you name them in as bold type as
possible, and go on to compete with your price.

Most catalog copy and retail copy needs to assume only this
abbreviated form. It deals with products which are already known,
and whose mechanisms are already understood and accepted.
Therefore, any further wordage on these points would only be
wasted.

But now we come to that vast array of products whose mechanism cannot simply be named. Why? For two basic reasons:

**Stage Two: Describe the Mechanism**

1. Because the prospect doesn't understand their mechanism
And

2. Because everybody else has the same mechanism, and the
same promise, and the same price. And the market is getting
tired, and you need a new way to compete.

Let's look at the simplest case—case #1—first:
Here your mechanism is not so well known, or not known
at all, and you can't simply name it. You have to go into more
detail; you have to describe it.

So you have the classic situation of Promise—Reason Whv.
You build a strong, quick promise—and then you follow up with
the reason why you can deliver that promise.

-----

FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION 169

This one-two punch of promise and reason whv is as old as
advertising itself. Here, for instance, is how Rinso used it in 1926.
First thev give the promise, like[1] this:

Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hard work?

How would vou like to see vour wash come out of
a simple soaking—whiter than hours of scrubbing could
make it!
