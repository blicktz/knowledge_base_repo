## THE SECRET WEAPON THAT WILL
 GROW YOUR BUSINESS

### To help you grow your company, I’m going to guide you in simplifying
###### your message into sound bites that come from seven categories. Once you have these seven messages down, any anxiety you experience while talking about your brand will subside, and customers will be more attracted to what you offer. These sound bites will help you better understand your customers’ story and place yourself and your products right smack in the middle of it.
 Story, after all, is atomic. Stories have always moved through people to motivate and inspire their actions. Story is the energy that has fueled every human movement and is the one thing that can hold a person’s attention for hours as entertainment and for years when it informs a life purpose.
 Nobody can look away from a good story. In fact, neuroscientists claim the average human being spends more than 30 percent of their time daydreaming—unless they’re reading, listening to, or watching a story unfold. Why? Because when we are engaged in a story, the story does the daydreaming for us.
 Story is the greatest weapon you have to combat noise because it organizes information in such a way that people are compelled to listen. If you want to bring attention to your brand, you must understand how story works and how to invite customers into a narrative that is compelling.

##### STORY MAKES MUSIC OUT OF NOISE

###### Living in Nashville, I’ve learned quite a bit about the difference between music and noise. Nearly half the friends my wife and I share are musicians. The talent around here is immense. Hardly a dinner party goes by without somebody picking up a guitar.
 I could summarize what I’ve learned about the difference between music and noise by saying my friends make music and I make noise, but there’s actually some compelling science involved.
 Technically speaking, music and noise are similar. Both are created by traveling sound waves that rattle our eardrums. Music, however, is noise that submits to certain rules that allow the brain to engage on a different level. If I played you a recording of a dump truck backing up, birds chirping, and children laughing, you’d not remember those sounds the next day. But if I played you a Beatles song, you’d likely hum it to yourself for a week.
 There is an obvious difference between a well-choreographed piece of music and the sound of a cat chasing a rat through a wind chime factory, which is the equivalent of the average small business website, leader’s keynote speech, or sales rep’s elevator pitch. The brain remembers music and forgets about noise just like the brain remembers some brands and forgets about others.
 Story is similar to music. A good story takes a series of random events and truths and distills them into the essence of what really matters. There’s a reason the final cut of a movie is called a final cut. Prior to the theatrical release, a film has gone through rounds upon rounds of edits, dialogue omissions, revisions, and scene deletions. Sometimes entire characters end up on the cutting-room floor. Why? Because storytellers utilize frameworks and filters to cut out the noise. If a character or scene doesn’t serve the plot, it has to go.
 When clients want to add a bunch of confusion to their marketing message, I ask them to consider the ramifications of doing so if they were writing a screenplay. I mean, what if The Bourne Identity were a movie about a spy named Jason Bourne searching for his true identity, but it also included scenes of Bourne trying to lose weight, marry a girl, pass the bar exam, win on Jeopardy, and adopt a cat? The audience would likely lose interest. When storytellers bombard people with random information, the

###### audience is forced to burn too many calories to make sense of the drama. As a result, they daydream and walk out of the theater, or in the case of our marketing message, leave us for a competing brand where they place their order.
 Why do so many brands create noise rather than music? It’s because they don’t realize they are creating noise. They actually think people are interested in the random information they’re doling out.
 This is why we need a filter. The essence of branding is to create simple, relevant messages we can repeat over and over so that we “brand” ourselves into the public consciousness.

##### STEVE JOBS AND THE MESSAGE OF APPLE

###### Apple began to grow into the company they are today only after Steve Jobs began filtering his message through the frameworks that storytellers use to build compelling narratives. His thinking transformed after working with (and partially creating) the genius storytelling factory that is Pixar. When Jobs came back to Apple after being surrounded by professional storytellers, he realized story was the foundation on which every memorable brand had been built.
 Just think about the incredible transformation that took place in Steve’s life after Pixar. In 1983, Apple launched a computer called Lisa, the last project Jobs worked on before he was let go. Jobs released Lisa with a nine- page ad in the New York Times spelling out the computer’s technical features. It was nine pages of geek talk nobody outside NASA was interested in. The computer bombed.
 When Jobs returned to the company after running Pixar, Apple became customer-centric, simple in their product offering, compelling, and clear in their communication. The first campaign Jobs released after returning from his time at Pixar, then, went from nine pages in the New York Times to just two words on billboards all over America: Think Different.
 When Apple began filtering their communication to make it simple and relevant, they actually stopped featuring computers in most of their advertising. After all, nobody at the time knew why they would need a computer. Instead, they understood their customers were all living,

###### breathing protagonists in stories they felt were uninteresting. Jobs invited those heroes into a better story, one in which they could be different, productive, artistic, and recognized. The offer was clear: if you want to be different, choose Apple. The story they invited the public into involved (1) identifying what their customers wanted (to be seen and heard), (2) defining their customers’ challenge (that others didn’t recognize their hidden genius), and (3) offering their customers a tool they could use to express themselves (computers and smartphones). Each of these plot points is a pillar in ancient storytelling formulas and is critical for connecting with the public.
 I’ll teach you about these three pillars and more in the coming chapters, but for now realize the time Apple spent clarifying the role they play in their customers’ story is one of the primary factors responsible for their growth.
 Notice, though, the story of Apple isn’t about Apple; it’s about you. You’re the hero in the story, and they play a role more like Q in the James Bond franchise: they are the guy you go see when you need a tool to help you win the day.
 Despite what acolytes of the cult of Mac may say, whether Apple has the best technology is debatable. “Best” is subjective, of course. But it doesn’t matter. People don’t buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand and apply to their lives the fastest. Apple has inserted themselves into their customers’ story like no other technology company, and as a result, they’re not only the largest technology company but one of the top ten largest companies period.[1] If we want our own businesses to grow, we should borrow a page from their playbook. We should clarify our message.

##### STORY CAN GROW YOUR BUSINESS

###### To better understand what Steve Jobs learned during his years at Pixar, let’s take off our business hats for a few pages and pretend we’re learning about story for the first time. Once you understand how story integrates with your brand message, you’ll be able to create messaging material (and even a brand strategy) that engages more customers and grows your business. And once you really understand and can apply the framework intuitively, people

###### around the office will wonder how in the world you became such a messaging and marketing genius.
 After studying hundreds of movies, novels, plays, and musicals across nearly every imaginable genre, and after having written twelve books of my own along with cowriting a nationally released major motion picture based on one of my books, I’ve narrowed down the necessary elements of a compelling story to seven basic plot points. If we were writing a full screenplay, of course, we’d need more than this, but for the purposes of understanding and entering into our customers’ story, there are only seven critical plot points we need to understand.

 Story in a Nutshell
 Here is nearly every story you watch, read, or hear in a nutshell: A character who wants something encounters a problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a guide steps into their lives, gives them a plan, and calls them to action. That action helps them avoid failure and experience a success.
 That’s really it. You’ll see some form of this structure in every movie you watch, every novel you read, and every story you hear from this moment forward. By understanding the formula I just told you, you can essentially predict what is going to happen in almost every story you encounter. These seven basic plot points are powerful because they work to hold a human being’s attention. That’s why that formula has been used in countless stories for thousands of years. However, this formula is not stale or tiresome. In fact, these plot points are like chords of music in the sense that you can use them to create an infinite variety of narrative expression. Just like playing the guitar, with these seven chords you can create an infinite number of creative and engaging songs. Varying too far from set chords, however, means a composer risks descending into incomprehensible noise. Music, is, after all, noise submitted to rules. If a songwriter breaks the rules, the audience fails to engage. This idea is just as true for stories as it is for music. If a storyteller fails to identify what the hero wants, or does not include enough conflict, or fails to identify the stakes at play, then they are breaking the “rules of story” and the consequences are dire: the audience stops paying attention and the movie fails at the box office (or more likely never gets approved for production).

-----

###### What does any of this have to do with growing your business? Everything. The same rules that get and keep a movie audience’s attention can also get and keep a customer’s attention. And attention is what you need more than anything else. But we will talk more about how to apply story to your business later.
 For now, let’s look at how this simple story framework plays out in a couple of familiar stories. Once you can recognize the framework in stories, you’ll start to understand exactly where the story of your brand is confusing customers and costing you influence.
 In the first Hunger Games movie, Katniss Everdeen must compete in a twisted fight-to-the-death tournament forced on the people of Panem by an evil, tyrannical government called the Capitol. The problem she faces is obvious: she must kill or be killed (stakes). Katniss is overwhelmed, underprepared, and outnumbered (a hero in a hole).
 Along comes Haymitch, the brash, liquor-loving, grizzled winner of a previous Hunger Games tournament (the Guide). Haymitch assumes the role of Katniss’s mentor, helping her hatch a plan to win over the public (a plan). The plan is to get Katniss more sponsors, thereby equipping her with more resources for the fight and increasing her chances of winning.
 Here is the first Hunger Games story laid out on the StoryBrand grid:

 In Star Wars: A New Hope, our reluctant hero, Luke Skywalker, experiences a devastating tragedy: His aunt and uncle are murdered at the hands of the evil Empire (a hero in a hole). This sets a series of events in motion: Luke begins the journey of becoming a Jedi Knight (enter a guide, Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former Jedi Knight who once trained Luke’s father) and

###### destroys the Empire’s battle station, the Death Star, which allows the Rebellion to live and fight another day (the plan).

 Not every story works this way, but most do. Sometimes a writer will bring in multiple guides or (usually to the story’s peril) include what I call a scattered climactic scene, but the formula holds up in almost every story you’ll encounter. The closer the screenwriter or storyteller sticks to the formula, the more the audience loves the story itself.
 When Tom Cruise decided to make a sequel to his enormous box-office hit Top Gun, he might have created the most formulaic movie in the history of man. The result: a $1.46 billion box-office juggernaut, the highest- grossing movie of Tom Cruise’s career.

###### The fact that nearly every movie you go see at the theater includes all or most of the seven elements in the StoryBrand framework means the framework itself is something we should notice and respect. After thousands of years, storytellers the world over have arrived at this formula (or one like it) as a means of best practices. Simply put, this framework is the pinnacle of narrative communication. The further we veer away from these seven elements, the harder it becomes for audiences to engage. This is why indie films, which often break from narrative formulas, fail to gain critical acclaim and fail miserably at the box office. Critics sometimes like movies that disobey formulas, but that is because they are snobs who watch everything and are hungry for something different. The masses, who do not study movies professionally, want accessible stories that deliver entertainment.
 Stories, by the way, don’t have to be fictionalized to adhere to the formulas. One of my favorite documentary series is called Welcome to Wrexham, a true story about two Hollywood actors who bought a bottom- level soccer team in Wrexham, England, only to transform the team (and the town) from underdog losers into a fine-tuned winning machine. When the storytellers who produced the documentary series edited the story, they made sure to include a clear ambition in each episode, a challenge the heroes had to overcome, backstories of the protagonists (in this case a group protagonist story of townspeople, soccer players, family members, and a couple of lovable actors who were, essentially, humble but eager fish out of water) that caused us to like them, and tons and tons and tons of stakes and challenges all leading to (I hate to ruin it) skin-of-their-teeth victories. Wow. I think I lost two weeks of my life on the couch just clicking “next episode.” I got so deep into it that my wife had to point out I was beginning to talk with a Welsh accent and kindly asked me to stop using soccer metaphors like “you really put this one in the back of the net” to describe her lovely outfit.
 It seems true that some brands (as well as some screenwriters) break these formulas and succeed all the same, but when you look closely, this is rarely the case. Brilliant screenwriters know how to use the formula while still avoiding cliché. The same is true for brilliant marketers, by the way. The ability to keep it clear yet unique is what makes them brilliant. When you get good at the SB7 framework, hardly anybody will notice you are using it.

###### The Three Crucial Questions
 So how do we make the story our company is telling clear? Remember, the greatest enemy our business faces is the same enemy that good stories face: noise. Here’s a good test to know whether the screenwriters are doing a good job keeping the story clear: at no point should you be able to pause a movie and fail to answer three critical questions.

 1. What does the hero want? 2. Who or what is opposing the hero getting what they want? 3. What will the hero’s life look like if they do (or do not) get what
 they want?

 If you’ve ever started daydreaming in a movie, it was likely because your subconscious couldn’t answer one of these questions, or worse, you didn’t care. Here’s the kicker: if these three questions can’t be answered within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, the story has already descended into noise and will almost certainly fail its audience.
 At StoryBrand, our certified coaches have reviewed thousands of pages of marketing copy that had nothing to do with the customer’s story. We tell our clients the same thing my filmmaker friends told me when I was writing screenplays: anything that doesn’t serve the plot has to go. Just because a tagline sounds great or a picture on a website grabs the eye doesn’t mean it helps us enter into our customers’ story. In every line of marketing and messaging copy we write, we’re either serving the customer’s story or descending into confusion; we’re either making music or making noise.
 Nobody remembers a company that makes noise.

##### DOES YOUR MARKETING PASS THE GRUNT TEST?

###### Just like there are three questions audiences must be able to answer to engage in a story, there are three questions potential customers must answer if we expect them to engage with our brand. And they should be able to answer these questions within five seconds of looking at our website or marketing material:
