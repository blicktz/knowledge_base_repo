Ask the client to provide this background material before you attend any briefings or write the copy. One way to simplify this request for information is to create a checklist of the background material you need.
 And, of course, extract as much product information as you can from the Internet. You should spend a lot of time printing out and reading the client’s Web site, or at least the pages pertaining to the product you are promoting.
 Ask the client who its major competitors are, and study the content on those Web sites as well. Finally, a Google search on key words related to the product can unearth a lot of valuable information that may find its way into your copy.
 By studying this background material, the copywriter should have 90 percent of the information he or she needs to write the copy. The copywriter can get the other 10 percent by asking the right questions, either in person or via e-mail, Skype, or telephone. Steps 2 through 4 outline the questions the copywriter should ask the marketer about the product, the audience, and the objective of the copy.

 Step 2: Ask Questions About the Product

 What are its features and benefits? (Make a complete list.) Which benefit is the most important? How is the product different from those of the competition? Which features are exclusive? Which are better than the competition’s? If the product isn’t different, what attributes can be stressed that haven’t been stressed by the competition?

-----

### What technologies does the product compete against? What are the applications of the product? What problems does the product solve in the marketplace? How is the product positioned against competing products? How does the product work? How reliable is the product? How long will it last? How efficient is the product? How economical? How much does it cost? Is it easy to use? Easy to maintain? Who has bought the product and what do they say about it? What materials, sizes, and models is it available in? How quickly does the manufacturer deliver the product? If they don’t deliver, how and where can you buy it? What service and support does the manufacturer offer? Is the product guaranteed?

 Step 3: Ask Questions About Your Audience

 Who will buy the product? (What markets is it sold to?) What exactly does the product do for them? Why do they need the product? And why do they need it now? What is the customer’s main concern when buying this type of product (price, delivery, performance, reliability, service, maintenance, quality, efficiency, availability)? What is the character of the buyer? What type of person is the product being sold to? What motivates the buyer? How many different buying influences must the copy appeal to? (A toy ad, for example, must appeal to both the parent and the child.) If you are writing an ad, read issues of the magazines in which the ad will appear. If you are writing direct mail, find out what mailing lists will be used and study the list descriptions.

### If you are writing online ads, study the Web sites and e-newsletters in which they will appear.

 Step 4: Determine the Objective of Your Copy

 This objective may be one or more of the following:

 To generate traffic To generate conversions To generate inquiries To generate sales To answer inquiries To qualify prospects To generate store traffic To introduce a new product or an improvement of an old product To keep in touch with prospects and customers To build an opt-in e-list of prospects To get prospects to purchase the product To transmit news or product information To build brand recognition and preference To build company image To provide marketing tools for salespeople

 Before you write the copy, study the product you’re writing about: its features, benefits, past performance, applications, and markets. Digging for the facts will pay off, because in copywriting, specifics sell.

 USING INTERVIEWS TO GATHER FACTS

 Of course, collecting background material doesn’t always give you all the answers to the questions listed above. At times you must get additional facts from product experts employed by your client: engineers, designers, salespeople, product managers, and brand managers.

### Journalists will tell you that a face-to-face interview is better than a phone interview. When you sit across the table from people, you can observe their manner, their dress, their appearance. And you can learn a lot about people from their surroundings.
 But the kind of interview you conduct as a copywriter is different from the interview conducted by a reporter. You are not interested in the subject’s colorful personality or history. You are seeking only straight facts and product information of an informational nature. Therefore, there’s no need to get “up close” to the subject, and a telephone, Skype, or Zoom interview will serve your purpose just as well as an in-person conference.
 Actually, there are a number of advantages to doing interviews by phone. First, although the experts have intimate knowledge of the product, advertising is usually not their area of responsibility and, since they are busy, they don’t want to get involved with it. A phone interview takes less of their time and busy managers appreciate the efficiency of this method.
 Second, it’s easier to take notes by phone. Some people get jittery when they see you clicking away on your laptop. But your note taking can be invisible (turn off your Webcam); and the subject can talk in a relaxed, natural manner without being aware that his words are being transcribed.
 Third, the copywriter eliminates a trip to and from the client’s office. If you’re billing by the job, this increases your profit on the assignment. If you’re billing by the hour, the time saving is passed on to the client as less time spent on research. Either way, money is saved.
 A question beginning copywriters ask is, “Should I use a digital recorder or take notes on my keyboard device?” My answer is that it depends on the situation and on the assignment. By the way, if you do decide to tape the interview, be sure you let the subject know your intention before you begin.
 At times, you will be forced to go to a briefing without much background material on the product or the market. In this case, new information will be given to you at a frantic rate. It may help to use a digital recorder, like a smartphone app, in these situations, unless you are fast enough at the keyboard to get it all down.
 If, on the other hand, you have been thoroughly briefed and are familiar with the product, you should go into the meeting or the phone conference

### with a list of specific questions: gaps in your product knowledge that the background material didn’t fill. Here you are looking for short, specific answers, and taking notes with PC or pencil does the job.
 I almost always e-mail that list of questions to the subject matter expert prior to our interview. About 20 percent of the time, they will type out answers and send them to me via return e-mail.
 In an article in the Writer, author Dorothy Hinshaw Patent gives these tips for arranging and conducting a successful interview (the basic tips are Dorothy’s, but I’ve added some elaboration to tailor them to the needs of the copywriter).

 1. When you call a person to arrange an interview, immediately say who you are, who suggested you get in touch with the person, and why you want to interview him or her.
 For example: “Jim Rosenthal? Good morning. My name is Bob Bly, and I’m handling the writing of the ground radar brochure for your ad agency, Anderson & Associates. Lansing Knight at the agency suggested I give you a call and says you know a lot about the design of the radar dish. I’d like to ask you a few questions, if that’s convenient.”
 At times, you will encounter resistance from the person. Here are a few tactics to overcome this:

 • Explain that the interview won’t take much time. (“Well, I’ve got a small list of just six questions in front of me, and the interview will take but ten minutes to complete. I know you’re busy, but do you think we might chat for just ten minutes sometime in the next few days?”)

 • Flatter the subject, but be sincere. (“I suppose I could talk to someone else in your department. But they told me you designed the antenna, and I’d really like to make sure I get the right information for this ad, since it’s appearing in Machine Design, Design News, and Electronics Digest.”)

 • Explain the importance of your assignment. (“The article I’m putting together will be published in this year’s annual report, so you can see why I’m trying to get the most accurate information possible.”)

-----

### • Use authority as leverage. (“Shirley Parker, your department head, is working closely with the agency on this one and she felt it would be really important to get your input.”)

 2. Let the subject select the time and date for the interview. Offer to do the interview in the morning, during lunch, after work, in the evening, or any time that’s convenient and comfortable for the person. Some people are too busy during office hours to talk with you, and would prefer to do it after 5:00 or 6:00 P.M., when they can relax. Others may find lunch to be the best time. Schedule the interview at the subject’s convenience.
 And, just as important, set a firm date and time for the interview, whether it’s a face-to-face meeting or a phone call. If you’re doing a phone interview, make sure the subject understands that you are setting aside time to be by your phone on that date; the phone interview should be considered as firm a commitment as a meeting.

 3. Arrange for interviews well in advance of your deadline. With advertising’s short deadlines, this isn’t always possible. So it’s best to arrange interviews the day you get the assignment. That way, if a key interview subject is out of town or unavailable to meet, you can notify your client and work around it (by extending the deadline or finding someone else to take the subject’s place).

 4. Do your homework. Come prepared. Read all of the background information before the interview. Know in advance specifically what you want to find out during the interview. Prepare a written list of questions you want to ask.
 The subject’s time—and your time—is money spent by the client. Don’t waste it by asking your subject to give you an education in the basics. Instead, use this valuable time with the expert to get specific, detailed product and marketing facts that the product literature and other background material didn’t provide.

### 5. Be on time for the interview. Many businesspeople are impatient types, and if you miss your appointment, you may never get a second chance. If you can’t avoid being late, call in advance and explain the situation.

 6. If you are taking notes, type only the information you need to get the facts straight.

 7. Establish a rapport with the subject. You two may not have a lot in common, but by showing an interest in and understanding of the subject’s problems, you win that person over as a friend. And friends give better interviews than hostile or indifferent subjects.
 Maybe you really don’t care how difficult it was to manufacture the world’s first fiber-optic fishing pole. But the engineer you’re interviewing does. So, when he turns to you and says, “Boy, you don’t know the problems we had in adjusting tensile strength to the right length-to-diameter ratio,” give an understanding nod and a smile. Maybe even say, “I can imagine the problems you’ve had. But it sure is a great fishing pole.” This is just common courtesy, and it helps make the interview go smoothly.

 8. Keep a list of the people you interviewed. Also save your notes until the copy is accepted and published and for many months after that. Refer to the list and notes if the client wants to know where you got your information or questions the accuracy of the copy.

 9. Show your appreciation. You should always say “thank you” at the close of the interview. A short follow-up e-mail is an even nicer way of showing your gratitude.

 ORGANIZING YOUR INFORMATION

 At this point, you’ve read mounds of product literature and have taken notes or underlined key passages, or both. You also have notes or audio files of

-----

### interviews with product experts. The next step in getting ready to write copy is to type up your notes on your PC and print them out for quick and easy reference.
 There are two benefits to this. First, by filtering the information through your brain, to your fingers, and onto the typewritten page, you gain more familiarity with your facts.
 When I was in elementary school in the 1960s, teachers often assigned simple reports that could be based entirely on articles found in the encyclopedia. Not much research was involved, and as students, we thought we were pulling the wool over the teacher’s eyes by cribbing from the World Book or Encyclopaedia Britannica.
 But the teachers were smart. They knew that, by re-forming the encyclopedia essay in our own words, we would think through the ideas and come to our own conclusions about the subject.
 So it is with the copywriter. As you retype interviews and previous copy in your own words, you gain a perspective on the product and generate your own ideas on how to sell it.
 Now, to be fair, I know many copywriters who don’t go through this step. All I can tell you is that it works for me, and I wouldn’t tackle an assignment without first reprocessing all the information I’ve collected through my brain and keyboard and onto the printed page.
 The second advantage of typing up and printing out your notes is that, by single-spacing, you can reduce hours of interviews and mounds of Web pages, white papers, and product brochures to three to ten or so sheets of paper. Instead of searching through a huge pile of research material to find a key fact, you can quickly locate it in your typed notes using the Word Find feature.
 You can also use the notes as a checklist, checking off facts you have used in your copy, circling those facts you must include but haven’t yet, and crossing out information that will not be used in the copy. Also, looking at the notes is a lot easier on the eye than trying to decipher page after page of your handwriting.
 Convenient as these notes are, I must tell you that once you’ve gone through the process of keying them into your PC or laptop, the material will

### be so fresh in your mind that you will probably be able to write the copy with only an occasional glance at the pages to confirm a fact or search for a missing bit of data.
 I’ve written complete ads and e-mail marketing messages without once looking at my notes. After the copy was finished, I used the notes as a checklist to make sure all important facts were included.

 SHOULD YOU MAKE AN OUTLINE FIRST?

 Many copywriters debate the usefulness of preparing an outline before they write the copy. Again, this depends on your individual approach to writing, and you should make an outline only if it is helpful to you.
 With most short pieces of copy—online ads, e-mails, blog posts—the number of separate sales points to be covered is small enough that I can hold the outline in my head. And so there’s no need to write it down. But if the copy has an unusually large number of sales points, or if an organizational scheme hasn’t popped into my head (as it usually does), I will open a new Word file and work up an outline.
 For longer pieces—video sales letters, landing pages, white papers, Web sites—an outline is always helpful to me. I pin the outline to a cork board next to my desk and use it to guide me through the assignment. As first drafts of each section are completed, I check off the section on the outline. This gives me a sense of accomplishment and motivation to go on to the next step.
 For decades, I have made a practice of showing at least a rough outline of the promotion to the client and getting approval before I proceed to a first draft. The outline consists of a working headline and a description, either in a numbered or bullet list or in paragraph form, of the theme and contents I intend to cover in the body copy.
 Also called a “copy platform,” this type of outline ensures that the client agrees with your approach before you write. Without submitting a copy platform and getting it approved, you risk writing an entire promotion on a theme or concept that the client is going to reject, forcing you to write the

### whole thing over again. This is far less likely to occur when you are writing from an approved copy platform.
 How do you organize your outline? The “motivating sequence” presented in chapter 4 is a general outline for all pieces of persuasive writing. Examples of organizational schemes for specific writing tasks— ads, brochures, YouTube videos, Facebook boosted posts, press releases, sales letters, and e-mails—are presented later in the book.
