###### question di�erently: ‘Do you plan to read Gone With the Wind?’ It was easy for those who hadn’t read it to answer yes, they planned to read it, while those who had already read it said so. This produced a credible result.
 Waiting for a train in Pennsylvania station one evening, I was accosted by an interviewer and asked questions which I had written two days before. They were impossible to answer. I went back to my o�ce and canceled the survey.
 A food manufacturer had to decide whether to sell his product in cans or glass jars. He guessed that some housewives would vote for glass because they thought glass sounded more prestigious, so he gave out samples of his product in glass and other samples in cans. Two weeks later he called back and asked the housewives which samples tasted better. A large majority declared that the product in the jars tasted better than the same product in the cans. Without knowing it, they were voting for glass.
 In a study of the causes of in�ation, the French Government cut thousands of cheeses in half and put them on sale. One half were marked 37 centimes, the other 56 centimes. The higher-priced cheese sold faster. Consumers judge the quality of a product by its price.

 Research among children If you think that advertising to children is satanic, skip the next two pages. If, on the other hand, you earn your living making toys or breakfast cereals, you may be interested to learn how research can make your advertising produce more sales.
 Children understand only the simplest questions, and cannot easily articulate their replies. They also tend to say what they think you want them to say. Here are three procedures which work reasonably well:

 Group dynamics. You show your commercial to a group of children and then get them to play games, like talking to a friend on a play telephone about your commercial. Or you get

-----

###### them to imitate the characters in the commercial. This procedure reveals misunderstandings and negative reactions.

 Communication discrepancy. This procedure is for somewhat older children. You show them your commercial and ask them what it told them about the product, and what they liked about it. Then you show them the product itself and ask what they like about it. By comparing what they said about the commercial and what they say about the product itself, you �nd out whether your commercial does your product justice. If it doesn’t, you can usually �x it.
 Suppose you show a doll commercial. Only 20 per cent of the children say they like the fact that the doll can walk. But when they see the doll itself, 60 per cent say they like this. Obviously the commercial has not done justice to the doll.
 If, on the other hand, you �nd that your commercial raises hopes which are disappointed when the children see the doll, I have little doubt that, being an honest person, you will modify the commercial.

 Prize pad test. You give children a pad on which four toys are illustrated, including the one you are advertising, and ask them to circle the toy they would like you to give them. Then, after showing them your commercial, you say that some of the children forgot to put their names on the pad, which is probably true. You hand out new pads and again ask them to circle the toy they want. By comparing the votes, you get a measurement of your commercial’s persuasion. After doing this with several toys and several commercials, you can relate your score to the norm.

 Gentle reader and fellow parent, if you think it unseemly for researchers to enrol children as guinea-pigs, it will comfort you to know that they are now protected from us admen by ferocious regulations. For example, we are no longer allowed to tell children to importune their mothers to buy our products. Other regulations in force in the United States include these:

-----

###### ‘Appeals shall not be used which directly or by implication
 contend that if children have a product they are better than their peers, or lacking it, will not be accepted by their peers.’

 ‘Material shall not be used which can reasonably be expected
 to frighten children or provoke anxiety, nor shall material be used which contains a portrayal of or appeal to violent, dangerous or otherwise anti-social behavior’

 ‘Advertisements shall not include any dramatizations of any
 product in a realistic war atmosphere.’

 ‘Advertisements shall include audio and video disclosure
 when items such as batteries needed to operate a product as demonstrated in the advertising are not included.’

 ‘When a toy is presented in the context of a play
 environment, the setting and situation shall be that which a child is reasonably capable of reproducing.’

 ‘Advertising shall not employ costumes and props which are
 not available with the toy as sold, or are not reasonably accessible to the child without additional cost.’

 ‘Each commercial for breakfast-type products shall include at
 least one audio reference to and one video depiction of the role of the product within the framework of a balanced regimen.’

 Just try writing a commercial which obeys thirty-four regulations like these.

 Where I come out Few copywriters share my appetite for research. The late and great Bill Bernbach, among many others, thought that it inhibited creativity. My experience has been the opposite. Research has often lead me to good ideas, such as the eyepatch in the Hathaway campaign.

-----

###### I have seen ideas so wild that nobody in his senses would dare to use them – until research found that they worked. When I had the idea of writing headlines for French tourism in French, my partners told me I was nuts – until research revealed that French headlines were more e�ective than English headlines. Research has also saved me from making some horrendous mistakes.
 I admit that research is often misused by agencies and their clients. They have a way of using it to prove they are right. They use research as a drunkard uses a lamppost – not for illumination but for support. On the whole, however, research can be of incalculable help in producing more e�ective advertising.

 What little I know about marketing

###### hen they told me I had won the Parlin Award for Marketing, I thought they were kidding. I cannot even understand what the

## W

###### experts write on the subject. Stu� like this from Professor Paul Warshaw of McGill:

 Though use of sample cross-validated correlations is acceptable, the infrequently used squared population cross-validated correlation coe�cient ( [2]) is a more precise (although slightly biased) measure (Cattin 1978a, b; Schmitt, Coyle, and Rauschenberger 1977). It utilizes all available data simultaneously rather than bisecting the sample into arbitrary estimation and holdout components. Because of these comparative advantages, [2] is used in the present analysis. Though several versions are available, Srinivasan’s (1977) formulation [2] is acceptable for models containing �xed predictor variables.[1]

 If you can understand this kind of thing, you may �nd it useful to look up other models of consumer behavior, such as Lavidge and Steiner, Andreason, Nicosia, Engel-Kollat-Blackwell, Howard and Sheth, and Vaughan. All double Dutch to me. However, thirty odd years of rubbing shoulders with marketing practitioners has taught me some things which have helped in my work.

 New products

-----

###### About 35 per cent of supermarket sales come from products which did not exist ten years ago.
 You can judge the vitality of a company by the number of new products it brings to market. I have known Chief Executive O�cers who made enough pro�t from the products they inherited from their predecessors to obscure their failure to introduce new ones of their own. It is not uncommon for such men to grudge a measly million dollars for developing a new product, but to shell out $100,000,000 to acquire somebody else’s product, without turning a hair. Their borrowing-power is greater than their brain-power.
 The opposite is seen in the pharmaceutical industry. Merck, for example, spends $200,000,000 a year on new-product research. Years may go by without their discovering anything, then bingo…up comes a miracle drug. The e�ect on the share price is lovely to behold.
 Why do eight out of ten new consumer products fail? Sometimes because they are too new. The �rst cold cereals were rejected by consumers. More often new products fail because they are not new enough. They do not o�er any perceptible point of di�erence – like better quality, better �avor, better value, more convenience or better solutions to problems.
 It helps if the point of di�erence goes hand-in-hand with a chord of familiarity that links the new product to the consumer’s past experience – a disposable diaper, a light beer, a diet cola, a paper towel.

 Naming your product Finding any name which has not already been registered by another company is infernally di�cult. There are three kinds of names:

 Names of men and women – like FORD, CAMPBELL and VEUVE CLICQUOT. They are memorable, they are di�cult to copy and they suggest that your product is the invention of a human being.

-----

###### Meaningless names like KODAK, KOTEX, and CAMEL. It takes many years and millions of dollars to endow them with any sales appeal.

 Descriptive names like 3-IN-ONE OIL, BAND-AID and JANITOR IN A DRUM. Such names start with sales appeal. But they are too speci�c to be used for subsequent line-extensions.

 You can use consumer research to �nd out whether a name says what you think it says, whether it is easily pronounceable, whether it is confused with existing names, and whether it is memorable.
 Once I told a computer that I wanted a name for a new brand of co�ee, specifying that it had to begin with the letter M and contain no more than seven characters. The computer spewed out hundreds of permutations, and I was back where I started.
 If it is important that the name appear as big as possible on a package, choose a short one like TIDE, and not a long one like SCREAMING YELLOW ZONKERS.
 If you want to use the same name in foreign markets, make sure that it does not have an obscene meaning in Turkish or any other language. There have been some nasty accidents.
 I have suggested names for dozens of new products, but have not yet had one accepted. Good luck to you.

 Sleeping beauties Some products which sell well without being advertised may sell better, and make more pro�t, with advertising. For 40 years the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company sold modest quantities of a mouthwash called Listerine, without advertising it. When young Jerry Lambert started advertising it – as a remedy for halitosis – sales went through the roof.
 Milton S. Hershey built the biggest confectionery business in the world without advertising. Some years after his death, his successors asked my partner Bill Weed to �nd out whether advertising could increase their pro�ts, most of which went to the Hershey orphanage. Bill had commercials made for three of their products and tested

-----

###### them in local markets. One of the products did not respond to advertising, but sales of Hershey Bars went up, and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups went up 66 per cent. By 1980, Hershey was spending $42,000,000 on advertising.

 The end of the block-buster brand It has become prohibitively expensive to launch brands aimed at a dominant share-of-market. Even the manufacturers with the biggest war-chests are �nding it more pro�table to aim their new brands at narrowly de�ned segments of the market. The recent launch of a new cigarette cost $100,000,000. The advent of cable television, with 50 or more channels, will make it easier to aim your advertising at special groups of consumers. There may never be another universal giant like Tide or Maxwell House.

 Don’t waste time on problem babies Most marketers spend too much time worrying about how to revive products which are in trouble, and too little time worrying about how to make successful products even more successful. It is the mark of a brave man to admit defeat, cut his loss, and move on.
 Concentrate your time, your brains, and your advertising money on your successes. Back your winners, and abandon your losers.

 Don’t dawdle Most young men in big corporations behave as if pro�t were not a function of time. When Jerry Lambert scored his breakthrough with Listerine, he speeded up the whole process of marketing by dividing time into months. He reviewed progress every 30 days, with the result that he made a fortune in record time.

 Promotions In 1981, US manufacturers spent 60 per cent more on promotions than on advertising, and distributed 1,024,000,000,000 coupons. Bloody fools.

-----

###### In the long run, the manufacturer who dedicates his advertising to building the most sharply de�ned image for his product gets the largest share of the market. The manufacturer who �nds himself up the creek is the short-sighted opportunist who siphons o� his advertising dollars for short-term promotions. Year after year I �nd myself warning clients about what will happen to their brands if they spend so much on promotion that there is no money left for advertising.
 Price-o� deals and other such hypodermics �nd favor with sales managers, but their e�ect is ephemeral, and they can be habit- forming. Said Bev Murphy, who invented Nielsen’s technique for measuring consumer purchases and later became President of Campbell Soup Company: ‘Sales are a function of product-value and advertising. Promotions cannot produce more than a temporary kink in the sales curve.’
 Says Dr. Ehrenberg: ‘A cut-price o�er can induce people to try a brand, but they return to their habitual brands as if nothing had happened.’
 Don’t get me wrong. I am not opposed to all promotions. I would not, for example, think of launching a detergent without sampling to consumers.

 Pricing is guesswork It is usually assumed that marketers use scienti�c methods to determine the price of their products. Nothing could be further from the truth. In almost every case, the process of decision is one of guesswork.
 The higher you price your product, the more desirable it becomes in the eyes of the consumer. Yet when Professor Reisz of the University of Iowa tried to relate the prices of 679 brands of food products to their quality, he found that the correlation between quality and price was almost zero.
 Most of the marketers I know are afraid of pricing their products above competiton. At a dinner in Europe three years ago, the head of Research and Development in a famous company told me, ‘I have

-----

###### never seen my company go to market with the best product I could make. Time after time our marketers force me to give them an inferior product at a lower price.’ I was able to tell him that there are now unmistakable signs of a trend in favor of superior products at premium prices. The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife.

 Marketing in recession What should you do in times of recession, when you need every penny to sustain your earnings? Stop advertising?
 If you stop advertising a brand which is still in its introductory phase, you will probably kill it – for ever. Studies of the last six recessions have demonstrated that companies which do not cut back their advertising budgets achieve greater increases in pro�t than companies which do cut back.
 In a Morril survey of 40,000 men and women involved in the purchase of 23 industrial products over �ve years, it was found that share-of-market went up in bad times – when advertising was continued.
 I have come to regard advertising as part of the product, to be treated as a production cost, not a selling cost. It follows that it should not be cut back when times are hard, any more than you would stint any other essential ingredient in your product.
 During World War II, the British Government prohibited the marketing of margarine under brand names, but Unilever continued to advertise one of their brands during all the years it was not on the retailers’ shelves. When the war ended and brands returned, the Unilever brand emerged at the top of the heap.
 Keynes might have advised manufacturers not to advertise during boom times, but instead to set aside the money in a reserve for advertising during recessions.

 Heavy users Thirty-two per cent of beer-drinkers drink 80 per cent of all beer. Twenty-three per cent of laxative users consume 80 per cent of all

-----

###### laxatives. Fourteen per cent of the people who drink gin consume 80 per cent of all the gin.
 In everything you do, keep your eye glued to the heavy users. They are unlike occasional users in their motivations.
