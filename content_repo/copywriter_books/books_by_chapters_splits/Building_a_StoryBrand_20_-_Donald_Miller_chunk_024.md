## HOW TO EXECUTE A FLAWLESS
 STORYBRAND MESSAGING
 CAMPAIGN

### We will see an increased engagement from customers only if we
###### implement our StoryBrand BrandScript in a marketing and messaging campaign. The BrandScript you’ve put together has to show up on websites and in email campaigns, elevator pitches, and sales scripts. The sound bites you have created must be repeated over and over for years to come if you are hoping to grow your business.
 The degree to which you implement your StoryBrand BrandScript into marketing and messaging material is the degree to which people will understand why they need your products and/or services and begin to place orders.
 It’s surprisingly easy to fool yourself into thinking that just because you clarified your message, customers can read your mind. Let’s be clear: Your message is clear to you, but until you speak it and repeat it, it isn’t clear to anybody else. To get results, your message must be clear in the minds of others.
 This, then, is the goal of a communication campaign: If you are running for office, your job is to install your clear message into the minds of the body politic. If you are building a brand, your job is to act as though your products and services are running for office.
 Years ago, I was asked to come to the headquarters of a presidential favorite. The candidate had served as governor of a large state and went into

###### the campaign with an enormous lead and the locked-down electoral votes of his own state. He had national name recognition, had over a hundred million dollars behind his campaign, and had the support of his political party behind him. And he was failing. His campaign was shrinking in the polls month after month.
 When I met with his team, I introduced them to the StoryBrand framework and emphasized why their candidate needed to repeat sound bites—sound bites that clarified what the country needed; sound bites that defined our nation’s biggest problems from an external, internal, and philosophical perspective; sound bites that positioned himself as the guide and the body politic as the hero; sound bites that laid out a simple, three- step plan; sound bites that painted a clear picture of a bright future; sound bites that warned voters of the negative consequences of wasting their vote on somebody else; sound bites that offered an aspirational identity for the country; and finally a sound bite that affirmed a vote for him was the right decision.
 His campaign leadership, sadly, explained that their candidate was not a “sound bite kind of guy.” Instead, they told me he was a scholar. He had written books about his policy ideas. He was authentic and intelligent. He was more at home in a town hall meeting answering questions off the cuff and believed in the necessity of nuance. He wanted to be in meetings, studying the issues, devising plans to solve America’s biggest problems. Honestly, the more they described their candidate, the more I thought he should be president. And the more they described him, the more I realized he would never be president. I told them so.
 “You are doing everything to prepare this man to be president and nothing to get him elected,” I said.
 This same dynamic is likely true of you and your products and services. You did the work to create terrific products and services and are capable of delivering. But building great products and services and being able to talk about them effectively requires two separate sets of skills. The idea that “if you build it, they will come” may work to summon ghosts to a baseball field in Kansas, but it will not work to grow your business. To sell products and services, you must build them and then talk about them. And when you’re done talking about them, you must talk about them again. And then again.

###### Having spent ten years helping brands clarify their message, I’ve come to believe people have to read or hear your message about eight times before they internalize and respond to that message. On top of that, people ignore most commercial messages, so you have to repeat your clear message over and over for them to hear it even once. If 90 percent of all commercial messages are ignored, for instance, you will have to repeat your message eighty times to get somebody to hear it eight times. Your clear message needs to be stated clearly in elevator pitches, passed around in conversation, repeated clearly on your website, spoken of in your lead generators, talked about in YouTube videos, printed on your swag, painted on the wall of your retail establishment, written about in emails and snail mail, and spoken from the mouths of your sales representatives. Your message should be communicated in any digital ads you create, podcast openings and closings, keynote presentations, and so on and so on. In other words, your clear message is going to require a campaign.
 The third section of Building a StoryBrand gives both large and small companies tangible, practical steps they can take to apply their BrandScript into messaging and marketing collateral. Whether you’re a mom-and-pop shop, a start-up, a personal brand, a multibillion-dollar organization, or even a presidential candidate, in the following chapters I’ll show you the lessons we’ve learned from the thousands of companies who have effectively created and executed on their StoryBrand BrandScript to see radical results. The first step, though, is simple: talk differently.

##### CLARIFY AND MEMORIZE YOUR SOUND BITES

###### Stop rambling. When you talk about your brand, know what you are going to say long before you are asked to speak. Don’t wing it. Don’t make it up as you go along. You will immediately find that when you start using the sound bites you have created to talk about your brand, people pay attention.
 Years ago I came up with my own BrandScript sound bites to describe StoryBrand itself. I noticed that when I repeated my sound bites, people leaned in, and, to be honest, the interest wasn’t always welcome. If somebody sitting next to me on a plane asked what I did for work, I’d answer with my sound bite and then have to spend the rest of the flight

###### looking at their website or rewriting the speech they were going to deliver to whatever audience they were flying out to address. My favorite encounter was with an Uber driver in Baltimore. He’d picked me up at the Baltimore Airport and was dropping me off at my client’s headquarters only a few miles away. I knew we wouldn’t be in the car long, so when he asked what I did, I decided to test the effectiveness of my sound bite: Sometimes business leaders have great ideas and great products, but they don’t know how to talk about them to get people to pay attention. When they can’t come up with the sound bites they need to get their ideas across, they call me. I help business leaders come up with the sound bites they need to sell more products or get more votes.
 The young man driving the car turned down his stereo, thought for second, and said to me, “You are a very important person.” I laughed. I guess my sound bite worked, sort of. He then explained he needed some messaging advice. I figured he had a side hustle and wanted some advice to grow his business, but it turned out something else was true: he needed messaging advice in order to break up with his girlfriend. He literally pulled his car over at the gates of a national security building where I was scheduled to meet with a client and started talking about their relationship and how she just didn’t get him and that she’d been seeing this other guy. I’d suddenly been dropped into an episode of The Bachelor. Men with guns were watching us from behind the barricades, and so as he talked I was torn. I didn’t want to get shot, but I was deeply curious about what she saw in this other guy. Anyway, I’m not a relationship counselor, but I did give him a few lines. I say I gave him messaging advice, but truthfully most of the short conversation consisted of me saying things like, “Don’t say that. Definitely don’t say that.” To be honest, I think she might have been better off without him, but that’s hardly the point. The point is, when you use your sound bites to talk about your brand, people should turn down the radio. People should pull over. They should understand exactly why you and your brand are so important.
 What follows is a short, simple three-step process to get your message across in a successful communication campaign.

 Step One: Create Your StoryBrand BrandScript
 If you’ve not been creating your BrandScript as you’ve read this book, go back and start at the beginning. The process of creating a BrandScript

-----

###### will clarify your offer not only to customers but to yourself and your team. Don’t think just because you know you shouldn’t play the hero that your audience will start seeing you as their guide, for instance. They will see you as the guide only when you use sound bites that demonstrate you empathize with their problem and then use sound bites that demonstrate your competency to help them solve their problem. Create your StoryBrand BrandScript.

 Step Two: Edit Your Sound Bites Until They Get the Reaction You Want
 If you’ve created the right sound bites, they should stop people in their tracks. When you’re done repeating your sound bites, people should ask for your business card or, better, hand you their credit card. If, on the other hand, people ask for clarification so they can understand what you were trying to say, you don’t quite have your sound bites dialed in. The only question people should have after you repeat your sound bite is, How can I buy it? In fact, if you’ve used your call to action sound bite, they shouldn’t even be asking that question because you already answered it. In short, when you use your sound bites, people should either want to place an order or know somebody they think should place an order.
 Consider your StoryBrand BrandScript a rough draft. The number one problem I’ve encountered in coaching people through the process is their initial sound bites are too elusive. You can’t be vague if you want your sound bites to work. Remember, don’t be clever; be clear.
 Your StoryBrand BrandScript should be a work in progress until it succeeds. If you aren’t getting the reaction you want, keep refining the sound bites until they lead to engagement and orders. This can be a difficult process for some, especially if you really like the way you’ve been talking about your brand. But the fact that you really like something likely has more to do with the process you and your team went through or how hard it was to come to an agreement or the fact your granddaughter came up with your tagline or the idea that your sound bite rhymes. Please, God, help us all. The only thing you should be paying attention to when it comes to creating a StoryBrand BrandScript is whether customers are leaning in and placing orders. Keep evolving your sound bites until they get the reaction you want.

###### Step Three: Repeat Your Sound Bites Until the Public Has Them Memorized
 Think of your communication campaign as an exercise in memorization. Your job is to repeat your sound bites over and over so many times that your customers can repeat them back to you.
 Around my house we don’t give out an allowance. Chores exist because children are a critical part of the family, and we all have to contribute to the family objectives, which, in our home, are all about loving and respecting each other and the guests who enter our home. That said, our daughter has a terrific opportunity to make money, which is by memorizing poems. When I was young, I memorized poetry and I credit my success as a writer to this practice. Not only this, but the countless hours I spent repeating Kipling’s “The God’s of the Copybook Headings” or William Blake’s “The Tyger” in my mind were the hours I wasn’t going to the stupid places I’d likely have taken my mind. And how do you memorize something (or more accurately, help somebody else memorize something)? You help them repeat whatever it is you want them to memorize over and over in the exact same language. This is why the alphabet song is so effective. It is essentially a marketing jingle that has been helping people effectively memorize the alphabet for a century or more. If you want to memorize a poem, you carry it around on an index card and pull it out of your pocket to read it whenever you’re standing in line at a coffee shop or waiting for a movie to begin.
 When my wife’s baby sister turned twelve, I gave her a binder filled with ten classic poems. On the back side of each poem, I taped a $100 bill in an envelope. I let her know that whenever she memorized each of the ten poems, she could have and spend the $100 associated with that poem. What did I really give her for her birthday? I gave her the transformation that takes place when a person meditates on some of the greatest words ever captured in the English language. In other words, I gave her the opportunity for personal transformation.
 Your messaging campaign works like that binder, except instead of your customer getting $100 every time they memorize your sound bite, they pay you money in the form of an order.
 If you want to use your StoryBrand BrandScript to grow your business, take the three steps necessary to roll out a messaging campaign: Create your BrandScript, edit your BrandScript, and then repeat your BrandScript. After
