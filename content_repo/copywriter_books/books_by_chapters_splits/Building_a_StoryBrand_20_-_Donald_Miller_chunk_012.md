###### At StoryBrand, we have seen thousands of businesses experience an increase in customer engagement once they stopped positioning themselves as the hero and started positioning themselves as the guide. After filtering their message through the StoryBrand framework, thousands of business leaders have realized their websites, email blasts, digital ads, television commercials, and even their elevator pitches have been broadcasting a self- sabotaging message. However, adjusting our focus so that it is clearly on the customer and playing the guide by offering that customer a solution to their problem will radically change the way we talk about, and even do, business.
 So what do we have to do to be recognized as the guide in our customers’ lives?
 We must demonstrate two characteristics in order to be recognized as a guide: empathy and competency.
 When Luke Skywalker meets Yoda, he encounters the perfect guide. Luke is ill-equipped for the task before him, and Yoda is the endearing character who empathetically understands Luke’s dilemma. This empathy would be of little service, of course, were it not for Yoda’s competency as a Jedi himself. Yoda understands Luke’s dilemma and has mastered the skills he must now develop if he is going to win the day.
 The guide must have this precise one-two punch of empathy and competency in order to move the hero and the story along. These are the characteristics the hero is looking for, and when he or she senses them, they know they have found their guide.

 The Incredible Power of Empathy
 When Bill Clinton delivered his now-famous line “I feel your pain” in 1992, he did more than just clinch a victory over George H. W. Bush in a close presidential election; he positioned himself as the guide in the American voters’ story. In fact, many pundits believe Clinton locked up the election during a town hall debate in which Bush gave a rambling answer to a young woman when she asked what the national debt meant to the average American. Clinton countered Bush’s linear, cerebral answer by asking the woman if she knew anybody who’d lost their job. He asked

###### whether it pained her that she had friends out of work, and when the woman said yes, he went on to explain how the national debt is tied to the well- being of every American, even her and her friends.[5] That’s empathy. What did the audience sense? They sensed competency in Bush but empathy and competency in Clinton. Did Bush care? Of course, but unless we use sound bites to express our care, our audience does not connect. As a mentor of mine once told me: don’t put people in the mind-reading business.
 When we empathize with our customers’ dilemma, we create a bond of trust. People trust those who understand them, and they trust brands that understand them too.
 Oprah Winfrey, an undeniably successful guide to millions, once explained that the three things every human being wants most are to be seen, heard, and understood. This is the essence of empathy.
 Empathetic statements start with words like, “We understand how it feels to . . .” or “Nobody should have to experience . . .” or “Like you, we are frustrated by . . .” or, in the case of one commercial inviting Toyota owners to engage their local Toyota service center, simply, “We care about your Toyota.”
 Expressing empathy isn’t difficult. Once we’ve identified our customers’ internal problems, we simply need to let them know we understand and would like to help them find a resolution. Scan your marketing material and make sure you’ve told your customers that you care. Again, customers won’t know you care until you tell them.

 ARE YOU LIKE ME? Empathy is more than just sentimental slogans though. Real empathy means letting customers know we care about them in the same way we care about ourselves. Customers look for brands they have something in common with. Remember, the human brain likes to conserve calories, so when a customer realizes they have a lot in common with a brand, they fill in all their cognitive dissonance with trust. Essentially, when we highlight the aspects of ourselves or our brand that we have in common with our customer, the customer batches their thinking, meaning they think in “chunks” rather than details. Here’s what I mean by “thinking in chunks.” Last night, my wife and I attended a dinner party and sat next to a couple we’d not met before. As we started talking, I noticed how instinctively human beings search for

-----

###### commonality. When my wife discovered that the couple had grown up in Louisiana, there was an instant connection as she herself hails from the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. As humans get to know each other, they search for shared places and people and experiences, thus increasing the feeling that there is a mutual understanding of life and giving us the feeling that the person we are talking to is safe. That is why finding and expressing commonality—whether taste in music or shared values or shared stages of life—and talking about those commonalities is such a powerful marketing tool.
 Once, while counseling a politician, I explained that even if you are in a room of people who are completely different than you, you must find and focus on a common experience, especially if you need to express disagreement. For example: Like you, I am deeply concerned about the cost of health care, but I’m equally concerned about government incompetency to run our health-care system. In my view, socialized medicine disincentivizes innovation, which could ultimately lead to a radical decline in patient care and even longevity of life. You and I are the same in that we believe Americans are paying too much for too little when it comes to health care, but if we put our heads together, practical people like us will find a solution. You’re right, though, that this problem must be dealt with. We certainly agree on that.
 The point is this: Your brand and your customer are alike. You have shared experiences and a shared view of life. A recent Discover Card television campaign tapped into the power of empathy by showing customers who call Discover’s customer service line and end up talking to an exact replica of themselves. As they talk, the customer realizes they have everything in common with their credit card company; in fact, they are exactly the same. The message? Discover Card will take care of you the same way you would take care of yourself. We understand you. We know you.

 The Necessity of Competency
 In the first edition of Building a StoryBrand I listed the two characteristics of a guide as empathy and authority, but the word authority never sat right with me. After all, nobody likes a know-it-all and nobody wants to be preached at. The better word, then, is competency. As a guide, you do not have to be perfect, but you do have to be competent in your field

###### of expertise. This is paramount. This is why Mary Poppins refused to budge in her self-confidence as a guide. Were she to have compromised her higher ground as it related to her competency to positively shape the future of a child, the movie would have had two heroes and no guide and as such would have been ruined. Competency matters, and if you actually have it, let’s not mess around with self-deprecation. Your hero needs more than a friend; they need a useful friend.
 Imagine walking into a nutritionist’s office for the first time, determined to get into the best shape of your life.
 “I’d like to lose thirty pounds,” you might tell her. “It’s been a struggle for a long time, but I’m ready.”
 How would you feel if the nutritionist, upon hearing your stated objective, looked at you, sighed, pinched an inch of the spare tire around their waist, and said, “Me too.”
 It wouldn’t take you long to realize you’d chosen the wrong nutritionist. The guide needs to know what they are doing and should have serious experience helping other heroes win the day. Wouldn’t you agree that Gordon Ramsey’s television show would be ruined if, instead of being the authoritative chef and restaurateur, he shyly confessed he knew nothing about fixing a restaurant but looked forward to learning with his hopeless client?
 At this point in the journey, many readers wonder how they can demonstrate their own competency without making themselves the hero. It’s a good question. The truth is, as a guide, you can talk about yourself all day long. To play the guide doesn’t mean that you go quiet and humble. In fact, you’ll notice that Mary Poppins gets much more screen time than George Banks, even though the story is largely about his transformation. The key to playing the guide, though, is to tell only the parts of your story that support your care for the customer and your competency to help them.
 As customers view our websites, commercials, or emails, they simply want to check off a box in the back of their minds that gives them confidence in our ability to help them. And our backstory can help. I recently had dinner with Mary and Madison Lee, who run a skin care line called Nēmah. The origin story of Nēmah serves as a great example of a brand telling the part of its story that positions the brand as the guide. In short, Mary had trouble finding a skin care line she could trust during the pregnancy of her first child. It turns out many skin care products are not

###### safe for the mother and are especially harmful for the development of a child. She and her husband then created Nēmah’s line of products using only ingredients that are safe and healthy so that mothers would have a brand they could trust. By tapping into a serious concern mothers everywhere have in common and telling their own story about that concern (empathy) along with the science they discovered in their research (competency), they have built a phenomenally successful brand positioning themselves as former struggling heroes turned empathetic and competent guides who are helping other heroes win the day.
 There are five easy ways to add evidence of competency to your marketing and messaging.

 1. Testimonials: Let others do the talking for you. If you have
 satisfied customers, place a few testimonials on your website. Testimonials give potential customers the gift of going second. They know others just like them who have bought your products and experienced success. You don’t need many testimonials as long as they are short and speak directly to how your product solved their problem. Three is a great number to start with and will serve the need of ensuring that most customers know that you know what you are doing. Also, avoid rambling testimonials that heap endless praise on your brand. It won’t take long for a customer to trust you, so keep a testimonial brief. If it looks too long, they won’t read it. Most customers scan websites. The shorter the sound bites, the more they will engage and retain. 2. Statistics: How many satisfied customers have you helped? How
 much money have you helped them save? A simple statement like the email marketing platform Keap’s “125,000 users trust [our] award-winning automation software”[6] is all your potential customer needs. Numeric evidence scratches the itch of the left-brained consumer who loves numbers, statistics, and facts. 3. Awards: If you’ve won a few awards for your work, feel free to
 include small logos or indications of those awards at the bottom of your page. These are hardly necessary, but if you’ve got them, flaunt them a little. Awards go a long way in earning your customer’s trust, even if they’ve never heard of the award.

###### 4. Press Mentions: If you’ve been featured in the press, simply state
 “Featured by” and the logo of the press that has featured you. You can also list endorsements from either press or influencers as a way of creating social proof that demonstrates your competency. 5. Logos: If you provide a business-to-business product or service,
 place logos of known businesses you’ve worked with in your marketing collateral. Customers want to know you’ve helped other businesses overcome their same challenges. When your customer recognizes another business you’ve worked with, it provides social proof you have the ability to help them win the day.

 Take a minute to scan your marketing material and ask yourself whether you’ve provided evidence of competency. Remember, you don’t have to brag about yourself. Testimonials, logos, awards, press mentions, and statistics will allow customers to check the “trust” box in the back of their minds as it relates to your products or services. Your customers are asking themselves questions like, “Does this brand know what they’re doing? Is investing my time and money going to be worth it? Can they really help me solve my problem?”

##### HOW TO MAKE A GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION

###### When people meet your brand, it’s as though they are meeting a person. They’re wondering if the two of you will get along, whether you can help them live a better life, whether they want to associate their identity with your brand, and ultimately, whether they can trust you.
 Harvard Business professor Amy Cuddy has spent more than fifteen years studying how business leaders can make a positive first impression. Cuddy distilled her research into two questions people subconsciously ask when meeting someone new: “Can I trust this person?” and “Can I respect this person?” In her book Presence, Cuddy explains that human beings value trust so highly, it’s only after trust is established that a person begins to consider getting to know us further.[7]
 When we express empathy, we help our customers answer Cuddy’s first question, “Can I trust this person?”

-----

###### Providing evidence of competency helps our customers answer the second question, “Can I respect this person?”
 The same two characteristics that help us make a great first impression with people at a cocktail party also work to help our brand make a great first impression with potential customers.
 Once we express empathy and demonstrate competence, we can position our brand as the guide our customer has been looking for. This will make a significant difference in the way they remember us, understand us, and ultimately become willing to engage with our products and services.
 That said, even though our customers like us and trust us, it doesn’t mean they’re going to place an order. There is still a yawning chasm between a customer’s trust and their decision to invest their hard-earned money in what we’re offering. What are they looking for next? We’ll talk about an important aspect in the buying journey in the next chapter.
 For now, though, brainstorm how you can position yourself as the guide in your customer’s life by expressing empathy and providing evidence of competency.

 CLARIFY YOUR MESSAGE SO CUSTOMERS LISTEN

Go to StoryBrand.AI and either create a BrandScript or log in to your existing
BrandScript.
Either alone or with a team, brainstorm empathetic statements you can make so
your customers know you care about their internal problem.
Brainstorm the many ways you can demonstrate competency by exploring
potential testimonials, statistics that demonstrate competence, awards you’ve
won, press mentions, or logos from other businesses you’ve helped.
Once you finish your brainstorming session, make the two StoryBrand
BrandScript decisions that will allow you to fill out section 3.
