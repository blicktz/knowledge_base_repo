So in many, many lines. Cigar makers send out boxes to anyone and say, “Smoke
ten, then keep them or return them, as you wish.” Makers of books, typewriters, washing
machines, kitchen cabinets, vacuum sweepers, etc., send out their products without any
prepayment. They say, “Use them a week, then do as you wish.” Practically all
merchandise sold by mail is sent subject to return.

These are all common principles of salesmanship. The most ignorant peddler
applies them. Yet the salesman-in-print very often forgets them. He talks about his
interest. He blazons a name, as though that was of importance. His phrase is, “Drive
people to the stores,” and that is his attitude in everything he says. People can be coaxed
but not driven. Whatever they do they do to please themselves. Many fewer mistakes
would be made in advertising if these facts were never forgotten.

 Mail Order Advertising · What It Teaches

The severest test of an advertising man is in selling goods by mail. But that is a
school from which he must graduate before he can hope for success. There cost and
result are immediately apparent. False theories melt away like snowflakes in the sun. The
advertising is profitable or it is not, clearly on the face of returns. Figures which do not
lie tell one at once the merits of an ad.

This puts men on their mettle. All guesswork is eliminated. Every mistake is
conspicuous. One quickly loses his conceit by learning how often his judgment errs —
often nine times in ten.

There one learns that advertising must be done on a scientific basis to have any
fair chance of success. And he learns that every wasted dollar adds to the cost of results.
Here is a tough efficiency and economy under a master who can’t be fooled. Then, and
only then, is he apt to apply the same principles and keys to all advertising.

A man was selling a five-dollar article. The replies from his ad cost him 85 cents.
Another man submitted an ad which he thought better. The replies cost $14.20 each.
Another man submitted an ad which for two years brought replies at an average of 41
cents each. Consider the difference on 250,000 replies per year. Think how valuable was
the man who cut the cost in two. Think what it would have meant to continue that
$14.20 ad without any key on returns.

Yet there are thousands of advertisers who do just that. They spend large sums
on a guess. And they are doing what that man did — paying for sales from 2 to 35 times
what they need cost. A study of mail order advertising reveals many things worth
learning. It is a prime subject for study. In the first place, if continued, you know what
pays. It is therefore good advertising as applied to that line. The probability is that the ad
has resulted from many traced comparisons. It is therefore the best advertising, not
theoretical. It will not deceive you. The lessons it teaches are principles which wise men
apply to all advertising.

Mail order advertising is always set in small type. It is usually set in smaller type
than ordinary print. That economy of space is universal. So it proves conclusively that
larger type does not pay. Remember that when you double your space by doubling the
size of your type. The ad may still be profitable. But traced returns have proved that you
paying a double price for sales. In mail order advertising there is no waste space. Every

line is utilized. Borders are rarely used. Remember that when you are tempted to leave
valuable space unoccupied.

In mail order advertising there is no palaver. There is no boasting, save of superservice. There is no useless talk. There is no attempt at entertainment. There is nothing
to amuse. Mail order advertising usually contains a coupon. That is there to cut out as a
reminder of something the reader has decided to do.

Mail order advertisers know that readers forget. They are reading a magazine of
interest. They may be absorbed in a story. A large percentage of people who read an ad
and decide to act will forget that decision in five minutes. The mail order advertiser
knows that waste by tests, and he does not propose to accept it. So he inserts that
reminder to be cut out, and it turns when the reader is ready to act.

In mail order advertising the pictures are always to the point. They are salesmen
in themselves. They earn space they occupy. The size is gauged by their importance. The
picture of a dress one is trying to sell may occupy much space. Less important things get
smaller spaces. Pictures in ordinary advertising may teach little. They probably result in
whims. But pictures in mail order advertising may form half the cost of selling. And you
may be sure that everything about them has been decided by many comparative tests.
Before you use useless pictures, merely to decorate or interest, look over some mail order
ads. Mark what their verdict is.

A man advertised an incubator to be sold by mail. Type ads with right headlines
brought excellent returns. But he conceived the idea that a striking picture would
increase those returns. So he increased his space 50 percent to add a row of chickens in
silhouette. It did make a striking ad, but his cost per reply was increased by exactly that
50 percent. The new ad, costing one-half more for every insertion, brought not one
added sale. The man learned that incubator buyers were practical people. They were
looking for attractive offers, not for pictures.

Think of the countless untraced campaigns where a whim of that kind costs half
the advertising money without a penny in return. And it may go on year after year. Mail
order advertising tells a complete story if the purpose is to make an immediate sale. You
see no limitations there are on amount of copy. The motto there is, “The more you tell
the more you sell.” And it has never failed to prove out so in any test we know.

Sometimes the advertiser uses small ads, sometimes large ads. None are too small
to tell a reasonable story. But an ad twice larger brings twice the returns. A four times
larger ad brings four times the returns, and usually some in addition. But this occurs only
when the larger space is utilized as well as the small space. Set half-page copy in a page
space and you double the cost in returns. We have seen many a test prove that.

-----

Look at an ad of the Mead Cycle Company — a typical mail order ad. These have
been running for many years. The ads are unchanging. Mr. Mead told the writer that not
for $10,000 would he change a single word in his ads. For many years he compared one
ad with the other. And the ads you see today are the final results of all those experiments.
Note the picture he uses, the headlines, the economy of space, the small type. Those ads
are as near perfect for their purpose as an ad can be.

So with any other mail order ad which has long continued. Every feature, every
word and picture teaches advertising at its best. You may not like them. You may say
they are unattractive, crowded, hard to read — anything you will. But the test of results
has proved those ads the best salesman those lines have yet discovered. And they
certainly pay.

Mail order advertising is the court of least resort. You may get the same
instruction, if you will, by keying other ads. But mail order ads are models. They are
selling goods profitably in a difficult way. It is far harder to get mail order than to send
buyers to the stores. It is hard to sell goods which can’t be seen. Ads which do that are
excellent examples of what advertising should be. We cannot often follow all the
principle of mail order advertising, though we know we should. The advertiser forces a
compromise. Perhaps pride in our ads has an influence. But every departure from those
principles adds to our selling cost. Therefore it is always a question of what we are
willing to pay for our frivolities. We can at least know what we pay. We can make keyed
comparisons, one ad with another. Whenever we do we invariably find that the nearer we
get to proved mail order copy the more customers we get for our money.

This is another important chapter. Think it over. What real difference is there
between inducing a customer to order by mail or order from his dealer? Why should the
methods of salesmanship differ? They should not. When they do, it is for one of two
reasons. Either the advertiser does not know what the mail order advertiser knows. He is
advertising blindly. Or he deliberately sacrifices a percentage of his returns to gratify
some desire.

There is some apology for that, just as there is for fine offices and buildings. Most
of us can afford to do something for pride and opinion. But let us know what we are
doing. Let us know the cost of our pride. Then, if our advertising fails to bring us the
wanted returns, let us go back to our model — a good mail order ad — and eliminate
some of our waste.

 Headlines

The difference between advertising and personal salesmanship lies largely in
personal contact. The salesman is there to demand attention. He cannot be ignored. The
advertisement can be ignored. But the salesman wastes much of his time on prospects
whom he can never hope to interest. He cannot pick them out. The advertisement is
read only by interested people who, by their own volition, study what we have to say.
The purpose of a headline is to pick out people you can interest. You wish to talk to
someone in a crowd. So the first thing you say is, “Hey there, Bill Jones” to get the right
persons attention. So it is in an advertisement. What you have will interest certain people
only, and for certain reasons. You care only for those people. Then create a headline
which will hail those people only.

Perhaps a blind headline or some clever conceit will attract many times as many.
But they may consist of mostly impossible subjects for what you have to offer. And the
people you are after may never realize that the ad refers to something they may want.

Headlines on ads are like headlines on news items. Nobody reads a whole
newspaper. One is interested in financial news, one in political, one in society, one in
cookery, one in sports, etc. There are whole pages in any newspaper which we may never
scan at all. Yet other people might turn directly to those pages. We pick out what we
wish to read by headlines, and we don’t want those headlines misleading. The writing of
headlines is one of the greatest journalistic arts. They either conceal or reveal an interest.

Suppose a newspaper article stated that a certain woman was the most beautiful
in the city. That article would be of intense interest to that woman and her friends. But
neither she nor her friends would ever read it if the headline was “Egyptian Psychology.”
So in advertising. It is commonly said that people do not read advertisements. That is
silly, of course. We who spend millions in advertising and watch the returns marvel at the
readers we get. Again and again we see 20 percent of all the readers of a newspaper cut
out a certain coupon. But people do not read ads for amusement. They don’t read ads
which, at a glance, seem to offer nothing interesting. A double-page ad on women’s
dresses will not gain a glance from a man. Nor will a shaving cream ad from a woman.

Always bear these facts in mind. People are hurried. The average person worth
cultivating has too much to read. They skip three-fourths of the reading matter which
they pay to get. They are not going to read your business talk unless you make it worth
their while and let the headline show it.

-----

People will not be bored in print. They may listen politely at a dinner table to
boasts and personalities, life history, etc. But in print they choose their own companions,
their own subjects. They want to be amused or benefited. They want economy, beauty,
labor savings, good things to eat and wear. There may be products which interest them
more than anything else in the magazine. But they will never know it unless the headline
or picture tells them.

The writer of this chapter spends far more time on headlines than on writing. He
often spends hours on a single headline. Often scores of headlines are discarded before
the right one is selected. For the entire return from an ad depends on attracting the right
sort of readers. The best of salesmanship has no chance whatever unless we get a
hearing. The vast difference in headlines is shown by keyed returns which this book
advocates. The identical ad run with various headlines differs tremendously in its returns.
It is not uncommon for a change in headlines to multiply returns from five or ten times
over.

So we compare headlines until we know what sort of appeal pays best. That
differs in every line, of course. The writer has before him keyed returns on nearly two
thousand headlines used on a single product. The story in these ads are nearly identical.
But the returns vary enormously, due to the headlines. So with every keyed return in our
record appears the headlines that we used. Thus we learn what type of headline has the
most widespread appeal. The product has many uses. It fosters beauty. It prevents
disease. It aids daintiness and cleanliness. We learn to exactness which quality most of
our readers seek. This does not mean we neglect the others. One sort of appeal may
bring half the returns of another, yet be important enough to be profitable. We overlook
no field that pays. But we know what proportion of our ads should, in the headline,
attract any certain class.

For this same reason we employ a vast variety of ads. If we are using twenty
magazines we may use twenty separate ads. This because circulation’s overlap, and
because a considerable percentage of people are attracted by each of several forms of
approach. We wish to reach them all.

On a soap, for instance, the headline “Keep Clean” might attract a very small
percentage. It is too commonplace. So might the headline, “No animal fat.” People may
not care much about that. The headline, “It floats” might prove interesting. But a
headline referring to beauty or complexion might attract many times as many. An
automobile ad might refer in the headline to a good universal joint. It might fall flat,
because so few buyers think of universal joints. The same ad with a headline, “The
Sportiest of Sport Bodies,” might out pull the other fifty to one.

-----

This is enough to suggest the importance of headlines. Anyone who keys ads will
be amazed at the difference. The appeals we like best will rarely prove best, because we
do not know enough people to average up their desires. So we learn on each line by
experiment.

But back of all lie fixed principles. You are presenting an ad to millions. Among
them is a percentage, small or large, whom you hope to interest. Go after that percentage
and try to strike the chord that responds. If you are advertising corsets, men and children
don’t interest you. If you are advertising cigars, you have no use for non-smokers. Razors
won’t attract women, rouge will not interest men.

Don’t think that those millions will read your ads to find out if your product
interests. They will decide at a glance — by your headline or your pictures. Address the
people you seek, and them only.

 Psychology

The competent advertising man must understand psychology. The more he
knows about it the better. He must learn that certain effects lead to certain reactions, and
use that knowledge to increase results and avoid mistakes. Human nature is perpetual. In
most respects it is the same today as in the time of Caesar. So the principles of
psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to unlearn what you learn about
them.

We learn, for instance, that curiosity is one of the strongest human incentives. We
employ it whenever we can. Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice were made successful largely
through curiosity. “Grains puffed to 8 times the normal size.” “Foods shot from guns.”
“125 million steam explosions caused in every kernel.” These foods were failures before
that factor was discovered.

We learn that cheapness is not a strong appeal. Americans are extravagant. They
want bargains but not cheapness. They want to feel that they can afford to eat and have
and wear the best. Treat them as if they could not and they resent your attitude.

We learn that people judge largely by price. They are not experts. In the British
National Gallery is a painting which is announced in a catalog to have cost $750,000.
Most people at first pass it by at a glance. Then later they get farther on in the catalog
and learn what the painting cost. They return then and surround it.
