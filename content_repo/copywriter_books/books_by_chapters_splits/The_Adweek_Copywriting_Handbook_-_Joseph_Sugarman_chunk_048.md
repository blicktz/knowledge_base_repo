##### The infomercial (half-hour commercial), commonly referred to in the advertising trade as long-form TV, became an advertising phenomenon in the mid-1980s when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated many of its policies and allowed for the broadcast of 30 minutes of straight advertising.
 At first, real estate shows appeared on the air. Then the BluBlocker sunglasses made their first showing in 1986, and shortly thereafter came the exercise, self-help and get-rich-quick shows. Infomercials became extremely popular in a very short period of time. Overnight companies launched what soon became household names. Some marketers became instant millionaires, making small fortunes in just a few months, while others lost millions and went bankrupt just as quickly.
 The key to this medium is to determine a good format in which to present your show. It should resemble what is popular and what is currently being broadcast. For example, if reality shows are popular, then maybe your product would lend itself to a reality show. If interview shows like Larry King Live are popular, then set up an interview format. If your product would appeal to the Oprah Winfrey Show audience, then set use a set that looks similar to Oprah’s. In short, you identify with a popular format that fits your product and with which your prospective audience is comfortable and that they can harmonize with.
 A good example of this approach is our BluBlocker infomercial, which ran in four different versions for six years and created a brand name for sunglasses from all the exposure, not to mention a lot of sales. I used a candid-camera approach famous during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I would walk up to strangers and interview them right on the street or on the beach, and then have them try on my sunglasses and react with surprised expressions of wonder or amazement.
 For a product to work on long-form TV, the keys for success are a good product in the $39 to $250 price range with sufficient margin or one that has good continuity and back-end sales potential—in short, a product that you can automatically ship to your customers every month like vitamins or one that has strong sales after the initial sale. With a half hour you have more

 Today, the infomercial industry has shaken out the fly-by-nights, and only the more experienced and stable companies remain. It is also a lot more difficult to succeed in this field unless you really know what you are doing. And that includes knowing the importance of a product with continuity and back-end sales.

# Back-End Sales

##### When you produce a successful TV spot or infomercial and your customer calls to order your product, there is a major sales opportunity available to you while your customer is on the phone. The sale in this case is called back-end sales, or what is commonly called in the industry “upsells.” Often, you can take a simple $49.95 sale and turn it into a $200 sale if you come up with some good products to enhance the initial purchase or even a service that your prospect may want after the sale such as coaching in the case of some income opportunity shows.
 For example, when I called to order the knife set Ron Popeil offered in an infomercial in early 2006, the operator had a script she used to try to sell me more related products. This is one more opportunity for a copywriter to come up with sales copy to increase the sales of the product that was originally offered. It may be copy that says, “Because you are ordering within 20 minutes of the show, you are entitled to buy our special deluxe knife set holder. This handsome wooden holder comes with engraved names for each of the knives you have ordered. . . .”
 You can offer anything from a deluxe version of a product or a second one at a discount to a complete set of something that may relate to your product or even the opportunity to get the product for less if the buyer signs up for automatic shipments (what is called “continuity”).
 As a copywriter, you may be asked to write copy for the upsell. After all, it is a form of selling and you should be prepared to write copy for this selling opportunity. My suggestion is to call up and order some of the products on TV and see how the operators handle their upsells. Often the upsell will vary greatly depending on the current approach to upsells. For example, today many upsells try to encourage continuity sales (regular monthly shipments), and other times it might be coaching or a deluxe version of something. Keeping your fingers on the pulse of the market is an excellent way for you to become an expert on this important selling opportunity. Once you are knowledgable about the product, the prospect and even the currently offered upsells by others, you’ll be able to apply the same principles you’ve already learned to come up with a variety of

##### different approaches, all of which will require testing to determine which one will work best.

# After-Sale Opportunities

##### If you thought that the upsell was the last opportunity to make that sale, think again. You now have a huge mailing list of those who have bought your product from your ads on TV, some with average orders and others spending into the hundreds of dollars.
 How do you address these people to sell them more? What tricks of the copywriting trade do you use to entice them to keep buying from you?
 Here’s a clue. If you have a list that was gathered from customers who bought on TV, use telemarketing. If they bought out of a catalog or from a print ad, use print or direct mail.
 You may be wasting your time and money trying to reach somebody using a catalog or a direct mail solicitation when the telephone is the way to reach them. And a good copywriter will create a good telephone selling message to reach this potentially lucrative audience.
 Again, using the principles already expressed in this handbook is a start. Begin the conversation with the purpose of establishing dialogue: “Mrs. Jones, how are you today?” “Fine,” she says. Then you respond with the reason you are calling and the offer you are making with the hope of having each question you ask elicit a yes or positive answer. For example, “I understand you have purchased Ron Popeil’s knife set—is that correct?”
 Your customer once again responds with a positive response. “Yes, I did” might be the answer. You have now established rapport and have gotten the start of the “yes” answers you need to create the harmony required to lead you to a positive answer when you ask for the sale.
 “Well, Mrs. Jones, Ron Popeil has asked me to call you with a special offer—something that would go nicely with your knife set.” Here you are using a little bit of curiosity. What is the thing Ron Popeil is offering? “Do you have a minute to talk?” Here you are getting another yes. Then you go into the sales pitch and ask, “How many sets would you like?”

# Home Shopping

##### I’ve had a lot of experience selling on QVC—the home shopping network both in Europe and in the United States. There is not much a copywriter needs to do there except for creating a written sales pitch the show hosts use to brief themselves. Again, it is the job of the copywriter to describe the product, briefly mentioning all its benefits and features. You can recommend various upsells and create the copy for the operators, but very often the upsell is up to QVC both to script and to use as they see fit.
 The home shopping networks in the United States and throughout the world are usually live broadcasts without the need for scripts, but they are worth mentioning if only to show that a copywriter’s job can cover all of the aspects of TV regardless of the form it may take.
 QVC does over $6 billion in sales a year. Their programs reach millions of households and have successfully delivered to consumers quality, value and convenience. And they love products that have proven themselves both in print and on TV. So if you are successful with a product in the other formats mentioned here, QVC would make a great opportunity for you once you’ve proven that you have a winning product.
 Once during a “Today’s Special Value” feature on QVC over 250,000 pairs of BluBlockers were sold. Now, that is incredible power—and all in one day.

# The Internet

##### The Internet holds such incredible advantages for copywriters and marketers that it indeed has become a major revolution in sales and marketing. And it will continue to grow now and well into the future. There are four reasons for this.
 First, you can be a tiny company with little means but look like even the biggest companies on the Internet. In short, your environment is your graphic presentation. The Internet levels the playing field, and graphics determine your image. Your race, religion and age do not matter. Cameron Johnson made millions of dollars on the Internet before he reached voting age. At 15 he earned $50,000 selling Beanie Babies and went on to earn $15,000 a day on one of his many sites. Now, at 21, he’s one of the most successful Internet marketers in history—and note, he started as a teenager.
 Second, testing is now less expensive and more immediate. You can easily test a marketing concept and your copy—even test the results of changing just a few words—to determine the difference in response, and all at almost no cost. This is a major breakthrough in the art and science of testing.
 Third, the speed at which you can come up with an idea and implement it quickly at low cost dwarfs almost every other form of selling and marketing. This is a wonderful time to be living if you love copywriting and marketing.
 Finally, there are many ways to sell using the Internet: e-mail broadcasts, using other media to call attention to your web site, links from other web sites, affiliate programs and the list goes on.
 And with the emergence of Internet video, a new dimension has been added—all the features of television combined with all the advantages of the Internet—resulting in a powerful medium, one that is still expanding and unfolding. As bandwidth and video grow on the Web, so do the possibilities for an extremely effective way to grow a business.
 How does a copywriter tackle a copywriting assignment to write copy for the Internet? How do we write for the Internet? How do you capture a prospect on this unique and exciting format? It’s more involved than you

##### may think, but once you understand some of the thinking and the marketing principles behind the format you can truly build an empire.
 First you’ve got to get people to read your copy. They either have to hear about your web site from some publicity you’ve generated, advertising you’ve done, links from other web sites or e-mail broadcasts you make. The problem is that people refer to unsolicited e-mails as spam and therefore unwanted.
 What will often work is a combination of elements to allow you to build your opt-in names and consequently send them communications they would not only be interested in but look forward to receiving on a frequent basis.
 Some companies have found that sending a catalog to a prospect from which the prospect buys creates a great opt-in buyer who can easily become a future Web buyer. Catalog sales are dropping while Internet sales grow, but this doesn’t mean that the catalog is dead or dying. It’s still alive and well and really needed to break through the bad reputation spam has given the Web.
 The catalog qualifies the buyer as a potential Internet buyer. And so would a TV spot or a radio announcement. Your list of customers culled from some other form of advertising can become a major source of hot prospects and future customers for Internet sales.
 There are a few different formats that you can use to apply your copywriting skills on the Web. There’s the e-mail broadcast, the web site home page, the web catalog, the blog, the ezine, the long sales letter and various combinations using video, links and search engine optimization to attract those prospects.
 You can see how many different formats and combinations there are and how varied each can be. So let’s take the most important ones and see how the various principles you’ve learned early in this handbook apply. But let me warn you. A lot of what I will describe is more marketing oriented than it is copywriting oriented. But to be a great copywriter you must learn everything you can about the medium you are working in. And if you know positively that something won’t work, you’ll save yourself or your client a lot of time and money. So get ready for some good marketing tips and insights on how to make the World Wide Web work for you.

## The E-Mail Broadcast

##### As in direct mail, e-mail is the most personal form of communication on the Web. In fact, using many of the word processing programs, you can personalize each letter with the recipient’s name. Not only can you start the body of the e-mail with a first or last name, but you can also add personal information or paragraphs that make each broadcast even more personal. And you can sign each e-mail with your own signature. But be careful not to overdo it. Your letter should sound like a very personal letter, not like you’ve just discovered a new personalization technique and you’re overdoing it.
 The principle of having a personal communication with your prospect is important here. The more personal the better. Keep it brief. If your e-mail is too long, it appears very intimidating and you’ll lose the reader. Remember, the average person in business has to filter through hundreds of messages a day. Keeping your message brief and offering a link to a catalog or a longer sales message is the approach you should use.
 Unlike other forms of personal communication, the great number of e- mails received during a typical business day and the prevalence of spam mean that recipients are very jaded in what they will even open and read. The first step in enticing them is to get them to read the subject line. I know that in a long list of e-mails waiting for me, the first thing I do is scan the subject lines. If I find one that interests me or I recognize the person or company that sent it, I will open it first. In this process, I will also delete the ones I don’t have time for or I know are spam.
 A subject line should be brief and either let the prospect clearly know who is sending it or cover a subject that your prospect would be interested in. I hope your business isn’t the stock market, real estate or a pharmacy selling Viagra. It seems that most of the spam is from these types of companies and the average recipient is already deleting a lot of that with spam filters.
 Your subject line is like the envelope of a direct mail campaign. The envelope copy compares to a headline in a mail order print ad. In an e-mail, that subject line is a tough one first to get through the spam filters and then to draw the attention of recipients who often discard it as more spam.
