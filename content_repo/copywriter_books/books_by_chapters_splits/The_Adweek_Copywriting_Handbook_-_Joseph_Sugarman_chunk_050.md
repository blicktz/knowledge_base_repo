##### People love to shop on the Internet. It’s convenient and generally fast, often beating the time needed to call a live operator to place an order.
 To run a successful Internet store you have to learn a few basic principles. First, let’s start with a few assumptions. Ideally, prospects have bought from a catalog, know the store that contacted them or searched on a search engine for a store selling what they are looking for. They’ve also agreed to opt in for future offers.
 Great. These people are now excellent prospects for future purchases. Your Internet company then sends an e-mail broadcast to its list. A recipient opens the e-mail to see what the company has to offer.
 Here’s where the offer has to be so simple that it will take only seconds to comprehend. Let’s assume for a moment someone purchases a leather jacket on the Internet after finding a store that has the style she is looking for.
 The package arrives quickly. This is very important. The main advantage of buying retail is that you can bring the product home with you. No waiting. Instant gratification is what a retail store offers. But when you buy through the Internet and the product is shipped to you, there is a lag time. To beat the retailers at their own game, Internet stores have learned to ship almost on the same day if possible to allow that item to arrive quickly. Shipping promptly greatly reduces the advantage retail has over mail order.
 Let’s get back to that company that sold the leather jacket. The customer likes the jacket when she receives it and sees that the invoice states clearly how she could return it if by chance she didn’t like it. So far, so good. The leather company has built trust in her continuing as a loyal customer. She wouldn’t mind receiving e-mails from that company in the future.
 Then an e-mail from the store does arrive. The subject line is “20% Off on Leather.” And as I mentioned previously, opening the e-mail reveals a single simple message with a nice graphic background. There is enough curiosity to cause her to click on the image shown in the e-mail and connect with the store. This first click gets her to the web site, where she can shop for anything else she might want to buy.

##### The store has a list of product categories of all its leather products from clothes to accessories, from motorcycle jackets to fashion jackets. You then click on the category you would like to explore and the category appears with several thumbnail photos of various products that come under this category. You then click on the picture of the item you are interested in and immediately it enlarges to give you a better view of the product and some text describing the item.
 This is where I find a lot of companies fail. They don’t describe the items in enough detail to make the prospect feel comfortable with their purchase. And I suspect dissatisfaction return rates would drop if they did. But you as a copywriter reading this handbook will know this and will provide more text in the description. Just mentioning color, size and texture won’t cut it. You need something more. Maybe talk about the type of leather, where it was made, how it was sewn, what features make it better than any other similar product. Include as much information about the item as possible. People don’t mind reading about something they are about to buy.
 One of the things you want to do for your store is to make sure that ordering is quick and easy. It has been proven that the more clicks required to consummate a purchase, the less likely it is that the purchase will be made. Requiring several clicks allows the potential purchaser to change his or her mind. When Amazon.com sends me an e-mail with a book offer, I can order it with just a few clicks. I don’t mind spending a minute or so to order the book, as it would have taken me an enormous amount of time to shop at a retail bookstore.
 Make sure you keep your clicks to a minimum, you deliver quickly and you describe your products fully, and you’ll have a lot of success with your web site store.

## The Future of the Internet

##### In the early 1980s I predicted in American Airlines’ in-flight magazine that the TV, the home computer and the telephone would merge into a single entity that would provide entertainment, enable communications and become a great research tool. We have already reached that point and have gone well beyond it. We can now watch TV shows on our computers, we can shop the far reaches of the world and we have at our fingertips the research tools to find anything we want when we want it. It truly is an amazing time we live in.
 But even more amazing is the equal opportunity the Web offers everyone reading this handbook. From aspiring entrepreneurs to experienced marketers, the Web is offering a new and more efficient way to distribute, sell or market products and services. And we are only at the beginning of that revolution. There is a lot more to come.
 With the ability to communicate in writing you hold one of the keys to this fast-emerging technology—a technology to enrich your life and indeed the lives of others.

### Epilogue

 Some Final Thoughts

##### The material that you have read was based on an exclusive seminar I conducted from 1977 through 2000. During this time I taught many students who went on to build great companies and fortunes for themselves. I’m proud of them all.
 And you should be proud of yourself, too, for having read this book. You have had to read and learn a great deal. I hope you will use this material to contribute to your community and to your country in a positive and productive way through the informative, entertaining and effective use of advertising.
 There are many businesses to build in the future. There’s the Internet and all the opportunities associated with it. There’s the combination of direct marketing and the new technologies that are only now being developed even as you read this. Congratulations for making the effort to succeed.
 I am not the smartest of men. Had I been smarter I would not have made many of the mistakes I did. I would have read more of the direct marketing books and learned more that would have prevented those mistakes from ever happening. I would have tested more. I would have thought more carefully before risking my money and my time.
 I never graduated from college, my grades were not great and I practically flunked English. I’ve never taken an advertising course (although that may have been the best educational break I ever had) and I’m not formally educated in many of the subjects necessary to ply my craft.
 I am also not that much more talented than others. There are many great writers, marketers and entrepreneurs. If you work longer hours, if you risk more of your time and capital, eventually you learn. I worked and risked a lot. And I learned a lot.
 Then what do I have? I would say two things could sum me up. The first is the skill I have to take a very complex issue and present it in a very

-----

##### simple, understandable way—in short, my communications skill. Because of it, I therefore became a good teacher and was able to pass along to my students the underlying reasons for why things work. I was able to share the many experiences I’ve had and point out the real lessons that I learned. Very often a teacher does not make a good practitioner and a practitioner does not make a good teacher. I like to think I can do both.
 The second thing I have is persistence. I don’t easily give up. And if I do, it is not without a very good reason. To me, it wasn’t whether I won or lost that was important. It was whether I played the game. And I played hard.
 There comes a time in your life to step out of the trenches and share the knowledge that you have acquired in your years of battle—to examine the scars and reflect on the lessons and the often odd directions you’ve taken. For me, that time is right now and this book is a product of that introspection.
 Claude Hopkins, one of the early pioneers in advertising, explained why he wrote his book My Life in Advertising in the 1920s: “Any man who by a lifetime of excessive application learns more about anything than others owes a statement to successors.”
 If I had to pick another motivation for writing this book, it would be my strong desire to give of myself to others. I learned more at my seminars by giving and sharing than I did at any time before or after. And aside from acquiring many insights from the seminar participants themselves, I was forced to organize and articulate my concepts to present them properly— which made me a better copywriter and marketer, as I soon started following my own advice.
 Many of the seminar participants were highly motivated. You had to be motivated to spend up to $3,000 to attend. And to get to know more than 200 of them personally—their successes, their failures and the lessons they learned—simply added to my base of knowledge and experience. You learn from the mistakes and failures of others, and as I was sharing my mistakes and failures, so were they sharing theirs.
 As mentioned in Chapter 1, Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid camera, once said, “A mistake is a future benefit, the full value of which is yet to be realized.” And in that spirit many of my mistakes became learning tools that I shared with my students and that inspired them.

##### I have helped many entrepreneurs build outstanding businesses and go on to contribute greatly to their industry and their community. That is my greatest thrill. For if I can continue that achievement with this book, I will have left a legacy that can live long after I am gone.

### Appendix A

 Assumed Constraints, Continued

##### As you can see from the diagram, by not assuming any constraints the answer to the puzzle on page 56 becomes quite simple. All too often we assume constraints that aren’t really there. By breaking out of the box you can come up with incredibly effective answers—whether you’re writing copy or simply solving everyday problems.

# Assumed Constraint Examples

##### The following are examples of assumed constraints from history. When somebody tells you it can’t be done, recall these seven historical examples before you become discouraged.
 1. “Drill for oil? You mean drill into the ground to try to find oil? You’re crazy.” This was said by drillers whom wildcatter Edwin L. Drake tried to enlist in his project to drill for oil in 1859. 2. “Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.” Ferdinand Foch, professor of military strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre, later commander of Allied Armies in World War I. 3. “Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” Irving Fisher, professor of economics, Yale University, 1929. 4. “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” Thomas Watson Sr., president of IBM, 1943. 5. “So we went to Atari and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got this amazing thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do you think about funding us? Or we’ll give it to you. We just want to do it. Pay our salary, we’ll come work for you.’ And they said, ‘No.’ So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said, ‘Hey, we don’t need you. You haven’t got through college yet.’” This was related by Steven Jobs, Apple Computer cofounder, on his attempts in the mid-1970s to get Atari and Hewlett-Packard interested in his and Steve Wozniak’s personal computer. 6. “A cookie store is a bad idea. Besides, the market research reports say America likes crispy cookies, not soft and chewy cookies like you make.” This was a response in the mid-1970s to Debbi Fields’ idea of starting Mrs. Fields Cookies. 7. “640K ought to be enough for anybody.” Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, 1981.

### Appendix B

 Seeds of Curiosity, Continued

##### You couldn’t wait, could you? You had to turn to the back of the book before you read the next line of copy in Chapter 10. Well, you just fell for the seeds of curiosity theory big time:
 Your message must always be so compelling that you motivate the reader to do things normally not done.
 I realize that you might think this is a dirty trick and the story never took place. You’re wrong on both counts. This is exactly what happened and this is no dirty trick. But to get people to reach into their pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for your product is not a natural act. It’s one of the most difficult things a copywriter must do to sell a product. It requires tremendous motivation—motivation that needs to be generated by a compelling message, a message so compelling that people will become totally involved with your copy, slide down the slippery slide and call or write to place an order or feel guilty if they haven’t.
 I guess it wouldn’t be fair, now that I’ve proven my point, to leave you hanging. After all, you were so involved with my text that you skipped all the rest of the chapters in this book (something you normally wouldn’t do) to find out exactly what Ginger said to me at that dramatic moment in my office.
 “Joe, I want only you to help me. I want you as my mentor—my guide through this direct marketing jungle. I don’t know what I can do to motivate you to help me, but I do know what most men appreciate. I’ve had men proposition me all my life but I’ve never openly propositioned a man. What I’m saying, Joe, is that—”
 “Wait,” I said, fumbling for words as I held up one hand as if to say stop. “You’ve got the wrong guy. Don’t embarrass yourself any further. I can no longer accept what I think you’re trying to say. I can’t do the work for you. I’m really too busy to take outside projects. But attend my seminar. I’ll let

##### you attend for free on the condition that you pay me back after you make your first million.”
 Ginger left the office, maybe a bit embarrassed. And I never heard from her again. I suspect that she thought she could entice me into writing copy by flaunting her body. And would she have really followed through? I guess I will never know.
 When I returned home that evening and my wife asked me how the day went, I replied, “Oh, I was almost seduced by a gorgeous blonde who was willing to give me her body for my copywriting ability.”

 Summary of Axioms and Major Points

##### The following lists summarize the axioms and major points of copywriting that have been presented throughout this book.

####

# Axioms

##### Axiom 1: Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or service. (page 24)
 Axiom 2: All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy. (page 29)
 Axiom 3: The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence. (page 33)
 Axiom 4: Your ad layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service. (page 38)
 Axiom 5: Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy. (page 44)
 Axiom 6: Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide. (page 49)
 Axiom 7: When trying to solve problems, don’t assume constraints that aren’t really there. (page 58)
 Axiom 8: Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity. (page 63)
 Axiom 9: Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept. (page 71)
 Axiom 10: The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem, and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, environment and ego. (page 80)
 Axiom 11: Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request. (page 85)
 Axiom 12: Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used. (page 92)

-----

##### Axiom 13: The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect’s questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face. (page 97)
 Axiom 14: In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words. (page 102)
 Axiom 15: Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized. (page 197)
