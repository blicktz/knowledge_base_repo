A man went into a bank with a gun and held ten people hostage, including a small child. The child cried as the man brandished the gun and yelled at the hostages to lay still. Police called in to the bank, but the robber would not answer the phone. It wasn’t until the mother of the child began speaking to the robber, identifying with his frustrations about the unfairness of the economy and sympathizing with the robber’s plight, that the robber let the hostages go and was later apprehended safely.

###### Do you read that as a sad story or a happy story? Most readers would say that the story is a feel-good story because it has a happy ending, yet the story is about a potentially violent criminal threatening the lives of the innocent, including a child. In fact, there are many more negative characteristics to the story than there are positive, yet the soft plot points of empathy and compassion and allowing the hostages to go free color the rest of the story. The principle is, the darker the story gets, the brighter the light is at the end of the tunnel.
 As business leaders, it is important to understand that emphasizing the negative consequences in play only makes placing the order a more hopeful and happy conclusion. In other words, the bad makes the good even better.

##### WHAT ARE YOU HELPING YOUR CUSTOMER AVOID?

###### What negative consequences are you helping customers avoid? Could your customers lose money if they don’t place an order? Are there health risks in play if your customers avoid your services? What about opportunity costs? Could they make or save more money with you than with a competitor? Could your customers’ quality of life decline if they pass up your offer? What is the cost of not doing business with you?
 If you’re a financial adviser, for example, the list of what you’re helping customers avoid might look like this:

 Confusion about how your money is being invested Not being ready for retirement A lack of transparency from your financial adviser A lack of one-on-one interaction with your adviser Hidden fees

 In your marketing copy, you can even imagine a tragic scene that might befall your customers if they don’t engage. In an email or on a landing page, a financial adviser might write something like this:
 “Don’t postpone your retirement. You’ve worked too hard for too long to not enjoy time with your grandchildren.”

###### Here are a few examples of what StoryBrand clients are helping their customers avoid:

**Perkins Motorplex (used cars)**

###### Getting ripped off by a used car salesman Being stuck with a lemon Feeling taken advantage of

**Rely Technology (audio and video for the home)**

###### Living in a boring home Nobody will want to watch the game at your house You need a PhD to turn on your television

**Aerospace Market Entry (manufacturer of aerospace equipment)**

###### Product failure, damaging your reputation Inefficient production Being passed by the competition

**Win Shape Camps (summer camp for kids)**

###### A long, boring summer A bunch of restless kids in your house Regret about having wasted the summer

 You can see how including these ideas in each client’s marketing material gave the story they invited customers into a sense of intrigue and urgency.
 In this module of your StoryBrand BrandScript, you’re given only a few bullet points. You’ll notice you’re given a great deal more in the success module. This, of course, is on purpose. You’ll need only a few terrible, dastardly, awful things to warn your customers about in order to create the necessary sense of urgency. Too much negativity and your customers will resist you, but if you use too little they won’t know why your products even matter.
 Once we’ve defined the negative stakes, your customers will be motivated to resist failure. In the next chapter, we’ll dramatically increase their motivation by helping them imagine how great life could be once they
