##### Let’s say you have a great headline, one that won’t be filtered out by the spam filters, which delete such words as “Free” or “Viagra” or “Low Interest Rates” or—well, you get the picture—seemingly all of the words that a sales message might use in a headline. Then how should the copy read?
 Well, I’ve already said that the copy should be brief. Maybe the subject line could direct the prospect someplace else where the message is a lot longer.
 Joe Vitale, prolific top-selling author whose recent book is There’s A Customer Born Every Minute (John Wiley & Sons, 2006), says that the copy should be what he calls “relationship builders.” In short, don’t try to sell anything but rather develop a dialogue and a level of trust with your prospect.
 Get prospects to open your e-mail each time you send one because you are sharing valuable or useful information that they appreciate. Your words should make prospects get into the habit of opening your e-mail. By sharing this sought-after information, it is easy then to wax enthusiastic about a product that you have and would like to sell them.
 By the time you do that, the prospect feels a little guilty if he or she doesn’t respond. Plus you’ve developed this wonderful rapport and they feel they can trust you. You have integrity.
 Vitale calls it “karmic marketing.” Do enough good by giving of yourself and your knowledge to help people and you will reap the rewards at the end. “It’s really karmic,” says Vitale.
 Joe Polish, a top-niche marketing expert from Phoenix, agrees. He says, “You need to educate and provide value in your e-mails. Only after you’ve communicated and provided value and even bonded with the prospect do you start to offer them your product or service.”
 Polish says there are three elements to obtain good opt-in e-mail addresses—push, pull and dangle. You pull them from your media ads or any off-line activities. Then you dangle something free that would interest them. And finally you push out marketing messages. Money is made only on the last step.
 Polish feels that there are two types of marketing methods: transaction versus relationship marketing. Once you develop the relationship, it is much easier to succeed in selling something than it is in strictly a transaction

## The Long Internet Letter

##### Just as the long copy ads of the past 35 years have been a great method of conveying the value of premium products and services, there is an equivalent on the Internet—the long letter or ezine (an Internet version of a sales magazine).
 I have seen letters that were 32 pages long on the Web. I have seen testimonials not only in full color with actual people and real names but also with sound and video. The testimonials come alive, and you are the one who can play them simply by clicking on the control strip located below the picture.
 The art in all this technology gives Internet marketers tools they never had before and an involvement with the prospect that was never even imagined a decade ago.
 As a copywriter you use the same principles you would use to write that print ad but you add a few bells and whistles to enhance your message. In general, the longer the copy, the more expensive the purchase. But regardless of how much copy you use, it should be so interesting and compelling that your prospects feel like they are on a slippery slide, unable to stop reading.
 Now here is where the difference comes in between the print ad and the Internet ad. In a print ad, the prospect knows to glance at the end of the ad to get a summary of the offer and all the ordering information. Not so with a long Internet ad. Throughout the ad you need to have “Buy Now” buttons on almost every screen, even at the very beginning of the ad.
 In a print ad it is very helpful to have paragraph headings to make the copy look less intimidating. That makes a lot of sense. In a long Internet letter having paragraph headings could serve that purpose as well. But if you make those paragraph headings into links that go straight to your order page, you can accomplish both—a less intimidating look and a direct link to your order page.
 I always recommend having testimonials in a print ad and to make sure the testimonials are genuine. They become even more real and believable when you can include the testimonial givers’ true names and actual hometowns.

##### The Internet takes the matter of testimonials one notch higher by incorporating both audio and video. You click on the “Play” button and the person recites his or her glowing comments with both sound and motion. In short, you are harnessing the advantages of television to make the testimonials that much more impressive. And you can do that several times in a single letter. You can put them at the beginning or the end, group them in the middle, or sprinkle them throughout the letter.
 The long letter does not have to limit audio and video to just testimonials. Often a small demonstration might make sense. Or the person making the sales presentation could do it in a video clip. But be careful. Make sure the person has good diction, can speak naturally, not like he or she is reading from a script, and looks presentable. Whether you like it or not, there will be some out there who will judge the presenter on his or her looks and you may evoke a negative emotion from some prospects and lose them as customers—just because they didn’t like the presenter’s handsome face or gorgeous figure. Test the letter with and without the video or your audio sales presentation and find out if you are creating bad emotional response.
 Your picture should be in that long letter. Again, like the testimonial, it evokes trust and confidence. Prospects feel a real person is behind the product or service they are contemplating purchasing.
 Long copy is both informative and educational. As long as you are providing very interesting information to somebody who is hungry for that information, the length of the letter does not matter. Just follow the basic principles of copywriting explained in the first part of this handbook, incorporate a lot of the new video technology if it makes sense, and you will truly capture the attention, respect and trust of your prospect. And you will make plenty of sales in the process.

## The Internet Infomercial

##### It would stand to reason that the Internet would be the ideal place to run infomercials. After all, you’ve got the audio and video capabilities right on your computer—the same elements you see on commercial or cable TV.
 And if somebody is interested in your product or service, they’ll appreciate seeing and hearing as much information about it as possible.
 Typically, the length of an infomercial on TV is 28½ minutes. But when you are using the Web, your infomercial can be any length you want. You can run one on TV and run it on the Web in its full length or you can edit it to 15 minutes and run it in a shorter format. There are also a few rules to keep in mind as you prepare an infomercial for the Web.
 The first rule is regarding price: The more expensive the product, in general, the longer the infomercial.
 The second rule covers the ordering process. Since you are on the Web, you can make it very easy to place an order. Simply put an “Order Now” button on your screen when you would normally put the call to action. (It can be in the first five minutes or later in the show.) Your prospect will press the Order Now button and place the order.
 The third rule to remember has to do with attention span. Your typical Internet viewer has a much shorter attention span than your TV viewer and is more likely to leave your site than a TV viewer is to switch channels. TV viewers are accustomed to half-hour segments, so once they are viewing a show they may be less inclined to change channels. If they did, they would end up in the middle of some other program. Not so on the Internet. They can go anywhere on their computers—from checking e-mail to finding something else that might interest them. So you need to keep your presentation interesting, fast moving, and in most cases shorter than an infomercial on TV.
 Finally, don’t forget the upsell potential on your infomercial. You can do the upsell with audio and video once they’ve made the buying decision and have placed the order. You should also list the toll-free number. Many will not feel comfortable placing their order on the Web and will want to talk to a real human.

-----

##### Your infomercial need not be expensive. You can shoot your program with a good quality consumer video camera. And it could be a simple format like you being interviewed by somebody.
 You will start seeing more and more infomercials on the Internet in the very near future. In fact, I predict that this will be one of the fastest growing segments on the Internet, so consider it when you look at your media mix.

## The Book Promotion

##### One of the major changes in marketing has occurred in the book industry. Traditionally, an author, to get his or her book onto the best seller lists, had to go on a major public relations (PR) tour and do book signings, besides getting great reviews and spending plenty of money on advertising. All that has changed as a result of the Internet, and now smart authors are taking a totally different route.
 Here’s what a copywriter should know to write excellent copy to create a promotion leading to a number one best seller. And here’s the good part: If you’re an author, you need none of the old methods you had to use before the advent of the Internet. Here’s what successful authors are doing now.
 A week before the publication date of a book, an author will create a web site in which he plugs his book and makes an offer to his opt-in list. He encourages his list to buy the book on its release date, so all the response comes in at once. Each prospect who buys the book on the very day it is released receives free goodies worth sometimes thousands of dollars. The free goodies often come from the author and the author’s friends.
 And these friends also sell books, have web sites, and are happy to supply their goodies to the author because doing so enables them to expand their own opt-in lists. These friends then broadcast the author’s offer to their entire opt-in lists, too. Each friend’s free gift to a book purchaser has a catch to it. The free gift requires the e-mail address and name of the recipient of the free gift in order to have access to it. This builds the friend’s opt-in e- mail list and becomes a win-win for both parties. Expand this to a dozen friends looking to expand their opt-in lists and you can see the viral effect this can have for the book’s success and for the friends’ ability to increase their opt-in names.
 The free gifts usually cover electronic files a customer can obtain over the Internet by downloading some report or a portion of an e-book or some similar item.
 Joe Vitale offered his recent book, Life’s Missing Instruction Manual (John Wiley & Sons, 2006), along with numerous gifts as part of the purchase if his opt-in list members would order through Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com on the publication day. Over 35,000 books were

##### quickly sold and the book was number one on Amazon.com for four straight days.
 Dozens of Vitale’s friends participated in the offer both by supplying their own free gifts for his promotion and volunteering their opt-in lists to spread the word. Millions of opt-in names were contacted, and the response catapulted the book to the top slot on Amazon.com. As a result of what was accomplished and the resulting publicity associated with making the number one list, a single chain purchased 10,000 books.
 “The gifts were well thought out,” says Vitale. “You just don’t offer any old thing but items that the prospect might buy just on its own. I look for quality items to offer.”
 Recently, Wayne Dyer, a spiritual guru and author of the million seller Your Erroneous Zones (Funk & Wagnalls, 1976), did a major promotion of his new best seller, Inspiration (Hay House, 2006). He used the Internet selling method described here despite his best-selling-author image. In short, even established, highly respected authors are using this method. This handbook that you are holding was to be introduced this way. If you’re just starting out with your first book, you have the opportunity to become a successful author using this method. The playing field is much more level than at any other time in the history of the publishing industry.

## The Personal Blog

##### It started as a way of giving people the opportunity to express themselves, tell the world what they are doing and share everything from pictures to emotions—a great opportunity for people who enjoy writing.
 Web logs, or blogs, are now a major trend throughout the world, with people in all walks of life starting them—from doctors to students, from housewives to authors. It is easy to set one up, fun to watch it grow and a way to promote yourself if you are a copywriter or certainly a way to share your personality and your view of events with the world.
 So if you’re a copywriter, set one up if you haven’t already done so. And express yourself in writing each day. You’ll be amazed at how your writing will improve and how many people will be interested in reading your musings.
 The search engines that look for content pay considerable attention to blogs, often placing them quite high on search results lists. And one of the tips that Joe Vitale offers if you want high search engine presence is to use popular events, current trends and famous names to get the best rankings. Vitale ran the headline, “What I Learned from Lindsay Lohan about Losing Weight,” and it was picked up prominently by the search engines simply because of the association with a famous personality.
 Once again, a blog is a great way to expand your writing skills. You can do reviews, entertain or even brag a little about what you do. It’s all fair game on a blog. Go for it.

## The Viral Transmission

##### Don’t worry, it’s not a new disease and you won’t need any vaccine. Here’s how it works. Let’s say you have a brand-name product and you want to promote the brand. Or you have a web site and want to attract more hits. You can do what I did along with a friend, Stan Oliver, to promote the BluBlocker brand name.
 Oliver has a web site that promotes his “CyberSpacers” cartoon characters. BluBlocker has its web site that promotes its sunglasses. What Oliver did was locate an exciting video game that had been developed in one of the Eastern European countries and obtain a license to use the game software. With the help of a cartoonist he turned it into a game that incorporated sunglasses, video game action and his cartoon characters.
 He then made contact with a small advertising agency in London that I visited. The agency specialized in sending broadcasts out through the Internet with games or humorous animation. After they transmit the game they then monitor and rank the game to determine how many times it has been played in which country over a period of time.
 Since there are several similar games or video clips, each item is ranked according to number of hits. Within a week of our game’s launch, it became a major hit, scoring number one in the rankings (the King Kong game promoting the 2005 movie ranked second). The more than 1.5 million hits on our game came from many countries throughout the world. Every continent and almost every major country had people playing the game. The hits to the BluBlocker web site grew as well, and the brand became known to a whole new generation of prospects. And sales followed suit.
 It was easy to understand the viral nature of the game. When somebody played it and liked it, they referred their friends to it, who downloaded it, played it and then recommended it to all of their friends. If you do the math, you see it doesn’t take long for the game to circle the globe. And that’s what this game did. In fact, it probably is still circling the globe as you read this.
 With a program like this, we added copy to our web site to take advantage of the exposure and to suggest to those visiting us for the first time to check out our store. As a copywriter, I needed to turn those visits into sales. I had to write copy to get our visitors involved with getting to know more about our line of sunglasses.
