##### One of the questions people may think about while reading an ad is “Can I really justify this purchase?” Once again, it is a question that is raised and then must be resolved. If you don’t resolve it, then you won’t answer all the prospect’s questions and this will give the prospect the excuse to “think about it” and, of course, never buy.
 Somewhere in your ad, you should resolve any objection by providing some justification to the purchaser. Sometimes it’s just saying, “You deserve it.” And other times you might have to justify it in terms of savings (the price is a one-time-only value), health reasons (protects your eyes), recognition (the men in your life will love the way you look in it) or dozens of other reasons based on the wants and needs of your prospect.
 People often tell me, “Joe, when I read your ads, I feel guilty if I don’t buy the product.” That’s quite a compliment and probably due to the way I justify a purchase in the mind of the consumer.
 The higher the price point, the more need there is to justify the purchase. The lower the price point or the more value the price represents, the less you have to justify the purchase. In fact, the lower the price, the more greed plays a role.

# 7. Greed

##### Greed in the form of attraction to bargains is a very strong motivating factor. I don’t know how many times I’ve bought things even though I didn’t need them simply because they were a bargain.
 Don’t hesitate to recognize greed as a very strong factor in either low- priced merchandise or expensive products offered at low prices. Too low a price may diminish your credibility unless you justify the low price. Many people are willing to risk dealing with an unknown vendor just to pay less and get more for their money. Providing the consumer with more than what is normally received for the price is a way of appealing to the consumer’s greed.
 In one of my earlier ads in the Wall Street Journal, I offered a calculator for $49.95 and the manufacturer got really upset with me. “That product should have sold for $69.95 and now I have dealers all over the country calling me and complaining,” screamed the manufacturer.
 “Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ll correct it.” So I ran a small ad in the Wall Street Journal announcing my error, raising the price from $49.95 to $69.95 and giving consumers just a few days to respond at the old price. Even though the size of the ad was considerably smaller, it outpulled the previous one as people rushed to buy the calculator within those few days at the $49.95 bargain price.
 Greed is not a technique that can be employed all the time. But it should be recognized as an effective element that plays on everybody’s weakness.
 When you lower the price of a product, you usually end up with more unit sales. Keep lowering the price, and you’ll continue to generate more unit sales than before if the price drop is big enough. Go too low and you’ll have to add a little justification for the lower price as it will start raising credibility issues with your prospects.
 Greed is really not a very positive human trait. But it exists and it is a force to consider when communicating with your prospects.

# 8. Establish Authority

##### There’s always something that you can say about your company to establish your authority, size, position or intention. The consumer loves to do business with experts in a particular area. That’s why the trend is away from department stores that sell general merchandise to category stores that sell a specific line of products. These stores have more expertise, knowledge and authority in a specific category.
 For example, for years I would call JS&A “America’s largest single source of space-age products.” What I was really doing was establishing the authority of JS&A as a major supplier of space-age products. The words “single source” really meant that we shipped our products out of a single location. We may not have shipped more space-age products than Sears or RadioShack, but we shipped more out of a single location and we specialized only in space-age products.
 Establishing your authority is something that should be done in each ad regardless of how big or how little you are. For example, “America’s largest supplier of specialized products for the chimney sweep industry.” (One of my seminar participants was actually in the chimney sweep industry.) Or even if you are the smallest, you can always say, “The hardest-working bunch of guys in the advertising business.” If you really examine your company, you will find something you can say that establishes your authority and expertise in what you are selling.
 Then, after you establish your authority, there is going to be the temptation to stop using the phrase that established your authority. I know that when we had run our phrase for almost six years I wondered if we really needed it. But there were always those first-time readers who caught the ad and needed that reassurance that they were dealing with an authoritative company in the field in which they were contemplating a purchase. That phrase gave them the confidence.
 Sometimes it is easy to establish authority by virtue of the name of the company. American Symbolic Corporation was a company I set up once whose name sounded like it was a very big operation. Jack and Ed’s Video doesn’t sound very big at all. Computer Discount Warehouse gives you a

##### pretty good idea of their authority. It has name recognition, plus it tells you what the company is through its name.

## People Respect Authority

##### People naturally respect a knowledgeable authority. Let’s say you want to buy a computer. You might first check with the expert in your neighborhood who is known as the neighborhood computer genius. Let’s call him Danny. He has established his authority and you feel quite comfortable going to Danny to get advice. He’ll then tell you what he thinks you should buy and from whom. And chances are, he’ll recommend some retail outlet that has established itself with some level of authority. It might be the cheapest computer company or maybe the company that provides the best service. You’ll seek out the type of authority you need.
 Sometimes the authority does not even have to be stated but can be felt by the copy, the layout or the message of an ad. Establish your authority in the field of the product or service you are selling and you’ll find that it will make a big difference in your copy’s effectiveness.
 Let me give you a personal example of something that really illustrates the point. As I was about to walk into a local business supply store in Las Vegas, a young lady came running up to me and said, “Please, could you help me?”
 I was a little surprised by the suddenness of her approach and, in fact, first thought that there was some kind of emergency. “Sure, what’s the problem?”
 Almost with tears in her eyes, she answered, “I’m about to buy a computer and I’ve picked out the one I like the most, but I need somebody to tell me if I’ve made the right choice. If you know about computers, could you come in the store with me and give me your opinion?”
 I agreed and went into the store with her. The girl explained that she was attending college at UNLV (the University of Nevada at Las Vegas) and since this was her first computer, she needed reassurance from somebody who knew computers that this was a good and wise purchase. She told me how most of the people in the store really didn’t know that much about computers. I looked over the computer and, having pretty good knowledge about home computers, told her that she had indeed made a wise choice and that the computer was also a good value. I pointed out some of the technical features that would help her in her schoolwork, and although she didn’t

## Nobody Wants to Make a Mistake

##### Relieved, she thanked me, and then was off to buy her new computer. As she was walking away, she looked over her shoulder and said, “I’ve worked hard for my money and I didn’t want to make a stupid mistake.”
 Before you bought a computer, you may have first called somebody who was a partial expert on computers to ask for an opinion. You, too, wanted reassurance and confidence about the purchase you were making—that the money you were about to exchange for a computer was going to be spent wisely. The same holds true when you buy anything of value. You just want reassurance. If, however, you can trust the sales organization as the experts, then you won’t need any outside expert opinion as the young student needed in the preceding example.
 Even after you buy something, you often seek confirmation that your purchase was a good one. The late direct marketing consultant Paul Bringe once wrote: “One of the first things we do after making a sizable purchase is to seek assurance from others that our decision was a good one. We tell our family, our neighbors, our friends and our business associates and wait for their approval.”
 One of the surprises I had while taking orders on our phone lines at JS&A was the number of customers who stated something like, “I bet that’s one of your best-selling products.” In many cases, it wasn’t. But in every case, whenever I mentioned that the product they had just purchased was indeed a very popular product, there was always a comment like, “I just knew that it was.” People need reassurance that they have made the right purchase.

# 9. Satisfaction Conviction

##### When you saw this heading, you might have thought we would be talking about the trial period. Indeed, a trial period could be defined as a form of satisfaction conviction. “If you aren’t totally satisfied with my product within one month, you may send it back for a full refund.” But that isn’t what we mean here. Sure, every direct response offer should have a trial period. After all, the consumer needs to touch and feel a product to make a decision about whether to keep it. So the trial period provides the buyer with a level of confidence. The consumer can change his or her mind if it is not exactly what he or she is looking for.
 But a satisfaction conviction is more than a trial period. It basically conveys a message from you to your prospect that says, “Hey, I’m so convinced you will like this product that I’m going to do something for your benefit to prove how incredible my offer is.”
 If your potential customer, after reading what you are going to do, says something like, “They must really believe in their product,” or “How can they do it?” or “Are they going to get ripped off by customers who will take advantage of their generosity?” then you know you’ve got a great example of a satisfaction conviction.
 Let me give you an example. When I first offered BluBlocker sunglasses, I said in my TV advertising, “If you’re unhappy with BluBlockers, I’ll let you return them anytime you want. There is no trial period.” A lot of people thought to themselves, “That must be a good product or otherwise they wouldn’t make that offer.” Or they may have said, “Boy, are they going to get ripped off.” In either case, I conveyed a conviction that my customer was going to be so satisfied that I was willing to do something that is rarely done.
 In one ad, I stated, “If you aren’t happy with your purchase, just call me up and I’ll personally arrange to have it picked up at my expense and refund you every penny of your purchase price including the time you took to return the product.”

## Testing a Satisfaction Conviction

##### Once I was able to test the power of a satisfaction conviction. In an ad I wrote for the company called Consumers Hero, I was offering subscriptions to a discount bulletin showing refurbished products at very low prices. But rather than just mail the bulletin to prospects, I formed a club and offered a subscription to the bulletin. I tested various elements in the 700-word ad. I changed the headline and tested it and improved response by 20 percent. I changed the price and saw little change in total response. The lower the price, however, the more orders I received. But when I changed just the satisfaction conviction, the response rate doubled.
 In one ad, I said, “If you don’t buy anything during your two-year subscription, I’ll refund the unused portion of your subscription.”
 In the second ad I stated, “But what if you never buy from us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us just your membership card and we’ll fully refund your five dollars plus send you interest on your money.”
 In the first ad, you see a basic, simple trial-period type offer. In the second version, however, you see an offer that goes well beyond the trial period and can be classified as a satisfaction conviction.
 In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfaction conviction was at the very end of the ad. This meant that people read the entire ad and then, at the very end when that important buying decision had to be made, the satisfaction conviction removed any remaining resistance to buying into the concept.
 If you have gotten the reader into the slippery slide and all the way to the end of an ad, it’s that last part of the ad where you’ve got an awful lot to do. Think about it. You’ve got to explain the offer to the prospect, why it’s a good offer and why he or she should buy the product, and then you’ve got to do something dramatic to push him or her over the edge—all within the very last part of your sales message. It’s like a salesperson asking for the order and then also saying, “And if you buy this from me now, I will do something that few salespeople would do to ensure your satisfaction.”
 The right satisfaction conviction is important, too. The ideal satisfaction conviction should raise an objection and resolve it, as I’ve indicated in the

-----

##### previous chapter, but in resolving it, go beyond what people expect.
 It was effective in my Consumers Hero ad because it tied perfectly into resolving any last-minute resistance. First it raised the objection—“What if I don’t buy from your bulletin over a two-year period?” And then I resolved it with a satisfaction conviction—something that went beyond what people expected.
 But be careful to use a satisfaction conviction that makes sense for the offer. You wouldn’t want to raise an objection and then satisfy it with the wrong resolution. Make sure any objection is indeed satisfied by the correct resolution. In short, it’s got to make sense.
 The satisfaction conviction is a critical part of the sales message and few realize its importance. Yet, if you can create a powerful satisfaction conviction, this simple device will do a great deal for the success of your offers.

# 10. Nature of Product

##### This is one of the really important keys in determining how to sell a product. First, you have to realize that every product has its own unique personality, its own unique nature, and it’s up to you to figure it out.
 How do you present the drama of that product? Every product has one very powerful way of presenting itself that will express the true advantages and emotion that the product has to offer and motivate the largest number of people to buy it.
 Remember the Midex burglar alarm that I sold for many years through full-page ads in national magazines? What was the nature of that product and how could I motivate people to buy it? I explained that in Chapter 2.
 I used the security system as an example of the nature of products. This was an unusual product because it had a unique personality. The product category itself had its own profile. By realizing the nature of every product and playing to its strengths, you will end up with a very powerful and emotionally dramatic presentation.
 Think about other examples. What is the nature of a toy? It’s a fun game. So you bring out the enjoyment. What is the nature of a blood pressure unit? It’s a serious medical device that you use to check your blood pressure. Note the word serious. What is the nature of a burglar alarm? It’s a serious product that should be easy to install, work when it is supposed to and provide protection to concerned homeowners. Very often, common sense is all you need to understand and appreciate the nature of a product.
 Realize that you must understand the nature of the product you are selling or you won’t effectively sell it.
