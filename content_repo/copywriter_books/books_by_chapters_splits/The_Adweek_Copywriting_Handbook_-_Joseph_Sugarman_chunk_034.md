##### These are very strong motivating factors for the right product or the right situation.
 The concept is to basically let prospects feel that they are special if they buy a particular product—that they will belong to the very small group that can be envied for owning this very limited item.
 The emotional appeal of this approach is quite strong. Everybody likes to feel special. Most people would like to belong to a rare group that owns a product that few people can own and enjoy.
 By limiting the number they produce, some marketing companies have come up with a very strong appeal for consumers. The Franklin Mint—a multimillion-dollar business—was built on the premise of the limited edition, first with coins and then later with everything from plates and cups to model cars and dolls. Anything you could collect and they could limit was fair game for the Mint.
 The thought behind the limited edition is also to provide value. As people build various collections of things, the objects grow in value if others start collecting the same goods too. Soon, the collections come to the attention of the mass market and that attracts more collectors. Then the value of the collections really starts to grow.
 Those collectibles that have a limited circulation or a limited number in circulation grow in value even more. And there’s always the story of somebody discovering an heirloom in the attic worth a small fortune. There are exceptions, of course—silver airplane tails, to name one.
 One of the appeals of an exclusive item is the possibility of extra future value implied by limiting the circulation of that product.
 The power of exclusivity was driven home to me in October of 1980 when I was in Minocqua, Wisconsin. It was right after I had given a seminar.
 At the seminar site, for the enjoyment of the participants, I kept a stable of six snowmobiles. Whenever I would give a seminar during the winter, I would have these machines available for my students during their breaks.

##### Riding snowmobiles was a lot of fun and everybody loved to drive them. Then one day the president of Mattel Electronics, Jeff Rochlis, broke his arm in a bad snowmobile accident. That ended our snowmobile program.
 I now had six snowmobiles in my garage with not many people to use them. Out of curiosity, one day I visited the local snowmobile shop—the same place that had sold me the six that I owned. I obviously didn’t need any more but I wanted to see what small improvements were added in the new models.
 I walked into the shop and asked the salesman, “Well, Paul, what’s new for this year?”
 Paul took me over to a snowmobile that was propped up on a small riser and pointed to it. “This baby is our new oil-cooled model that goes over 100 miles per hour and sells for $2,600.”
 At the time, snowmobiles were selling for under $1,000 and their top speed was around 40 miles per hour so this new model was obviously special. But regardless of how special it was, I already had six and I certainly did not need any more. I turned to Paul and in a matter-of-fact way said, “Who could possibly want a snowmobile that could go 100 miles per hour and cost $2,600? How ridiculous.”
 Paul chuckled, “Well, there are only going to be six sold in the entire state this year. We’ve been allocated only two of them and we already have one sold.”
 I then quickly blurted out, “I’ll take this one.” Yes, I ended up buying it. I wanted to be one of the few who owned this powerful new machine. I wanted to feel that I was part of a unique group and that I was special. And even though I didn’t need any more snowmobiles, I ended up buying it and I was proud of the fact that I did.
 It was this incident that made me realize the power of exclusivity, uniqueness and rarity.

# 24. Simplicity

##### You must keep your advertising copy simple. The positioning of your product must be simple. Your offer must be simple. In short, you want to keep your entire presentation as simple as possible while still getting across your message.
 There are times when you want to turn something simple into something complex. We talked about that in the previous chapter under the topic “Product Explanation.” But that rule applies to marketing issues, and here we are looking at the basic psychological motivator of simplicity.
 What does this mean in terms of your advertising copy? I like to tell my students to focus. Focus on what you are trying to accomplish and eliminate things that either complicate your presentation or aren’t necessary.
 This doesn’t mean you write copy that is so simple a third grader can read it. That’s not what we mean by simple. The copy should be able to be read by the less educated people as well as the more educated and come across clearly. It is not good style to write either “up” or “down” to anybody.
 The use of big words to impress is one example of writing up to somebody. You’re trying to impress with your use of words while somebody else who might not be familiar with your fancy words will be lost. Use simple easy-to-understand words. Words are, after all, stories— emotional images—each having an impact sometimes greater than we think. Using simple words has the greatest impact. Using words that everybody can understand has a greater impact than words that most people have difficulty with.
 And keep your layouts simple. Tests have confirmed that things like color bars across an ad, fancy type that is difficult to read and lines that draw your eyes away from the copy can hurt comprehension. Fancy typefaces may look good but they often give the lowest comprehension scores.

## Simplicity Is a Powerful Tool

##### If you have a tendency to complicate things, you’re not going to succeed in writing good direct response advertising copy. Be aware of this important point as you decide which typeface to use, how you want to present your product and the offer you want to make.
 A good example of how simplicity works in direct response happened to me when Murray Raphel, a dear friend and a great public speaker, approached me. He had been in touch with the people who had developed the Swiss Army watch and wondered if I would be interested in marketing the product in the United States. Yes, I was. A meeting was arranged in which I was going to see the line of watches.
 At the meeting I was presented with three styles and three colors in each style for a total of nine different watches. One was a men’s style, the second was for women and the third was for children. The colors were black, red and khaki. I examined the watches, learned the history and in general became very knowledgeable about the watches themselves. Then came the big question.
 “Mr. Sugarman, you’ve examined the watches. What do you think?” I looked over the watches, thought for a few minutes and answered, “I’d like to run just the men’s watch in black in the Wall Street Journal to test the concept.”
 The watch company executives looked perplexed. “Why don’t you offer all the styles? Look at how many more people you’ll reach if you offer nine different styles. You’ll reach women and children in addition to men and you’ll give them all a color choice.”
 I told them that in my experience, keeping it simple was the best approach and that offering a customer too many choices was a very dangerous thing to do.
 But no matter what I said, they would not agree. “Logic says, Mr. Sugarman, that offering more of a choice will result in more sales.”
 I then came up with an idea to prove that I was right. I offered to run two separate ads in what is called an “A/B split.” That is where the Wall Street Journal will print two separate versions of the same ad—version A and version B—to be delivered in the same area at the same time. So one home

##### will get one version of the ad while the next-door neighbor might get version B. This was a very good way to test two different ads to determine the winning approach.

 These two ads were practically identical with ad A (top) offering nine different models and ad B (bottom) offering only one.

-----

##### I offered to do the test and ran the two ads with almost identical copy and graphics. One of the few differences was that in ad A, I showed the men’s watch along with the child’s watch for size perspective, whereas in ad B, I

-----

##### showed just the men’s watch. I then listed each one of the choices—nine in all—in ad A and just one in ad B.
 When I finished the ads, the A version actually looked better than the version with only one choice. When both versions ran, the ad that featured only one men’s watch outpulled the other version that featured nine models by a surprising 3 to 1 ratio. In short, for every watch we sold from the ad that featured the nine styles, we sold three in the other ad that showed just the one black watch.
 I knew almost instinctively that to give the consumer a confusing array of choices meant that the consumer would back off and not buy.
 When would I show all these nine watches? Later, in my catalog. Once I’ve located those people interested in Swiss Army watches, I would then show them all nine models in the catalog. By the time the catalog reaches my customer, he or she has been qualified as a watch buyer. I can now offer a larger selection.
 Another good example of the power of simplicity occurred during the production of a half-hour TV commercial I was doing for a pill that reduced wrinkles and improved the skin. Called Miracell, the product was truly revolutionary. I had been taking it for a few months and noticed dramatic results. We did two double-blind studies that proved that the product really did work. But there was one major problem.
 For maximum effectiveness, you had to take two pills a day for the first three months and then reduce the intake to one pill a day.
 This violated my principles of simplicity and I was very concerned that the consumer was going to be confused. You make it easy initially to buy a continuity product and then later you raise the price. For example, the first video in a video series offered on TV may cost only $5. It is a simple offer and it isn’t very expensive. You then buy the video and to get the rest of the series, you must pay $19.95 a month to receive a video each month for the next 12 months.
 I was going the opposite way. For the first three months, pills would cost double what they would cost during the fourth month and beyond. And here I was recommending taking two pills a day for three months and then one pill a day for the rest of the time. Prospects might find it really confusing and hold off buying.

-----

##### So I did two things to ensure the success of this show, which we had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare. The first was to have the host in the show verify the dosage and tell how the program worked even after I had explained it. We devoted almost three minutes to explaining the complicated offer in order to answer all anticipated questions.
 But somehow I knew that the first offer was too complicated. And so I prepared an alternative offer just in case. For the second version I shot additional footage with just a simple offer: “Miracell costs $25 a box and a box lasts one month.” That was it. It was very simple and very easy to understand. I knew that I would have to supply my customers with a double dose for the first three months, so three boxes would be at my own expense if this second version of the ad worked and the complicated first version did not.
 Sure enough, after testing, the version that worked was the simple one; it outpulled the first one by a very large margin. We ended up giving away an enormous amount of product in order to keep the offer simple and make the program simple as well.
 Simplicity in direct response is critical and quite necessary. These are just two typical experiences from my many years of direct response marketing in various media.

# 25. Human Relationships

##### It is always important to relate the product or service you are offering in human terms. How the product will fit, how it will feel, how it will look— these are just some of the ways you can relate. That may seem pretty obvious.
 But there are other ways that copy or graphics can bring a human element to an advertisement. And let’s look at why this is important.
 Buying is an emotional human experience when we exchange our hard- earned money for a product or service. And because we worked hard for that money, the act of buying represents more than just handing over our money. Buying something becomes an emotional event.

## Resonating with Your Prospect

##### Now let’s consider for a moment a physical device—specifically a tuning fork. I’m talking about the ones that look like a U-shaped piece of metal. Clang one of the metal tines and you hear a vibration. Take two tuning forks and if they are of the same frequency and you hit just one, the other one will start vibrating even though it did not come into physical contact with the first one.
 Taking this experiment one step further, if you take several tuning forks and put them together and hit them all, they will create a harmonic frequency all their own. And if you just happen to know what that combined frequency is and have a tuning fork that matches that frequency, then, it too, will start to vibrate in resonance with all the other tuning forks.
 In creating a direct response advertisement, it is important that you create a condition where your customer is in perfect harmonic resonance with your copy. We talked earlier in this book about getting the prospect to start nodding his or her head in agreement until the close. And the close becomes easier because the prospect is already nodding yes in agreement. It then becomes easier to say yes when that final question is posed: “May I have your order?”
 If you look at all the elements of an advertisement as a series of tuning forks that must resonate with your reader, you’ve got a valuable picture of the dynamics that take place during the selling process.
 One tuning fork might be the headline, another might be the picture, another might be the caption, and on to the first sentence and through the copy to the final offer. In a print ad, the vibrations must be conveyed through the elements in the advertisement.
 In order to create these positive vibrations, you first must interest the prospect in reading your copy and then you must really “tune in” and relate to your prospect.
 You can add a human element by relating a story in your copy. Stories hold people’s interest. This technique is the next trigger discussed. Or you can use a byline and write copy in the first person using a conversational tone. This makes your copy a more direct communication from one individual to another. Using humor in a light, inoffensive way will also

-----

##### develop a relationship with your prospect. The humor can relate a story in a folksy way as in my “Pet Plane” ad in Chapter 29 or it can bring out the “humanness” of the person marketing the product or service as I’ve done in my ad for the Magic Stat thermostat in Chapter 28.
 Another approach is to use a picture of a human hand holding a small product. The hand adds size and perspective to what is being presented and also adds that human element.
 You can use attractive models. People like to relate to pretty women or handsome men even though they may not themselves be attractive. In a subtle sense, they want to belong to the group of people in the picture. Conversely, you don’t want to use a picture of yourself if you think some of your readers may respond negatively to it. Especially if you look like a bearded villain from some B-rated movie.
 In short, in your advertising you want to use as many positive human elements as you can without risking any negative vibrations from emotional reactions.
 And if you do your job right, your advertisement will have its own vibration—so much so that some people will be able to pick up that vibration and feel that they almost know you.

# 26. Storytelling

##### People love stories, and one of the really good ways to relate to your prospect is to tell a story. Just as a picture is worth a thousand words, a story can be invaluable and often creates an emotional relationship or bond that keeps your prospect riveted and listening. Stories create human interest. In childhood, stories read to us by our parents were the way we fantasized or even saw the world. In short, we’ve been primed for stories ever since we were very young.
