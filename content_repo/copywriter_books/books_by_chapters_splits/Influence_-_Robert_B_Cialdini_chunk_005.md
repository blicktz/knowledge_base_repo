## The Profiteers

#### It is odd that, despite their current widespread use and looming future importance, most of us know very little about our automatic behavior patterns. Perhaps that is so precisely because of the mechanistic, unthinking manner in which they occur. Whatever the reason, it is vital that we clearly recognize one of their properties. They make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work.
 To understand fully the nature of our vulnerability, let’s take another glance at the work of ethologists. It turns out that these animal behaviorists with their recorded cheep-cheeps and clumps of colored breast feathers are not the only ones who have discovered how to activate the behavior programs of various species. One group of organisms, termed mimics, copy the trigger features of other animals in an attempt to trick the animals into mistakenly playing the right behavior programs at the wrong times. The mimics then exploit this altogether inappropriate action for their own benefit.
 Take the deadly trick played by the killer females of one genus of firefly (Photuris) on the males of another firefly genus (Photinus). Understandably, the Photinus males scrupulously avoid contact with the bloodthirsty Photuris females. However, through centuries of natural selection, the Photuris female hunters have located a weakness in their prey —a special blinking courtship code by which members of the victims’ species tell one another they are ready to mate. By mimicking the flashing

#### mating signals of her prey, the murderess is able to feast on the bodies of males whose triggered courtship program causes them to fly mechanically into death’s, not love’s, embrace.
 In the struggle for survival, nearly every form of life has its mimics— right down to some of the most primitive pathogens. By adopting certain critical features of useful hormones or nutrients, these clever bacteria and viruses can gain entry into a healthy host cell. The result is that the healthy cell eagerly and naively sweeps into itself the causes of such diseases as rabies, mononucleosis, and the common cold.[6]
 It should come as no surprise, then, that there is a strong but sad parallel in human behavior. We, too, have profiteers who mimic trigger features for our own brand of automatic responding. Unlike the mostly instinctive response sequences of nonhumans, our automatic programs usually develop from psychological principles or stereotypes we have learned to accept. Although they vary in their force, some of the principles possess a remarkable ability to direct human action. We have been subjected to them from such an early point in our lives, and they have moved us about so pervasively since then, that you and I rarely perceive their power. In the eyes of others, though, each such principle is a detectable and ready lever, a lever of automatic influence. Take for instance the principle of social proof, which asserts that people are inclined to believe or do what they see those around them believing or doing. We act in accord with it whenever we check product reviews or star ratings before making an online purchase. But, once on the review site, we have to deal with our own brand of mimics —individuals who counterfeit genuine reviews and insert their phony ones. Fortunately, eBox 1.1 offers ways to spot the fakes.

### Here’s How to Spot Fake Online Reviews with 90 Percent Accuracy, according to Science

#### A new computer program identifies phony reviews with incredible accuracy.

When you buy products online, for either yourself or your business, reviews probably
weigh heavily in your decision-making. We check to see other buyers’ opinions on
Amazon, opt for the five-star option rather than the one with only four and a half stars, or
book the Airbnb with the most enthusiastic former guests.

Of course, we all also know these reviews can be bogus—either paid for by the seller or
maliciously placed by the competition. A team of Cornell University researchers decided
that building a computer program that could spot bogus recommendations sounded like a
useful thing to do.

So what are the tells that a “five-star” hotel room might end up being moldy and
cramped or that a highly rated toaster might die before you get through a single loaf?
According to the Cornell research, you should beware if a review:

lacks detail. It’s hard to describe what you haven’t actually experienced, which is
why fake reviews often offer general praise rather than digging into specifics.
“Truthful hotel reviews, for example, are more likely to use concrete words relating
to the hotel, like ‘bathroom,’ ‘check-in’ or ‘price.’ Deceivers write more about
things that set the scene, like ‘vacation,’ ‘business trip’ or ‘my husband.’”
includes more first-person pronouns. If you’re anxious about coming across as
sincere, apparently you talk about yourself more. That’s probably why words such as
_I and me appear more often in fake reviews._
has more verbs than nouns. Language analysis shows that the fakes tend to include
more verbs because their writers often substitute pleasant (or alarming) sounding
stories for actual insight. Genuine reviews are heavier on nouns.

Of course, these subtle tells alone probably won’t make you a master of spotting fakes,
but combined with other methods of checking a review’s trustworthiness, such as watching
out for various types of verified buyers and suspicious timestamps, you should be able to
do a lot better than random chance.

**Author’s note: Minding the mimics. Online review sites are in an ongoing battle with**
fake reviewers. We should join the fight. One set of comparisons shows why. From 2014 to
2018, customers’ favorable responses to online reviews went up in every category (for
example, those who read reviews before buying rose from 88 percent to 92 percent), except
one: those who trusted a business that had positive reviews dropped from 72 percent to 68
percent. It seems the mimics are undermining our confidence in the worth of the shortcut
information we seek.

#### There are some people who know very well where the levers of automatic influence lie and who employ them regularly and expertly to get what they want. They go from social encounter to social encounter, requesting others to comply with their wishes, and their frequency of success is dazzling. The secret to their effectiveness lies in the way they structure their requests, the way they arm themselves with one or another of

#### the levers of influence that exist in the social environment. To do so may take no more than one correctly chosen word that engages a strong psychological principle and launches one of our automatic behavior programs. Trust the human profiteers to learn quickly how to benefit from our tendency to respond mechanically according to these principles.
 Remember my friend the jewelry-store owner? Although she benefited by accident the first time, it didn’t take her long to begin exploiting the expensive = good stereotype regularly and intentionally. Now during the tourist season, she first tries to speed the sale of an item that has been difficult to move by substantially increasing its price. She claims that this is marvelously cost effective. When it works on the unsuspecting vacationers, as it frequently does, it generates an enormous profit. And, even when it is not initially successful, she can then mark the article “Reduced” and sell it to bargain hunters at its original price while still taking advantage of their expensive = good reaction to the inflated figure.[7]

## Jujitsu

#### A woman employing jujitsu, the Japanese martial art, uses her own strength only minimally against an opponent. Instead, she exploits the power inherent in such naturally present principles as gravity, leverage, momentum, and inertia. If she knows how and where to engage these principles, she can easily defeat a physically stronger rival. And so it is for the exploiters of the levers of automatic influence that exist naturally around us. The profiteers can commission the power of these principles for use against their targets while exerting little personal force. This last feature of the process gives the profiteers an enormous additional benefit—the ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation. Even the victims themselves tend to see their compliance as a result of the action of natural forces rather than the designs of the person who profits from that compliance.
 An example is in order. There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, which affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. If the second item is fairly different from the first, we tend to see it as being more different than it

#### actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we estimate the second object as being heavier than we would have estimated it if we had lifted it without first lifting the light one. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions. If we are watching our weight and at lunch we are trying to estimate the calorie count of a cheeseburger, we’ll judge it as being much higher (38% higher in one study) in calories if we first estimate the calories in a salad. In contrast to the salad, the cheeseburger now seems even more calorie rich. Relatedly, if we are talking to an attractive individual at a party and are joined by a comparatively less attractive one, the second will strike us as being less attractive than he or she actually is. Some researchers warn that the unrealistically attractive people portrayed in the popular media (actors, models) may cause us to be less satisfied with the looks of the genuinely available romantic possibilities around us. The researchers demonstrated that increasing exposure to the exaggerated sexual attractiveness of sensual models in the media lowers the sexual desirability of our current mates.[8]
 Another demonstration of perceptual contrast is one I have employed in my classrooms to introduce students to the principle. Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of water—one cold, one at room temperature, and one hot. After placing one hand in the cold water and the other in the hot water, the student is told to place both simultaneously in the room-temperature water. The look of amused bewilderment that immediately registers tells the story: even though both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that was in the cold water feels as if it is in hot water, while the one that was in the hot water feels as if it is in cold water. The point is that the same thing—in this instance, room-temperature water—can be made to seem very different depending on the nature of the event preceding it. What’s more, the perception of other things, such as college course grades, can be affected similarly. See, for example, in figure 1.3, a letter that came across my desk several years ago from a university student to her parents.

**Figure 1.3: Perceptual contrast and the college coed**

_Dear Mother and Dad:_

_Since I left for college I have been remiss in writing and I am sorry for my thoughtlessness_
_in not having written before. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please_
_sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay?_

_Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I_
_got when I jumped out the window of my dormitory when it caught on fire shortly after my_
_arrival here is pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can_
_see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day. Fortunately, the fire in_
_the dormitory, and my jump, was witnessed by a worker at the gas station near the dorm,_
_and he was the one who called the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also visited me_
_in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was_
_kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It’s really a basement room, but_
_it’s kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to_
_get married. We haven’t got the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to_
_show._

_Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to_
_being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and_
_devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our_
_marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection which prevents us from passing our_
_pre-marital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him._

_Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory_
_fire, I did not have a concussion or skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not_
_pregnant, I am not engaged, I am not infected, and there is no boyfriend. However, I am_
_getting a “D” in American History, and an F in Chemistry, and I want you to see those_
_marks in their proper perspective._

_Your loving daughter,_

#### Be assured the nice little lever of influence provided by the contrast principle does not go unexploited. The great advantage of the principle is not only that it works but also that it is virtually undetectable. Those who employ it can cash in on its influence without any appearance of having structured the situation in their favor.
 Retail clothiers offer a good example. Suppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store to buy a suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money? Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item first. Common sense might suggest the reverse. If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend much more on the purchase of a sweater, but the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle advises: sell the suit

-----

#### first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. The same principle applies to a man who wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with his new suit. Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supports the contrast-principle prediction.
 It is more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; to fail to do so not only loses the force of the contrast principle but also causes the principle to work against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one makes the expensive item seem even more costly—hardly a desirable consequence for sales organizations. So just as it is possible to make the same bucket of water appear to be hotter or colder depending on the temperature of previously presented buckets of water, it is possible to make the price of the same item seem higher or lower depending on the price of a previously presented item.
 Clever use of perceptual contrast is by no means confined to clothiers. I came across a technique that engaged the contrast principle while I was investigating, undercover, the compliance tactics of real-estate companies. To learn the ropes, I accompanied a salesman on a weekend of showing houses to prospective home buyers. The salesman—we can call him Phil— was to give me tips to help me through my break-in period. One thing I quickly noticed was that whenever Phil began showing a new set of customers potential buys, he would start with a couple of undesirable houses. I asked him about it, and he laughed. They were what he called “setup” properties. The company maintained an unappealing house or two on its lists at inflated prices. These houses were not intended to be sold to customers but only to be shown to them so that the genuine properties in the company’s inventory would benefit from the comparison. Not all the sales staff made use of the setup houses, but Phil did. He said he liked to watch his prospects’ “eyes light up” when he showed the places he really wanted to sell them after they had seen the unattractive ones. “The house I got them spotted for looks really great after they’ve first looked at a couple of dumps.”
 Automobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the price of a car has been negotiated before suggesting one option after another. In the wake of a many-thousand-dollar deal, a couple hundred extra dollars for a nicety such as an upgraded sound system seems almost trivial in comparison. The same will be true of the added expense of accessories,

-----

#### such as tinted windows, better tires, or special trim, that the dealer might suggest in sequence. The trick is to bring up the options independently of one another so that each small price will seem petty when compared to the already determined much larger price. As veteran car buyers can attest, many a budget-sized final-price figure balloons out of proportion from the addition of all those seemingly little options. While customers stand, signed contract in hand, wondering what happened and finding no one to blame but themselves, the car dealer stands smiling the knowing smile of the jujitsu master.
