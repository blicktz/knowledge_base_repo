## HAS A PROBLEM

#### StoryBrand Principle Two: Companies tend to
 sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.

### Now that you’ve piqued your potential customers’ curiosity about your
###### brand, how do you deepen their interest so that they are more likely to place an order? You borrow yet another play from the storyteller’s playbook; you start talking about the problems your customers are living with because they don’t have your product yet.
 Identifying our customers’ problems deepens their interest in the story we are inviting them into because when we identify their problem, we open the story gap even wider.
 In a story, the problem is the “hook,” and if we don’t identify our customers’ problems, the story we are inviting them into will fizzle fast. Until our hero has a problem, the story fails to gain traction, and as soon as the conflict in a story is resolved, audiences stop paying attention. The next time you watch a movie, pause the screen at any point and I promise you will be able to identify a problem the hero is dealing with. Even if you are watching a documentary, the same principle applies. Documentary filmmakers must identify a problem in each section because if they don’t, the documentary will fail.
 In fact, there’s a parlor trick I often play in my home when I’m making this point. Our carriage house doubles as a library and contains over a thousand books. When I talk about how every story is about problems being solved, I ask somebody to go to the shelf and pull out any book. When they do, I ask them to open the book to any page, then I ask them to set their

###### finger down on any paragraph. Once this is done I let them know what that paragraph is about. It’s about conflict. It’s about a problem. It’s about a hero who is up against trouble and is fighting their way out. And you know what? I’ve never been wrong. Why is nearly every sentence in every novel about conflict? Because a good writer knows that conflict is how you get people’s attention. This is also why every politician wants their constituents to believe the country is going to hell in a hand basket. If it weren’t, why would anybody need them? The same is true of the news. When is the last time you turned on the news to discover everything was going great? No news program will ever admit things are okay, because if they did, you’d go outside and fly a kite with your kids and they’d be out of a job.
 Certainly there are constant problems happening in the world, but are they nearly as bad as the media would have us believe? Not at all. As the novelist James Scott Bell says, “Readers want to fret.”[1]
 As careful as we must be to refrain from manipulating people with half- truths and exaggerations, those of us who build brands can learn a thing or two from professionals in the entertainment industry (and I’d include twenty-four-hour news outlets as producers of entertainment). Conflict gets people’s attention.
 If Jason Bourne were to receive a call thirty minutes into Bourne Identity and on the other end of the call a gentle voice explained who Jason really was, why he’d suffered amnesia, and that the government was sorry for the offense and offering a pension along with a house on the coast, the moviegoing audience would lose interest because the reason to pay attention would be gone. If there is no conflict in the story, there is no story gap, and without a story gap, there is no reason to pay attention.
 It bears repeating: the more we talk about the problems our customers experience, the more curiosity they will have about our brand.
 So how do we put this idea to work in our messaging? It’s simple. Figure out what problem your products solve. Are you a clothing boutique? Talk about how hard it is to find something to wear that goes with anything. Talk about how important it is to stand out in the office. Talk about how frustrating it is to find clothes that are well-made. When you talk about a problem, people become interested in finding a solution, which means you sell more of your products.
 Last year I spent time with a powerful government agency to help them clarify messaging on foreign policy. I can’t name the agency because of a

###### nondisclosure agreement, but I can share the messaging points as they were always intended to be public facing from the beginning. In fact, it is hoped the talking points will be repeated by many, so I’m happy to do my part. As we spent the day together, filling whiteboards and keynote decks with talking point after talking point, I realized the nature of the threat against America, and I found the significant “problems” we were up against to be concerning, to say the least. The threat the agency wanted the public to understand was this: A global force is taking shape to empower authoritarian regimes. As I sat there looking at the whiteboard, I realized the threat my family faced, especially my young daughter, was significant. I confess that until it had been spelled out so clearly, I’d not paid much attention. With the help of the folks in that room, I realized there are significant forces threatening our democracy, our economy, and our culture. In short, the very idea of democracy is a threat to the personal power of some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders. Specifically, if citizens under authoritarian regimes witness the peaceful transfer of power in America, along with economic and cultural freedom and flourishing, their people will want it too, which threatens the stranglehold the autocratic leader must maintain over their own people. Because of this, democracies must be diminished or destroyed on the world stage. Trillions of dollars, books filled with lies, rooms filled with hackers, and ships and planes loaded with weapons are all being utilized against America and all other successful democracies. Our job in that room was to find the right words to adequately warn a distracted American public, and it was certainly working on me.

##### HOW TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS’ PROBLEMS

###### In the second module of the StoryBrand framework, we’re going to look at three elements of conflict that will increase customer interest, ratchet up engagement, and give a greater depth of meaning to the story our brand is inviting customers into.
 First, though, let’s start with the root of where all this conflict is coming from. I’m talking about one of the most dynamic, interesting characters in any story: the villain.

-----

###### The Villain Gives the Problem a Root Cause and a Focus
 The villain is the number one device storytellers use to give conflict a clear point of focus.
 Screenwriters and novelists know the stronger, more evil, more dastardly the villain, the more sympathy we will have for the hero and the more the audience will want them to defeat their foe and return to their previous state of stability.
 How much less sympathetic would Batman be if it weren’t for the diabolical Joker? Would we root as strongly for Luke Skywalker if it weren’t for the haunting presence of Darth Vader? Doesn’t Harry Potter become infinitely more heroic under the threat of Voldemort? What about superman without the threat of Kryptonite? (Let’s be honest, Lex Luthor isn’t that interesting of a bad guy.)
 Here’s why this matters in the building of your brand: If we want our customers’ ears to perk up when we talk about our products and services, we should position these as weapons they can use to defeat a villain. The more dastardly the villains, the more urgent their need for our products.
 If we’re selling time-management software, for instance, we might talk about time thieves, those people who want to steal our time by locking us in meetings in which nothing gets done, or coworkers who stand around the coffee machine waiting for the next victim they can capture for a long conversation about their latest Netflix find. That’s a good villain. Now that we’ve identified the villain, we can talk about the conflict they stir up, that conflict being distractions. Our time-management software could then be offered as a weapon that stops time thieves in their tracks. After all, we have to get back to our “blocked for deep work” session. Time thieves could be personified as snipers in the woods, taking shots at us when we least expect it. When you use our new time-management system, however, you learn to say no to unimportant meetings and get-togethers, which keeps you out of the woods in the first place. Sounds kind of dramatic, right? Yet distractions are what’s diluting our customers’ potential, wrecking their families, stealing their sanity, and costing them enormous amounts of time and money. Time thieves, then, are a great personification of the villains and distractions our product helps people avoid. Don’t be afraid of a little drama in your messaging, especially if that drama is true.
 The point is, real threats exist in the world. If your customer wasn’t experiencing some sort of pain or frustration as it relates to your brand, they

###### wouldn’t be seeking you out anyway. Take your customers’ frustrations seriously. Whether we are talking about artery-blocking cholesterol, money- eating inflation, or sleep-disrupting anxiety, we are naive to assume our customers’ quality of life isn’t under threat. And if our product can protect our customers, we can and should name the villains out to get them.
 Now that I’ve pointed out the technique of identifying villains in our customers’ challenges, you’ll see the messaging methodology being used in television commercials all the time. Who knew that those dust bunnies collecting along the baseboards of our houses move around in animated, criminal gangs wearing leather jackets, coordinating their devilish efforts to ruin our floors? Ah, that is, until they meet their match: the new mop from ACME Mop Company.
 Advertisers personify the villains their customers face in order to capture their customers’ imaginations and give their frustrations a focal point. Fuzzy hairballs with squeaky voices living in your drains, making nests, and clogging up the pipes? Yellow globs of living, breathing, talking plaque vacationing between your teeth? These are all personified versions of conflict. They’re all villains.
 Here are four characteristics that make for a good villain on your StoryBrand BrandScript:

 1. The villain should be a root source. High taxes, for example, are
 not an example of a villain; they are what a villain makes us experience. Rather, the broken-down government is a good example of a villain that is charging us all that tax money to do precisely nothing but use it to collect salaries and stir up culture wars so they can get re-elected and continue their important work of doing nothing. 2. The villain should be relatable. When people hear us talk about
 the villain, they should immediately recognize it as something they disdain. 3. The villain should be singular. One villain is enough. A story with
 too many villains falls apart for lack of clarity. 4. The villain should be real. Never go down the path of being a fear monger. There are plenty of actual villains out there to fight. Let’s go after them on behalf of our customers.

-----

###### 5. Another thing: the villain doesn’t have to be serious. If you’re
 creating the messaging for the upcoming Boston Red Sox versus New York Yankees series, personifying your opponent as the villain is just smart marketing. Turning the opposition into a villain will fill the stands at either stadium and increase the urgency the audience feels while rooting for their team.

 Is there a villain in your customers’ story? Of course there is. What is the chief source of conflict that your products and services defeat? Talk about this villain. The more you do, the more people will want a tool to help them escape the villain’s deadly grasp.
 Later, when you’re creating your BrandScript, I’ll ask you to brainstorm what kind of villain your customer faces. For now, though, let’s look closely at the kinds of conflict this villain causes. Once we understand the three levels of problems our customers encounter, we’ll have a better idea of how to talk about their problems in such a way that they engage.

 The Three Levels of Conflict
 A villain is the antagonist because they cause the hero serious problems. That’s obvious. But what’s less obvious is that in a story, there are three levels of problems that work together to increase the urgency and draw the moviegoing audience further and further in.
 The three levels of problems heroes (and customers) face are

 external problems, internal problems, and philosophical problems

 In a story, a villain initiates an external problem that causes the character to experience an internal frustration that is, quite simply, philosophically wrong. These are also the three levels of problems a customer hopes to solve when they buy a product.
 I know that sounds complicated, but let’s take a closer look at each level of conflict so we know exactly how to talk about each frustration so that it is as intriguing as it can be.

-----

###### EXTERNAL PROBLEMS In literature, a villain’s job is to wreak havoc on the hero, to place barriers between them and the stability they desire. But ill intentions aren’t enough. Something, that is, some thing (or things) must represent this barrier. Enter the external problem.
 In stories, the external problem is often a physical, tangible problem the hero must overcome in order to save the day. The problem might manifest itself as a ticking time bomb or a runaway bus, or maybe even a combination of the two: a bomb on a bus that will go off if Keanu Reeves doesn’t keep the speed above fifty miles per hour!
 The external problem works like a football set between the hero and the villain, and each is trying to gain control of it so they can win the game.
 For Billy Beane in the movie Moneyball, the external problem is the need to win baseball games. For Matthew Broderick in the movie WarGames, it’s a piece of rogue software that has taken over the American government’s computer system and is waging a deadly war against the Soviets.
 But what does the existence of an external problem in a story have to do with branding? Well, most of us are in the business of solving external problems. We provide insurance or clothes or soccer balls. If we own a restaurant, the external problem we solve is hunger. The external problem a plumber fixes might be a leaky pipe, just like a pest-control guy might solve the external problem of termites in the attic.
 Brainstorming what external problems you solve will be the easiest part of creating your StoryBrand BrandScript. The external problem is usually obvious. But you’d be wrong to think the reason people call you, walk through your door, or visit your website is limited to the resolution of an external problem. Something else is going on.

 INTERNAL PROBLEMS By limiting our marketing messages to external problems, we neglect a principle that is costing us thousands and potentially millions of dollars. That principle is this: companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems.
 The purpose of an external problem in a story is to manifest an internal problem. If I wrote a movie about a guy who simply needed to disarm a
