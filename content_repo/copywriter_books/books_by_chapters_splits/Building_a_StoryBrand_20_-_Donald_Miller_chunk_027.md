## HOW TO EXECUTE A STORYBRAND
 MESSAGING AND MARKETING
 CAMPAIGN

#### Transform your marketing by implementing your clear message in a marketing system that
 works

### So where do we go from here? Now that we have a StoryBrand
###### BrandScript, how can we use these powerful sound bites so they have the greatest possible impact on our bottom line?
 The StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign is a proven, simple marketing system that works. This is basically a communication campaign you roll out so that customers hear about your brand, begin to trust that you can solve their problems, and then place orders.
 We have certified nearly a thousand StoryBrand coaches in the last ten years, each of whom understands the framework and is practiced in putting your sound bites in the right places within an effective messaging and marketing campaign. In the hundreds of meetings we’ve had with our coaches, they’ve shared with us what works and what doesn’t. This chapter is a summation of their most effective practices. You can either create your messaging and marketing campaign on your own or hire a coach to create some or all of your campaign from our Coach directory at MarketingMadeSimple.com. What follows is a step-by-step execution plan.

###### Again, much of your rough draft can be done using the StoryBrand Brain at StoryBrand.AI, but refining your work, designing your messaging and marketing campaign, and hooking it up to a CRM can all be done either by yourself or by one of our coaches.

##### YOUR STEP-BY-STEP PLAN

###### Every step you take should result in greater customer engagement and more sales. You don’t have to create your entire messaging and marketing campaign all at once. That said, the more you create, the more customers will encounter and understand your offer.
 Also, once you’re done creating your StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign, create another one. My business has a dozen or more messaging and marketing campaigns operating, and each of them brings in leads that help us sell various products, from certifications to workshops to masterminds and private strategy sessions. Every morning I open my dashboard to see how many leads came in for each product, and I can follow those leads down a pipeline to see how many are converting to sales. In other words, I’m able to predict revenue long before a customer purchases our products, which is helpful knowledge to have when trying to grow a small business. I want the same for you.
 If you are going to create your messaging and marketing campaigns plan yourself, what follows can serve as your complete roadmap. If you have a marketing director on your team, simply hand them this book and give them the task of completing the BrandScript assignment (the previous chapters in this book) and the StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign l that makes up this final chapter.
 The reason a StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign works so well is because it guides customers through the three stages of relationships: curiosity, enlightenment, and commitment.
 When a potential customer hears your elevator pitch, they get curious. The reason they get curious is because they suspect you have a product or service that can help them. It’s only when a customer gets curious that they want to know more, so the first job of a good messaging and marketing campaign is to make them curious. After a customer gets curious, they

-----

###### begin to read a little more about your product to “enlighten” themselves about whether your product is right for them. In this enlightenment stage, depending on how expensive or complicated the product adoption might be, a customer may look around for reviews, read about your product, ask their friends if they’ve used the product, or search YouTube for videos about your product. If you have good “enlightenment” material, customers will then move on to the third phase of their relationship with you, and that is the “commitment” phase in which they become willing to place an order.
 Our goal as marketers is to create terrific curiosity collateral—that is, sound bites on landing pages and digital ads and webinars and the like that will pique a potential customer’s curiosity. After we create our curiosity collateral, we need to create enlightenment collateral, which may include downloadable PDFs, webinars, breakout session presentations, automated email sequences, YouTube videos, and other long-form marketing collateral. Once we’ve created our enlightenment collateral, we need to make sure our calls to action are clear, including sales emails, countdown timers, special offers, and so on.
 The job of a messaging and marketing campaign is to pique our customers’ curiosity; earn their trust with consistent, valuable information; and then ask for the commitment by challenging them to make a purchase. If you follow the step-by-step instructions in this chapter, your StoryBrand Messaging and Marketing Campaign will do the job perfectly.
 With that, let’s get started with the first step.

##### STEP ONE: GENERATE A STORYBRAND BRANDSCRIPT

###### It goes without saying that your StoryBrand BrandScript is the foundation of your messaging and marketing campaign. Until you get the words right, your marketing will fail. To get the best results, create a BrandScript for every major marketing initiative. You can do this by reading this book, listening to the audiobook, or, if you want to have a little fun, listen to StoryBrand Radio Theater Presents: Pete and Joe Save Their Mother’s Company on Audible or Youtube.com/@storybrand. The radio theater version of Building a StoryBrand is a fictional story that teaches the framework, followed by me explaining a step-by-step process you can go

###### through to create a BrandScript. The radio theater version of Building a StoryBrand was designed to be a quick and effective way for you (or your team) to understand and create a BrandScript.
 Once you’ve created your BrandScript, move on to step two.

##### STEP TWO: CREATE A ONE-LINER

###### Most people turn customers off the second they start talking about their business. When somebody asks what we do and we answer with something like, “Well, it’s complicated” or “You see, fifty years ago my grandfather started our company . . .” we’ve lost the customer’s interest immediately. Instead of rambling, though, imagine memorizing a single statement you could recite to intrigue and even engage a potential customer. Imagine this statement being so powerful it causes people to ask for your business card or, better, inquire about how they could place an order.
 A one-liner is a better way to answer the question, “What do you do?” It’s more than a slogan or tagline; it’s a single statement that helps people realize why they need your products or services.
 To understand how it works, let’s take another page out of the storyteller’s playbook. When screenwriters pitch their screenplays to studio executives, the difference between being accepted or rejected often comes down to what’s called a logline.
 A logline is simply a movie’s one-sentence description. A strong logline will help the screenwriter sell the screenplay and will continue to be used all the way through a movie’s opening weekend so that promoters can sell it to moviegoing audiences. If you’ve ever scrolled through a movie app on your phone or scrolled through Netflix looking for something to watch, chances are you’ve read a logline. Here are a few examples:

 “A precocious private high school student whose life revolves around his school competes with its most famous and successful alumnus for the affection of a first-grade teacher.”
 —Rushmore

-----

###### “Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate ‘Captain’ Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor’s daughter, from Jack’s former pirate allies, who are now undead.”
 —Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

 “A science-fiction fantasy about a naive but ambitious farm boy from a backwater desert who discovers powers he never knew he had when he teams up with a feisty princess, a mercenary space pilot, and an old wizard warrior to lead a ragtag rebellion against the sinister forces of the evil Galactic Empire.”
 —Star Wars: A New Hope

 “An incompetent, immature, and dimwitted heir to an auto-parts factory must save the business to keep it out of the hands of his new con-artist relatives.”
 —Tommy Boy

 What makes these loglines complete and effective? Two things: clarity and promise. A logline is designed to summarize the story in a way that a reader understands the plot (and thus the entertainment value of the story) and desires to know more. In other words, the reader of the logline clearly understands what the movie is about and believes the promise that it will provide entertainment or inspiration.
 The one-liner you will create for your company will work like a logline for a movie: it will clearly communicate your offer and promise a solution to your customer’s problem. And, not unlike a logline, your one-liner will make people want to buy your product. Not only this, but your one-liner can be used to convert your entire team into a sales force. Whether it’s your customer service reps, your assembly-line team, or your company’s president, every member of your team should know your one-liner so that if anybody asks them about the business, they can describe it in such a way that customers clearly understand why they need your products and services.
 What would life look like if everybody you worked with were converted into a salesforce spreading the word about your products and services? Creating a one-liner and having everybody repeat it over and over is a great way to spread word about the value of your products and services.

-----

###### To craft a compelling one-liner, we’ll employ a sound bite that comes from a distilled version of the StoryBrand framework. While a StoryBrand BrandScript has seven parts, a one-liner has three parts: the problem, the product as solution, and the result.
 Your one-liner doesn’t have to be a single sentence, nor does it need to be four sentences. Think of it more as a statement. You simply want to communicate these four ideas: Who is your customer? What is their problem? What is your plan to help them? What will their life look like after you do?
 Let’s take a deeper look at each of the three necessary components: As I said earlier in the book, stories become interesting when the hero wants something and encounters conflict in their journey to get what they want, so if we want to get people interested in our brand, we should open our remarks by identifying our customer’s conflict. For example, which of these statements makes the product sound more interesting?

 Option one: Our new toothpaste is gentle on teeth and gums. Option two: Many people have sensitive teeth and gums and experience
 pain when brushing their teeth. Our new toothpaste is gentle on teeth and gums.

 The second option starts with the problem and then positions the product as the solution to the problem. Most people, and certainly most people who have this problem, would find the second sound bite much more intriguing. The point: the problem is the hook.
 Starting your one-liner with the problem that is bothering your customer will trigger the mental response we are looking for. When we start with the problem, the customer thinks to themselves: Yeah, I do struggle with that. Tell me more.

**HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS DIFFERENT BRANDS CAN TALK**
**ABOUT:**
###### If you’re a busy mom and can’t find time to work out, then . . . If your dog barks loudly whenever somebody knocks on the door,
 then . . . If you want the benefits of an electric vehicle but worry about range,
 then . . .

-----

###### After you state the problem your customers experience, your customers will lean in. Next, we want to position our product, service, or idea as the solution to the problem, thus offering a resolution to the story loop we just opened by talking about the problem.
 Now that we’ve clearly stated the problem, let’s position our product as the solution. This should be a very, very simple addition to the one-liner. Simply state: “That’s why we created X” and stop talking. When creating a one-liner, clients will often ramble on and on about their product, about its features and benefits and so on. This is a mistake. When you simply state the name or short description of the product, you resolve the open story loop and satisfy the customer’s curiosity, but when you ramble on and on, you actually dilute the value of your product. For example, compare: “Many people find it difficult to fall asleep at night because they are stressed. Our meditation is based on science and over twenty years of research, relieving the central nervous system by triggering natural calming agents that are released through breath work, mental focus and . . .” with this statement: “Many people find it difficult to fall asleep at night because they are stressed. Our simple meditation helps you fall asleep fast.”
 Certainly the first statement is interesting, but it also wanders into the weeds. That’s fine if your customer is ready to be enlightened, but enlightening your customer isn’t the job of the one-liner. The one-liner’s purpose is to pique curiosity so that people will want to either buy your product or seek enlightenment about why they should buy it. Your one-liner will be more effective if you keep the “product as solution” portion as short as possible.
 The third and final sound bite you want to include in your one-liner is the result your customer will experience if they buy your product. Use this portion of your one-liner to cast a vision for your customer’s future, thus giving them a picture of the life they could have once their problem is resolved. Human beings move toward a positive vision of their future, but only if that vision is described clearly. For example: “More and more people want to know where their beef comes from because industrialized ranching practices can leave toxins in our food, often triggering food allergies. Regenerative ranching practices ensure animals are toxin-free, which means you don’t struggle with food allergies and feel much better over time.”

###### Keep Editing Your One-Liner Until It Works
 Consider your first one-liner a rough draft. Write it down and test it repeatedly. Run it by your friends, spouse, potential customers, even strangers standing in line at Starbucks. Do people look interested? Do they completely understand what you offer? If so, you’re on the right track. When they start asking for your business card or for more information, you’ve really dialed it in.

##### STEP THREE: WIREFRAME AN EFFECTIVE LANDING PAGE

###### As I mentioned in the last chapter, your website or landing page should be the best and clearest version of your sales pitch. To achieve that, use each section of your landing page to invite customers further and further into a story that piques their curiosity, enlightens them, and challenges them to make a commitment.
 Of the tens of thousands of websites our StoryBrand certified coaches have created for their clients, these are the sections of a website or landing page that have proven to be the most effective.
 If you have an e-commerce site selling dozens or hundreds of products, use these sections to explain your overall brand. You can then create a landing page like this for each of your individual products or services.

 THE HEADER
 The header is the part of your website that sits “above the fold,” meaning at the top of the page. The job of the header is to explain your offer so clearly and in such simple language that your customer wants to know more. If you’ve used the right text, your customer will want to keep scrolling to “enlighten themselves” about all that you offer.
 A good header will include a large-text offer, a transitional call to action, a direct call to action, and, if you like, a value stack (a few additional bullet points that build on your initial offer). Here is an example:

-----

###### THE STAKES
 The stakes section of your website is where you put the negative consequences of not doing business with you. We like this section near the top because, as you remember, the problem is the hook. Your stakes section can be developed as a paragraph, images, bullet points, or even a video. Here is a simple example:

 THE VALUE PROPOSITION

-----

###### Since you went negative at the top, let’s quickly swing back to positive. Humans love it when a story swings back and forth between happy and hard moments, so employ that technique here. In this section, you’ll use a paragraph or some bullet points or even a testimonial to reiterate the value you can offer a customer. In a way, this section will be a wordier version of the header, meaning it’s a slightly more elaborated version of your offer. Here’s an example:

 GUIDE
 Now that you’ve invited customers into a story, introduce yourself. After all, at this point, you’ve likely earned the right to be heard. In this section, you want to position yourself or your brand as the guide the hero needs in order to solve their problem and win the day. Remember, in this section you want to communicate empathy and demonstrate competency. Here is an example:

-----

###### THE PLAN
 At this point in looking at your landing page, many customers will want to place an order, but they aren’t going to. The reason? Cognitive dissonance. Something still feels confusing to them. Mostly, they wonder how the process is going to work or exactly how they will make this change in their lives. Rather than sending them away to “think about it,” let’s give them a three-step plan. Here is an example:
