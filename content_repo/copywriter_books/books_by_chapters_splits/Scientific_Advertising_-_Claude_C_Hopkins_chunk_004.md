What folly it is to cry a name in a line like that, plus a few brief generalities. A car
may be a lifetime investment. It involves an important expenditure. A man interested
enough to buy a car will read a volume about it if the volume is interesting.

So with everything. You may be simply trying to change a woman from one
breakfast food to another, one tooth paste, or one soap. She is wedded to what she is
using. Perhaps she has used it for years.

You have a hard proposition. If you do not believe it, go to her in person and try
to make the change. Not to merely buy a first package to please you, but to adopt your
brand. A man who once does that at a woman’s door won’t argue for brief
advertisements. He will never again say, “A sentence will do,” or a name claim or a boast.

Nor will the man who traces his results. Note that brief ads are never keyed. Note
that every traced ad tells a complete story, though it takes columns to tell. Never be

-----

guided in any way by ads which are untraced. Never do anything because some
uninformed advertiser considers that something right. Never be led in new paths by the
blind. Apply to your advertising ordinary common sense. Take the opinion of nobody,
whom know nothing about his returns.

 Art In Advertising

Pictures in advertising are very expensive. Not in cost of good art work alone, but
in the cost of space. From one-third to one-half of an advertising campaign is often
staked on the power of the pictures. Anything expensive must be effective, else it
involves much waste. So art in advertising is a study of paramount importance.

Pictures should not be used merely because they are interesting. Or to attract
attention. Or to decorate an ad. We have covered these points elsewhere. Ads are not
written to interest, please or amuse. You are not writing to please the hoi-polloi. You are
writing on a serious subject — the subject of money spending. And you address a
restricted minority.

Use pictures only to attract those who may profit you. Use them only when they
form a better selling argument than the same amount of space set in type.

Mail order advertisers, as we have said, have pictures down to a science. Some
use large pictures, some small, some omit pictures entirely. A noticeable fact is that none
of them uses expensive art work. Be sure that all these things are done for reasons made
apparent by results. Any other advertiser should apply the same principles. Or, if none
exist to apply to his line, he should work out his own by tests. It is certainly unwise to
spend large sums on a dubious adventure.

Pictures in many lines form a major factor. Omitting the lines where the article
itself should be pictured. In some lines, like Arrow Collars and most in clothing
advertising, pictures have proved most convincing. Not only in picturing the collar or the
clothes, but in picturing men whom others envy, in surroundings which others covet.
The pictures subtly suggest that these articles of apparel will aid men to those desired
positions.

So with correspondence schools. Theirs is traced advertising. Picturing men in
high positions of taking upward steps forms a very convincing argument.

So with beauty articles. Picturing beautiful women, admired and attractive, is a
supreme inducement. But there is a great advantage in including a fascinated man.
Women desire beauty largely because of men. Then show them using their beauty, as
women do use it, to gain maximum effect.

-----

Advertising pictures should not be eccentric. Don’t treat your subject lightly.
Don’t lessen respect for your self or your article by any attempt at frivolity. People do
not patronize a clown. There are two things about which men should not joke. One is
business, one is home. An eccentric picture may do you serious damage. One may gain
attention by wearing a fool’s cap. But he would ruin his selling prospects.

Then a picture which is eccentric or unique takes attention from your subject.
You cannot afford to do that. Your main appeal lies in headline. Over-shadow that and
you kill it. Don’t, to gain general and useless attention, sacrifice the attention that you
want.

Don’t be like a salesman who wears conspicuous clothes. The small percentage
he appeals to are not usually good buyers. The great majority of the sane and thrifty
heartily despise him. Be normal in everything you do when you are seeking confidence
and conviction. Generalities cannot be applied to art. There are seeming exceptions to
most statements. Each line must be studied by itself.

But the picture must help sell the goods. It should help more than anything else
could do in like space, else use that something else.

Many pictures tell a story better than type can do. In advertising of Puffed Grains
the picture of the grains were found to be most effective. They awake curiosity. No
figure drawing in that case compare in results with these grains.

Other pictures form a total loss. We have cited cases of that kind. The only way
to know, as is with most other questions, is by compared results. There are disputed
questions in art work which we will cite without expressing opinions. They seem to be
answered both ways, according to the line which is advertised.

Does it pay better to use fine art work or ordinary? Some advertisers pay up to
$2,000 per drawing. They figure that the space is expensive. The art cost is small in
comparison. So they consider the best worth its cost. Others argue that few people have
art education. They bring out their ideas, and bring them out well, at a fraction of the
cost. Mail order advertisers are generally in this class. The question is one of small
moment. Certainly good art pays as well as mediocre. And the cost of preparing ads is
very small compared with the cost of insertion.

Should every ad have a new picture? Or may a picture be repeated? Both
viewpoints have many supporters. The probability is that repetition is an economy. We are
after new customers always. It is not probable that they remember a picture we have used
before. If they do, repetition does not detract.

-----

Do color pictures pay better than black and white? Not generally, according to
the evidence we have gathered to date. Yet there are exceptions. Certain food dishes look
far better in colors. Tests on lines like oranges, desserts, etc. show that color pays. Color
comes close to placing the products in actual exhibition.

But color used to amuse or to gain attention is like anything else that we use for
that purpose. It may attract many times as many people, yet not secure a hearing from as
many whom we want. The general rule applies. Do nothing to merely interest, amuse, or
attract. That is not your province. Do only that which wins the people you are after in
the cheapest possible way. But these are minor questions. They are mere economies, not
largely affecting the results of a campaign.

Some things you do may cut all your results in two. Other things can be done
which multiply those results. Minor costs are insignificant when compared with basic
principles. One man may do business in a shed, another in a palace. That is immaterial.
The great question is, one’s power to get the maximum results.

#### Chapter 10

 Things Too Costly

Many things are possible in advertising which are too costly to attempt. That is
another reason why every project and method should be weighed and determined by a
known scale of cost and result.

Changing peoples habits is very expensive. A project which involves that must be
seriously considered. To sell shaving soap to the peasants of Russia one would first need
to change their beard wearing habits. The cost would be excessive. Yet countless
advertisers try to do things almost as impossible. Just because questions are not ably
considered, and results are traced but unknown.

For instance, the advertiser of a dentifrice may spend much space and money to
educate people to brush their teeth. Tests which we know of have indicated that the cost
of such converts may run from $20 to $25 each. Not only because of the difficulty, but
because much of the advertising goes to people already converted.

Such a cost, of course, is unthinkable. One might not in a lifetime get it back in
sales. The maker who learned these facts by tests make no attempt to educate people to
the tooth brush habit. What cannot be done on a large scale profitably can not be done
on a small scale. So not one line in any ad is devoted to this object. This maker, who is
constantly guided in everything by keying every ad, has made remarkable success.

Another dentifrice maker spends much money to make converts to the tooth
brush. The object is commendable, but altruistic. The new business he creates is shared
by his rivals. He is wondering why his sales increase is in no way commensurate with his
expenditure.

An advertiser at one time spent much money to educate people to the use of
oatmeal. The results were too small to discover. All people know of oatmeal. As a food
for children it has age-old fame. Doctors have advised it for many generations. People
who don’t serve oatmeal are therefore difficult to start. Perhaps their objections are
insurmountable. Anyway, the cost proved to be beyond all possible return.

There are many advertisers who know facts like these and concede them. They
would not think of devoting a whole campaign to any such impossible object. Yet they
devote a share of their space to that object. That is only the same folly on a smaller scale.
It is not good business.

-----

No one orange grower or raisin grower could attempt to increase the
consumption of those fruits. The cost might be a thousand times his share of the returns.
But thousands of growers combined have done it on those and many other lines. There
lies one of the great possibilities of advertising development. The general consumption
of scores of foods can be profitably increased. But it must be done on wide co-operation.

No advertiser could afford to educate people on vitamins or germicides. Such
things are done by authorities, through countless columns of unpaid-for space. But great
successes have been made by going to people already educated and satisfying their
created wants.

It is a very shrewd thing to watch the development of a popular trend, the
creation of new desires. Then at the right time offer to satisfy those desires. That was
done on yeasts, for instance, and on numerous antiseptics. It can every year be done on
new things which some popular fashion or widespread influence is brought into vogue.
But it is a very different thing to create that fashion, taste or influence for all in your field
to share.

There are some things we know of which might possibly be sold to half the
homes in the country. A Dakin-fluid germicide, for instance. But the consumption would
be very small. A small bottle might last for years. Customers might cost $1.50 each. And
the revenue per customer might not in ten years repay the cost of getting. Mail order
sales on single articles, however popular, rarely cost less that $42.50 each. It is reasonable
to suppose that sales made through dealers on like articles will cost approximately as
much. Those facts must be considered on any one-sale article. Possibly one user will win
others. But traced returns as in mail order advertising would prohibit much advertising
which is now being done.

Costly mistakes are made by blindly following some ill-conceived idea. An article,
for instance, may have many uses, one of which is to prevent disease. Prevention is not a
popular subject, however much it should be. People will do much to cure trouble, but
people in general will do little to prevent it. This has been proved by many
disappointments.

One may spend much money in arguing prevention when the same money spent
on another claim would bring many times the sales. A heading which asserts one claim
may bring ten times the results of a heading which asserted another. An advertiser may
go far astray unless he finds out.

A toothpaste may tend to prevent decay. It may also beautify teeth. Tests will
probably find that the latter appeal is many times as strong as the former. The most
successful tooth paste advertiser never features tooth troubles in his headlines. Tests

-----

have proved them unappealing. Other advertisers in this line center on those troubles.
That is often because results are not known and compared.

A soap may tend to cure eczema. It may at the same time improve complexion.
The eczema claim may appeal to one in a hundred while the beauty claims would appeal
to nearly all. To even mention the eczema claims might destroy the beauty claims.

A man has a relief for asthma. It has done so much for him he considers it a great
advertising possibility. We have no statistics on this subject. We do not know the
percentage of people who suffer from asthma. A canvass might show it to be one in a
hundred. If so, he would need to cover a hundred useless readers to reach one he wants.
His cost of result might be twenty times as high as on another article which appeals to
one in five. That excessive cost would probably mean disaster. For reasons like these
every new advertiser should seek for wise advice. No one with the interests of
advertising at heart will advise any dubious venture.

Some claims not popular enough to feature in the main are still popular enough
to consider. They influence a certain number of people — say one-fourth of your
possible customers. Such claims may be featured to advantage in a certain percentage of
headlines. It should probably be included in every advertisement. But those are not
things to guess at. They should be decided by actual knowledge, usually by traced returns.

This chapter, like every chapter, points out a very important reason for knowing
your results. Scientific advertising is impossible without that. So is safe advertising. So is
maximum profit.

Groping in the dark in this field has probably cost enough money to pay the
national debt. That is what has filled the advertising graveyards. That is what has
discouraged thousands who could profit in this field. And the dawn of knowledge is
what is bringing a new day in the advertising world.

 Information

An ad-writer, to have a chance at success, must gain full information on his
subject. The library of an ad agency should have books on every line that calls for
research. A painstaking advertising man will often read for weeks on some problem
which comes up. Perhaps in many volumes he will find few facts to use. But some one
fact may be the keystone of success.

This writer has just completed an enormous amount of reading, medical and
otherwise, on coffee. This is to advertise a coffee without caffeine. One scientific article
out of a thousand perused gave the keynote for that campaign. It was the fact that
caffeine stimulation comes two hours after drinking. So the immediate bracing effects
which people seek from coffee do not come from the caffeine. Removing caffeine does
not remove the kick. It does not modify coffees delights, for caffeine is tasteless and
odorless.

Caffeineless coffee has been advertised for years. People regarded it like nearbeer. Only through weeks of reading did we find a way to put it in another light. To
advertise a tooth paste this writer has also read many volumes of scientific matter dry as
dust. But in the middle of one volume he found the idea which has helped make millions
for that tooth paste maker. And has made this campaign one of the sensations of
advertising.

Genius is the art of taking pains. The advertising man who spares the midnight
oil will never get very far. Before advertising a food product, 130 men were employed for
weeks to interview all classes of consumers. On another line, letters were sent to 12,000
physicians. Questionnaires are often mailed to tens of thousands of men and women to
get the viewpoint of consumers. A $25,000-a-year man, before advertising outfits for
acetylene gas, spent weeks in going from farm to farm. Another man did that on a
tractor. Before advertising a shaving cream, one thousand men were asked to state what
they most desired in a shaving soap.

Called on to advertise pork and beans, a canvass was made of some thousand of
homes. There-to-fore all pork and bean advertising has been based on “Buy my brand.”
That canvass showed that only 4 percent of the people used any canned pork and beans.
Ninety-six percent baked their beans at home. The problem was not to sell a particular
brand. Any such attempt appealed to only four percent. The right appeal was to win the
people away from home-baked beans. The advertising, which without knowledge must
have failed, proved a great success.

A canvas made, not only of homes, but of dealers. Competition is measured up.
Every advertiser of a similar product is written for his literature and claims. Thus we start
with exact information on all that our rivals are doing. Clipping bureaus are patronized,
so that everything printed on our subject comes to the man who writes ads.

Every comment that comes from consumers or dealers goes to this man’s desk.
