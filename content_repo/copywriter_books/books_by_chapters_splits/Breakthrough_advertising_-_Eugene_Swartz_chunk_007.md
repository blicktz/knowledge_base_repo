For example, take any Volkswagen ad. Count the number of
nouns per sentence, and compare it to the number of adjectives
See how the ad kids itself—never takes itself too seriously Notice how it makes its point quietly, and them stops. Even how the
extremely short, extremely simple- sentence structure adds to the
reeling of sincerity.

Here is a complete Volkswagen ad. which features one superiority of the car over competitive models. Could,,ou have told
the storv as well, ex-en if you used ten times as many words?

_You never run out of air_
You also won't have am worries about draining or
Hushing the radiator in spring. Then- is no radiator. "
Or hoses.
Or water pump.
Or rust.

And so there are no worries about anti-lreeze in the
fall or cracked blocks in the winter.

If vou feel that vou owe vour Volkswagen engine a
little something special every spring and fall, you can do
this much.

Just run it once around the block and let it air itself out.

This is great copv because of its simplicity and its image and
its sell, all of which interact to give a very powerful argument to
anvone looking for a new car.

Also, I'd suggest that vou study any of the old Claude Hopkins ads, or John E. Kennedy if'rom the old Lord & Thomas days)
to get the same power of sincerity without the limiting whimsy.
Or the great radio and TV pitches of the Fifties.

There is little advertising being written this way, and its very
raritv makes it even more effective. It will not solve every selling problem, but where it is effective—especialh* in continuous
campaigns—it is very effective indeed.

The second mood vou mav employ to break away from the
"advertising" stereorvpe is what 1 call Deadly Sincerity. This is
the technique of leaning over backwards to point out the flaxes
_in an offer, so that the benefits, when you bring them in, will be_
believed that much more deeply.

Since this is not done in ordinary advertising—since ordinary copv does not knock its product as well as praise it—it carries great emotional impact, especially in highly-competitive fields.

Here is an example, for a book on getting ahead on your
job, which had to run after a hundred books on the same subject had already appeared in the same publication:

TO THE MAN WHO WILL SETTLE FOR NOTHING
LESS THAN THE PRESIDENCY OF HIS FIRM

And who is willing to make the incredible sacrifices
necessary to get there in the shortest possible time.

Here is the most realistic handbook ever written for
vou—and vou alone.

This is a private advertisement.
It is not meant for ninety-nine men out of everv hundred. These men do not have the drive—the impossible
pride—the absolute compulsion to succeed that this advertisement demands . . .

And so on. You can see immediately, in the first few paragraphs of this ad, how the tone of utter frankness is set. The use
of such "non-advertising phraseology" as "incredible sacrifice". . .
_"impassible pride". . . "absolute compulsion". . . "this advertise-_
_ment demands" set the ad off from the others around it—give it_
an air of unpredictability that induces the reader to go on.

In our next chapter when we discuss Reinforcement, we shall
see how this tone of complete fairness, and even criticism, can
make a comparatively minor claim take on immense emotional
impact. But for now it is sufficient to point out that this is one
more way to break out of the hard-sell stereotype, and gain almost the same type of believability that would be given to a factual report.

### THE FINAL TOUCHES

Let's now review what we've done
up to this point, and the last few problems that we have to consider.

We started this book with the idea that there was a definite
technique that could produce better headlines than the ones you
were using yesterday. And. since the headline is so vitally important to the success or failure of vour ads, we devoted the first
part of our book to this creative search.

Then, in the second part, we investigated the equally important problem of how to exploit that headline. How to lead the
prospect from the feeding of interest and curiosity that your headline had aroused in him, into a constantly mounting conviction
that this product has what he wants, and that it is absolutely capable of giving it to him.

You use body copy to accomplish this second objective—
perhaps a lot of it, perhaps very little. In either case, we've
examined the three interlocking paths by which this effective
demand is created: first, the intensification of desire; then the
creation of an acceptable product personality- or role with which

195

-----

196 THE FINAL TOUCHES

the prospect will want to identify; and then the rather abstract
structure underlying your copy arrangement that produces be_lievability of vour story._

So now we Ye seen how to reach out to your prospects mind
on all three emotional lex-els: Desire . . . Identification . . . and
Belieyabilirv.

Now, as our last problem, we have to put all tliese elements
_together. We haxe to take all these promises, these images, these_
devices, these structures—and weave them together into one cohesive unit, that holds your prospect's attention from beginning
to end.

In other words, having broken down the ad to analyze the
elements that make it work—we now have to deal with the reverse problem: tying it together once again.

We have several additional devices that help us do this. We Ye
already touched on them in passing in previous chapters. Now
let's examine them more closely see what makes them operate.
formalize them into working rules. Like this:

**Verification—How to Offer Authorities and Proof**

Now, of course, comes the most obvious kind of believability copy. Your proof: your statistics; your tests; vour testimonials:
your authorities; vour trends; vour documentation; vour seals of
approval; your awards won. Any fact at all that vou can use, anywhere in the copy, to show that your product does what vou saxit does.

The key words here are anyichere in your copy. Because, as
I hax-e tried to shoxv in the last four chapters, the placement of
_your proof is as important to its overall effect as the content itself._

I can't tell you anything about gathering proof that xour oxxn
research department doesn't knoxv a hundred times better. Or, if
you have no research department, that good hard digging won't
give you.

There are no special rules to phrasing proof—except, perhaps,

-----

THE FINAL TOUCHES 1 ^ '

to keep it as short as possible, as dramatic as possible, as specific

as possible.

And, above all. remember that proof copy, like every other
word in vour ad, is selling copy. It cannot merely offer proof
alone. It must offer the kind of proof that makes the prospect
hungry to read everv word of it. and it must make him want the
product more and more at the end of every line.

Fine. But the next question is: where do you place the proof
in your ad? At what point or points will it be most effective?

And, next, how manv different proofs or tests or testimonials or what have vou should you include in the ad? When do you
put them in. and when (if ever' do you leave them out? When
do thev make the ad too heavy? When do they make it dull [0 ]

When do thev make it too much to be believed?

We have been discussing these questions, though not in this
context, for the last four chapters. For the last four chapters we
have been discussing the placement and structure of claims, of
promises. We have found that the more you prepare for those
claims, and the more agreeable vou have made your reader to
accepting them, the more powerful they become.

The same exact rules hold for vour proof. Proof—like claims—
_is most effective ichen the reader unconsciously demands it, and_
_when he is reach/ to accept its content as necessary and logical._

This is the rule. As simple and concrete as this. All the rest
is application.

_We've gone over, quite carefullv, the four processes that de-_
termine position in vour ad. They are, once again:

1. Gradualization—the development of a stream of acceptances from vour reader to vour statements, leading finally to an
inevitable demand on the part of that reader for your product.

_2. Redefinition—the removal of preconceived objections on_
the part of vour prospect toward your product, by providing him
with a new definition of that product.

3. Mechanization—the verbal proof that your product
works—that it does what vou sav it does.

-----

198 THK FINAL TOUCHES

4. _Concentration—the verbal proof that other alternate pre_
rod
nets do not do this essential function as well.

Now, every one of these processes is effective, not onlv in
increasing the believability of vour claims, but also in increasing
the believabilitv of vour proof.

And, in exactly the same wav, in everv one of these processes, there is a place for your proof to appear where it will do
twice as much good for your copy as it would aimvhere else.

For example, go back and look at the Concentration copv in
the spark plug ad that we analvzed in Chapter 12. Here was a
point-after-point comparison of the weaknesses of spark plugs
contrasted with similar strengths in fire injectors.

At the end of this sequence, the writer had built up tremendous believability. He could have done manv things with that
believability. He could have switched it into an immediate restatement of his main claims. He could have channeled it directly into asking for the order. He could have gone into a monev
back guarantee, etc.

Instead, he chose to pile proof upon believabilitv in this wav:
"These are some of the reasons that the U.S. Air Force pai/s
_premium_ _prices for_ _surface_ _supported_ _injectors for_ _their_ _air-_
_craft . . . ."_

And, in so doing, strengthens the power of both the believability copy that went before, and the authoritv-reference that
now follows.

Thus, and we'll take this up in greater detail in the Rein_forcement section that follows, in copy 1 + 1 can often equal 10._
By adding one powerful piece of copv—at preeiselv the right moment—to another, you can get an overall effect far greater than
these two pieces of copy would ever produce, if thev were just
spread out all over the page.

Position increases power. We continue to find new examples
ot this ever\- time we explore another copv process.

And how about the other three processes? How does vour
proof interact with them?

-----

THE FINAL TOUCHES 199

Well, take Gradualization. Study the TV Repair Manual ad
again. Notice the exact point that the '"manufacturers test rooms"
are brought into the copy—at the very moment that the reader
_is begging for some sort of solution to the problems that the copy_
_has intensified over and over again._

Here, at this point, the reader is searching for an answer.
Here the exact same proof which might be merely dull statistics
if it were presented earlier, suddenly takes on a sharpened drama—
_because the reader now is fully aware of its importance, and is_
ready to explore every word.

Again, I must repeat that the main problem with documentation is that it is inherently dull. Your job, therefore, is to add
excitement to it. You have to stage it. You have to develop a
drama, in your readers mind, into which your documentation enters as the hero. In which statistics suddenly become charged
with emotion—because you've made them the solution to what_ever stands between your reader and the satisfactions that he_
_craves._

I could go on, and give examples of the interaction of proof
and each of the remaining mechanisms, but I think you would
gain far more bv doing it yourself. Instead, let me sum up by
saying this:

Documentation is any sort of proof—statistics, facts, tests,
etc.—that your product works.

_Mechanization on the other hand (in case there may be a_
confusion in your mind) is the verbal and logical demonstration,
and thus also proof, that vour product works. Mechanization does
not necessarily have to incorporate any outside documentation at
all to prove its point—it does this on the strength of its logic and
its structure alone.

_Verification—which is different from both of them—is the_
process of arranging your documentation within your copy so that
it gains the greatest immediate acceptance from your reader, and
has the greatest emotional effect on him.

Thus, I would suggest that you stop thinking of placing your

-----

z u u THE FINAL TOUCHES

documentation only in the headline of vour ad, or in the subhead, or in a separate box labelled. "Here's Proof."

I would suggest instead that you start thinking of documentation as one more element (along with promises, belief-words.
momentum-builders, image-sharpeners, emotion-definers, and all
the rest which we'll explore before we finish) to be interwoven
together, side by side—so that, combined, thev give vou far greater
emotional power and believabilitv than anv one of them could
separately.

**Reinforcement—How to Make Two**
**Claims Do the Work of Four**

The first rule of all copy, of course, is that it produce an
emotional impact. As we have seen, over and over again, even in
believabilitv copy, even in documentation, every icord must carry
_image,_ _picture, feeling._

Now. the wonderful thing about emotional writing, of which
copy is one form, is this: That if you employ it skillfully, then the
impact of one emotion, plus the impact of a second emotion, will
often add up—non-mathematically—to the impact of FOUR
emotions.

In mathematics, one plus one alwavs equals two—never more.
In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten. In other
words, two emotional images, joined together in the right way_can often have TEN TIMES the impact that either of these im-_
_ages has hi) itself._

For example, in the classic Avis campaign, the main theme
was "We try harder." Good by itself; but nowhere near as powerful as it became when it was reinforced by the reason why Avis
tries harder: "We're only second."

These two separate ideas: (1) We're second; (2) Therefore.
_we try harder.—when they are combined, take on a joint impact_
far greater than you could ever logically expect if vou simply examined each one of them by itself.

In fact, we can even define one type of creativity as the

T1IK FINAL TOVCHKS 201

_ahiliitj to combine separate images into a new uiiiti/ that is much_
_more powerful than the mere logical sum of Us parts._

This is how new words are horn. As well as new phrases.
slogans, concepts, ideas. And. ot course, headlines.

Your job—and it's a tough one is to do just this, image bv
image, throughout the entire !>od\ cop\ ol vonr ad.

For example, in the ad lor "the man who will settle for nothing less than the presidency ol his firm'' that we quoted in the
last chapter, this sequence occurs:

This is John Horn's first book, lie is not an accomplished writer, and it has Haws. II \OII read tor stvle. or for
literarv quality this is not \oiir book.

_Bui there are jxirajraphs in liu\ hook—ideas in this_
_hook—whole chapters i>i this lnuik licit in here nerer seen_
_put down on paper liejore' \ud dial mai/ open doors to_
_(/on—tomorrow—thai olhrru i\<_ _might take a lifetime of_
_waiting for i/ou to walk through!_

Notice how the startling frankness of the first paragraph,
which goes out of its wav to call the reader's attention to flaws
in its product, serves as an intensifying contrast to the positive
claims of the second paragraph- -making them far more believable and therefore far more powerful to the reader who is now
convinced that he is receiving a fair report on this book.

It is the juxtaposition ol these two paragraphs—one following right on top of the other-- that makes their combination so
effective.

Copvwriting. in nianv phases, is the search for such juxtapositions. The last five chapters have been full of examples of
them. I suggest that vou go back and read these examples again,
and underline the combination points—and junctures—where one
claim blends into another, and either sharpens it, pours strength
into it. or makes it more believable.

So. one wav vou tie vour ad together is to constantly build
one claim on top of another— -alwavs seeking to make each stronger
and more believable bv the combination.

202 THE FINAL TOUCHES

This same principle applies in a smaller way in our next
device.

**Interweaving—How to Blend Emotion, Image and**
**Logic Into the Same Sentence**

Let me mention at this point a thought that has probably
occurred to you several times over the past few chapters:

The big trouble with analysis of the kind we've been doing
in the second part of this book is that after a while it begins to
sound quite mechanical. You've probably thought that I'm suggesting that you abandon any kind of creative flow, and work like
a sort of phrase-carpenter. Here you put in a promise; there vou
nail on a believability sentence; then cover both of them with a
good strong identification.
