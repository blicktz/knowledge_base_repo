Chapter 19 covers graphics in detail. But here are some factors that enhance the readability and eye appeal of a layout:

Use one central visual. Headline set in large, bold type. Body copy set underneath headline and visual. Body copy set in clear, readable type. Space between paragraphs increases readability. Subheads help draw the eye through the text. Copy should be printed black on a white background. Copy printed in reverse, on a tint, or over a visual is difficult to read. Short paragraphs are easier to read than long ones. The lead paragraph should be very short—less than three lines of type, if possible. Simple visuals are best. Visuals with too many elements in them confuse the reader. The best layout is a simple layout: headline, large visual, body copy, logo. Additional elements—a subhead, a sidebar, secondary photos— can enhance the ad’s readability, but too many make it cluttered and unappealing to the eye. Many art directors believe that ads must have a large amount of “white space” (blank space) or else they will look cluttered and people won’t read them. But if your typography is clean and readable, you can set a solid page of text and people will read every word of it.

 In the same way, there are certain visual techniques that make ads unappealing to readers. These techniques give ads an “addy” look and should be avoided. They include:

 Headlines and blocks of copy set on a slant

-----

### Reverse type (white letters on a black background) Tinting of black-and-white photographs with a second color (usually blue or red) Tiny type (smaller than 8-point type) Long, unbroken chunks of text A long listing of company locations and addresses crammed in under the logo Type set in overly wide columns Poorly executed or reproduced artwork and photography

 The look of your ad—its appearance, its layout, how the elements are set up on the page—won’t make an ad with poor copy effective. But an unappealing layout can discourage interested consumers from reading brilliant copy that has a lot to offer them. Again, chapter 19 covers the basics of what copywriters need to know about designing ads.

 5. The body copy covers all important sales points in logical sequence.

 The effective ad tells an interesting, important story about the product. And, like a novel or short story, the copy must be logically organized, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
 If you are describing a product and its benefits, you will probably organize your sales points in order of importance, putting the USP in the headline and taking the reader from the major benefits to minor features as you go through the body copy. In this format, the ad resembles the “inverted pyramid” style used by journalists in news stories.
 If the sales points are not related in any way, you might prefer to use a list format, in which you simply list the sales points in simple 1-2-3 fashion.
 If you are writing a case history or testimonial ad, you can use chronological order to relate the story as it happened. Or you might use a problem/solution format to show how the product solved a problem.

 6. The copy provides the information needed to convince the greatest number of qualified prospects to take the next step in the buying process.

-----

### The length and number of sales points to be included in the copy depends on what you’re selling, who you’re selling it to, and what the next step is in the buying process.
 Here are some observations on ad length that come from flipping through a single issue of Good Housekeeping magazine:

 • A full-page ad for Sophia perfume shows a color photo of the perfume bottle superimposed against a background of fireworks. The ad contains no body copy, just a headline and tagline.

SOPHIA IS DESIRE.

SOPHIA IS MYSTERY.

SOPHIA IS FANTASY.

SOPHIA BY COTY. WEAR IT WITH A PASSION.

### Apparently, there is not a lot to say about perfume; it is sold on the mystique of what wearing perfume does to enhance your sex appeal.

 • An ad for Caltrate 600, a calcium supplement, contains a diagram, a chart, more than four hundred words of body copy, and a straightforward headline announcing, “New Caltrate 600 Helps Keep Bones Healthy.” Apparently, there is a lot to say about health products. The ad also invites the reader to write in for a price-off coupon for the product and a “calcium counter.”

 • Many food ads contain recipes that center around the product being advertised. The food advertiser hopes the reader will like the recipe and, as a result, purchase the product every time he or she makes the dish.

 • The ads for more expensive items—blenders, juicers, flooring, DNA test kits, dentures, real estate—all invite the reader to write or phone for additional information. The advertiser knows there is more to say about these products than can be put in a newspaper or magazine ad; brochures, Web sites, and salespeople will have to augment the efforts of the ad.

-----

### When you sit down to write your ad, ask yourself: “What do I want the reader to do? And what can I tell him that will get him to do it?”

 7. The copy is interesting to read.

 “You cannot bore people into buying your product,” writes David Ogilvy in Ogilvy on Advertising. “You can only interest them in buying it.”
 People will read your ad only as long as it is interesting to them. They will not read copy that is boring, in content or in style.
 As a writer and a reader, you know when writing is interesting to read and when it is dull. The style should be crisp, lively, and light. The copy should have rhythm and clarity.
 But great style won’t save an ad without substance. The copy must appeal to the reader’s self-interest. It must contain benefits, or news, or it must solve the reader’s problem. It cannot entertain for entertainment’s sake; it must present compelling reasons why the product is desirable to the reader.
 Here are a few things that add interest to advertisements:

 Copy that speaks directly to the reader’s life, the reader’s emotions, the reader’s needs and desires Copy that tells a story Copy about people Copy written in a personal style, so that it sounds like a letter from a friend: warm, helpful, and sincere Testimonials from celebrities A free offer (of a gift, a pamphlet, a brochure, or a sample) Copy that contains important news, especially practical advances in health care and medical science Copy that addresses major issues: beauty, health, old age, parenting, marriage, home, security, family, careers, education, social issues Copy that answers questions readers have in their minds Copy about a subject that interests the reader

-----

### Here are some things that make ads boring:

 Copy that centers on the manufacturer—that talks about the company, its philosophy, its success Copy that talks only about how the product is made or how it works rather than what it can do for the reader Copy that tells readers things they already know Long-winded copy with big words, lengthy sentences, and large unbroken chunks of text Copy in which all sentences are the same length (varying sentence length adds snap to writing) Copy that gives only product features and not benefits Copy without a point of view—without a strong selling proposition or a cohesive sales pitch (such copy presents the facts without really showing the reader how these facts relate to his needs) Ads with cluttered layouts and poorly reproduced visuals that look boring and turn the reader off

 8. The copy is believable.

 “Cynicism and suspicion abound today,” said ad agency owner Amil Gargano, “much of it with good reason. That’s why advertising won’t work unless it is trusted, no matter how clever it might seem. And the way to be trusted is to be honest and sensitive to the people you want to reach.”
 The copywriter’s task is not an easy one. In addition to getting attention, explaining the product, and being persuasive, you must overcome the reader’s distrust and get her to believe you.
 We’ve already discussed a number of techniques for building credibility: testimonials, demonstrations, research tests. But these are just techniques. The key to being believed is to tell the truth.
 This is not as radical as it sounds. Contrary to the image of advertising executives as slick hucksters, many are honest, professional businesspeople who believe in the products they’re selling. They would not create

-----

### advertising for a product that is harmful or inferior. And, although ethics plays a part, the real reason for this is a simple fact about advertising.
 Clever advertising can convince people to try a bad product once. But it can’t convince them to buy a product they’ve already tried and didn’t like.
 So you see, there’s no percentage in writing ads that tell lies. Besides being unethical, it’s unprofitable for the agency and the advertiser, and it gives advertising a bad name.
 Fewer and fewer practitioners engage in such unethical behavior. The majority believe that the product they are advertising can do you a lot of good. When you believe in your product, it’s easy to write copy that is sincere, informative, and helpful. And when you are sincere, it comes across to readers and they believe what you’ve written.

 9. The ad asks for action.

 The ad should ask the reader to take the next step in the buying process, whether that step is to send in an order, call a sales office, visit a store, try a sample, see a demonstration, or go to a Web site or landing page.
 You are already familiar with coupons, toll-free numbers, and other devices used to urge the reader to respond to the ad. Barry Kingston, merchandising director of Opportunity magazine, gave these tips on getting the best response to your ad:

 Use a street address instead of a post office box number. A street address gives the impression that your firm is large, stable, and well established. If most of the magazine’s readers qualify for your offer, use a toll-free number to increase response. But if you want to qualify your leads, use a regular company phone number. If the product can be ordered directly with a credit card, include a toll- free number. Use a company phone number to add credibility to both e-commerce and print advertising. A coupon boosts response between 25 and 100 percent.

-----

### Asking the reader to send in a letter reduces response but produces highly qualified leads (people with genuine interest in the product).

 DOES YOUR AD NEED A SLOGAN?

 A slogan, also known as the tagline, is a phrase or sentence that appears beneath the company logo in an ad or series of ads. The slogan is used to sum up the central message of the ads, or to make a broad statement about the nature of the company.
 Some well-known slogans:

WE’RE AMERICAN AIRLINES: DOING WHAT WE DO BEST

MAXWELL HOUSE: GOOD TO THE LAST DROP

LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, STATE FARM IS THERE

NOTHING BEATS A GREAT PAIR OF L’EGGS

PRUDENTIAL: GET A PIECE OF THE ROCK

IF THEY COULD JUST STAY LITTLE TILL THEIR CARTER’S WEAR OUT

LONG DISTANCE: THE NEXT BEST THING TO BEING THERE

AMERICAN EXPRESS: DON’T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT

### These slogans have built consumer awareness of brand-name products because they are pithy and memorable, and because they sum up the nature of the product or service. However, there are hundreds of slogans that have been used for a few months and then dropped from ads, never to be written or uttered again.
 Should you use a slogan in your ad? It depends on whether your product lends itself to this technique. In copywriting, the rule should be “Form follows function.” In other words, use a technique if it works and seems natural. But don’t force-fit a copy technique in an ad where it doesn’t belong.
 Applying this rule to slogans, I’d say use a slogan if your product’s key selling proposition or its nature can be summed up in a single, catchy statement. But if the essence of your product or business can’t be captured in a one-liner, don’t force it, or the result will be an artificial slogan that

-----

### detracts from the ad and makes you, your ad agency, your employees, and your customers embarrassed and uncomfortable.
 For example, let’s say your company manufactures flypaper. The company president says, “Our slogan should be: The Leader in Quality Flypaper.” But this slogan restricts you to a narrow product category. If you decide to expand and manufacture flyswatters, you’ll have a hard time because people will think of you as a flypaper company only.
 Then your ad agency says, “Let’s think big. You’re not just in flypaper; you’re in ‘pest control.’ How about ‘Leaders in the Science of Pest Control’ as a slogan?” But this is too general. Pest control can be anything from spraying termites to catching rats. And your company really doesn’t plan to get involved in these areas.
 So the danger with slogans is that some are too narrow and pigeonhole you in a specialty, while others are so broad-based that they lose any real meaning or applicability to your business.
 Slogans work best when they are memorable and when they are repeated to the target audience numerous times over a prolonged period. For instance, Allstate’s slogan has been “You’re in Good Hands” since 1950.

 MANUSCRIPT FORMAT FOR AD COPY

 Today most of my copy is sent to clients via e-mail as attached Microsoft Word files, a Dropbox folder, or Google Docs. If your clients are PC literate, they can use the Word “Track Changes” feature to make their comments on your copy, eliminating the need to print it out and mark it up by hand.
 Some copywriters include labels in their copy that indicate whether the text the reviewer is reading is for a headline, subhead, body copy, caption, boxed material, or the description of a visual. Some writers type these descriptions in parentheses in the left margin. I type them in capital letters flush against the left margin, with a colon following the label but with no parentheses. This way, my manuscript looks very neat because everything is flush with the left margin.
 A sample page of manuscript is shown here:

ThermoPal ad—page 1

**HEADLINE:**
How to Keep Your Iced Tea on Ice

**VISUAL:**
Tall glass of iced tea sitting next to an open ThermoPal thermos.

**COPY:**
Nothing quenches thirst like a cold iced tea on a hot summer’s day.

But the tea in a can or a carton won’t stay cool in summer heat. And an ordinary thermos
won’t fit in your briefcase or bag or lunch box.

Introducing ThermoPal, the pint-size thermos that makes sure your cool summer drinks stay
cool … and is small enough to go where you go.

**SUBHEAD:**
A big gulp in a tiny bottle

**COPY:**
ThermoPal is tiny enough to fit in the slimmest briefcase or in a tightly packed backpack. But
it’s big enough to hold a frosty 8 ounces of tea, lemonade, or fruit juice. That’s as much as you
get in a tall, cool glass at home or from a machine.

But by carrying your lunchtime drink in ThermoPal, your refreshment costs a few pennies
instead of a dollar or more, as it would from a vending machine or fast-food stand. So
ThermoPal pays for itself in just a few weeks … and brings big savings over the long, hot
summer.

We know you’ll be delighted with ThermoPal for years to come. If not, just send the lid back
in the mail for a full refund—no questions asked.

To order ThermoPal, clip and mail the reply coupon. Or visit www.thermopal.com/offer. But
hurry—supplies are limited, and we usually sell out by the middle of spring.

**COUPON:**

# □ YES, I want to keep cool. Please send me ___ ThermoPals at $8.95 each plus $1.00 each
for shipping and handling. My check is enclosed. If not satisfied, I’ll send back the top of the
thermos for a full refund of my money.

### A CHECKLIST OF ADVERTISING IDEAS

 Copywriters don’t sit down with an assignment and say, “I want to do a testimonial ad” or “Let’s make it a how-to ad.” They first study the product, the audience, and the purpose of the advertisement. Then they use the technique that fits the assignment.
 Still, it helps to be familiar with the various types of ads that have been successful over the years: how-to, testimonials, before-and-after, and others.
 Below is a checklist of many of these categories. When you’re stuck for an idea, a quick review of the list might give you inspiration—you might scan the list and say, “Hey, here’s an approach that works with what I’m selling!” Turn to this checklist not as a crutch but as an aid in producing selling ideas:

QUESTION AD—asks a question in the headline and answers it in the
### body copy.

QUIZ AD—copy presents a quiz. Reader takes quiz. Her answers
### determine whether she is a prospect for the product or service being offered.

NEWS AD—announces a new product or something new about an
### existing product.

DIRECT AD—gives a straightforward presentation of the facts.

INDIRECT AD—has an obscure headline designed to arouse curiosity
### and entice the reader to read the body copy.

REWARD AD—promises a reward for reading the ad.

COMMAND AD—commands the reader to take action.

PRICE-AND-WHERE-TO-BUY AD—announces a sale. Describes the
### product, gives the price and discount, and tells where to buy it.

REASON-WHY AD—presents reasons why you should buy the product.

LETTER AD—an ad written in letter form.
