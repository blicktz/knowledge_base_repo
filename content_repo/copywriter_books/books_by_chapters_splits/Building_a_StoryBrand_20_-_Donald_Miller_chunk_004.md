###### 1. What do you offer? 2. How will it make my life better? 3. What do I need to do to buy it?

 At StoryBrand, we call this passing the grunt test. The critical question is this: Could a caveman look at your website and immediately grunt your offer back to you?
 Imagine a guy wearing a bearskin T-shirt, sitting in a cave by a fire, with a laptop across his lap. He’s looking at your website. Would he be able to grunt an answer to the three questions posed above? If you were an aspirin company, would he be able to grunt, “You sell headache medicine, me feel better fast, me get it at Walgreens”? If not, you’re likely losing sales.
 Cut it with the cute copy that expensive ad agency charged you for. Nobody wants to go to your website and figure out a riddle. Just. Be. Clear.

##### CLARITY PRODUCES RESULTS

###### One of our early clients, Kyle Shultz, was a fireman in Ohio who looked into StoryBrand because he wanted to leave his job and pursue his passion of teaching photography. He had recently launched an online photography course aimed at parents. He’d worked hard to create terrific video training allowing moms everywhere to finally start using that basic camera they’d placed in the junk drawer because they felt it was too complicated. Interest was decent. In his first launch, he sold $25,000 worth of online courses. He was ecstatic. Still, it wasn’t enough money for him to quit his job and pursue teaching photography full-time.
 When Kyle encountered the SB7 framework, he began to wonder whether his message was too confusing. The night before his next launch he used the framework to completely rewrite his website. In fact, he removed 90 percent of the text he’d previously used on his sales page and stopped using inside language like “f-stop” and “depth of field.” Instead, he used phrases like “Take those great pictures where the background is blurry.”
 The next day Kyle sent a mass email to the exact same email list he’d contacted only six months before and offered the course again. He wasn’t

###### expecting much because he’d already sold to this list, but to his surprise the course sold another $103,000 worth of registrations.
 The difference? He highlighted the aspects of his course that would help parents survive and thrive (build stronger tribes, strengthen family connections, and connect more deeply with life’s greater meaning), and he did so in such a simple way (with fewer than three hundred words on his sales page) that people didn’t have to burn calories to figure out what was in it for them. Overnight, he’d gone from a cluttered mess to the clear guide in his customers’ story.
 Today, Kyle has quit his job and runs Shultz Photo School full-time. Every day he gets emails from parents thanking him for helping them feel great about the photographs they’re taking of their children.
 Here’s another story: My wife made a friend named Nicole Burke. Her mission to make gardening ordinary was slowly gaining traction through her business, Gardenary. Nicole has a terrific, ready-for-television personality and has attracted a lot of clients. When she joined my mastermind and I reviewed her messaging collateral, I had to let her know that nobody wakes up wanting to make gardening ordinary. Her mission was just that: her mission. It wasn’t her customers’ mission. I told her to buy the domain StartAGarden.com because tons of people wake up on respective mornings and realize they want to start a garden. A quick Amazon.com and web search revealed nobody owned that idea. The mental real estate was wide open and she took it. Today, Nicole’s business is poised to quadruple in revenue and influence, not because she launched a new product or because she got that television show (which she deserves) but because she started being clear. I believe Nicole is going to be a household name one day. Why? Because she is going to own a problem. If you want to start a garden, go see Nicole. The irony of her story is that by branding herself as the woman who can help you start a garden, she will make gardening ordinary, thus accomplishing her original mission. The moral: we will not accomplish our mission by explaining our own story; we will accomplish our mission by inviting customers into a story in which they can experience a clear win.

##### WE NEED A FILTER

-----

###### Alfred Hitchcock defined a good story as “life with the dull parts taken out.”[2] Good branding is the same. Our businesses are complex, for sure, but a good messaging filter will remove all the stuff that bores our customers and will accentuate the aspects of our brand that will help them survive and thrive.
 So how do we come up with these messages? It’s simple. We use a storytelling grid to map out a story our customers step into, then we create clear and refined statements in the seven relevant categories of their lives to position ourselves as their guides. When we do this, we become the people who help them overcome their challenges and achieve a life they want to live.
 Once we begin filtering our message through the SB7 framework and using it as a communication filter, we will be able to repeat powerful messages over and over that “brand” us into our customers’ lives.
 The SB7 framework is simple, fun, and effective. And when you’re done, your entire brand message is going to sit on a single sheet of paper. We call this single sheet of paper (actually, it’s a free digital application I’m going to introduce you to) the StoryBrand BrandScript.
 Once you’ve finished the process, you’ll use your BrandScript to create all manner of improved messaging and marketing material, and you’ll be more clearly positioned in the marketplace. Think of the StoryBrand framework as a weight-loss plan for messaging and marketing. When your messaging is lean and muscular, customers will finally start to listen. When customers understand how you can help them live a great story, your business will grow.
 With that, let’s take a look at the StoryBrand framework.

###### CHAPTER 3

## THE SIMPLE SB7 FRAMEWORK

### In the following chapters, I’ll dive deep into the elements of the SB7
###### framework, showing you how each important category of messaging makes your brand more and more inviting to customers. You will use these seven categories to create powerful sound bites you can easily repeat over and over to get astonishing results. For now, though, let’s take an overview so you can understand, in summary form, all that the StoryBrand framework can do to simplify your marketing and messaging.

##### THE STORYBRAND FRAMEWORK

###### 1. A Character

 STORYBRAND PRINCIPLE ONE: THE CUSTOMER IS THE HERO, NOT YOUR

BRAND.

-----

###### A major paradigm shift in the SB7 framework is that the customer is the hero of the story, not your brand. When we position our customer as the hero and ourselves as the guide, we will be recognized as a trusted resource to help our customers overcome their challenges.
 Positioning the customer as the hero in the story is more than just good manners; it’s also good business. However, it’s counterintuitive. Communication expert Nancy Duarte has done extensive research on how to create powerful presentations. The strategy she recommends to her clients is simple: When giving a speech, position yourself as Yoda and your audience as Luke Skywalker.[1] This small but powerful shift honors the journey of the audience and positions us as a leader providing wisdom, products, and services they need in order to thrive.
 In marketing and messaging, too many business leaders position themselves as the hero—and it’s a turnoff. Imagine going to a movie in which the story stops so the screenwriter can come on screen to brag about how awesome the story is going and how brilliant they are at creating such great characters. No screenwriter would do that, would they? Yet business leaders do it all the time. Rather than invite their customers into a story, they talk about themselves, their mission, their goals, their backstory, and all sorts of stuff no customer cares about. Instead, let’s understand our products from the customer’s perspective.
 Once we identify who our customer is, we have to ask ourselves what they want as it relates to our brand. The catalyst for any story is that the hero wants something. The rest of the story is a journey of discovering whether the hero will get what they want.
 Unless we identify something our customer wants, they will never feel invited into the story we are creating. As we explore the first element of the StoryBrand framework, I’ll show you what customers really want from your brand and how to invite them into a story that makes them pay attention to your brand so they can get what they want.

 2. Has a Problem

-----

###### STORYBRAND PRINCIPLE TWO: THE ONLY THINGS PEOPLE BUY ARE

SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS, AND IF YOU HAVEN’T IDENTIFIED YOUR

CUSTOMER’S PROBLEMS OR FAIL TO TALK ABOUT THEM CLEARLY, YOU AREN’T

GOING TO SELL ANYTHING.

###### In its purest form, a story starts with a character who lives in peace and stability. Suddenly that stability is disrupted: a bomb goes off, someone is kidnapped, or a disaster strikes. This sets up the start of the story, a predicament I call the hero in a hole. Once your hero is in a hole, the story begins, which, of course, is all about getting the hero out of the hole. The hero then sets out on a journey to return to the peaceful life they once enjoyed.
 Customers are attracted to our brands for the same reason heroes are pulled into stories: They want to solve a problem that has, in big or small ways, disrupted their peaceful life. In short, every one of our customers is a “hero in a hole” looking for a way out. Whether they are looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift, relief from a headache, whiter teeth, a larger car to fit their growing family, or an investment that doubles as a tax break, your customers are in a hole and are looking for a way out. If we sell lawn- care products, our customers are coming to us because they’re embarrassed about their lawn or they simply don’t have time to do the work. If we sell financial advice, they’re coming to us because they’re worried about their retirement plan. It may not be as dramatic or sexy as James Bond going to Q to grab the latest high-tech spy weapon, but the premise is the same: our customers are in trouble and need our help.
 By talking about the problems our customers face, we deepen their interest in everything we offer.
 What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal, and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three levels of problems human beings face in their everyday lives. Almost

-----

###### all companies try to sell solutions to external problems, but as we unfold the StoryBrand framework, you’ll see why customers are much more motivated to resolve their inner frustrations.
 In the second element of the StoryBrand framework, we’ll look at the three levels of problems our customers experience and create messages offering to resolve those problems. Understanding and addressing the three levels of problems our customers face will help us create a brand promise that will connect with customers on a primitive level and at their deepest point of need. This, in turn, will help us endear customers and create passionate brand evangelists.

 3. And Meets a Guide

 STORYBRAND PRINCIPLE THREE: CUSTOMERS AREN’T LOOKING FOR

ANOTHER HERO; THEY’RE LOOKING FOR A GUIDE.

###### If heroes in a story could solve their own problems, they would never get into trouble in the first place. That’s why storytellers, through the centuries, have created another character to help the hero win. Depending on the scholar you talk to, there are many names for this character, but the term we use at StoryBrand is the guide.
 In Tom Hooper’s Academy Award–winning film The King’s Speech, King George VI struggles to overcome a debilitating stutter. As Britain prepares for war against Germany, the Brits look to their leader for confidence and direction. Desperate, King George VI solicits the help of Lionel Logue, a dramatist turned speech therapist, who gives him a plan, coaches him to competency, and helps him transform into a powerful orator. This emotional and strategic support are the same service Obi-Wan (and Yoda) offers Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, Haymitch offers Katniss in The

-----

###### Hunger Games, Bing Bong offers Joy in Pixar’s Inside Out, and countless other guides offer countless other heroes in nearly all our favorite stories.
 It’s no accident that guides show up in almost every narrative you encounter. Nearly every human being is looking for a guide (or guides) to help them win the day.
 To position yourself as a hero is a mistake. Brands that position themselves as heroes unknowingly complicate their relationship with potential customers. Every human being wakes up each morning and sees the world through the lens of a protagonist. The world revolves around them, regardless of how altruistic, generous, and selfless a person they may be. Each day is, quite literally, about how we encounter our world. Potential customers feel the same way about themselves. They are the center of their world.
 When a brand comes along and positions itself as the hero, customers remain distant. They hear us talking about how great our business is and subconsciously believe we’re competing with them for scarce resources. Their subconscious thought pattern goes like this: Oh, this is another hero, like me. I wish I had more time to hear their story, but right now I’m busy looking for a guide to get me out of this hole.
 Many brands have wrecked their potential by playing the hero instead of the guide. Many politicians have lost their elections because they positioned themselves as the hero instead of the guide. Many products have flopped upon launch, not because the product was bad but because the product itself was not positioned as a tool the hero could use to get out of their hole. These are fatal mistakes and, sadly, they are made all the time. As we explore the third element of the StoryBrand framework, we’ll look at two mental triggers that will position you, your brand, and your products as the guide with the resources your customers have been looking for.

 4. Who Gives Them a Plan

-----

###### STORYBRAND PRINCIPLE FOUR: CUSTOMERS TRUST A GUIDE WHO GIVES

THEM A PLAN.

###### At this point in our customers’ story we’ve identified what they want, defined three levels of problems they’re encountering, and positioned ourselves as their guide. And our customers love us for the effort. But they still aren’t going to make a purchase. Why? Because we haven’t laid out a simple plan of action they can take to get out of their hole.
 Making a purchase is a huge step, especially if our products or services are expensive or time-consuming to adopt. What customers are looking for, then, is a clear path we’ve laid out that takes away any confusion they might have about how the process of getting out of the hole is going to work. The StoryBrand element we will use to create this path is called the plan.
 In almost every story, the guide gives the hero a plan, usually in the form of a few steps they can take to get the job done. In the Star Wars movies, Yoda tells Luke to trust the Force and then trains him on how to wield this power. Lionel gives King George a series of exercises he can use to control his stutter in The King’s Speech. The point is that people are looking for a philosophy they can embody or a series of steps they can take to solve their problems.
 In the fourth element of the StoryBrand framework, we’ll look at two kinds of plans: the agreement plan and the process plan. Each of these plans will earn trust and offer our customers a clear path to stability, effectively creating a ladder they can use to get out of their hole, greatly increasing the chance they will make a purchase.

 5. And Calls Them to Action

###### STORYBRAND PRINCIPLE FIVE: CUSTOMERS DO NOT TAKE ACTION UNLESS

THEY ARE CHALLENGED TO TAKE ACTION.
