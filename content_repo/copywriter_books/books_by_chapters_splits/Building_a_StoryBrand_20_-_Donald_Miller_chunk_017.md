## THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE

#### StoryBrand Principle Six: Every human being is
 trying to avoid a tragic ending.

### A story endears an audience based on its ability to generate interest in a
###### single question: Will the hero succeed or fail in accomplishing their objective? To encourage the audience to care about the hero and their objective, a good storyteller employs well-worn narrative tactics. For example, the first thing the storyteller must do is make the hero relatable and sympathetic: This is why so many stories begin by showing you how the hero became an orphan. Orphans are sympathetically endearing to every human being because orphans are almost always innocent creatures who are lost and in need of completion, which is a state humans find themselves in several times each week. All of us feel like orphans from time to time, even if we had terrifically attentive parents. To feel like an orphan, in the psychological sense, is to realize that your life is your own and in the end you’re going to have to take responsibility for that life in your search for completion. In a meaningful narrative treatment, then, the completion the hero must find takes on a symbolic form of some sort, such as accomplishment (Daniel winning the karate tournament in The Karate Kid) or relational fulfillment (every romantic comedy you can think of) or a return to home (Lord of the Rings and all the Benji movies). In short, the storyteller’s job is to make us care about the hero as long as it takes for the story to feel like a difficult and transformative journey. This is all fairly easy to accomplish by establishing an early hardship (a hero in a hole) and then stating a clear objective (the hero standing on the edge of the hole, reflecting back on how the journey changed them.) The hard job of the

###### storyteller, though, is stretching it all out for ninety minutes or two hours or, in the case of a narrative series, several seasons on Netflix. So how do the storytellers elongate the plot so they can get a full-length feature out of the story idea? They interject conflict and then dangle high stakes.
 In a previous chapter we talked about your customers’ problems and how important it is to understand them and speak of them often. You will remember that the more you speak of your customers’ problems, the more likely they are to buy your products. But speaking of your customers’ problems will be twice as effective if you add one more element to your campaign—negative stakes.
 In storytelling, narrative stakes are what’s at play based on whether the hero accomplishes their objective. The higher a storyteller can raise the stakes, the more the audience leans in to find out what will happen.
 Throughout a story, storytellers foreshadow a potential successful ending and a potential tragic ending. The audience remains in suspense as long as the storyteller keeps the hero teetering on the precipice of success and failure. The key here is to use stakes in the story to shorten the audience’s leash.
 Need to raise the stakes in a romantic comedy? Have the young woman fall in love with the hero’s brother, who, by the way, is a jerk and a bully and a con artist. Then, continue to show the bully brother reeling in the romantic interest through lies and deception, all the while making the audience cringe at how horribly this story might end. If the young woman marries the con artist brother, both her life and the life of the hero will be ruined. Of course, any time the storyteller needs to heighten a sense of urgency, they can simply pull on the “make the brother do something awful” lever and the audience will lean in even more.
 Storytellers use stakes as plot devices all the time, and in our journey to clarify our brand’s message, we can learn something from this proven tactic. The question we must then ask ourselves as we clarify our message is, What can be won or lost in our customers’ lives if they do or do not purchase our products?
 The only two motivated actions a hero can take in a story are to move away from something bad or move toward something good. Such is life. Our desire to avoid pain motivates us to seek a resolution to our problems.
 If a storyteller doesn’t clearly let an audience know what no-good, terrible, awful thing might befall their hero unless she overcomes her

###### challenge, the story will have no stakes, and a story without stakes will lose favor with an audience—fast.
 As a rule, each scene in a movie must provide a clear answer to the “stakes” question—that is, What’s at stake in this scene for the hero? Every conversation, every chase scene, every sentimental and reflective montage should serve the movie in the same way: it must move the character either closer to or further from the tragic result that might befall them.
 We kept turning the pages of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre based on our suspicion that Edward Rochester was hiding something even darker than we first suspected.
 We sat on the edge of our seats in the movie Jaws because we knew that more citizens of Amity Island might be killed by the shark if Chief Martin Brody didn’t do something.
 Imagine a story in which nothing bad could befall the hero. Imagine a love story in which everything went well for the couple straight through to the beautiful and tension-free wedding. Imagine an action movie in which the bomb the hero had to destroy was actually a dud and nobody was ever in actual danger. Would an audience care?
 The lesson for those of us clarifying our brand message is this: brands that don’t paint the stakes fail to answer the “so what” question every customer is secretly asking.

##### WHERE’S THE MAYHEM?

###### Allstate Insurance’s long-running Mayhem campaign features dozens of commercials featuring actor Dean Winters humorously portraying various maladies such as raccoons in the attic or a raging fire started by a barbecue grill at a tailgating party. The idea is to humorously remind people why they need insurance. Mayhem, then, is always contrasted against the peaceful stability of life protected by Allstate, buttoned up with the reflective question, “Are you in good hands?”
 In 2015, Allstate, along with the advertising agency Leo Burnett, took the campaign to a terrifically entertaining level. During the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day, Allstate launched a campaign called Project Share Aware.

-----

###### The idea was to make people aware that sharing their whereabouts on social media might tip off criminals about when to burglarize their homes.
 To announce the project, Allstate found a real couple and led them to believe they’d won a prize. They visited the couple in their home, secretly taking pictures of their household items. Later, they recreated their home on a soundstage, complete with duplicates of their belongings. The couple was then invited to attend the Sugar Bowl and given their own private box. During the game, Mayhem began auctioning off the couple’s belongings on national television. People were directed to Mayhemsale.com for bargain- basement prices on everything from the couple’s used car to an old tuba. As the couple watched their possessions being sold on the big screens at the game, hidden cameras caught their reactions and broadcast their actual panic on live television.
 Of course, the couple’s actual possessions were safe. Nevertheless, the campaign agitated a fear in many Americans. In fact, news outlets all over the country, including ABC News, Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times, covered the story. Suddenly, the threat of criminals walking into our homes as we announce our distant whereabouts on social media became a national fear.
 The result of the campaign for Allstate? Mayhemsale.com received six to ten thousand hits per second immediately following each commercial. The site received more than eighteen million hits during the game. Also, #Mayhemsale trended in the top ten hashtags during the game, and immediately after the commercials aired, it surged to number one worldwide. Mayhem’s X followers (then Twitter) increased by twenty-four thousand during the game, and the first commercial of the campaign resulted in more than twenty million impressions on Facebook and almost seventy thousand likes.[1] Allstate had, in the course of one football game, foreshadowed a potential failure (stakes) for their customers and sold an insurance product that would protect them, both opening a dark psychological story loop and offering a product to close it in a single campaign.
 Of course, we don’t all have access to the millions it takes to create a campaign like this, but the benefits of featuring the potential pitfalls of not doing business with us are much easier to include than we may think. Blog subjects, email content, and bullet points on our website can all include

###### elements of potential failure to give our customers a sense of urgency when it comes to our products and services.

##### WHAT’S THERE TO LOSE?

###### As it relates to negative stakes in our marketing, the obvious question is, What will the customer lose if they don’t buy our products?
 Some of you just cringed. I understand. I used to cringe when I thought about “warning” my customers about imminent doom too. Why wouldn’t I? The last thing I want to be is a fearmonger, because it’s true that fearmongers can give customers the cringe. But fearmongering is not the problem 99.9 percent of business leaders struggle with. In our messaging, most of us actually generate the opposite dynamic in the minds of our customers because we don’t define the negative stakes of the story we are inviting customers into, and this presents us as uninteresting. Remember, if there are no stakes in the story, there is no story.
 In a good movie, you must be able to pause the screen and define what is at stake both in the overall story and in the specific scene itself. For instance, if we pause Jason Bourne midscene, we must be able to easily decipher that if he doesn’t figure out who he is and who is out to get him, the mysterious bad guys will win and he will die, and if he doesn’t get out of this house before the hit team shoots him, he will die here and now. In other words, there are stakes and then substakes at play from the first minute of the movie to the last.
 The same must be true in your marketing and messaging. If I am perusing your landing page, I must know what the stakes are if I do or don’t buy your product, and if you send me an email telling me about your product, there must be stakes in the email too. If you are giving me an elevator pitch, those stakes must be repeated. And by the way, if you are offering a lead-generating PDF, there must be stakes as to whether I download it; and if I do, there must be stakes as to whether I read it; and if I do read it, the stakes must be clear as to whether I buy your product and also whether I buy by midnight tonight. Too many stakes? Almost never. Can there be too many stakes in an action movie? And don’t you want the story you are inviting customers into to be as engaging as an action movie?

###### Too many of our messaging campaigns play out with the slow-moving urgency of a French art film that has no commercial appeal save for the avant-garde, twenty-something wannabe-writer using the film to bolster their fragile artistic identity as a way to feel superior over others, despite the fact that it failed to attract the women they wanted and that the money they squandered producing it could have been better spent lining the tip jar of a good therapist. Speaking for a friend.

 Human Beings Are Motivated by Loss Aversion
 Emphasizing potential loss is more than just good storytelling; it’s good behavioral economics. In 1979, Nobel Memorial Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman published a theory about why people make certain buying decisions. Prospect theory, as it is called, espoused that people are more likely to be dissatisfied with a loss than they are to be satisfied with a gain. In other words, people hate losing one hundred dollars more than they like winning one hundred dollars. The study proved that loss aversion is a greater motivator of buying decisions than potential gains. In fact, according to Kahneman, in certain situations, people are two to three times more motivated to make a change to avoid a loss than they are to achieve a gain.[2]
 Loss aversion can be employed any time we need to convince people to make the right decision. When Lyndon Baines Johnson worked to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he faced undying pressure from political leaders across the South. One of the principal leaders who refused to endorse the legislation was George Wallace, then governor of Alabama. Wallace had no vote on the bill, but his influence threatened its passage all the same. At a crucial moment in the negotiations, Johnson sat Wallace down and explained he’d better get on the right side of history. Johnson said that Wallace’s legacy hung in the balance, that people would either build a statue in his honor or he’d be remembered for instigating hate. The choice was his. In other words, Johnson spelled out the narrative structure of his leadership effort and emphasized the stakes, including the potential of the governor’s tarnished legacy. The civil rights bill, of course, was passed.
 So how do we use messages from the failure category in our StoryBrand BrandScript? In Dominic Infante, Andrew Rancer, and Deanna Womack’s book Building Communication Theory, they propose a four-step process called a “fear appeal.”

-----

###### First, we must make a reader (or listener) know they are vulnerable to
 a threat. I’ll use a simple marketing narrative for a pest-control business as an example:
 “Nearly 30 percent of all homes have evidence of termite infestation.” Second, we should let the reader know that since they’re vulnerable,
 they should take action to reduce their vulnerability.
 “Since termites will destroy your home, you should do something about it to protect your investment.” Third, we should let them know about a specific call to action that
 protects them from the risk.
 “At ACME Pest Control, we offer a complete home treatment that will ensure your house is free of termites.” Fourth, we should challenge people to take this specific action.
 “To enjoy a 10 percent discount, call us today and schedule your home treatment.”[3]

 Essentially, Infante, Rancer, and Womack present a soft way of agitating a fear and then highlight a path that would return readers or listeners to peace and stability, saving them from the negative stakes at play in the story.
 The stakes in a story can be quite serious. If you are a doctor, stating the negative stakes clearly can save lives. Sure, you may disturb a patient or two as you explain that they need to change their diet or remember to take their medication, but isn’t disrupting their comfort worth it if you are saving their lives?
 Make no mistake, the words that describe negative stakes matter. If there is something serious at stake, state it clearly. Sometimes a warning may feel like bad news, but if that warning will prevent devastation, say it boldly.

 Fear Is Salt in the Recipe
 We do not need to use a great deal of fear in the story if we want to see results. Just a pinch of salt in the recipe will do. While we do need to communicate something from the failure category in order to complete our

-----

###### BrandScript, too many warnings about imminent doom will run the risk of turning customers off.
 Infante, Rancer, and Womack explain why:

 When receivers of negative messaging are either very fearful or very unafraid, little attitude or behavior change results. High levels of fear are so strong that individuals block them out; low levels are too weak to produce the desired effect. Messages containing moderate amounts of fear-rousing content are most effective in producing attitudinal and/or behavior change.[4]

 The lesson here is that we mustn’t let a fear of negative messaging keep us from using it, because if we don’t use negative messaging, our campaign will fail to stimulate action. That said, we can’t overuse it either. In my view, though, almost nobody reading this book will overuse it. Instead, most of us will let our fear of negative messaging cause us to make the larger mistake, which is to use so little of it, or to keep the negative messaging so vague, that it fails to enhance our message and create urgency. For me, this is the general rule: when I am slightly uncomfortable with the negativity of my message, I add a little more and then stop. In my experience, my feeling that I’m being negative is shared only half by the person hearing the message.
 Another truth to consider is that your negative message is mostly converted into a positive message if you’re marrying those warnings with an offer of redemption. For instance, ask yourself if the following story is happy or sad:
