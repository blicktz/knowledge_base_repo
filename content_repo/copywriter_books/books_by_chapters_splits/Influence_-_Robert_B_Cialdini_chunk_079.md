#### Chapter 7: Commitment and Consistency
1. For an instructive article on Amazon’s “Pay to Quit” program, see
www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/why-amazon-pays-employees-5000-to-quit.html. Evidence of the ability
of a commitment, once made, to drive subsequent responding has been found at the horse track
(Knox & Inkster, 1968), in political elections (Regan & Kilduff, 1988), and within resourceconservation efforts (Abrahamse & Steg, 2013; Andor & Fels, 2018; Pallak, Cook, & Sullivan,
1980). General support for the existence of consistency pressures has been obtained in a wide variety
of studies (Briñol, Petty, & Wheeler, 2006; Bruneau, Kteily, & Urbiola, 2020; Harmon-Jones,
Harmon-Jones, & Levy, 2015; Ku, 2008; Mather, Shafir, & Johnson, 2000; Meeker et al., 2014;
Rusbult et al., 2000; Stone & Focella, 2011; Sweis et al., 2018).
2. Although he wasn’t the first prominent theorist to give the need for consistency a central place
in human behavior, easily the most famous was Leon Fes tinger, whose cognitive dissonance theory
(1957) begins with the assumption that we are uncomfortable with our inconsistencies and will take
steps to reduce or remove them, even if it requires fooling ourselves to do so (see Aronson & Tavris

[2020] for a modern application of this powerful formulation to the COVID-19 pandemic). Moriarty
(1975) conducted the radio-theft experiment. Not only is inconsistency a negatively viewed trait in
ourselves; we also dislike it in others (Barden, Rucker, & Petty, 2005; Heinrich & Borkenau, 1998;
Wagner, Lutz, & Weitz, 2009; Weisbuch et al., 2010). There is good evidence that consistent
responding can occur in automatic fashion (Fennis, Janssen, & Vohs, 2009) both to avoid the
undesired conclusions that rational thought can bring (Woolley & Risen, 2018) and simply to avoid

-----

the rigors of thinking, which can, as Sir Joshua Reynolds said, be laborious (Ampel, Muraven, &
McNay, 2018; Wilson et al., 2014). Besides those benefits of a mechanical tendency toward
consistency, it’s also the case that the propensity to stay consistent with an initial interpretation or
choice very often leads to accurate decisions (Qiu, Luu, & Stocker, 2020). Siegal (2018) offers a
highly critical look at the history and business model of TM.
3. It is both remarkable and instructive that relatively minor verbal commitments can lead to much
larger behavior changes in such arenas as auto sales (Rubinstein, 1985), charitable volunteering
(Sherman, 1980), Election Day voting (Greenwald et al., 1987; Spangenberg & Greenwald, 2001),
in-home purchases (Howard, 1990), self-presentation (Clifford & Jerit, 2016), health-care choices
(Sprott et al., 2006), and sexual infidelity (Fincham, Lambert, & Beach, 2010).
4. Information about the psychological indoctrination programs of the Korean War is available in
the reports of Drs. Edgar Schein (1956) and Henry Segal (1954). It is important to note that the
widespread collaboration Schein and Segal documented was not always intentional. The American
investigators defined collaboration as “any kind of behavior which helped the enemy,” and it thus
included such diverse activities as signing peace petitions, running errands, making radio appeals,
accepting special favors, making false confessions, informing on fellow prisoners, divulging military
information, and more.

The “How are you doing today?” study conducted by Daniel Howard (1990) was one of three he
reported that showed the same pattern. See Carducci et al. (1989) and Schwartz (1970) for studies
demonstrating the “momentum of compliance” effect. The initial data documenting the foot-in-thedoor technique were collected by Freedman & Fraser (1966), but a variety of subsequent studies have
supported its effectiveness; Doliński (2016) provides a review. Burger and Caldwell (2003) show
how even trivial commitments can lead to self-concept change.
5. The reason active, public, effortful, and freely chosen commitments change our self-images is
that each element gives us information about what we must truly believe. If you perceive yourself
committing to a particular position by taking action regarding it, you are likely to attribute to yourself
a stronger personal belief in the position. The same would be true if you see yourself taking the
position for all to see, in a way that requires a lot of effort on your part, because of an entirely
voluntary choice. The consequent impact on your self-concept would likely lead to resilient and
enduring shifts (Chugani, Irwin, & Redden, 2015; Gneezy et al., 2012; Kettle & Häubl, 2011; Sharot,
Velasquez, & Dolan, 2010; Sharot et al., 2012; Schrift & Parker, 2014).

The idea that people use their own actions as a primary source for deciding who they are was first
rigorously tested by Bem (1972) and has since received good confirmation (e.g., Burger & Caldwell,
2003; Doliński, 2000). Poza (2016) posted the article describing the advantages of registration forms
that limited their first page to two or three fields of requested information. The evidence for greater
compliance from actively made commitments comes from Cioffi & Garner (1996), as well as from
other experiments (Allison & Messick, 1988; Fazio, Sherman, & Herr, 1982; Silver et al., 2020). The
tendency of observers to believe that the author of a statement believes it unless there is strong
evidence to the contrary appeared in research by Allison et al. (1993), Gawronski (2003), and Jones
& Harris (1967). The effects of giving people a label to live up to in the context of charity requests,
supermarket purchases, and international negotiations were described by Kraut (1973), Kristensson,
Wästlund, & Söderlund (2017), and Kissinger (1982), respectively.
6. The claim that public commitments tend to be lasting commitments has been well supported
(e.g., Dellande & Nyer, 2007; Lokhorst et al., 2013; Matthies, Klöckner, & Preißner, 2006; Nyer &
Dellande, 2010). An interesting form of this support comes from work showing consumers to be
more loyal to brands they use publicly versus privately (Khamitov, Wang, & Thomson, 2019).
Evidence that we want both to be consistent within ourselves and to appear consistent to others has
been provided by Schlenker, Dlugolecki, & Doherty (1994) and Tedeschi, Schlenker, & Bonoma
(1971). The stubbornness that public commitments confer on initial choices that Deutsch & Gerard
(1955) observed can be seen in the hung-jury findings of Kerr & MacCoun (1985).

-----

One piece of research (Gollwitzer et al., 2009) stands in stark contrast to the conclusion we have
drawn about public commitments by reporting data suggesting that making a goal commitment
public actually reduces one’s likelihood of reaching the goal. After reviewing the extant literature,
one set of researchers (H. J. Klein et al., 2020) expressed frustration that even though this
contradictory data set has been the only one to find its pattern, it is the one receiving the most media
coverage outside of academic circles—in blogs, popular books, and a TED talk seen by millions.
How might we account for its atypical pattern? I believe that psychological reactance (see chapter 6)
may have played a role. Recall that reactance theory asserts that people become less likely to
undertake an action if (1) deciding whether to take the action represents an important freedom for
them and (2) they experience external pressure to take the action. In the Gollwitzer et al. (2009)
work, participants were first asked to specify how they would take steps to further their educational
goals. Next, in order to make these steps public, some participants were required to submit them to an
external evaluator, the experimenter, who judged the steps before allowing the participants to
continue. Other participants, in the _private condition, did not have to gain the experimenter’s_
approval before being allowed to continue; they simply submitted their planned steps without the
constraints of the experimenter’s permission to continue. These procedures led participants to
become less likely to take the specified steps toward their goal only if both (1) the goal was important
to them and (2) they experienced the external barrier of having the steps permitted by the
experimenter—exactly what reactance theory would predict.
7. The effortful-commitment data from Hangzhou were collected by Xu, Zhang, & Ling (2018).
Additional research into the greater impact of difficultly made commitments has revealed that people
who pay for goods and services by using more psychologically uncomfortable means of payment
(cash or checks versus credit or debit cards) become more committed to the transaction and brand
and thus more likely to make a repeat purchase (Shah et al., 2015).

Although Whiting, Kluckhohn, & Anthony reported on the initiation rites of South Africa’s
Thonga in 1958, not much about their severity has changed in the decades since. In May of 2013, for
example, the South African government had to call a temporary halt to the initiation ceremonies of
various tribes, including the Thonga, after twenty-three young initiates died within a span of nine
days (Makurdi, 2013). A similar conclusion could be drawn regarding school fraternity’s hazing
ceremonies, which were first recorded in the United States at Harvard in 1657 and have remained
present, intractable, and deadly ever since. For a manageably-sized summary, see Reilly (2017); but
for a comprehensive and continually updated record of school hazings, go to the website of college
professor Hank Nuwer (www.hanknuwer.com) and his multiple books on the topic, from which I
gleaned most of my information. The research on the effects of arduousness—either in the form of
embarrassment (Aronson & Mills 1959) or pain (Gerard & Mathewson, 1966)—on an entrant’s
positive responses to an opportunity has been extended to a commercial context; consumers given
access to an exclusive one-day-sale offer were more favorable to the deal if getting that access was
made effortful rather than easy (Barone & Roy, 2010).
8. The idea that paying people to take a stand produces greater commitment to it if they are paid a
small versus large amount for the commitment has received steady support since it was first predicted
(Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959). For example, in a more recent experiment, participants who put
themselves in the position of referring a friend to a brand became more favorable and loyal to the
brand when the monetary reward for the referral was small (Kuester & Blankenstein, 2014). In a
similar vein, since its early demonstrations (Cooper & Fazio, 1984; Deci et al., 1982; Zuckerman et
al., 1978), the idea that giving people free choice produces greater commitment has also continued to
receive support (e.g., Shi et al., 2020; Geers et al, 2013; Staats et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2011),
including among infants (Silver et al., 2020). One reason voluntary choices strengthen commitments
is that they activate our brains’ reward sectors (Leotti & Delgado, 2011). Evidence that commitments
are undermined when they are made because of external pressures such as large monetary rewards or
punishments can be seen in the work of Deci & Ryan (1985), Higgins et al. (1995), and Lepper &

-----

Greene (1978). Finally, when commitments are made for internal rather than external reasons, they
lead to greater psychological well-being. Muslim women in Saudi Arabia and Iran who wear a veil
have greater life-satisfaction scores if they do so for internal reasons, such as personal preferences or
values, rather than for external reasons, such as government controls or social approval (Legate et al.,
2020).
9. For examples of how people support their commitments with new justifying reasons, see
Brockner & Rubin (1985) and Teger (1980). In addition to the Cialdini et al. (1978) study, several
other experiments attest to the success of the low-ball procedure in a variety of circumstances and
with both sexes (Brownstein & Katzev, 1985; Burger & Petty, 1981; Guéguen & Pascual, 2014), and
Joule, 1987. Burger & Caputo (2015) report a meta-analysis confirming the tactic’s effectiveness, as
do Pascual et al. (2016) who support a commitment-based explanation for it. A full description of the
Iowa energy-users study is provided in Pallak, Cook, & Sullivan (1980).
10. The Grant & Hofmann (2011) study also evaluated the impact of two other signs placed over
soap and gel dispensers, neither of which was designed to remind doctors of their commitment to
_patient safety (“Gel in, Wash Out” and “Hand hygiene protects you from catching diseases”) and_
neither of which had any effect on soap or gel usage. Meeker et al. (2014) conducted the study on
prescription of antibiotics, whereas the work on reminders of prior pro-environmental commitments
was performed by Cornelissen et al. (2008) and Van der Werff, Steg, & Keizer (2014).
11. It is not altogether unusual for even some of our most familiar quotations to be truncated by time
in ways that greatly modify their character. For example, it is not money the Bible claims as the root
of all evil; it’s the love of money. So as not to be guilty of the same sort of error myself, I should note
that the Emerson quote is somewhat longer and substantially more textured than I have reported. In
full, it reads, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and
philosophers and divines.”

Evidence that we are sensitive to our feelings on a topic earlier than our cognitions regarding it
comes from Murphy & Zajonc (1993) and van den Berg et al. (2006). This is not to say that what we
feel about an issue is always different from or always to be trusted more than what we think about it.
However, the data are clear that our emotions and beliefs often do not point in the same direction.
Therefore, in situations involving a commitment likely to have generated supporting rationalizations,
feelings may well provide the truer counsel. This would be especially so when, as in the question of
Sara’s happiness, the issue at hand concerns an emotion (Wilson et al., 1989).
12. My team’s work on a preference for consistency scale and the relationship of age to the
preference for consistency appears in Cialdini, Trost, & Newsom (1995) and Brown, Asher, &
Cialdini (2005), respectively. The analysis of the tapes of scammers attempting to defraud the elderly
is contained in Pratkanis and Shadel’s informative book Weapons of Fraud: A Sourcebook for Fraud
_Fighters (2005). There is good evidence of the tendency of US residents to be individualistic (Santos,_
Varnum, & Grossmann, 2017; Vandello & Cohen, 1999) and that this tendency inclines them toward
consistency with their prior choices (Cialdini et al., 1999; Petrova, Cialdini, & Stills, 2007).

#### Chapter 8: Unity
1. This chapter incorporates and updates some material from my book _Pre-Suasion: A_
_Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade (2016), with permission of the publisher Simon &_
Schuster. Evidence for the multifaceted positive effects of in-group favoritism comes from Guadagno
& Cialdini (2007) and Stallen, Smidts, & Sanfey (2013) for agreement; Foddy, Platow, & Yamagishi
(2009) and Yuki et al. (2005) for trust; Cialdini et al., (1997), De Dreu, Dussel, & Ten Velden (2015),
Gaesser, Shimura, & Cikara (2020), and Greenwald & Pettigrew (2014) for help and liking; Balliet,
Wu, & De Dreu (2014) and Buchan et al. (2011) for cooperation; Westmaas & Silver (2006) for
emotional support; Karremans & Aarts (2007) and Noor et al. (2008) for forgiveness; AdarvesYorno, Haslam, & Postmes (2008) for judged creativity; Gino & Galinsky (2012) and Leach,

-----

Ellemers, & Barreto (2007) for judged morality; and Brandt & Reyna (2011), Haslam (2006), Smith
(2020), and Markowitz & Slovic (2020) for judged humanness. Evidence that in-group favoritism
appears in other primates and among human infants is available in Buttleman & Bohm (2014),
Mahajan et al. (2011), and Over & McCall (2018).
2. The cognitive confusion that arises among the identities of in-group members can be seen in
their tendencies to project their own traits onto those group members (Cadinu & Rothbart, 1996;
DiDonato, Ulrich, & Krueger, 2011), to poorly remember whether they had previously rated traits
belonging to themselves or fellow in-group members (Mashek, Aron, & Boncimino, 2003), and to
take longer to identify differentiating traits between themselves and in-group members (Aron et al.,
1991; Otten & Epstude, 2006; Smith, Coats, & Walling, 1999). The neuroscientific evidence for the
blurring of self and close-other representations locates their common brain sectors and circuits in the
prefrontal cortex (Ames et al., 2008; Kang, Hirsh, & Chasteen, 2010; Cikara & van Bavel, 2014;
Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005; and Volz, Kessler, & von Cramon, 2009). Pfaff (2007, 2015)
introduced the concept of neuronal “cross-excitation.”
