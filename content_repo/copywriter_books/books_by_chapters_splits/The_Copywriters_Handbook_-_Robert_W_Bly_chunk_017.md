### format to suit their objectives. Of course, there’s always the option of using a completely different format, such as a self-mailer or an invoice stuffer.
 The heart of the package is the sales letter. Most of the selling is done in the letter; the brochure is used to highlight sales points, illustrate the product, and provide technical information not appropriate to a letter. There’s an old saying among direct-mail writers: “The letter sells; the brochure tells.”

 SALES LETTER MECHANICS

 It’s easy to begin an ad, because they all follow the same format: headline first, visual that illustrates the headline, and lead paragraph that expands on the headline.
 But the writer has more options with the start of a sales letter. First, there’s the choice of whether to personalize the letter with the individual recipient’s name and address, or send out a form letter.
 To personalize, you use a computer to generate customized letters for each person on the mailing list, and that can be expensive. Personalized letters generally get a better response, as long as they look personally typed and sound personal in tone. Don’t overdo it by repeating the person’s name over and over in the letter (“so, MR. RAYMOND, we have reserved this special offer for you and the whole RAYMOND family…”). This technique sounds insincere; you wouldn’t use the person’s name that often if you were speaking face-to-face.
 Also, avoid the old-fashioned “ink jet” printing systems that produce letters in which the name is obviously inserted into a form letter. The letter should look as if it were typed by hand; you can achieve this effect with a laser printer.
 In many assignments, economy will require that you use preprinted letters. Some advertisers print form letters and then type in each prospect’s name and address (this is the “match and fill” technique). But match and fill is time-consuming, and mailing tests show that match-and-fill letters often don’t pull any better than form letters with headlines running across the top.

### There are exceptions. It pays to personalize sales letters going to existing customers, and also when writing to high-level executives. The bigger the corporation and the higher up the corporate ladder the recipient, the more likely personalization is to pay off.
 Set the letter headline in large, bold typeface, such as 16-point Arial Black. You can place the headline above the salutation, and as an option, you can center the headline and put it in a box to call attention to it. Such a box is called a Johnson Box.
 In some letters, you may decide against a headline and simply start with the salutation: Dear Friend, Dear Reader, Dear Business Executive, Dear Friend of the Smithsonian Institute.
 A salutation that identifies with the reader’s special interest—Dear Farmer, Dear Lawyer, Dear Computer Enthusiast, Dear Future Millionaire —is always better than Dear Sir, Dear Madame, or Dear Friend.
 Sometimes you will use a salutation only. Sometimes, a salutation and a headline. In some cases, a headline without a salutation may be more appropriate.

 15 WAYS TO START YOUR SALES LETTER

 The first sentence of your letter is the most important one. This sentence signals whether there is something of interest in your letter or whether it is worthless junk mail to be thrown away without a second glance. The lead must hook the reader’s attention, but it must also entice him to read further.
 Over the years, letter writers have found that there are certain types of openings that are more effective in direct mail than other types. Here are samples of fifteen of those leads. When you’re struggling with your first letters, turn to these examples for possible ideas on how to structure your own opening.

 1. State the Offer

 The offer consists of the product for sale, its price, the terms of the sale (including discounts), and the guarantee.

-----

### If your offer is particularly attractive, you may make the offer—and not the product or its benefits—the theme of the letter. Here’s how the International Preview Society featured a free ten-day trial offer in a sales letter selling Beethoven CDs:

**Yours FREE for 10 days—**
**the legendary music of Beethoven—**
**Nine Symphonies that epitomize the**
**beauty and harmony denied him in life.**
**Plus FREE Preview bonus.**

Dear Music Lover,

Beethoven. The name alone calls to mind some of the greatest music of the ages …

### The letter writer figured that the reader already appreciated Beethoven, so there was no need to sell her on Beethoven’s symphonies. And it’s hard to sell one set of classical recordings over another based on the orchestra or conductor or the quality of the performance. So the copywriter concentrated on the offer—a free trial plus a free bonus CD—just for accepting the trial offer.
 The headline was typed with an ordinary typewriter font and positioned where the reader’s name and address would normally appear in a personal letter.

 2. Highlight the Free Literature

 Letters that seek to generate inquiries from potential customers usually offer the reader a free brochure, booklet, catalog, or other piece of sales literature. You can increase response by stressing the offer of free literature, and by centering the sales pitch on the benefits of the literature rather than those of the product or service.
 Here’s an example from a letter sent to me by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York:

Dear Friend:
We have reserved for you a free copy of Prentice Hall’s TAX-SAVING STRATEGIES, a helpful
book for Corporate Executives and Professionals. It contains practical, timely, and useful ways

-----

for you to maximize the value of your deductions and save dollars.

### 3. Make an Announcement

 If you have something new to announce—a special offer, a new product, a new club, a one-of-a-kind event—start your letter with this important news, as in this letter from Calhoun’s Collectors Society:

In the world of U.S. stamps, there is only one name older than that of the Federal Bureau of
Engraving and Printing itself. The revered house of Scott—known since 1863 as the ultimate
authority on American philately.

Now, for the first time ever, Scott’s stamp experts have selected the subjects to be
commemorated in a limited philatelic edition that is unprecedented in collecting annals.

### 4. Tell a Story

 Copy written in story format has great reader appeal. First, it creates empathy with the reader. By telling a story that relates to the reader’s own situation, you build a bridge between the reader’s needs and your sales pitch. Second, people are familiar with stories and enjoy reading them. The news they get from newspapers, magazines, and television is related to them in narrative form. Stories hold their interest and get them to read letters they might otherwise put aside.
 A subscription letter for Inc. magazine begins with the story of a man who quit his job to become an entrepreneur—a move many of us with corporate positions may daydream of now and then.

Dear Executive,
Three years ago this month, a man I know—he was then a vice president of a big corporation
in Illinois—walked into his boss’s office and handed in his resignation.

Two weeks later, he started his own company.
The man had everything going for him. He was smart, he was energetic, he was dedicated,
and he knew his particular field inside out.

Almost from the start, the new company caught on. It grew quickly, adding new customers,
new employees, new equipment.

But then, about a year ago, the picture began to change. Orders were still coming in, but the
company was stumbling. Things went steadily from bad to worse until …

A week ago Friday, that man—who had started out on his own with such high hopes just
three years before—was forced to go out of business. His company closed its doors for good.

What happened? What went wrong? Could it have been avoided? How?…

-----

### This story holds our attention because it could happen to us someday. We want to know what went wrong and how Inc. magazine can help us avoid the same mistakes.

 5. Flatter the Reader

 One reason many people take a negative view toward direct mail is that they know it isn’t really personal. They know they are just one of thousands of people whose names the advertiser obtained from a mailing list.
 But you can turn this fact to your advantage by using flattery. Tell the reader, “Yes, I got your name from a list. Yes, you’re part of that group. But that group is special; the people in it have superior characteristics that set them apart from the crowd. And you’re superior, too. That’s why I’m writing to you.”
 There is flattery in the opening of a letter from the Maserati Import Company, a seller of luxury automobiles:

Dear Mr. McCoy:
One of a kind. Is that phrase a little trite?

I used to think so until I tried to find you.
Now I know what “one of a kind” really means.
The process of finding your name and address was the advertising equivalent of panning for
gold.…

### The letter goes on to offer the reader a free bottle of French champagne if he will test-drive a Maserati luxury sedan.

 6. Write to the Reader Peer-to-Peer

 The logic here is that people in special-interest groups—and most direct mail is aimed at narrow groups of prospects—will be more receptive to a sales pitch from a peer than from an outsider.
 So a letter aimed at farmers should be signed by a farmer. And it should be written in the plain, straightforward language of one farmer talking to another.

-----

### With this approach, the writer can achieve empathy with the reader by saying, “Look … I am like you. I know your problems. I’ve been through them myself. And I’ve found a solution. You can trust me.”
 In a subscription letter for Writer’s Digest, the pitch is made by one writer talking to other writers:

Dear Writer:
I don’t have the great American novel in me.

I flunked Poetry 102 in college. My first, last, and only short story was rejected by 14
magazines.…

### 7. A Personal Message from the President

 In direct mail, the owner or manager of a business can talk directly with his or her customers.
 Customers like dealing with the person in charge. When the top person in your company signs the letter, it makes the reader feel important. And having the owner’s signature on the advertising adds a bit more credibility to the message. (I’ve often heard people say of such mail, “Well, he wouldn’t sign it if it wasn’t true.”)
 FutureSoft begins a mailer on its Quickpro software package with a letter from the company president:

Personal Message to Microcomputer Owners from Joseph W. Tamargo, President of
FUTURESOFT …
I want to tell you why I have chosen to send you an actual condensation of the Operating
Instructions of our exciting and unique QUICKPRO, which writes programs for you.

### Another example, this one from John L. Blair, president of the New Process Company, a mail-order clothing manufacturer:

Dear Mr. Bly:
A memo recently crossed my desk that said I would have to RAISE MY PRICES—NOW—to
offset our spiraling operating costs!

But I said, “NO! NOT YET!”
I know that customers like you, Mr. Bly, expect the BEST VALUE for their money when
they shop at NPC. And that’s why I’m going to hold the line on higher prices just as long as I
possibly can!…

-----

### 8. Use a Provocative Quote

 The quote should contain news or a startling statistic or fact, or say something outrageous. The quote must be like the lead of a news story—it must raise a question or arouse curiosity to make the reader want to read the body of the letter to find out more.
 In a letter selling a book on advertising, Prentice Hall began with a quotation taken directly from the book itself:

Advertising agencies and other consultants score something on the order of a 9 on my LeastNeeded scale of 1-to-10.…

This is what Lewis Kornfeld has to say, based on his extraordinary success as Radio Shack’s
master marketer for over 30 years.

### 9. Ask a Question

 Question leads are effective when the answer to the question is interesting or important to the reader, or when the question arouses genuine curiosity.

 Here are a few examples of letters that lead with a question:

Dear Friend,
What do you think when you see a letter that starts with “Dear Friend” … a letter from
someone you’ve never met?

WHAT DO JAPANESE MANAGERS HAVE THAT AMERICAN MANAGERS
SOMETIMES LACK?

Dear Mr. Blake:
Is freelance a dirty word to you? It really shouldn’t be …

### 10. Make It Personal

 The most personal direct-mail piece I ever received began as follows:

Dear Friend,
As you may already know, we have been doing some work for people who have the same last
name as you do. Finally, after months of work, THE AMAZING STORY OF THE BLYS IN
AMERICA is ready for print and you are in it!

-----

### This letter is highly personal for two reasons. First, my name appears several times in the body of the letter. Second, the product is designed especially for me, a Bly. (But the letter is weakened by the stock opening “Dear Friend.” A better salutation is the more personal “Dear Friend Bly.”)
 Personalized mail usually gets more attention than form letters. So whenever possible, make it personal. Insert the reader’s name in the copy once or twice (if your budget allows for computer letters). And, more important, make sure the copy speaks to the needs, interests, and ego of the reader (as a book called The Amazing Story of the Blys in America has strong appeal to people named Bly).

 11. Identify the Reader’s Problem

 If your product or service solves a problem, you can create a strong sales letter by featuring the problem in the lead, then telling how the product or service solves the problem.
 There are two advantages to this technique. First, it selects a specific group of readers for your letter. (Only single people will respond to a letter that begins, “Are You Sick and Tired of Paying Extra Taxes Just Because You Aren’t Married?”)
 Second, the format shows in a clear and direct manner how the product solves the reader’s problem. When you start with the problem, the natural next step is to talk about the solution.
 Manhattan dentist Dr. Brian E. Weiss used this technique in a letter inviting me in for an appointment:

Dear Mr. Bly:
You know how difficult it is to look your best if dental problems are causing discomfort and
pain or if the appearance of your teeth needs improvement.

Have you been putting off a dental checkup or consultation on an existing problem? This
note may encourage you to take the important step to help yourself feel better by making a
dental appointment.…

### Politician Jim Thompson used the technique in a campaign letter aimed at voters in Chicago:

-----

Dear Mrs. Vanderbilt:
If you can’t afford higher taxes.

If you’re afraid to walk the streets at night.
If you’re sick and tired of corrupt government officials.
If your children aren’t getting the education they deserve.
Then you don’t need a Governor appointed by Chicago’s City Hall.…

### 12. Stress a Benefit

 A straightforward presentation of a benefit can outpull other techniques if the benefit is significant and has strong appeal to the reader.
 A sales letter from Prentice Hall offering a new book on advertising began with the headline, “Just published … HOW TO MAKE YOUR ADVERTISING MAKE MONEY. A clear, concise guide to effective advertising…” The headline is effective because it’s safe to assume that all advertising professionals who receive the letter want to create more effective advertising.
 To get results, a benefit-oriented headline must appeal to the reader’s self-interest. As Cahners Publishing points out in its booklet, “How to Create and Produce Successful Direct Mail,” “Don’t tell your prospect about your grass seed, tell him about his lawn.”

 13. Use Human Interest

 People enjoy reading about other people, especially about people who have anxieties, fears, problems, and interests similar to their own.
 Some of the strongest sales letters center around powerful, dramatic human interest stories. The readers get hooked because the events in the story relate somehow to their own lives. And the letter leaves more of an impression because it deals with human emotions, not just technical product features or abstract sales arguments.
 The publisher of Cardiac Alert newsletter used an autobiographical approach to add human interest to a sales letter asking for subscriptions to his publication. The headline read:

**When I was 16, my father died of a heart attack …**

### You can’t help but be interested in the letter that follows.

 14. Let the Reader In on Some Inside Information

 When a consumer sees your ad in a magazine, he knows he is sharing your message with tens of thousands of other people. But he has no way of knowing whether you’ve sent the sales letter he received to thousands of prospects, or just a select few.
 Direct mail is an excellent medium for appealing to the reader’s need to feel special, important, exclusive. And nothing is more exclusive than revealing some inside information on a sale or product that others don’t know about.
 Here’s exclusive news from a cover letter mailed along with a reprint of a magazine ad:

Here’s a fresh-from-the-printer reprint of our latest WALL STREET JOURNAL ad …

We’ll be running the ad in June because we want potential customers to know more about
our latest financial planning services.

But, as someone we’ve done business with before, we consider YOU even more important
than the “new business” out there.
