##### I received a call one day from a very sensuous-sounding young woman who called herself Ginger. She started the conversation with: “Mr. Sugarman, I love you.”
 I was a little taken aback and at first thought that this was a practical joke. “Thank you,” I responded. “I love you, too.”
 “No, I’m serious,” continued the woman. “I’ve been reading your advertisements for the past five years and I love your mind, I love your thought process and I love your creative personality. I really believe that I can tell a great deal about you from what you write and I really believe in you and truly love you.”
 I was surprised and then flattered. Even before I received her call, I had gotten comments from people who claimed that my personality really came through in my copy. And I believed it.
 If you are dishonest, it is sensed by the reader. If you are hiding something about a product you are describing, it comes through. If you’re very creative, it, too, is picked up. And it is the combination of all of these impressions that creates the buying environment that we referred to in Chapter 6.
 If you study the copy of others, you can sense what they are like from their copy. You’ll be amazed at how the copy reflects the personality of the person writing it. Any copywriter working for a CEO of a company will try to reflect the personality of the CEO and not him- or herself. Since I’m the guy who writes all the copy, you can pretty well tell a lot about my personality. But back to Ginger.

# An Invitation I Couldn’t Refuse

##### Was Ginger just flattering me or did she have an emotional attachment to me personally without having met me—strictly from reading my copy? She continued.
 “Mr. Sugarman, you are the only one who could help me. I need your help. Please, may I have an appointment to see you, privately? I promise you that you’ll be very glad to see me.”
 When she arrived at my office I could see what she meant when she said that I’d be glad to see her. She was a beautiful blonde with long legs and a miniskirt so short I was embarrassed to have her sit down. “Mr. Sugarman, may I call you Joe?”
 “Sure,” I replied, looking away as she adjusted her skirt. “Joe, I want to be very frank with you. I have admired your copywriting for years. I’m not even into electronics and gadgets but I enjoy so much what you do in print that quite frankly I have a real emotional attachment to you. I know this sounds silly but when I got in trouble, I couldn’t think of anybody else who could help me but you. I really need you.”
 She paused for a moment as if to hold back tears. She then continued. “I run a beauty shop in a shopping center. I know that when the shopping center is full, I get a percentage of that traffic and they buy my cosmetics. I also know that when the shopping center is empty, I get a smaller number of people who come to my store. It’s almost directly proportional to the traffic in the shopping center.
 “So Joe, when I decided to offer my cosmetics in a direct mailing, I thought that if I sent out 50,000 mailing pieces, I would get a certain percentage of response and I would make a profit. All I needed was half a percent return rate to make a nice profit.
 “I then invested all the money I had to get this 50,000-piece mailing out. I borrowed from my friends. When I launched the mailing, the results were so bad I couldn’t believe it. I ended up with one-tenth of what I needed to break even. I need you to look over my mailing piece and just tell me what went wrong with it. And Joe, if you could help me get it to work, I’d be extremely grateful.”

# What Was Her Angle?

##### Was I being propositioned in return for my help? Was this all a ploy or a guilt trip to get me to write her next mailing piece? I was a happily married man with two children and quite busy running my own business. And quite frankly, I didn’t like the idea of somebody trying to use guilt or sex or anything else to entice me to write copy or do a mailing piece. Still somewhat reserved, I said, “Show me the mailing piece.”
 Ginger reached for her purse, which was on the floor, and as she reached, she exposed even more of her legs. I was convinced she was in my office to seduce me. No question about it now. I was convinced that she was determined to entice me into writing copy for her. But I wondered how far she would go. I was soon to find out.
 She pulled out her mailing piece and handed it to me. I examined it for a few minutes, read the copy and studied the entire package. I also asked her which mailing list she used. “From the entire local area served by the beauty shop,” she said.
 I looked at the mailing again and saw many problems. She was using a mail-in offer yet her mailing list was not oriented toward mail order buyers —just the retail community—so it was no wonder her mailing didn’t work. Even the copy in the letter was very poorly written. It was a horrible presentation. It wasn’t that it looked bad, but it violated many of the principles I discuss in this book and some that apply to direct mail. I told her the presentation was not very good and that I wasn’t surprised that the piece did so badly.
 You already know the principles on traffic. You already know from previous examples that unless the recipients read all of her copy, the mailing most likely won’t work. Of course, she also used the wrong mailing list and that didn’t help, either.

# I Explained the Problems

##### After I explained to Ginger the problems with her mailing piece and mailing list, I brought out another very important fact about direct response advertising. “You can’t spend that kind of money without testing. That’s one of your problems, too. You just mailed to too big a list. You could have picked just 5,000 names and not 50,000 names for your mailing. And then you would have known if the mailing was successful without risking too much money.”
 I finished talking and there was a short pause. As she looked straight into my eyes, she said, “Can you help me? I mean really help me? Like write the copy for the mailing piece, help me pick the proper list and guide me as my mentor?”
 Since I was a little turned off by Ginger’s use of sex and guilt to get me to do her piece, I responded, “Ginger, I really don’t have the time. Plus, I have established a seminar in the north woods of Wisconsin where I take 20 people and teach them as a group. I just don’t have the time to help you on an individual basis.”

# A Shock I Never Expected

##### What Ginger whispered to me next took me totally by surprise. In fact, there have been very few times in my life when I have been at a complete loss for words. But wait. This is a book on copywriting and not about the secret goings-on behind the doors of successful direct marketing executives who are perceived by beautiful cosmetic executives as the answer to their dreams. “Aw shucks,” you’re probably saying. “Why doesn’t he finish the damn story and tell us what happened?”
 Okay, I will. But not here. I want you to continue uninterrupted with my thought process on copywriting, so I have devoted Appendix B on page 319 to the rest of the story—an episode that actually took place in my office and that could be part of a very steamy novel.
 Once you understand the concept of traffic in retailing and how it relates to direct marketing, then you should realize how important the slippery slide concept is in getting the reader to read the entire text of your ad. And one of the most powerful techniques to keep your slippery slide greased is the use of seeds of curiosity. Your readers must get into your copy. They must read your headline and be so compelled to read further that they read your subheadline. Then they must be so moved that they read your first sentence. And the rest of the copy must be so compelling that by the time your prospects read 50 percent of your ad, they are helplessly caught in a slippery slide and can’t escape.
 Once you understand the slippery slide and the seeds of curiosity, you will have two of the most powerful copywriting tools you can use.

 Axiom 8

**_Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity._**

# Chapter 11

 Copy as Emotion

##### Up to now we have covered some general principles of copywriting. You learned that all the elements of an advertisement are designed to get prospects to read the first sentence, and we showed you how to get them to start reading your copy by creating a very simple first sentence. And then we told you how important it is to get the second sentence read and the third and so forth. We mentioned nothing about benefits or features of a product because the sole purpose of the copy was to first get people to read the copy. The benefits come later.
 And then we covered the environment you create at the beginning of your copy. We explained the importance of resonating with your reader by getting the reader to say yes, believe you or agree with your assumptions.
 We expressed the importance of the reader slipping through your copy as if on a slippery slide—reading the copy so they can traffic your ad—and we gave the example of Ginger and her failed mailing. And we just showed you how seeds of curiosity work to keep the slippery slide fully greased.

# You’ve Learned Most of My
 Concept

##### Armed with the above principles, you have a major portion of the overall philosophy of my copywriting concept. There are only a few more points to learn to have the complete foundation upon which you can build your skills and write great copy.
 I can still remember the first seminar when I taught these same philosophies. At the end of the course, a Texas farmer named Frank Schultz, inspired by the seminar, shut himself in a room at the nearby Holiday Inn motel and wrote his first ad for the grapefruit he wanted to sell nationally in a print campaign in major magazines.
 His very first space ad was so powerful that it sold more fruit than he could pick and ship. He received letters from other prominent copywriters congratulating him on his simple yet beautiful ad. We’ll study that ad in Chapter 24, but if knowledge of the principles I teach can make a Texas farmer a great copywriter, it can do the same for you.

# Emotion in Advertising

##### This chapter is about emotion in advertising. And there are just three points to remember about the subject.
 Emotion Principle 1: Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story. Emotion Principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions. Emotion Principle 3: You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic. Let’s take the last point first. Why do you think people buy the Mercedes- Benz automobile in the United States? Is it because of the rack and pinion steering or the antilock braking system or the safety features? Other cars have the same features, so why spend a fortune to buy one when, for a fraction of the cost of a Mercedes, you can get an American or Japanese car or even a Volvo that has many of the exact same features?
 The answer: We buy on emotion and justify with logic. I know that when I first bought a Mercedes and my friends saw it, I told them that the reason I bought it was because of a series of technical features that I found very impressive. The real reason I bought the car was not for the technical features at all. I wanted to own a prestigious car and belong to the crowd that drove a Mercedes. But when I had to explain the reason for my purchase, I ended up using logic—something that I really believed was correct when I used it.

# Mercedes Advertising

##### Look at a Mercedes ad. Since the Mercedes advertising agency knows the real motivation behind the purchase of their cars, they focus on the reasons people use to justify their purchase. All their ads talk about the terrific drive you get or the technical features that make the car a breed apart. In reality, feature by feature, there is nothing so revolutionary that it can’t be duplicated in a less expensive car. The car is sold by virtue of its emotional appeal and then justified in its advertising by an appeal to logic.
 Look at the emotion of a message conveyed in the form of a song. The music is like the vibration or that special harmony that you work at creating in an advertising message. If the music appeals to the audience and their soul, they are really set up to receive the sales message—or in the case of a song, the words, which incidentally also have an attached emotion. A song is similar to an advertisement.
 Take a song and say the words without the music and it may sound rather funny. Steve Allen back in the 1950s on The Tonight Show would recite the words of a number one hit song and get lots of laughs reciting, “Ooh pappa doo pappa doo pappa woo. I love you. Ooh pappa doo da ditty.” Without the music, the words sounded absolutely ridiculous.

# Logic Often Doesn’t Work

##### In writing copy for an advertisement, often you get your reader in an emotional frame of mind as a result of the environment you have created, and logic becomes less important. For example, I’ve always used the phrase near the end of my ads, “If you aren’t absolutely satisfied, return your product within 30 days for a prompt and courteous refund.” Who ever heard of a refund being courteous? It doesn’t matter. The emotion or the feel of that phrase really says that we are a very respectful and understanding company that will return your money very promptly. With very few words, I conveyed the feeling of being a concerned company that acts promptly. And even though the phrase makes no logical sense, it has been picked up by several direct marketers and used in their catalogs and print ads.
 Often, a phrase or sentence or even a premise does not have to be correct logically. As long as it conveys the message emotionally, it not only does the job, but does it more effectively than the logical message.
 A good example of this was an ad I wrote for a device that had a breakthrough digital calculator display. The new display showed both alphabetical and numeric characters. And because it had such a large memory, you could use it to hold the phone numbers of your friends along with their names.
 At the time I had two competitors who got hold of the product first and came out with advertisements—both of which failed. There were several reasons they failed, but one of the main reasons was the way they pitched the product—on a logical level. They tried to explain what the term alphanumeric meant in a display and how much memory the unit had. The ad was filled with facts and logic, and because it was such a new breakthrough product you would think it would sell just based on logic. It didn’t.
 On a lark, I decided to sell a similar product myself in my catalog. Canon Corporation had approached me and told me that if I took their product, they would give me an exclusive for several months as long as I advertised it nationally.

##### I first tested the ad in my catalog and came up with the headline “Pocket Yellow Pages” with the subheadline being “Let your fingers do the data entry with America’s first computerized pocket telephone directory.” Now listen to the emotional version of the copy.
 You’re stuck. You’re at a phone booth trying to find a phone number, and people are waiting. You feel the pressure. To the startled eyes of those around you, you pull out your calculator, press a few buttons, and presto—the phone number appears on the display of your calculator. A dream? Absolutely not.
