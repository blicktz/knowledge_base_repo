A useful schedule has all project tasks and milestones (e.g., “first draft of white paper”), their due dates, and the people responsible.
 Most white paper campaigns have multiple components and involve multiple contributors, reviewers, and approvers. Without a project schedule, including the tasks, steps involved in the task, the person responsible for each step, and the date the step must be completed, the likelihood of timely completion is remote.

 STEP EIGHT: BUDGET

 Budget is simply what the campaign will cost. To make a budget, you first make a list of the campaign deliverables.
 For the white paper, your costs are copywriting, design, and—if it is a hard copy document—printing and binding.
 There is also the cost of inquiry fulfillment, which refers to sending prospects who respond to the mailing the bait piece and other materials they

### requested. When you automatically fulfill requests for your white paper by sending a PDF via autoresponder, inquiry fulfillment is close to free.
 However, don’t forget to factor in the cost of your marketing campaign. Just because it is mainly digital doesn’t mean it’s free.
 On the contrary, digital marketing can in fact be relatively expensive. Your spending on banner ads, Google ads, Facebook ads, e-mails to rented lists can easily run into thousands of dollars a month, per week, or even a day.

 STEP NINE: METRICS

 Determine your goals. Key metrics for white paper marketing campaigns include:

 Click-through rates to the white paper landing page. Conversion rates of click to white paper downloads. Inquiries from white paper recipients via e-mail or phone. Number of white paper recipients who are qualified prospects for the product. Percentage of white paper recipients who make a purchase.

 BLOGS

 Blogging, which in its most basic form is journaling online—although it has farther-reaching ramifications—has gained national prominence over the past two decades.
 According to SoftwareFindr, there are more than half a billion blogs on the Web. Techjury reports that 77 percent of Internet users read blogs, and that adding a blog to your existing Web site can increase traffic by as much as 434 percent.[5]
 Search engines like content, and when you blog, you’re posting lots of new content to your Web site on a regular basis. Adding an active blog to your Web site will almost surely boost your search engine rankings.

-----

### Unlike articles and white papers, which are traditionally one-way communications (you write it, your subscribers read it), blogs are a two- way online medium, a means of starting a lively conversation about an interesting topic.
 One effective blogging technique is to make a strong statement in your post, and then ask the reader for a response (e.g., I often end my posts with a question such as “What do you think?”). Another blogging technique that stimulates conversation is to withhold your opinion but ask readers for theirs.
 If you are discussing an article you or another source has already published, be sure to put a reference to the original article in your blog post. Hyperlink that reference to the actual article online, if it’s available.
 Many business blogs are written in the voice of a single author who becomes familiar to the readership over time, building a relationship and trust.
 Where appropriate, hyperlink a sentence or two in your posts to relevant material such as articles or Web sites covering the same topic as the post.
 According to Orbit Media, the average blog post is about a thousand words and takes more than three hours to write. Your blog should have at least one new post per week.[6]
 There are many blogging platforms. WordPress, an open-source software platform, is the most commonly used platform for creating blogs, and some hosts will set that up for you with just one click. WordPress comes with free and paid themes, but also check out others that can be used. For WordPress, there is the downloadable version you can get for free at WordPress.org. If you go this route, then make sure your hosting company supports the WordPress platform, and most do.
 The other version is found at WordPress.com, where WordPress hosts your blogging page, but is very minimal in terms of extending it farther. Extra purchase options are a custom domain name and added storage. You cannot use advertising platforms, such as Google AdSense.
 You will also run across the term “WordPress Theme Frameworks,” which means that the WordPress version you downloaded from WordPress.org has been taken by a company of developers and recoded to

 CASE STUDIES

 According to copywriter Heather Sloan, case studies are often more effective than brochures and traditional sales collateral. Why?
 “Everyone loves a story,” explains Heather. “Never did this wisdom ring truer than in sales conversations and marketing pieces. Stories paint pictures. Stories evoke emotions. Stories are memorable. Stories give your presentations sticking power. The easiest way to tell a marketing story is by case study.”
 A case study is a product success story. It tells how a company solved a problem using a specific product, process, method, or idea. As with other marketing techniques, case studies fluctuate in popularity: while almost any company can profitably market with case studies, an informal survey of B2B Web sites shows that most companies don’t take full advantage of the power of case study marketing.
 While case studies need not adhere to any one formula, here are some guidelines.
 The average case study is relatively brief: one or two sides of an 8½ x 11–inch page, or approximately 800 to 1,500 words. More complex or in- depth case studies can run 2,000 to 2,500 words.
 An effective case study makes the reader want to learn more about the product it features. It’s a soft-sell proposition designed to compel your prospects to request more detailed information. If you’ve mirrored the readers’ problem successfully, the case study will propel them deeper into the sales funnel and closer to buying.
 For the most part, case studies are not overly technical: they are written in a style similar to that of a magazine feature article. The intent of a case study is not to present in-depth minutiae and analytical data, but to briefly describe how a product or service can effectively address and solve a particular problem.

-----

### You needn’t be creative or reinvent the wheel when creating a case study. Most case studies follow some variation of this time-tested outline:

 1—Who is the customer? 2—What was the problem? How was it hurting the customer’s business? 3—What solutions did they look at and ultimately reject, and why? 4—Why did they choose our product as the solution? 5—Describe the implementation of the product, including any problems
 and how they were solved. 6—How and where does the customer use the product? 7—What are the results and benefits they are getting? 8—Would they recommend it to others and why?

 “We don’t have formal guidelines for case studies,” said Mark Rosenzweig, the former editor of Chemical Processing, a trade publication that has been running case study articles for decades. “Generally we’re looking for a relatively recent installation, say within the last two years, of innovative technology. What issues prompted the installation? What did it involve? What results have been achieved? We’re generally looking for 1,500 to 2,000 words.”
 Because case studies are presented in a story format, readers are naturally more inclined to take an interest—especially if the story has some sort of benefit to them. Unlike sales presentations, case studies are all about showing how a product or service works, rather than telling. Since the product benefits are extolled by an actual user—and not the manufacturer— the claims are more believable.
 By using a satisfied customer as an example, a case study essentially demonstrates how well your product works. Rather than present a pile of facts and figures, you tell an engaging story that vividly shows your product’s effectiveness.
 An equally strong selling point is the level of empathy a case study creates between your prospects and your satisfied customers. People tend to identify with people like themselves. Prospects feel far more at ease

-----

### listening to their peers. They relate better, because they often share the same issues and problems.
 Readers also believe case studies more than other sales literature. They are skeptical of ads and find brochures full of puffery, and even podcasts and company blogs can seem self-serving. But in a case study, a customer who has no motive or financial incentive to praise the product does so, creating instant credibility.
 A survey by Forrester Research Inc. shows that 71 percent of buyers base their decisions on trust and believability. Relating your customers’ positive experiences with your product is one of the best ways to establish credibility in the marketplace. Giving your customers confidence in what you’re offering dramatically increases the likelihood they’ll do business with you.
 One of the best sources of candidates for case studies is the sales force. However, salespeople prefer to spend their time selling. They are often indifferent to marketing communications and view participating in case studies as an aggravation with no direct reward to them.
 You can get salespeople excited about finding case study candidates by offering them tangible incentives: the sales rep gets cash, merchandise, or a travel incentive if her candidate is chosen and profiled in a case study. When offered a nice incentive, the sales force suddenly gets excited about the case study candidate search. The incentive does not have to be huge, but it should be desirable—a new iPod, for example.
 To prepare the case study, a writer interviews the person in the customer organization who is most involved in the application. For a small business, this may be the owner; for a larger company, it could be a plant manager or engineer. Before the writer calls, the vendor salesperson or account manager handling that customer should call and make sure the customer is willing and even eager to participate. Case studies written about reluctant or hostile users are difficult to create and rarely successful.
 During the interview, get as many good quotations as possible. Use these quotations in the case study text and attribute them to the person being interviewed.

-----

### Reason: the quotations in published case studies can do double duty as testimonials.
 Tip: If the subject is not saying exactly what you want him to say, use the “So are you saying” technique. Say to the subject, “So are you saying that…” followed by the statement you want him to make. If he answers “yes, that’s what I am saying,” you can attribute your phrasing to the subject.
 Often prospects are vague with their answers, and it is up to the interviewer/writer to wring the specifics out of the interview. Whenever possible, get the subject to give you numbers, so claims and results can be specific.
 For instance, if the subject says the product reduces energy costs, but can’t say by how much, pin him down: “Did it reduce energy consumption more than 10 percent? More than 100 percent?” He will give you a guesstimate, which you can use as an approximate figure (i.e., “The XYZ system reduced plant energy consumption by over 10 percent”).
 Before the case study can be released, the subject of the case study must approve and sign off on it. Keep these releases on file. If the subject takes a job with a different company, you may lose track of him. So you can’t afford to lose track of his signed permission form. Otherwise, if your authorization to use the case study is questioned, and you can’t produce a signed release, you may have to remove that case study from your site.
 Ask subjects of case studies whether they are willing to serve as reference accounts. That way, a prospect whose needs relate to a particular case study can in fact speak with the product user featured in that case study. Check your reference account list periodically to make sure names and numbers are current; update as needed.

## GETTING YOUR COPY WRITTEN

### If you’re a business owner or employer who doesn’t write copy, today there are multiple options for getting your copy written. Some have been actively used for decades. Others were infrequent when I started forty years ago, but have exploded in popularity. A handful, most technology driven, are relatively new. In this chapter, we explore the options and how to best take advantage of each.

 OPTION #1: WRITE YOUR OWN COPY

 Back in the day, many clients wrote their own copy for these primary reasons:

 They already had a deep understanding of their product and their markets, and found it easier to use that market and product knowledge to write their own copy, rather than take the time to explain it to a copywriter who was not as conversant in their business. Clients did not value copywriting as a specialized skill. They believed everyone can write. So why not write their own copy instead of paying a copywriter? The copy that came back from the professional copywriters they hired was not exactly as the client would have written it, or else contained mistakes ranging from technical errors to sales appeals that missed the

-----

### mark. And they found it a frustrating nuisance to direct the copywriter to write the ad exactly as they themselves would have done.

 In fact, you know your market and product better than outside writers and agencies. And some clients, especially today, when a plethora of copywriting courses are available, can gain considerable copywriting chops. For many of these copy-competent clients, they find that the best option is to write some of the copy themselves and assign other projects to staff or freelance writers.
 As a rule of thumb, the copy-competent client may choose to write his own copy when:

 The product is highly technical and requires specialized background (e.g., an engineering degree) to understand. The client feels in the time it would take to bring a writer up to speed, he could write it himself. He wants it written in his “voice” and doubts that a writer could capture that voice.

 The copy-competent clients may prefer to outsource the writing of a promotion when:

 The client doesn’t have time to write the copy. The client does not have the desire to write the copy. The client feels his time is better spent on other tasks.

 OPTION #2: OUTSOURCE

 Many clients, however, either can’t write their own copy, do not want to write copy, or do not have time to do so, and know they should instead focus on their core competencies—whether that’s machine learning or circuit design. These clients often hire outside copywriters, either freelancers or agencies, for several reasons.

-----

### First, writing copy takes time. And busy executives realize that writing copy is not the highest and best use of their time.
 Some view writing as an unwholesome mental chore to be avoided at all costs; it’s just not in their wheelhouse.
 Third, they find that professional writers produce superior copy. This should neither surprise them nor give them an inferiority complex. Think of it this way. I write copy sixty hours a week and have been doing so for forty years. For that reason, I’m probably a little bit better than most business owners and managers who have many other responsibilities and tasks to juggle.
 A “little bit better” may not seem like much. But when promoting a consumer e-commerce product online, raising the conversion rate only a few percentage points can, in my experience, increase gross revenues by many hundreds of thousands of dollars or even more.
 Writing in PR Daily, Jake Herway gives these tips on how clients can work more effectively with freelancers and independent contractors:[1]

 Consistently clarify expectations. Orient freelancers and their peers to the larger purpose and the goal. Give freelancers opportunities to communicate with client staff members to enhance productivity and build rapport.

 OPTION #3: INSOURCE

 Insourcing means you assign the copy to various people employed full-time at the company, typically those working in a marketing communications function. But some clients recruit others, including technical writers, public relations specialists, and sometimes engineers.
 Unlike when hiring freelancers, who get a briefing, go away, and come back with a first draft, there are three advantages to insourcing.
 First, while a freelancer may be working on half a dozen projects, the staff writer can be assigned 100 percent to yours.
 Second, insourced writers have easier access to subject matter experts. These SMEs often have offices right down the hall. And some can enrich

-----

### your knowledge by sharing their own stories, views, and specialized expertise that may not be in the copy briefing. They can also review your draft in progress and give you important direction on here that may be reflected throughout the rest of the piece.
 Third, most freelance copywriters sit alone in a room and write. Many corporations have multiple copywriters on staff. Members of the copywriting team can lend a helping hand to one another, from reading and reviewing rough drafts to helping one another come up with fresh campaign ideas.
 The primary reasons many businesses today outsource their copy despite the above factors are these: (a) many business owners do believe copywriters possess specialized skills that result in high response rates and (b) they can easily test this outside copy against copy written by other sources. In some cases, they may test the new copy against the copy they already have been using to determine whether the fresh copy in fact produces improved results.
