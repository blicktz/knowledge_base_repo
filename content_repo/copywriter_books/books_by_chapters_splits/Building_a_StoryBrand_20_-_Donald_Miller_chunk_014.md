Go to StoryBrand.AI and either create a BrandScript or log in to your existing
BrandScript.
Either alone or with a team, brainstorm the simple steps a customer would need
to take to do business with you (either a pre- or post-purchase process plan or a
combination of both).
What fears do your customers have related to your industry? What agreements
could you make with your customers that would alleviate those fears?
Do you share unique values with your customers? Can those values be spelled
out in an agreement plan?
Write the steps (and name) of your process plan on your StoryBrand
BrandScript. If you’re creating an agreement plan, simply use the notes section
of your BrandScript to capture the agreement you’ll be making with your
customers.
