The meeting At the meeting when you make your presentation, don’t sit the client’s team on one side of the table and your team opposite, like adversaries. Mix everybody up.
 Rehearse before the meeting, but never speak from a prepared text; it locks you into a position which may become irrelevant during the meeting.
 Above all, listen. The more you get the prospective client to talk, the easier it will be to decide whether you really want his account. A former head of Magnavox treated me to a two-hour lecture on advertising, about which he knew nothing. I gave him a cup of tea and showed him out.
 Tell your prospective client what your weak points are, before he notices them. This will make you more credible when you boast about your strong points.
 Don’t get bogged down in case histories or research numbers. They put prospects to sleep. No manufacturer ever hired an agency because it increased market-share for somebody else.
 The day after a new business presentation, send the prospect a three-page letter summarizing the reasons why he should pick your

###### agency. This will help him make the right decision.
 If you are too feeble to get accounts under your own steam, you can buy them – by buying agencies. But this practice has a way of back�ring. Adolph Toigo used it to quintuple the billings of Lennen & Newell, but he was unable to weld his acquisitions into a cohesive body. The result was a quarrelsome confederation which ended in bankruptcy.

 Credit risks Watch out for credit risks. Your pro�t margin is too slim to survive a prospective client’s bankruptcy. When in doubt, I always ask the head of the incumbent agency.
 Never pay a commission to an outsider who o�ers to introduce new business. No client who chooses his agency on the basis of such an introduction is worth having; and there is usually dirty work at the crossroads. Six weeks after I started my agency, I was so desperate for business that I o�ered a young man of my acquaintance 10 per cent of our stock if he brought in a vacuum- cleaner account which he had in his pocket. If he had accepted my o�er, his stock in Ogilvy & Mather would now be worth $19,000,000. A lucky escape.
 Some years later, when I was older and wiser, Ben Sonnenberg, the public-relations operator, asked me what percentage of our stock I would give him if he steered the Greyhound Bus account to us. When I said zero, he thought I was mad.
 Avoid clients whose ethos is incompatible with yours. I refused Charles Revson of Revlon and Lew Rosenstiel of Schenley.
 Beware of ventures which spend little or nothing today but might become major advertisers, if all goes well. Servicing such non- accounts can be expensive, and few of them make it. Yes, there are exceptions. I once made the mistake of turning down a small company which made o�ce machinery, because I had never heard of it. The name was Xerox.

###### The di�erences between agencies are less than they like to believe. Most of them can show that they have produced advertising that increased sales for some of their clients. Most have competent media departments and research departments. Thanks to in�ation, almost all of them have grown in billings. So what’s the di�erence between them?
 Very often the decisive di�erence in new business contests is the personality of the head of the agency. Many clients went to Foote, Cone & Belding because they were impressed by Fax Cone’s style. Conversely, many failures to win accounts are caused by the fact that the prospective client �nds the head of the agency obnoxious. My personality has lost some contests and won others.

 Aside: I have resigned accounts �ve times as often as I have been �red, and always for the same reason: the client’s behavior was eroding the morale of the people working on his account. Erosion of morale does unacceptable damage to an agency.

 Getting multinational accounts If you get an account which also advertises in overseas markets, you stand a good chance of getting it around the world. I call this the domino system of new business acquisition. J. Walter Thompson, McCann-Erickson and Young & Rubicam built their overseas networks to meet the needs of such multinationals as General Motors, Coca Cola, Esso and General Foods. When I got the Shell account in the United States, Max Burns, the then President of Shell, asked me if I would also like to have the account in Canada. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘but I don’t have an o�ce in Canada.’ ‘Get one,’ said Max, and that is how I started the network which was to spread to 40 countries.
 In these cases your competition will be the local agencies in the countries concerned. They have a habit of wrapping themselves in their national �ag and appealing to their governments for protection against us foreign invaders. They accuse us of imposing an alien

###### culture, particularly in countries which have little culture of their own, and in some cases their appeals have been heard. The Canadian Government employs only Canadian agencies. In Nigeria, the foreign agencies have been expelled.
 The fact is that almost all the overseas o�ces of American agencies are managed by nationals who would not know how to project American culture, even if they were foolish enough to try.

_Multinational accounts have propelled agencies into the international market. Shell was responsible for my building a_

_worldwide network of agencies. This Shell ad is from Ogilvy & Mather’s Frankfurt o�ce._

###### The old way to start a new agency was to defect from the agency which employed you and take some clients with you. Thus Ted Bates started his agency with accounts he had handled at Benton & Bowles. But this gambit has since been hampered by a legal decision. A man called Jones had a thriving agency, but he was an alcoholic and was always falling asleep during presentations. His associates begged him to retire. When the situation became intolerable, they crossed the street and set up their own agency – with some of Jones’s clients. He sued them for conspiracy and won; they had to pay such heavy damages that they were forced to close their agency.

-----

###### In 1981 an agency in New Zealand took successful action against its former Managing Director and Creative Director who had walked out with 17 members of the sta� and nine accounts. Gentle reader, you have been warned.
 With any luck, you will get accounts which grow. When I got American Express in 1962, the advertising budget was $1,000,000. It is now $70,000,000.
 When you are head of an agency, you know that your sta� looks to you to bring in new business, more than anything else. If you fail to do so over an extended period, you sense that you are losing their con�dence, and are tempted to grab any account you can get. Don’t. Above all, don’t join the melancholy procession of agencies which always accompanies a dying brand on its way to the cemetery. When Pan American fell on hard times, they moved their account from J. Walter Thompson, who had done an exceptionally good job for 29 years, to Carl Ally. Seven years later, when they continued to decline, they moved to N. W. Ayer. Three years later, they moved to Doyle Dane Bernbach. Six months later they moved to Wells, Rich, Greene. But this kind of instability is rare. The American Telephone Company, General Motors and Exxon have employed the same agencies for more than 70 years; DuPont, General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Scott Paper have employed the same agencies for more than 50 years.
 It is important to know how your agency is regarded in the marketing community. Don’t trust your own ears; you will only hear favorable opinions. It is safer, if you can a�ord it, to have a research organization conduct an impartial survey. When they report weak spots in your reputation, you can probably correct them, but it will take longer than you expect. Opinion always lags behind reality.
 If you aspire to building a portfolio of accounts in a wide variety of industries, you must be able to produce di�erent kinds of advertising. An agency which can only play the package-goods tune disquali�es itself from corporate accounts. An agency which always produces emotional advertising is unlikely to be hired by a manufacturer of power tools. The broader your range, the broader the spectrum of accounts you will get.

-----

###### It follows that you should recruit people with a wide range of talents. An agency should be like an orchestra, able to play anything from Palestrina to Jean-Michel Jarre with equal virtuosity.

 Big agencies vs. small It is very di�cult for small agencies to get big accounts. They cannot a�ord the range of specialized departments which big accounts require – regional o�ces, research, sales promotion, direct mail, public relations, and so on. They cannot deploy enough bodies to match the bodies at the client end. And the risk of losing a big client scares them out of that independence of judgment which should be one of any agency’s principal values to its clients.
 The other side of the coin is that the bigger an agency grows, the more bureaucratic it becomes. Personal leadership gives way to hierarchy. The head of the agency no longer recognizes his sta� in the elevators. I found working at Ogilvy & Mather more agreeable when it was small, but as I aspired to handling big accounts, I had no choice but to build a big agency.
 However, there will always be more small accounts than big ones, so small agencies are not an endangered species. Within the limits of their resources, they can often out-perform the big ones. Creativity is not a function of size. Small can be beautiful.

 Physician, heal thyself It puzzles me why so few agencies advertise themselves. Perhaps it is because the partners cannot agree on what to say. Some want to improve their agency’s reputation for ‘creativity.’ Some want to impress prospective clients with their agency’s marketing skills. Some want new business leads in a hurry. Make up your mind which you want – before you start writing house ads.
 Direct mail is probably the most e�cient medium for your house campaign. If you can scrape up the money, use space advertising as well, but don’t start it unless you mean to do it consistently. Young & Rubicam advertised in every issue of Fortune for 40 years.

_Advertising agencies seldom take their own medicine, but Young & Rubicam advertised in every issue of Fortune for 40 years._

_the art director._

_With these house ads, Ogilvy & Mather tell potential clients about the agency’s wide-ranging expertise._

###### Left alone, copywriters write house ads to impress other copywriters, and art directors make layouts to impress other art directors. But trendy layouts and fancy copy don’t impress prospective clients who have come up through �nance, production or sales. Writing house ads is a job for copywriters who can think like top-level businessmen. They should also be endowed with patience; it took me 22 years to get my �rst house ads approved by my partners.
 The purpose of my ads was to project the agency as knowing more about advertising. You may argue that this strategy was ill-advised, knowledge being no guarantee of ‘creativity.’ But at least it was unique, because no other agency could have run such advertisements – they lacked the required knowledge. My ads not only promised useful information, they provided it. And they worked – in many countries.
 But watch out: your clients will read your house advertisements. If you boast about your genius for brilliant ideas, you run the risk that they will ask you why you don’t give them brilliant ideas.

 Open letter to a client in search of an agency

###### Sir or Madam, If you have decided to hire a new agency, permit me to suggest a simple way to go about it.
 Don’t delegate the selection to a committee of pettyfoggers. They usually get it wrong. Do it yourself.
 Start by lea�ng through some magazines. Tear out the advertisements you envy, and �nd out which agencies did them.
 Watch television for three evenings, make a list of the commercials you envy, and �nd out which agencies did them.
 You now have a list of agencies. Find out which are working for your competitors, and thus unavailable to you.
 By this time you have a short list. Meet the head of each agency and his Creative Director. Make sure the chemistry between you and them is good. Happy marriages fructify, unhappy ones don’t.
 But don’t ask to meet the working-level people who would be assigned to your account. You might �nd them congenial, but have no way of judging their talent. Or you might �nd them repulsive – some of the most talented people are. A prospective client once passed up an opportunity to hire Ogilvy & Mather because the very able copywriter to whom I introduced him had long hair.
 Ask to see each agency’s six best print ads and six best television commercials. Pick the agency whose campaigns interest you the most.
 Ask what the agency charges. If it is 15 per cent, insist on paying 16 per cent. The extra one per cent won’t kill you, but it will double the agency’s normal pro�t, and you will get better service. Whatever

-----

###### you do, don’t haggle over the agency’s compensation. I know a big corporation which insists that its agencies negotiate terms of business with its Purchasing Department, as though they were selling o�ce furniture. Would they do this with lawyers and accountants?
 Insist on a �ve-year contract. This will delight the agency – and protect you from being resigned if one of your competitors ever tries to seduce them with a bigger budget.

 Now you have your agency, are you going to get the best out of them? Clients get the advertising they deserve. I know some who are a malediction, and others who are an inspiration.

_Don’t keep a dog and bark yourself. When Arthur Houghton asked me to do the advertising for Steuben Glass he said, ‘We_

_make the best glass. Your job is to make the best advertising.’ An admirable division of labor._

###### Don’t keep a dog and bark yourself. Any fool can write a bad advertisement, but it takes a genius to keep his hands o� a good one. I had just �nished showing a new campaign to Charlie Kelstadt, the Chairman of Sears Roebuck, when his Comptroller came into the room, started to read my copy – and took a fountain-pen out of his pocket. ‘Put that pen back in your pocket,’ snapped Kelstadt.

-----

###### Once a year give your agency a formal report on its performance. This will serve as an early warning of trouble which, if ignored, could end badly for all concerned.
 One of the biggest corporations in the world allows �ve levels to chew up its advertising. Each level has the power to veto, but only the Chief Executive O�cer has the power of �nal approval. Don’t strain your agency’s output through more than two levels.
 Even the best copywriters are preternaturally thin-skinned. When you have to reject their work, do it gently, and praise them to the skies when they perform well. They are the geese who can lay golden eggs. Inspire them to keep laying. The most inspiring client I have ever had was Ted Moscoso, the economic head of the Government of Puerto Rico. The day he hired us, he said to me, ‘Before we start advertising, we have to decide what we want Puerto Rico to become. A bridge between Latin America and the United States? An oasis of old Spanish culture? A modern industrial park?’ We talked all night. On later occasions, whenever I made a suggestion which appealed to his imagination – such as starting a music festival in San Juan – Moscoso would make a note in his pocket diary; action always followed. Governor Muñoz Marín, who was Ted’s chief, would have made a good President of the United States. When their party was �nally defeated, the new Republican governor moved the advertising to an agency which had handled his campaign in the election. I have never wept so bitterly.

###### Con�icts There is a convention that agencies should not serve more than one client in any category. When we do the advertising for Blogg’s Shoe Polish, we are not supposed to take on Mogg’s Shoe Polish. Some clients are �ercely jealous when their agencies violate this convention, to the point of �ring them.
 It sounds simple, but it is a mine�eld. Suppose the agency has a shoe polish account, and another of its clients decides to go into the shoe polish business. What do we do?
 Suppose we have a shoe polish account in our Vienna o�ce, and our Kuala Lumpur o�ce is o�ered another shoe polish. What do we do?
 Some clients extend the de�nition of con�ict to include any product which might indirectly reduce their sales. Suppose we have a shoe polish account and are o�ered a sandal account – wooden sandals, which don’t require polish. What do we do?

###### Such con�icts as these bedevil agencies. Says Marvin Bower of McKinsey:
