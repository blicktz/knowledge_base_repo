###### are natural charmers. They are not bullies. They encourage communications upwards, and are good listeners. Many of them drink too much, and read little except o�ce paper, in which they drown.
 With few exceptions, they are decent people, and worth knowing. It wasn’t always so. When I �rst arrived in New York, some of the agencies were headed by bastards and phonies.
 One of the most agreeable things about running an agency is that all your accounts are in di�erent industries. In the morning you discuss the problems and opportunities of a client who makes soap. In the afternoon it is a bank, or an airline, or a manufacturer of medicines. But you pay a price for this variety. Every time you see a client, you have to be su�ciently briefed on his business to give relevant advice. When I was the chief executive of my agency, I always took home two briefcases, and spent four hours reading their contents. Not much fun for my wife. Next to homework, my worst enemy was the telephone. I was usually 25 return calls behind.

###### Agencies are breeding-grounds for sibling rivalry. Will Cadwallader get a corner o�ce before Balfour? Why did you invite Pennypacker to lunch instead of Morgan? Why was Sidebottom made a Vice-President before Winterbottom? The agency I know

-----

###### best has two Chairmen, three Presidents, two Managing Directors, eight Executive Vice-Presidents, 67 Senior Vice-Presidents and 249 Vice-Presidents. You might suppose that nobody would take such nonsense seriously, but they do. Giving out the titles reminds me of Louis XIV: ‘Every time I give someone a title, I make a hundred people angry and one person ungrateful.’
 What can you do to keep sibling rivalry under control? You can be fair, and you can avoid playing favorites. Said Dr. William Menninger: ‘The executive is inevitably a father �gure. To be a good father, whether it is to his children or to his associates, requires that he be understanding, that he be considerate, and that he be human enough to be a�ectionate.’ If Menninger had been into transactional analysis, he would have added that the best fathers are ‘nurturing’ rather than ‘controlling.’
 Laymen assume that if you work in an advertising agency, you produce advertisements. The fact is that 90 per cent of the sta� don’t. They do research, they prepare media plans, they buy space and time, they do things loosely described as ‘marketing.’ And about 60 per cent of them do clerical work.
 In most agencies there are twice as many account executives as copywriters. If you were a dairy farmer, would you employ twice as many milkers as cows?
 Friction between copywriters and account executives is endemic in all agencies. Copywriters traditionally regard account executives as brainless bullies. I know a few account executives who �t this stereotype, but most of them are sensitive and well educated. Account executives are apt to regard copywriters as irresponsible prima donnas. Some are.

 Hiring Success in running an agency depends on your ability to hire men and women of exceptional talent, to train them thoroughly, and to make the most of their talents. The most di�cult people to �nd are those who have the capacity to become good copywriters. I have found that they always have well-furnished minds. They give

-----

###### evidence of exceptional curiosity about every subject under the sun. They have an above-average sense of humor. And they have a fanatical interest in the craft of advertising. I used to think that nobody could write good advertising before he was thirty. Then one day, on a visit to Frankfurt, I asked to meet the author of an exceptionally good campaign. She was eighteen.
 I marvel at the ability of some copywriters to keep their creative juices �owing year after year. George Cecil wrote the American Telephone advertising for 40 years, and wrote it well. It is a tragedy of the advertising business that its best practitioners are always promoted into management. I was in�nitely more useful to my clients when I wrote copy than when I was Chairman of the Board.

 When someone is made the head of an o�ce in the Ogilvy & Mather chain, I send him a Matrioshka doll from Gorky. If he has the curiosity to open it, and keep opening it until he comes to the inside of the smallest doll, he �nds this message: If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. But if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants.
 Even when you �nd someone who is better than you are, you won’t always succeed in recruiting him. Among those I have failed to recruit are Helmut Krone, the great art director; Shirley Polyko�, of Clairol fame; and a young account executive called Bart Cummings who went on to become head of the Compton agency.

###### I have always tried to hire what J.P. Morgan called ‘gentlemen with brains.’ Did he mean gentlemen in the snobbish sense? I think so. The debt owed by the United States to Roosevelt, Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman, Robert Lovett, John J. McCloy, the Rockefeller brothers and many other aristocrats has not been su�ciently acknowledged. I have been particularly lucky with alumni of St Paul’s and Harvard, notably my partners Esty Stowell and Jock

-----

###### Elliott. But I have also been lucky with gentlemen in the wider sense of the word.
 Brains? It doesn’t necessarily mean a high IQ. It means curiosity, common sense, wisdom, imagination and literacy. Why literacy? Because most communication between agencies and clients is in writing. I don’t suggest that you have to be a poet, but you won’t climb the ladder very high unless you can write lucid memoranda. I persuaded two of my partners to write a book on the subject. I commend it to you.[1]
 Look for young men and women who can one day lead your agency. Is there any way of predicting the capacity to lead? The only way I know is to look at their college records. If they were leaders between the ages of 18 and 22, the odds are that they will emerge as leaders in middle life.
 Make sure you have a Vice-President in charge of Revolution, to engender ferment among your more conventional colleagues.

 Crown Princes Spot the comers on your sta�, and plan their careers. Royal Dutch Shell has found that the most reliable criteria for selecting what they call Crown Princes are these:

 1 The power of analysis.

 2 Imagination.

 3 A sense of reality.

 4 The ‘helicopter quality’- the ability to look at facts and problems from an overall viewpoint.

 John Loudon, the distinguished former head of Shell, believes that when it comes to picking people for senior jobs, character is more important than any of these qualities. Dare I confess that I have come to believe in graphology as an instrument for assessing character? It is regarded as fakery in the United States, but is widely used in French business. Before accepting my o�er of marriage, my

###### wife had my handwriting analysed by two graphologists. Their reports were consistent – and accurate.
 Promote from within or hire from outside? ‘Mr. Morgan buys his partners,’ said Andrew Carnegie; ‘I grow mine.’ In the early days of Ogilvy & Mather, shortage of cash obliged me to pay peanut salaries. Pay peanuts, says Jimmy Goldsmith, and you get monkeys. I chose not to promote my monkeys, but to �ll senior openings from outside, with stars like Esty Stowell, Jock Elliott and Andrew Kershaw. Even a mature agency with a pool of potential leaders does well to refresh its blood by occasionally hiring partners from outside.

 Who not to hire Never hire your friends. I have made this mistake three times, and had to �re all three. They are no longer my friends.
 Never hire your client’s children. If you have to �re them, you may lose the client. This is another mistake I have made.
 Never hire your own children, or the children of your partners. However able they may be, ambitious people won’t stay in out�ts which practice nepotism. This is one mistake I did not make; my son is in the real estate business, secure in the knowledge that he owes nothing of his success to his father.
 Think twice before hiring people who have been successful in other �elds. I have hired a magazine editor, a lawyer and an economist. None of them developed an interest in advertising.
 And never hire your clients. The qualities which make someone a good client are not the qualities required for success in the agency business. I have made this mistake twice.

 O�ce politicians The hothouse atmosphere in agencies can cause outbreaks of psychological warfare to rival university faculties.[2] The politics became so vicious at Milton Biow’s agency that he was forced to close down. I know of seven ways to squelch them:

-----

###### 1 Fire the worst of the politicians. You can identify them by how often they send you blind copies of their poison-pen memos to their rivals.

 2 When somebody comes to your o�ce and denounces his rival as an incompetent rascal, summon the rival and make the denouncer repeat what he has just told you.

 3 Crusade against paper warfare. Make your people settle their �ghts face to face.

 4 Start a luncheon club within the agency. It turns enemies into friends.

 5 Discourage poaching.

 6 Don’t play favorites.

 7 Don’t play politics. If you practice the �endish art of divide et impera, your agency will go up in smoke.

 Discipline works Insist that your people arrive on time, even if you have to pay them a bonus to do so. Insist that telephones are answered promptly. Be eternally vigilant about the security of your clients’ secrets; indiscretion in elevators and restaurants, the premature use of outside typesetters, and the display of forthcoming advertisements on notice boards can do grave damage to your clients.
 Sustain unremitting pressure on the professional standards of your sta�. It is suicide to settle for second-rate performance. Above all, insist that due dates are kept, even if it means working all night and over the weekend. Hard work, says the Scottish proverb, never killed a man. People die of boredom and disease. There is nothing like an occasional all-night push to enliven morale – provided you are part of the push. Never leave the bridge in a storm.

 St Augustine had this to say about pressure:

-----

###### ‘To be under pressure is inescapable. Pressure takes place through all the world: war, siege, the worries of state. We all know men who grumble under these pressures, and complain. They are cowards. They lack splendor. But there is another sort of man who is under the same pressure, but does not complain. For it is the friction which polishes him. It is pressure which re�nes and makes him noble.’

 I have to admit that I have sometimes found the pressure unbearable; my own fault for frittering away so much time on things which lead nowhere. It is a good idea to start the year by writing down exactly what you want to accomplish, and end the year by measuring how much you have accomplished. McKinsey imposes this discipline on its partners and pays them according to how many of the things on their lists they accomplish.

 Leadership I have had unique opportunities for observing men who manage great corporations – my clients. Most of them are good problem- solvers and decision-makers, but few are outstanding leaders. Some of them, far from inspiring their lieutenants, display a genius for castrating them.
 Great leadership can have an electrifying e�ect on the performance of any corporation. I have had the good fortune to work for three inspiring leaders – Monsieur Pitard, who was my boss in the kitchens of the Majestic Hotel in Paris; George Gallup; and Sir William Stephenson of British Intelligence.
 There has been a lot of research into leadership. It is the consensus among the social scientists that success in leadership depends on the circumstances. For example, a man who has been an outstanding leader in an industrial company can be a �op when he goes to Washington as Secretary of Commerce. And the kind of leadership which works well in a new company seldom works well in a mature company.

-----

###### There appears to be no correlation between leadership and academic achievement. I was relieved to learn this, because I have no college degree. The motivation which makes a man a good student is not the kind of motivation which makes him a good leader.
 There is a tendency for corporations to reject executives who do not �t their conventions. How many corporations would promote a maverick like Charlie Kettering of General Motors? How many advertising agencies would hire a 38-year-old man whose curriculum vitae read: ‘Unemployed farmer, former cook and university drop-out?’ (Me in the year I started Ogilvy & Mather.)
 The best leaders are apt to be found among those executives who have a strong component of unorthodoxy in their characters. Instead of resisting innovation, they symbolize it – and companies cannot grow without innovation.
 Great leaders almost always exude self-con�dence. They are never petty. They are never buck-passers. They pick themselves up after defeat – the way Howard Clark of American Express picked himself up after the salad oil swindle. Under Howard’s indomitable leadership, the price of American Express shares increased fourteen- fold.
 Great leaders are always fanatically committed to their jobs. They do not su�er from the crippling need to be universally loved. They have the guts to make unpopular decisions – including the guts to �re non-performers. Gladstone once said that a great Prime Minister must be a good butcher.
 I saw the head chef at the Hotel Majestic �re a pastry cook because the poor devil could not get his brioches to rise straight. This ruthlessness made all the other chefs feel that they were working in the best kitchen in the world.
 Some men are good at leading the multitude – whether it be the labor force in their company, or the voting population in their country. But these same men are often miserable leaders of a small group.
 Good leaders are decisive. They grasp nettles. Some of them are very odd characters. Lloyd George was sexually chaotic. General

###### Grant, who won the Civil War, drank like a �sh. On November 26, 1863, the New York Herald quoted Lincoln as saying: ‘I wish some of you would tell me the brand of whiskey that Grant drinks. I would like to send a barrel of it to my other generals’
 Winston Churchill was another hardened drinker. He was capricious and petulant. He was grossly inconsiderate of his sta�. He was a colossal egotist. Yet his Chief of Sta� wrote of him:

 ‘I shall always look back on the years I worked with him as some of the most di�cult and trying ones in my life. For all that I thank God that I was given the opportunity of working alongside of such a man, and of having my eyes opened to the fact that occasionally such supermen exist on this earth.’

 I do not believe that fear is a tool used by good leaders. People do their best work in a happy atmosphere. Ferment and innovation depend on joie de vivre. I am indebted to Charlie Brower of BBDO for his amendment to the 13th chapter of St Paul’s �rst Epistle to the Corinthians: ‘A man who spendeth his life gathering gold for the United States Treasury and has no fun, is a sounding ass and a tinkling idiot.’
 The great leaders I have known have been curiously complicated men. Howard Johnson, the former President of MIT, has described it as ‘a visceral form of spiritual energy which provides the element of mystery in leadership.’ I have seen this mysterious energy in Marvin Bower of McKinsey, Ted Moscoso of Puerto Rico, and Henry Alexander of Morgan Guaranty.
