###### bomb, audiences would lose interest. What storytellers and screenwriters do, then, is create a backstory of frustration in the hero’s life.
 In the movie Moneyball, for instance, Billy Beane failed in his playing career and so was filled with self-doubt about whether he could redeem himself as a general manager. In Star Wars, Luke Skywalker was told by his uncle that he was too young to join the Rebellion, so he doubted his ability until the very end.
 In almost every story the hero struggles with the same question: Do I have what it takes? This question can make them feel frustrated, incompetent, and confused. The sense of self-doubt is what makes a movie about baseball relatable to a soccer mom and a romantic comedy relatable to a truck-driving man.
 Stories teach us that people’s internal desire to resolve a frustration is a greater motivator than their desire to solve an external problem.
 This is where most brands make a critical mistake. By assuming our customers only want to resolve external problems, we fail to engage the deeper frustration they’re feeling. The truth is, it’s those frustrations that are motivating them to call you.
 The key to discovering your customers’ internal problem is to ask yourself (or preferably, them) what the external problem they are dealing with is causing them to feel. For instance, if you sell childcare, the external problem is that the kids need a nanny, but what is this need causing your potential customers to feel? Helpless? Hopeless? Tired? Overwhelmed? These are the internal problems your customers are experiencing, and the more you talk about them, the more people want to buy your product so they can resolve those frustrations. When we ask, “What does this problem make our customers feel?” we can easily brainstorm great copy that will improve our marketing efforts.
 After their near collapse, Apple didn’t find their footing until Steve Jobs understood that people felt intimidated (internal problem) by computers and wanted a friendlier interface with technology. In one of the most powerful advertising campaigns in history, Apple showed a simple, hip, fun character who just wanted to take photos and listen to music and write books next to a not-so-hip tech nerd who wanted to talk about the inner workings of his operating system. The campaign positioned Apple Computers as the company to go to if you wanted to enjoy life and express yourself but felt marginalized by all the tech talk. In this specific campaign, Apple started

 The only reason our customers buy from us is because their external problem is frustrating them in some way. If we can identify that frustration, put it into words, and offer to resolve it along with the original external problem, we do more than just sell our customers products; we bond with our customers because we’ve positioned ourselves deeply into their narrative.
 For example, if we own a house-painting business, our customer’s external problem might be an unsightly home. The internal problem, however, may involve a sense of embarrassment about having the ugliest house on the block. Knowing this, our marketing could offer “Paint That Will Make Your Neighbors Jealous.”
 One of our clients, Stephen Boice, recently incorporated more internal messaging on his website and saw an increase in business, just by changing a few words. Stephen and his wife own Vitality Aesthetics, a face and skin studio in Florida that offers over thirty different treatments to help their customers look better. The header at the top of their website previously read, “Your Natural Beauty” and featured a picture of an attractive woman being treated by an aesthetician. While the website looked great and business was strong, I asked David to try something slightly different: Add get and back to their header. In other words, instead of saying “Your Natural Beauty,” say “Get Your Natural Beauty Back,” knowing that as most of us get older and spend more time in the sun, we lose our youthful looks a little faster than we have to. By identifying a customer’s feeling that they have lost something, David would be tapping into an internal frustration. I also asked David to include a price list that included all the procedures he offered but to give the price list away only in exchange for an email address. Once a potential customer downloaded the price list (definitely a qualified and interested customer), I asked him to send thirty emails over thirty weeks documenting how thirty separate clients felt about themselves after engaging each of his products. By creating an automated email campaign that taps into his customers’ internal frustrations and tells stories of how other customers had been relieved of those frustrations, David began to grow his business again.

 What Frustrations Do Our Products Resolve?
 Recently, the rental car company National got my business by understanding my internal frustration. I used to rent cars from a company that got on my nerves. When I get off a plane, I normally don’t feel like making small talk. The staff at the company I used to rent cars from had a policy of chitchatting with their customers. They even used a script. First they asked whether I was in town for business or pleasure, then they asked about the weather where I came from. On and on it went. I heard this script so many times I started having fun beating them to their own talking points. I’d often jump ahead on their script and ask the clerk, “Are you going to be able to have a little downtime while you’re in town?” They’d just stare blankly at me because I’d hijacked their line.
 One day, though, I was watching television and a commercial came on for National Car Rental. The commercial showed a guy walking through the rental office without talking to anybody. The character talked about how he hated having to make conversation with salespeople and how he loved walking straight to his car. I immediately changed rental car companies and have been happy ever since.
 Speaking of car companies, CarMax is a chain of used car dealerships that aims most of their marketing collateral at the internal problem a customer experiences when looking for a used car—namely, the fear and frustration of having to interact with a used car salesman.
 If you’ve ever walked onto a used car lot, you know the feeling. It’s as though you’re about to wear yourself out in an altercation with a professional wrestler.
 Knowing their customers don’t want to haggle over prices with a wannabe con artist, CarMax’s business strategy is aimed at alleviating your fear of being lied to, cheated, or worked over in your car-buying experience. To do this, they have an agreement plan with their customers that ensures the price on the car is the price you’ll pay, and lets you know their salespeople aren’t compensated on a variable commission. They also

 The external problem CarMax resolves is the need for a car, of course, but they hardly advertise about cars at all. Instead, their smart marketing department has focused on their customers’ internal problems and, in doing so, entered one of the least-trusted industries in America and created a $15 billion phenomenon.[3]
 Likewise, Starbucks exploded not just by offering customers a cup of coffee but by giving them a comfortable, sophisticated environment in which to relax and connect. When they walked into a Starbucks, customers felt good about themselves. Americans went from hanging out in diners and bars to lounging in a local, Italian-style coffee shop. By solving their customers’ internal problems, Starbucks brought an entire industry to America. Thousands of European-style boutique coffee shops have popped up in nearly every small town in America, following Starbucks’ lead.
 In understanding how their customers wanted to feel, Starbucks took a product that Americans were used to paying fifty cents for (or drinking for almost free at home or at work) and were able to charge four or five dollars per cup. Starbucks customers are willing to pay more for their coffee because they sense greater value with each cup.
 Understanding and talking about our customers’ internal problems does more than create better advertising. Framing our products as a resolution to both external and internal problems increases the perceived value (and, I would argue, actual value) of those products. In other words, when you solve somebody’s internal problem, you can charge more for your products.
 Later, I’ll guide you through a brainstorming exercise helping you identify some of your customers’ internal problems, but before that, let’s look at a third kind of problem our customers experience. This third level can help the story you are inviting customers into go from interesting to downright passion-inducing. Adding a philosophical problem is one of the main reasons a film will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and it will have your audience sitting on the edge of their seats. A good philosophical problem can help you turn disinterested customers into brand fanatics.

 PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS

-----

###### Adding a philosophical problem creates depth and meaning in a story and is often the reason stories resonate and become fan favorites. The philosophical problem helps those who engage the story understand why the story matters in the overall epic narrative of humanity itself.
 Why is it important that Tommy Boy should save his dad’s company? I’ll tell you why, because the people trying to take Tommy Boy down are lying thieves. This is a comedic story about honesty, family, integrity, and hard work versus deception, greed, and trickery.
 Why is it important that Hamlet should avenge his father’s death? Because his uncle is getting away with murder.
 Why is it important that Bridget Jones should find love? Because the beauty and worth of every person deserves to be recognized and cherished by another.
 A philosophical problem can best be talked about using terms like ought and shouldn’t. For example: “Bad people shouldn’t be allowed to win” and “People ought to be treated fairly.”
 In the movie The King’s Speech, the external problem is presented in the form of King George’s stutter. This external problem manifests the internal problem of the king’s self-doubt and his own feeling that the wrong man now wears the crown. King George simply doesn’t believe he has what it takes to lead his country. Philosophically, though, the stakes are much greater. Because the king must unify his people against the Nazis, the story takes on the philosophical problem of good versus evil.

 What’s the Deeper Meaning?
 The reason people resonate so strongly with the philosophical problem in a story is because human beings want to be involved in a story that is larger than themselves. When a story represents (or speaks to) a cause, it expands beyond the screen or the page and stirs people to champion a cause, which gives the story itself considerably more import. Likewise, brands that give customers a voice in a larger narrative add value to their products by offering a deeper sense of meaning in their own story.
 After creating their BrandScript, a global consulting firm my team worked with began to talk about how everybody deserved to work for a great manager. A pet store owner who came to us hung a sign in her window that said, “Pets deserve to eat healthy food too.” A fun-loving

 Before music went digital, Tower Records promoted their stores by using the tagline “No Music, No Life.” Not only did the tagline help them sell more than a billion dollars in records each year, but they sold thousands of bumper stickers and T-shirts featuring the tagline to fans who wanted to associate with the philosophical belief that music mattered.
 Is there a deeper story your brand contributes to? Can your products be positioned as tools your customers use to fight back against something that ought not to be? If so, let’s include some philosophical stakes in our messaging.

 The Perfect Brand Promise
 If we really want to satisfy our customers and create brand evangelists, we can offer much more than products or services; we can offer to resolve an external, internal, and philosophical problem whenever they engage our business.
 Storytellers use this formula to endear and satisfy audiences all the time. The strategy is to resolve the hero’s external, internal, and philosophical problem in a single, well-crafted scene. At the end of the blockbuster movie Star Wars: A New Hope, when Luke Skywalker shoots a photon torpedo through the exhaust portal in an empire-constructed planetary ship called the Death Star, Luke resolves the external problem of destroying the Death Star, the internal problem of self-doubt he felt about being a Jedi, and the philosophical problem of good versus evil. When all three levels of conflict were resolved at once, the audience felt three levels of relief, and the movie itself became a phenomenon that generated countless sequels and spin-offs and an entire new world at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.
 The climactic scene is often called the “obligatory” scene because by opening the external, internal, and philosophical story gap early in the movie, the storyteller is obligated to close all three levels of conflict at the story’s end. This idea is important for those of us who are building a brand. Our products, if we want them to succeed in the marketplace, should offer to solve a problem, soothe a feeling, and, if possible, contribute to some sort of justice-oriented agenda. Then, upon purchase, our solutions need to fulfill all three promises. If we can accomplish this (and use clear words to

###### explain how we did), we can expect customers to fall in love with our products and our brand.
 If we really want our business to grow, we should position our products as the resolution to an external, internal, and philosophical problem and frame the “Buy Now” button as the action a customer must take to close the story gap we’ve opened in their minds.
 Let’s look at how some familiar brands have positioned their products as the solution to external, internal, and philosophical problems:

**TESLA MOTOR CARS:**
###### Villain: Gas-guzzling, inferior technology External: I need a better car. Internal: I want to be an early adopter of new technology. Philosophical: My choice of car ought to help save the environment
 and perform better at the same time.

**NESPRESSO HOME COFFEE MACHINES:**
###### Villain: Coffee machines that make bad coffee External: I want better-tasting coffee at home. Internal: I want my home coffee machine to make me feel
 sophisticated. Philosophical: I shouldn’t have to be a barista to make gourmet coffee
 at home.

**EDWARD JONES FINANCIAL PLANNING:**
###### Villain: Financial firms that don’t listen to their customers External: I need investment help. Internal: I’m confused about how to do this (especially with all the
 tech-driven resources out there). Philosophical: If I’m going to invest my money, I deserve an adviser
 who will thoughtfully explain financial complexities to me in person.

##### WHAT CHALLENGES ARE YOU HELPING YOUR
 CUSTOMER OVERCOME?

-----

###### Identifying a villain that is causing an external, internal, and philosophical problem may seem daunting, but it will come to you if you commit to working it out in a brainstorming session. But be careful to keep it simple. Many of our clients want to include three villains, seven external problems, four internal problems, and so on. But, as I’ve already mentioned, stories are best when they are clear. If we are going to create memorable sound bites, we’ll need to make choices.
 Is there a single villain your brand stands against? What external problem is that villain causing? How is that external problem making your customers feel? And why is it unjust for people to have to suffer at the hands of this villain?
 These are the four questions we want to answer in the problem section of our StoryBrand BrandScript. When we do, the story our brand is telling will take shape because our hero, the customer who wants something, is being challenged. Will they win? Will their problems be resolved?
 Perhaps. The thing is, they will have to engage your brand to find out.

 CLARIFY YOUR MESSAGE SO CUSTOMERS LISTEN

Go to StoryBrand.AI and either create a BrandScript or log in to your existing
BrandScript.
Either alone or with your team, brainstorm all of the literal and metaphorical
villains your brand takes a stand against.
Brainstorm the external problems your brand resolves. Is there one that seems to
represent the widest swath of products?
Brainstorm the internal problem (frustration or doubt) your customers are
feeling as it relates to your brand. Is there one that stands out as a universal
experience for your customers?
Is your brand part of a larger, more important story? Is there a philosophical
wrong your brand stands against?
Once you finish your brainstorming session, make the four StoryBrand
BrandScript decisions that will allow you to create sound bites for the second
element of your StoryBrand BrandScript.
