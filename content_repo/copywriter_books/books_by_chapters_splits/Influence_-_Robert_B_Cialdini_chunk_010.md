#### create an obligation. Recall, also, that reciprocal relationships confer an extraordinary advantage upon cultures that foster them, and, consequently, there will be strong pressures to ensure the rule does serve its purpose. Little wonder that influential French anthropologist Marcel Mauss, in describing the social pressures surrounding the gift-giving process, says there is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.
 Although an obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity rule, it’s the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. A responsibility to receive reduces our ability to choose those to whom we wish to be indebted and puts the power in the hands of others. Let’s reexamine a pair of earlier examples to see how the process works. First, in the Regan study, we find that the favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets purchased from Joe was not one they had requested. Joe had voluntarily left the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the subject. There was not a single subject who refused the favor. It is easy to see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe’s gift: he had already spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in the situation, especially because Joe had one himself; and it would have been considered impolite to reject Joe’s thoughtful action. Nevertheless, receipt of that Coke produced a feeling of indebtedness that became clear when Joe announced his desire to sell raffle tickets. Notice the important asymmetry here—all the genuinely free choices were Joe’s. He chose the form of the initial favor, and he chose the form of the return favor. Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice of refusing both of Joe’s offers, but those would have been tough choices. To have said no at either point would have required the subject to go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation.
 The ability of uninvited gifts to produce feelings of obligation is recognized by a variety of organizations. How many times has each of us received small gifts through the mail—personalized address labels, greeting cards, key rings—from charitable agencies that ask for funds in an accompanying note? I have received five in just the past year, two from disabled veterans’ groups and the others from missionary schools and hospitals. In each case, there was a common thread in the accompanying message. The goods that were enclosed were to be considered a gift from the organization, and money I wished to send should not be regarded as

#### payment but rather as a return offering. As the letter from one of the missionary programs stated, the packet of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for but was designed “to encourage your [my] kindness.” We can see why it would be beneficial for the organization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of as merchandise: there is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one, but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product.[9]

#### From a male college student

Last year, on my way home for Thanksgiving break, I felt the pull of reciprocation
firsthand when I blew a tire. A driver in a nurse’s uniform stopped and volunteered to take
me home. I told her several times that my house was still 25 miles away and in the opposite
direction that she was heading; but she insisted on helping me anyway and wouldn’t take
any money for it. Her refusal to let me pay her created the uneasy, uncomfortable feeling
you discuss in Influence.

The days following the incident also caused anxiety for my parents. The rule of
reciprocation and the discomfort associated with the unreturned favor caused a mild
neurosis in my house. We kept trying to find her identity in order to send her flowers or a
gift, all to no avail. If we had found her, I believe we would have given the woman almost
anything she asked for. Finding no other way to relieve the obligation, my mother finally
resorted to the only route left to her. In her prayers at our Thanksgiving dinner table, she
asked the Lord to compensate the woman from heaven.

**Author’s note: Besides showing that unsolicited assistance can engage the reciprocity**
rule, this account points to something else worth knowing about the obligations that
accompany the rule: they are not limited to the individuals initially involved in giving and
receiving aid. They apply, as well, to members of the groups to which the individuals
belong. Not only was the family of the college student made to feel indebted by the help he
received, but had they been able, they could have retired the debt, as research indicates, by
helping a member of the nurse’s family (Goldstein et al., 2007). Additional research shows
that this kind of group-based reciprocity extends to mistreatment. If we are harmed by a
member of another group and we can’t harm that person, we’re more likely to take our
revenge by mistreating someone else of that group (Hugh-Jones, Ron, & Zultan, 2019).

### The Rule Can Trigger Unequal Exchanges

-----

#### There is yet another feature of the reciprocity rule that allows it to be exploited for profit. Paradoxically, although the rule developed to promote equal exchanges between partners, it can be used to bring about decidedly unequal results. The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated with a similar sort of action. A favor is to be met with another favor; it is not to be met with neglect and certainly not with attack; however, considerable flexibility is allowed. A small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger return favor. Because, as we have already seen, the rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debt-canceling return favor, we could easily be manipulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule.
 Once again, we can turn to the Regan experiment for evidence. Remember in that study, Joe gave one group of subjects a bottle of Coca- Cola as an initiating gift and later asked every subject to buy some of his raffle tickets at 25¢ apiece. What I have so far neglected to mention is that the study was done in the late 1960s, when the price of a Coke was a dime. On average, subjects who had been given a 10¢ drink bought two of Joe’s raffle tickets, although some bought as many as seven. Even if we look just at the average, we can tell that Joe made quite a deal. A 500 percent return on investment is respectable indeed!
 In Joe’s case, though, even a 500 percent return amounted to only 50¢. Can the reciprocity rule produce meaningfully large differences in the sizes of the exchanged favors? Under the right circumstances, it certainly can. Take, for instance, the account of a student of mine concerning a day she remembers ruefully.

_About one year ago, I couldn’t start my car. As I was sitting there, a guy in the parking lot came_
_over and eventually jump-started the car. I said thanks, and he said you’re welcome; as he was_
_leaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by. About a month later, the guy knocked on_
_my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as his was in the shop. I felt somewhat_
_obligated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked very young. Later, I found_
_out that he was underage and had no insurance. Anyway, I lent him the car. He totaled it._

#### How could it happen that an intelligent young woman would agree to turn over her new car to a virtual stranger (and a youngster at that) because he had done her a small favor a month earlier? Or, more generally, why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger return favors? One

#### important reason concerns the clearly unpleasant character of the feeling of indebtedness. Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and demands to be removed. It is not difficult to trace the source of this feeling. Because reciprocal arrangements are so vital in human social systems, we have been conditioned to feel uncomfortable when beholden. If we were to ignore the need to return another’s initial favor, we would stop one reciprocal sequence dead and make it less likely that our benefactor would do such favors in the future. Neither event is in the best interests of society. Consequently, we are trained from childhood to chafe, emotionally, under the saddle of obligation. For this reason alone, we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than the one we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological burden of debt. A Japanese proverb makes this point eloquently: “There’s nothing more expensive than that which comes for free.”
 There is another reason as well. A person who violates the reciprocity rule by accepting without attempting to return the good acts of others is disliked by the social group. The exception, of course, occurs when a person is prevented from repayment by reasons of circumstance or ability. For the most part, though, there is a genuine distaste for an individual who fails to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule. Moocher, taker, and ingrate are unsavory labels, to be scrupulously shunned. So undesirable are they that people will sometimes agree to an unequal exchange to dodge them.

Even the stingiest people feel the pull of the reciprocity rule. But the rule can also be used by
restaurant servers to increase their tips. One study found that servers who gave diners a piece of
candy when presenting the bill increased their tips by 3.3 percent. If they provided two pieces of
candy to each guest, the tip went up by 14 percent (Strohmetz et al., 2002).

#### In combination, the reality of internal discomfort and the possibility of external shame can produce a heavy psychological cost. When seen in the light of this cost, it is not so puzzling that in the name of reciprocity, we often give back more than we have received. Neither is it so odd that we often avoid asking for a needed favor if we will not be in a position to repay it. The psychological cost may simply outweigh the material loss.
 The risk of still other kinds of losses may also persuade people to decline certain gifts and benefits. Women frequently comment on the uncomfortable sense of obligation they can feel to return the favors of a man who has given them an expensive present or paid for a costly evening out. Even something as small as the price of a drink can produce a feeling of debt. A student in one of my classes expressed it quite plainly in a paper she wrote: “After learning the hard way, I no longer let a guy I meet in a club buy me a drink because I don’t want either of us to feel that I am obligated sexually.” Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern. If instead of paying for them herself, a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him.
 The rule of reciprocation applies to most relationships; however, in its purest form—an equivalent exchange of gift and favors—it is unnecessary and undesirable in certain long-term relationships such as families or established friendships. In these “communal” relationships, what is exchanged reciprocally is the willingness to provide what the other needs, when it is needed. Under this form of reciprocity, it is not necessary to calculate who has given more or less but only whether both parties are living up to the more general rule.[10]

#### From an American émigré to Australia

-----

Not long ago, we moved to Australia where my five-year-old daughter has been struggling
to adapt to the new culture and find new friends. Recently, on walks around the
neighborhood with my wife, our daughter tried leaving “gifts” in neighbors’ letter boxes.
These were really just drawings scribbled in crayon and then folded and taped together into
a letter. I thought it pretty harmless and was more concerned that it might be perceived as a
nuisance. I worried we would be known as the “Phantom Letter Box Litterers.” Then funny
things started happening. In our mailbox, we started finding cards—proper Hallmark cards
—addressed to my daughter that cost anywhere from $3 to $5 apiece. Then packets of
sweets and small toys started appearing there. If it wasn’t for reading your book, I wouldn’t
have understood this; but the power of reciprocity is unbelievable. She now has a group of
friends she plays with in the park across the road each day.

**Author’s note: I like this account because it reinforces a pair of features of the**
reciprocity rule we’ve already covered: it can not only trigger unequal exchanges but also
serve as the initiator of ongoing social arrangements. More than that, even young children
see it as a way to bring about such arrangements.
