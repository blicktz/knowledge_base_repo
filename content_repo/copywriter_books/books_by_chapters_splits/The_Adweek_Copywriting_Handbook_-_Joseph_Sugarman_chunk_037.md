##### The preceding is an extreme example. But let’s take something less extreme. You’re a traveling salesperson and stay at hotels a lot. Somebody tries to sell you a spray that you put on your feet before you go to sleep to prevent athlete’s foot, which might come from walking on a floor that hasn’t been cleaned thoroughly. You ignore the sales message because you rarely get athlete’s foot, and besides, it’s a bother to use. The next week you get athlete’s foot and you’re at the corner pharmacy trying to find the strongest thing they’ve got to cure it.
 The two situations illustrate two general principles. The first: It is human nature to think you’re never going to get the disease or affliction that the preventive can prevent, so it becomes a very tough sell. The second: If you do get the disease or affliction, you’re willing to pay a whole lot more for the cure than you were for the preventive and it’s easier to sell.
 I have been talking in medical or health terms. But this theory also applies to several other products and concepts. I’ll go into those in a moment, but let’s examine the first step in breaking through the cure/preventive theory and see if you can make the appeal of the preventive as strong as the appeal of the cure.
 It can be done, but only if you can position the product to make the preventive the cure. Let me cite an example:
 When the Midex burglar alarms were first sold by JS&A in the late 1970s, it was definitely a product that was more of a preventive. However, I also knew that there were people who were recently robbed or whose neighbors were recently robbed, and to these people, the Midex alarm was more of a cure. Think about it. At first they thought, “Naw, our neighborhood is safe. I don’t need one.” And then after their neighborhood was robbed and they needed a cure, “Boy, I’d better get one of those Midex alarms or else I may be next.” And of course, there was the prospect who had just been robbed: “Where did I see that ad for that burglar alarm?”
 I also knew that if I advertised in a professional manner and explained the quality and value of my product and its quick and easy installation, as opposed to using the scare tactics expressed through quoting crime statistics, I would attract a different kind of customer. I would attract the

##### person not quite threatened but concerned—a person to whom the product did not currently represent prevention or a cure. In short, it was for somebody who hadn’t been robbed and whose neighbor hadn’t been robbed, but who realized that there was a problem out there. This last group would save my ad, and when they needed it, they would take it out of their files— often after several months—and call. This actually did happen a lot.

 The consumer waited until he felt threatened before he bought.

 Twenty years ago, The Club automotive steering wheel locking device would have been a tough sale. Back then, car theft was not as big a problem as it is now. But with the increase in drug traffic today and with thousands of cars being stolen every hour, The Club has become more of a cure against your fear of having your car stolen.
 The big rage in health food and disease prevention a few years ago was the melatonin craze. This is a hormone secreted naturally by the pineal gland—a pea-sized object at the center of the brain. It is supposed to help prevent aging. With millions of baby boomers turning 60, it became a very big product—more of a cure than a preventive.

# Many Products Make Powerful
 Cures

##### When I sold my wrinkle pill, Miracell, it, too, was a cure. If you have wrinkles, you are a great prospect for wrinkle creams and treatments. They represent cures, not preventives. And think about it. Don’t the preventives like creams to moisturize your skin and sunscreens to avoid sun damage cost a lot less than the cures? But some of the effective wrinkle eliminators cost plenty for a small jar. Miracell sold at $25 for a month’s supply.
 Insurance is another preventive. “Keep your family from going through hard times after you die.” What could be tougher than thinking you’re going to die someday? But the older you get, the more you think about it. And remember the story about my friend, the insurance salesman, who always tried to sell me insurance and finally succeeded when my next-door neighbor died suddenly at an early age? I couldn’t wait to sign the papers.
 You must first make a decision when evaluating a product. Is this product a preventive or a cure? Can the product be positioned as a cure rather than a preventive? Is the market trend changing the perception of your product from being a preventive to being a cure? Or do you simply have a preventive that does not have a broad enough market?
 If you’ve got a cure and the market is large enough, you’ve got a powerful product. If you’ve got a preventive, think in terms of how you can change it into a cure. Let me show you how this can be done.

# Make a Preventive a Cure

##### Another pill I have been selling for the past few years, called simply “The Pill,” is a fuel-conditioning treatment for automobiles. It is a pill you put in your gas tank, and it is both a preventive and a cure.
 First, as a preventive, it helps you avoid engine problems by cleaning out your engine before anything serious happens to your car from impurities that could lodge in your fuel injectors. It reduces pollution to help you pass the many mandatory emissions tests conducted throughout the United States, and it prevents you from having to visit the repair shop. Again, these are the preventives.
 But when I go on TV at QVC to present The Pill, I don’t talk that much about what it prevents but rather what it cures. It cures engine knock, it eliminates ping, it saves up to 10 percent on gas. If you flunk your emissions test, use The Pill and you’ll pass the next time. In short, I emphasize the curative aspects of the product and underplay the preventive features. And The Pill is truly a miracle product. (I swear, it really works.) This brings me to my next point.
 Notice how I have to swear that The Pill really works. Selling truly breakthrough products is the toughest marketing job in the world because people find it difficult to believe that these products really work. And belief is one of the strongest motivational factors in human nature. If your prospect believes in something, he or she will move mountains to obtain it, but if he or she doesn’t believe in something, you won’t move that prospect an inch.
 In this chapter you’ve learned that you sell the cure, not the preventive, that preventives don’t sell very easily and that some products can be changed from preventives to cures. You’ve also learned that you can charge a lot more for a cure than you can for a preventive. And finally, I’ve demonstrated that you can successfully market a product that is both a preventive and a cure by emphasizing its curative aspects while underplaying its preventive aspects. So let’s summarize what you’ve learned in a simple statement that we can refer to in the future:

##### Axiom 15

**_Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as_**
**_a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized._**

##### The information presented in this chapter will be very helpful for you in evaluating products in the future. Simply understanding that the cure/preventive factor exists will help you to select and then position your next product for selling.

 Rating Your Writing Level

##### You’ve gained a tremendous amount of knowledge reading this book. And in Section Three you will use this knowledge to evaluate my mail order ads and those of others who attended my seminar.
 But how are you going to rate yourself in the future? Is there some measure you can apply to your writing to determine if you are communicating at the level you need to in order to reach your audience?
 Well, fortunately there is a way, thanks to Robert Gunning, who created the Fog Index for newspaper writers to help them avoid so-called foggy writing and determine for themselves the grade level of the copy they were writing. In short, were they writing with enough clarity so that a fifth grader could understand their copy or must a reader be in high school or even college to understand it? The lower the grade level, the wider the audience.

# Reaching a Mass Market

##### For example, if I wanted to reach a mass market, I would keep my ad copy simple and my sentences short and I wouldn’t use big words. On the other hand, if I wanted to reach a very upscale audience, I might use bigger words and longer sentences.
 Best-selling books are written for the 8th to 10th grade level. Time, BusinessWeek and the Wall Street Journal are 11th grade level. The Gettysburg Address and Reader’s Digest have a 10th grade level in common. And for the most part, the average American audience reads between the 11th and 12th grade levels.
 The following are the steps for determining the Fog Index, or grade level, of the copy you write:
 1. Take a sample of your copy—start with 100 to 125 words from the very beginning of the ad. 2. Count the words in each sentence. Dates and numbers equal one word and independent clauses count as separate sentences (e.g., “We studied, and we learned” would be two sentences). 3. Divide the total number of words by the number of sentences to get the average sentence length. 4. Count the number of long words (those of three or more syllables), but:
 Do not count short-word combinations like pawnbroker or yellowtail. Do not include proper names. Do not include verbs that have become three syllables by adding ed or es. 5. Divide the number of long words by the total number of words in the selection to get the percentage of long words. 6. Add the average sentence length to the percentage of long words. 7. Multiply this total by 0.4 to get the grade level. Now let’s use as an example the Vision Breakthrough ad we discussed in Chapter 19 under “Storytelling.” The ad is presented in full in Chapter 32. I

##### will take the first 102 words of copy, and show you how to determine the grade level.
 I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain. Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so incredible,” he said, “when you first look through a pair, you won’t believe it.” “What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?” Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision improves. Objects appear sharper, more defined. I have put the three long words in bold type. There are 102 total words in this selection and 11 sentences. This means that the average number of words per sentence is 9.3.
 The next step is to divide the number of long words (3) by the total words (102) to get the percentage of long words: 2.9 percent.
 Now add the average sentence length of 9.3 words to the percentage of long words, which is 2.9, and you have the number 12.2. Then multiply the number 12.2 by 0.4 and you end up with the number 4.9. In short, this ad started out being understandable to a very large segment of the market by virtue of the fact that it was quite comprehensible to anybody reading at about the fifth grade level and above.
 Incidentally, the next block of copy in that same ad had about the same reading level. The third block of copy jumped to 7.2, but by that time the reader was well into the copy. I would suggest that you take different 100- word blocks from different parts of your ad to see how consistent your style is.
 Try this with one of your ads or with one of the many ads in Section Three. It is an easy way to determine the level of comprehension of your writing and it will also make you aware of the effect that multisyllabic words and long sentences have on the comprehensibility of your ad and the level of reader that will resonate with your copy.
 The ad that we just tested was one of JS&A’s most successful. And it seemed that with many of my ads, the greater the clarity, the broader the appeal and the greater the response. After you’ve tried it with some of the

##### ads in this book or other ads, you’ll be amazed at how easily you will be able to guess the Fog Index from reading just the first few paragraphs of any ad.
 Clarity is one of the most important factors in writing copy, and the Fog Index gives you an insight into how important short sentences and simple words can be. But don’t be obsessed with achieving low Fog Index scores at the expense of common sense. You need to vary the length of sentences and use three-syllable words when you need them and realize that every audience is different.

 Seven Steps to Writing Great Copy

##### One of your reactions to having read the steps involved in writing copy might be that there are a lot of things to keep in mind as you craft your ad. And indeed there are.
 But if I were to reduce everything down to a simple seven-step formula, I would suggest the following, keeping in mind that you have read this book and have comprehended its principles.
 Step 1: Become an expert on the product or service you are planning to sell. I have gotten more great ideas delving into discovering everything I could about a product or service than I have from any other resource.
 Step 2: Know your prospect. You might become an expert on your product or service but if you don’t know your customer, you’re at a big disadvantage. What will motivate your prospect to become a customer? Who is your typical prospect? This will give you insight and also spur lots of good ideas.
 Step 3: Write your headline and subheadline. They must grab the reader and create enough curiosity to cause the reader to get to the first sentence. I like headlines that are short. “Vision Breakthrough,” “Pocket CB,” “Pocket Yellow Pages”—all are concise and yet create enough curiosity to get you to the subheadline. Subheadlines should be around 16 words, and first sentences should be as short as possible.
 Step 4: Write the copy. Don’t worry about sentence structure, grammar, punctuation—just start writing and keep writing. Let all your ideas and thoughts flow into the computer and above all don’t worry about making mistakes. The main idea is to take everything that is in your head about the subject and dump it into your hard drive. If you write your copy by hand or with a typewriter, write with the same abandon. However, you’re a lot better off writing your ad with a computer, especially when it comes to editing.

-----

##### Step 5: Edit your copy. Go through it and correct the spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. Eliminate extra words not necessary to express your thoughts. Tighten things up.
 Step 6: Incubate. Stop editing, put the text aside and take a walk or do something pleasurable. You’ll be amazed at what getting away from your text will do for you. If you can come back to it the next day, better yet. The more time between what you’ve just edited and taking the next step—all the better.
 Step 7: Take a final look at your copy. You’ll be amazed at how much more you’re going to catch and how much more refined you will be able to make the copy with this final look. Of course you could easily repeat steps 5 and 6 and continue to edit until you are happy with your results.
 These seven steps summarize what you as a copywriter will go through to write copy. It’s really that simple. And if you’ve learned the principles of writing copy, each time you do this you will get better at it. That I can guarantee.
