THE EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH
 Customers often want to do due diligence before placing an order, especially if you’re selling something complicated or expensive. Giving your customers a few paragraphs to read about your product or service,

-----

###### though, allows them to spend a little time reflecting on your offer. We call this the explanatory paragraph, and it can look like this:

 LEAD GENERATOR AD
 You definitely want to share your lead generator in a pop-up ad of some sort, but you can also repeat it in the actual body of the landing page. Mentioning your lead generator twice will actually encourage even greater sign-ups. Here’s a good one:

-----

###### THE JUNK DRAWER
 I used to joke that the junk drawer is the most important section of your website because it’s where you are going to put everything you previously thought was important. Don’t bother cluttering up your sales page with all kinds of links and background information about your brand. Instead, put that stuff down here at the bottom of the page.

 You can add or subtract from this wireframe if you like. Regardless, using the StoryBrand Brain at StoryBrand.AI to generate a sample landing page for your brand will help you see a terrific, visual “sales pitch” for your offering. Have fun creating yours!

##### STEP FOUR: CREATE A LEAD GENERATOR THAT COLLECTS EMAIL ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS

###### There is no question people are addicted to their phones. It’s a sad reality but a reality all the same. We are all staring at our phones all the time. Why? Not just because developers are making their apps more and more addictive but also because it’s our primary communication device. If you are like me, you likely interact with ten or twenty times as many people through your phone in a given day as you do in person. In fact, if you send me a text message, you are communicating with me in the same medium as my family and closest friends. And, more often than not, I’ve invited you to do so.

-----

###### If I give you my phone number for text updates, or my email address so that I can be notified about special offers, I’ve literally told you to reach out to me because I like your brand that much.
 Brands that reach out to their customers via text and email have a strategic advantage over those who do not, mainly because brands that do so are less likely to be forgotten.
 The challenge is convincing customers to give us their contact information. So how do we get people to join our email list or give us that valuable information? We offer them something in return, something more valuable than the vague offer of a newsletter or an invitation to “stay in touch.” This “something” is a lead generator, a resource that magnetically attracts people to our businesses and invites them to take action. In the StoryBrand framework, we call this a transitional call to action. A transitional call to action, if you remember, is like asking potential customers out on a date. We’re not asking them to commit to marriage, but we are asking them to spend a little more time with us.

 How to Create an Irresistible Lead Generator
 In order to combat noise in today’s marketplace, your lead generator must do two things:

 1. Provide enormous value for your customer 2. Establish you as an authority in your field

 As I mentioned before, in the year we started StoryBrand, our first lead generator was a simple, downloadable document (in PDF format) called “5 Things Your Website Should Include.” It was remarkably successful. More than forty thousand people downloaded it, which allowed me to email reminders about our upcoming StoryBrand Marketing Workshops. I credit that single lead generator with taking our company past the $2 million mark. From there, we created a free video series called The 5-Minute Marketing Makeover (5MinuteMarketingMakeover.com), which took our lead generation to another level. We were no longer grinding to create business. Now we create lead generators for each revenue stream our company offers. This allows us to segment our customers by their interests and offer different products to solve their various problems.

###### There are endless options for creating lead generators. Our StoryBrand coaches have been incredibly creative at producing lead generators that offer valuable information in exchange for an email address. Of all the lead generators our coaches have created for clients, there are five kinds that are the most effective.

 Five Types of Lead Generators for All Types of Businesses
 1. Downloadable guide: This is a shockingly inexpensive way to
 generate leads, and it’s what we used when launching StoryBrand. Get specific. If you’re a local market selling produce, offer monthly recipes or tips for tending a garden. 2. Online course or webinar: Creating a brief online course or
 webinar is involved, but it’s also easier than ever. If you’re an expert on something and want to position yourself as such in the marketplace, offer a free training online in exchange for an email address. By doing so, you’ll have positioned yourself as an expert, created reciprocity, and earned your customer’s trust. 3. Software demos or a free trial: This has worked wonders for
 many businesses. Remember in the early nineties when AOL sent demo CDs in the mail with one thousand hours of free internet browsing for forty-five days? They worked like a charm. The internet has changed since then, but the marketing principle remains the same. 4. Free samples: My wife, Betsy, orders ready-to-cook meals from a
 business called Blue Apron. To generate more leads, Blue Apron credits her with “free sample meals” she can send to friends and family. A number of them try it, and they end up buyers. 5. Live events: If you’ve ever walked into a large pet store like Petco,
 you’ve likely seen invitations to free dog obedience classes. Even if you’re a smaller operation, hosting a quarterly class is a terrific way to build a small database of qualified customers.

 Still Stuck? Swipe Ideas from These Examples
 One key to having an effective lead generator is giving it an irresistible title. These are some sample lead generators I’ve seen that worked well.

###### There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Leverage these proven examples and create something similar.

 “Five Mistakes People Make with Their First Million Dollars” —A
 downloadable PDF guide offered by a financial adviser who wanted to find young, newly wealthy clients and help them with their financial planning. “Building Your Dream Home: Ten Things to Get Right Before You
 Build” —A free e-book offered by an architect who wanted to establish herself as a guide to families looking to build a custom home. “Cocktail Club: Learn to Make One New Cocktail Each Month”
 —This was a monthly event surprisingly put on by a garden store that taught attendees how to infuse bitters and simple syrups with herbs. The objective for this promotion was to create a community around their store. Business is booming (or should I say blooming) because people want to attend their classes. “Become a Professional Speaker” —A free online course offered by
 a speaking coach for those who wanted to become professional speakers. This generated leads for long-term subscriptions to his coaching service.

 The ideas go on and on. Now that you’re aware of how lead generators work and which ones work best, you’ll see them everywhere. Keep a running list of lead generator possibilities. If one strikes you as exceptionally strong, get to work and create a version of your own. The key here is to avoid falling into “paralysis by analysis.” The best and easiest place to start is with a downloadable PDF guide. If you aren’t a writer, don’t worry. There are plenty of writers for hire, and you can find some terrific StoryBrand certified coaches through our directory at MarketingMadeSimple.com.
 You can also use the StoryBrand Brain at StoryBrand.AI. When you use the tool you will be given a list of possible lead generator titles and the copy you can use in the lead generator itself.

##### STEP FIVE: CREATE AN AUTOMATED EMAIL OR TEXT
 DRIP CAMPAIGN

###### In my mid-twenties, after traveling around the country for about a year in a Volkswagen van, I got a warehouse job at a publishing company outside Portland, Oregon. The job came to me by accident. A friend’s dad owned the company and knew I needed a job. But I’m grateful. Working in publishing, even in an entry-level position, helped me fall in love with the process of making and selling books and, later, writing them myself.
 Within a few years of getting that job, I was put in charge of the company. It was an unintentional move on the owner’s part because other employees retired or took other jobs, and the owner kept “temporarily” moving me up. One season, though, the owner hired a consultant to help him figure out how to grow the business, and after studying the numbers, the consultant pointed at me and said, “Put that guy on commission and let him do what he wants.” I was just as taken aback as my boss. Without any of us realizing it, the company had actually started growing while I was at the helm. And when we sat down and looked closely at the numbers, we realized the reason. I assure you, it had little to do with my competence at the time.
 Just before my series of promotions, I’d discovered a piece of software called FileMaker Pro. We used this software to manage our database and collect orders. Every day I’d show up at the office and fiddle with the software, and one day I realized we could use it to see who had placed the largest orders and automate the creation of a mailing list and subsequent thank-you letters. This is all standard marketing these days, but back then it was relatively new technology. Each month I sent about two hundred letters to the businesses that ordered the most copies of our books. That simple gesture generated a great deal of trust and differentiated us from other publishers, which, according to our consultant, generated a great deal more business.
 Honestly, the letters I wrote to our customers weren’t very good. One of the letters was about a camping trip I’d taken as a kid! Shakespearean prose, this was not.
 These days my letters get a lot bigger response, but looking back, even those terrible letters worked to grow our business. In fact, I doubt many of our customers even read those letters.

-----

###### So why did the company grow if people weren’t even reading my letters?
 What I realized, in hindsight, was that every month our top customers were being reminded that we existed. Every time one of those customers saw a letter and threw it away, even without opening it, our logo was flashing across their eyes.
 Content is important, but the point is, there is great power in simply reminding your customers you exist. I was young and dumb at the time, but I’d stumbled onto something. Your customers may not need your product today, and they might not need it tomorrow, but on the day they do need it, you want to make sure they remember who you are, what you offer, and where they can reach you if they want to buy it.

 Send Potential Customers Regular, Valuable Emails
 The days of direct mail aren’t completely dead, but it goes without saying that email and text messages have largely taken over. And for good reason. My company would not be where it is without having built a large email list. Because we have collected emails, we are able to earn trust by offering free value, invite customers to helpful webinars and live streams, give away massive amounts of content, offer the free use of our software tools, and, of course, let customers know when I release a new book or product.
 Now that you’ve obtained email addresses through your lead generator, the next step is to create an automated email campaign that provides value and earns trust.
 Also, an automated email campaign is a terrific way to remind customers you exist. And if they happen to open your email (you’ll be surprised at how many people actually do), then it’s a great way to invite them into a story in which the value you provide can change their lives.
 What is an automated email campaign? An automated email campaign is a prewritten sequence of emails that begin to go out once a person is added to your list. Some people call this an “auto-responder series,” but the idea is to invite customers into a narrative that enlightens them and builds a relationship.
 The same trust-building experience can be created via text too. With text, you want to keep things short and likely provide links to helpful tools, or you can limit it to sales announcements or special offers. Text, by the

-----

###### way, is also an incredibly effective way to keep your brand in people’s minds, long before and long after they place an order. In fact, I get routine text messages from a brand called Hank’s Belts. Hank sells, you guessed it, belts. I’ve never been much of a belt guy, but when I bought a belt from Hank’s Belts as a Christmas present for my father-in-law, the business texted me almost every day for months. Surprisingly, the text messages never bothered me. They were usually special offers or announcements of a new belt or line of belts, and, well, I was kind of interested. Later, when I actually needed a new, black, dress belt, I immediately thought of Hank’s Belts and visited their site and placed an order. Not only this, but I’ve told friends about Hank’s Belts. You might think I have told friends about Hank’s Belts because they make good belts, but the truth is, that’s not the reason at all. Lots of companies make good belts. I told my friends about Hank’s Belts because they’ve moved into the mental real estate of my mind by sending frequent text messages! In other words, they made me remember them by staying in touch and reminding me they exist. This, in short, speaks to the power of email and text-message marketing.

 DOES ANYBODY READ THESE THINGS?

Don’t worry if the open rates on your emails are low. A 20 percent open rate is the
industry standard, so anything above that is performing well. And remember, even if a
person sees and deletes an email, the goal has been accomplished: you are “branding”
yourself into their universe.

If someone unsubscribes from your list, that’s a good thing. That person probably
never would have bought from you anyway; besides, the subtraction of an email reduces
the size of your list, so you aren’t paying your email service provider for emails that
customer doesn’t want. The last thing you want to do in your marketing is bother
someone, so if a person unsubscribes, all the better. It’s more important to have a list of
qualified, interested subscribers than a large number of people who never intend to place
an order.

I’m subscribed to plenty of mailing lists and hardly ever open emails from them.
Why don’t I unsubscribe? Because every twenty or so emails, they send something I
actually want to open. But even the emails I don’t open are effectively branding the
name of those companies into my conscious mind and thus my mental list of options
when it finally occurs to me that I need the sort of products they sell.

###### Getting Started with Email and Text Marketing

-----

###### I will talk about text-message marketing in a bit. First, though, let’s talk about email marketing campaigns and how they can help you grow your business. While there are many kinds of automated email campaigns, the one we recommend starting with is the nurture campaign. A nurture campaign is a simple email that offers your subscribers valuable information as it relates to your products or services.
 Not unlike your lead generator, you want these emails to continue positioning you as the guide and to create trust and reciprocity with potential customers. There will come a time to ask for a sale, but this isn’t the primary goal of a nurture campaign. A typical nurture campaign may have an email going out once each week, and the order might look like this:

 Email #1: Nurture email Email #2: Nurture email Email #3: Nurture email Email #4: Sales email with a call to action

 The pattern of sending three nurture emails followed by a sales email can be repeated month after month for as long as you want to send them. Some brands never stop, just sending out an indefinite number of emails for as long as the customer stays subscribed to the list. I think this is smart marketing, honestly, because you never know when your customer is going to have the problem your product solves. And when they do, you want them to remember you. That said, I recommend creating a few months’ worth of material to get started and then adding to that campaign as you have time to create more. The idea behind a nurture campaign is to offer something of great value and then occasionally ask for an order. If your lead generator does its job of acquiring new contacts, in a short time you will have hundreds of potential customers being introduced to and reminded of your business week after week. And when those customers need help in your area of expertise, they will remember you and place an order.
 So what’s the difference between a nurture email and a sales email with an offer and call to action?
