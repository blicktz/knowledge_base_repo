###### thereby making the reports of much greater value to the Hollywood executives who were our clients.
 So why does it take agency researchers three months to answer a few simple questions? They are natural slowpokes, and too frightened of making mistakes.

 2 They cannot agree among themselves on methodology. It recently took the Research Directors of the 21 biggest agencies two years to reach agreement on the principles which should govern copy-testing. Now they have started to debate methodology. Five years?

 3 It is in research departments that you �nd the eggheads of the agency business. Too many of them are more interested in sociology and economics than advertising. They concentrate their attention on subjects which are only peripherally related to advertising.

 4 They have little or no system for retrieving research which has already been conducted. Reports are read, sometimes acted on, and �led. Two years later the researcher, the account executive, the copywriter and the brand manager have moved to fresh pastures. Even if somebody remembers that the research was done, nobody can �nd it. So we re-invent the wheel, year after year.

 5 Advertising research is full of fads. In the sixties we saw Eye Cameras, Latin Squares, Facturals, Randomized Blocks, Greco- Latin Squares. Some of them were useful, but all went out of fashion.

 6 Researchers use graphs which are incomprehensible to laymen. And their reports are too long. When he was an executive at Procter & Gamble, Ralph Glendinning refused to read any research report which was more than a quarter of an inch thick.

###### 7 Researchers have a maddening way of refusing to undertake projects which they consider imperfect by their perfectionist standards, even when the project would produce actionable results. Said Winston Churchill, ‘PERFECTIONISM is spelled PARALYSIS.’

 8 Ninety-nine researchers out of a hundred content themselves with conducting surveys for which they are asked, but seldom take initiatives. Stop asking them questions, and they grind to a halt.

 9 Worst of all, researchers use pretentious jargon – such as attitudinal paradigms, judgmentally, demassi�cation, reconceptualize, sub-optimal, symbiotic linkage, splinterization. Come o� it, professor.

 Media I have never worked in the media department of an agency, but observation of those who have been successful in this �eld leads me to think that they need an analytical mind, the ability to communicate numerical data in non-numerical formats, stability under pressure, and a taste for negotiation with the owners of media.

 Chief Executive O�cer The most di�cult job in an agency is Chief Executive O�cer. He (or she) must be a good leader of frightened people. He must have �nancial acumen, administrative skill, thrust, and the courage to �re non-performers. He must be a good salesman, because he is responsible for bringing in new clients. He must be resilient in adversity. Above all, he must have the physical stamina to work 12 hours a day, dine out several times a week, and spend half his time in airplanes.[1]

 Creative Director As a Creative Director myself, I dare to list the attributes needed for this back-breaking job. You must be:

 1 A good psychologist.

 2 Willing and able to set high standards.

 3 An e�cient administrator.

 4 Capable of strategic thinking – ‘positioning’ and all that.

 5 Research-minded.

 6 Equally good at television and print.

 7 Equally good at package goods and other kinds of accounts.

 8 Well versed in graphics and typography.

 9 A hard worker – and fast.

 10 Slow to quarrel.

 11 Prepared to share credit for good work, and accept blame for bad work.

 12 A good presenter.

 13 A good teacher and a good recruiter.

 14 Full of infectious joie de vivre.

 Notice that I put ‘good psychologist’ at the top of the list. Albert Lasker, who made the largest fortune in the history of the advertising business, once told a group of copywriters, ‘You think managing copywriters is a snap? You have taken some hairs out of me. I had a breakdown that kept me �ve and one-half months. I couldn’t talk for �ve minutes without starting to weep.’

###### Women in advertising Feminists are doing dreadful things to the English language. I refuse to write spokesperson, chairperson, househusband or womanhole cover.
 Like most boys of my generation, I started life believing that women belonged in the home, until I noticed how much happier my mother was when she went out to work. My �rst woman Vice- President was Reva Korda, a brilliant copywriter who later became head of the Creative Department. For all her brains and ability, even Reva encountered male copywriters and art directors who felt uncomfortable working under any woman. But there are now 52 women Vice-Presidents in the New York o�ce of Ogilvy & Mather, and there appears to be no resentment of them among the male sta�.
 The majority of people now being recruited by advertising agencies in the United States for so-called ‘professional’ jobs are women.

 Firing and hiring Agencies used to �re people at the drop of a hat. Stirling Getchel’s otherwise admirable agency had a turnover in sta� of 137 per cent in one year. Another agency �red a copywriter because he dared to talk to the boss in the men’s room. Today the boot is on the other foot. The people who work in agencies are lamentably nomadic. I recently hired a 40-year-old copywriter who had already changed jobs eleven times.
 You might suppose that a business which depends entirely on the talent of its people would take recruiting seriously, but that is not yet the case. In most agencies, the recruiting is still sloppy and haphazard. Even today, it is rare for any agency to ask an applicant’s former employers what they think of him. I know two men who were hired and �red as Presidents of three agencies – without their references being checked.

 Education for advertising

-----

###### Eighty-seven American universities o�er undergraduate courses in advertising, and some even give degrees in it. With a few conspicuous exceptions, the teachers lack the practical experience to be relevant. All of them are handicapped by the poor quality of the textbooks, and very few do research of their own. Most of their graduates get jobs with small agencies, the big agencies preferring to recruit people who have furnished their minds by studying history, languages, economics and so forth.
 The fashion for recruiting at schools of business administration seems to have passed its peak. Give or take a few stars like the Baker Scholars at the Harvard Business School, their alumni are more remarkable for stodginess and arrogance than imagination.

 Social status When I was a door-to-door salesman for Aga cooking stoves in Scotland, I paid a cold call on an aristocrat. He threw me out. What right had I to invade his privacy? ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘you are a Director of two companies which sell their products door-to-door. How dare you insult me for doing something which your own salesmen do every day?’ His disdain for salesmen is mirrored in the snobbish attitude of the British establishment towards advertising. Not so in the United States.

 Moonlighting If you need more income than your agency is willing to pay you, make up the di�erence by moonlighting. I have been moonlighting for 30 years. The Curtis Publishing Company gave me two magni�cent china lamps for writing an advertisement for Holiday magazine. They had been bullying their editors and I had reason to believe that they were about to �re Ted Patrick, the marvelous editor of Holiday. So I persuaded the heads of the 12 biggest agencies to join me in a testimonial to Ted, applauding him for his ‘indi�erence to the heckling of publishers.’ The Curtis people were too dumb to realize that this would make it impossible for them to �re Ted, and ran my advertisement.

-----

###### The Reader’s Digest gave $10,000 to the Scottish school which had educated me, in return for an advertisement I wrote for them.
 Omega, the watch company, paid me $25,000 to spend four days at their headquarters in Switzerland, advising them how to improve their advertising. To my surprise, they got their money’s worth. Even today, I am retained by the Campbell Soup Company as their consultant on marketing.

_Curtis Publishing paid me two antique china lamps for writing this advertisement in my spare time. They did not guess my_

_real motive: to make it impossible for them to �re the editor of Holiday magazine. The signatories were the heads of the_

###### ‘Be happy while you’re living’ ‘Chess’, wrote Raymond Chandler, ‘is about as elaborate a waste of human intelligence as you could �nd anywhere outside an advertising agency.’ If advertising is a waste of intelligence, it isn’t a very serious one. Not more than 100,000 men and women work in advertising agencies in the United States – less than 0.1 per cent of the working population. About 15,000 work in British agencies.
 Most of the people I know in agencies strike me as well cast for their work and reasonably happy in it. Whenever I think that someone is wasting his talents in advertising, I tell him so. One of my partners is a superb naturalist, and secretly resented every day he spent in the agency. On my advice he retired – and went on to save endangered species of fauna from extinction. In the words of the Scottish proverb, ‘Be happy while you’re living, for you’re a long time dead.’
 A few advertising people regard advertising as an unworthy occupation. Thus the head of the agency in Paris that helped François Mitterrand become President of France called his autobiography: Don’t tell my mother I work in an advertising agency – she thinks I play the piano in a whorehouse. Poor chap.

_In gratitude for my writing this advertisement, Reader’s Digest gave $10,000 to the Scottish school where I was educated._
_Because it was to appear over my signature, I took great pains to write it well – well enough for Raymond Rubicam to call it_

_‘a masterpiece.’ If all clients insisted on their agencies signing their ads, they would gel better ads._

###### Those of us who study public opinion surveys are aware that the lay public thinks we admen are rascals. Dr. Gallup recently asked people to rate 24 professions for honesty. Top marks went to clergymen, bottom marks to trade-union leaders, car salesmen and advertising practitioners. The stereotype of the ‘huckster’ dies hard. But I don’t think our poor image keeps many of us awake at night. I

 How to apply for a job Don’t telephone – write to three or four agencies, and enclose your curriculum vitae. Be sure to type your letter, and take a lot of trouble with it. In their book Writing that Works,[2] my partners Kenneth Roman and Joel Raphaelson o�er this golden advice:

 1 Spell all names right It’s astonishing how often job applicants misspell the names of the agencies they want to work for. The message that gets through, right o� the bat, is: ‘This applicant can’t be seriously interested in working here; he didn’t even take the trouble to �nd out how to spell our name.’

 2 Identify the sort of job you’re applying for State it clearly and at once. Say what led you to apply – a want ad, a recommendation from a friend, whatever. A letter applying for a job as a research analyst started in this mysterious way:

 Dear Ms. Smith: It’s spring already – a time to think about planting seeds. Some seeds are small, like apple seeds. Others are bigger. Coconuts, for example. But big or little, a seed can grow and �ourish if it’s planted in proper soil.

 The applicant would have done better to start like this:

 Dear Ms. Smith: I understand that you are looking for a research analyst.

 Ms. Smith doesn’t have time to play guessing games with her mail.

 3 Be speci�c and factual

-----

###### Once you’ve made clear what job you want, then touch on your chief quali�cations. Avoid egotistical abstractions like: ‘Ambition mixed with a striving for excellence is one of my strongest assets’

 4 Be personal, direct and natural You are a human being writing to another human being. Neither of you is an institution. You should be businesslike and courteous, but never sti� and impersonal.
 The more your letter sounds like you, the more it will stand apart from the letters of your competitors. But don’t try to dazzle your reader with your sparkling personality. You wouldn’t show o� in an interview, so why show o� in a letter? If you make each sentence sound the way you would say it across a desk, there will be plenty of personality in your letter.

###### 5 Propose a speci�c next stop Close your letter with a clear and precise statement of how you wish to proceed toward an interview. Avoid such mumblings as:

 ‘Hoping to hear from you soon.’

 ‘Thank you for your time and consideration.’

-----

###### ‘I’m looking forward to the opportunity of discussing a position with you.’

 All such conclusions place the burden of the next step on your busy prospective employer. Why make him work in your interest? Do the job yourself, like this:

 ‘I’ll call your o�ce on Wednesday afternoon to see if you’d like me to come in for an interview.’

 ‘I’m free for an interview every morning until 8:45, and Thursday after 2:30. I’ll call your o�ce on Wednesday afternoon to �nd out if you would like to get together at any of those times’

 At this stage a phone call makes things easy for the person at the other end. If you don’t call him, he has to go to the trouble of calling or writing to you. The idea is to make it as simple as you possibly can for your prospective employer to set up an appointment at a time that’s convenient to you.

 I am always surprised by the illiteracy of men and women who look for jobs in advertising. I am bombarded with applications like this recent lulu:

 ‘My goal is to seek more challenging experiences to further develop my skills in marketing and advertising. I feel I have reached a plateau in my education. My objective is to obtain a top level management position utilizing extensive experiences in marketing communications areas as a viable contribution to corporate objectives. My creative background and expertise involves a wide range of areas in the development of objectives, strategies and marketing communications programs to meet these goals’

-----

###### If you will take my advice, don’t get a job in advertising unless it interests you more than anything in the world.
 There are many di�erent kinds of jobs, calling for very di�erent skills, all the way from art direction to statistics. All the jobs can be performed by women, in some cases better than by men.
 The pay is good, but don’t expect the gold that Cosimo de Medici promised Cellini. There are easier ways to get rich.

 How to run an advertising agency

###### the morale of men and women who work in a continuous state of anxiety.
 It is popularly believed that advertising attracts neurotics who are naturally prone to anxiety. I don’t believe this. What happens in agencies is enough to induce anxiety among the most phlegmatic people.
 The copywriter lives with fear. Will he have a big idea before Tuesday morning? Will the client buy it? Will it get a high test score? Will it sell the product? I have never sat down to write an advertisement without thinking THIS TIME I AM GOING TO FAIL.
 The account executive also has reasons for anxiety. He represents the agency to the client, and the client to the agency. When the agency goofs, the client holds him responsible. When the client is bloody-minded, the agency blames him.
 The head of the agency also has his worries. Is such-and-such a client going to �re you? Is a valuable partner going to quit? Will you make a hash of the new business presentation on Thursday?
 Make it fun to work in your agency. When people aren’t having any fun, they don’t produce good advertising. Kill grimness with laughter. Encourage exuberance. Get rid of sad dogs who spread gloom.
 What kind of paragons are the men and women who run successful agencies? My observation has been that they are enthusiasts. They are intellectually honest. They have the guts to face tough decisions. They are resilient in adversity. Most of them
