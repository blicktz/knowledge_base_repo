According to the LinkedIn advertising team, this site for global professional networking currently boasts a membership of well over six hundred million. In their opinion, LinkedIn is the #1 social platform for business-to-business lead generation and networking for jobs (although indeed.com is the #1 job acquisition site).
 That said, let’s explore the advertising options available via LinkedIn: the common text-based ad, which we’ll explore later; then there are dynamic and display ads, Sponsored InMail ads, and Sponsored Content. Knowing what a text-based ad is, let’s define those unfamiliar ad formats.

 Dynamic ads: Right-column (also called “right rail”) personalized ads tailored to each member based on their profile data, such as company name or job title. There are currently three types of dynamic ad formats to choose from: spotlight, follower, and job posting ads (irrelevant to this discussion).
 1. Spotlight Ads: Here’s your chance to share thought leadership, best practices, insights, and valuable content with your target audience. When members click on your ad, they’re directed to your Web site or landing page, where you can record actions like leads, sign-ups, and visits. You can use spotlight ads to drive conversions and to build brand awareness. 2. Follower Ads: This format allows advertisers to promote their LinkedIn page and drive members to follow their LinkedIn page with a single click. This format is recommended for advertisers whose objectives are to generate brand awareness, increase

### engagement with the LinkedIn page, or convert LinkedIn members into engaged followers. These ads feature the member’s profile photo next to your company’s logo. They also feature the member’s first name and your company name in the ad copy. Display Advertising: Sometimes called banner advertising, a display ad includes an image and text content. Sponsored InMail ads: InMail messages are sent directly to another LinkedIn member you’re not connected to. If you have a Basic (free) account, you must upgrade to a Premium account to use InMail. You receive a specific number of InMail credits based on your subscription type. Sponsored InMail allows you to drive more leads and engage your target audience by delivering personalized, private messages right to their LinkedIn inboxes. Sponsored InMail messages consist of a custom greeting, call-to-action button, body text, custom banner image, and ability to add a link to the message body. Sponsored Content: There are two types of sponsored content, simple sponsored and direct sponsored content.
 Simple Sponsored Content is a LinkedIn page update created by Page admins, which advertisers can choose to sponsor to gain greater distribution.
 Direct Sponsored Content is Sponsored Content that does not appear on the LinkedIn page or Showcase Page. It allows advertisers to create content to sponsor on behalf of the company without cluttering the LinkedIn page or Showcase Page and without first posting a LinkedIn page update.

 Note: Showcase Pages are second-level pages accessible off of a company page. They allow a company to promote specific products or market to a specific buyer persona. LinkedIn users can follow singular Showcase Pages without following the business or its other Showcase Pages.

 Because LinkedIn offers many advertising options, it’s suggested you consult the LinkedIn Marketing Solutions specifications page

### (https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/topics/8154/8155/ad-specs-guidelines). When it comes to costs, depending on the format you choose, you’ll pay on the pay-per-click (PPC) or cost-per-impressions (CPM) or cost-per-send (CPS) for InMail advertising.

 WRITING A LINKEDIN TEXT AD

 It’s much the same as with Facebook text-based ads. Your creativity will be bounded by character and ad size limitations. Currently the specifications are as follows:

 Available in a variety of sizes: 300 x 250 pixels, 17 x 700 pixels, 160 x 600 pixels, 72 x 90 pixels, and 496 x 80 pixels. Image size (if you use one): 50 x 50 pixels. Headline: 25 character limit (including spaces). Description: 75 character limit (including spaces).

 Here’s an example of a text-based ad seen on LinkedIn. It’s small, features an image of a satisfied professional woman, and reads:

**VIP OF LEARNING?**
### Train your team to Speak to Senior-Level Decision Makers.

 Free Webinar

 The presentation of this next text ad is slightly different, in that it clearly presents the Web address in question (as opposed to having it embedded in the code of the advertisement) and is branded.

## WRITING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

### WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

 One aspect of the many social media platforms available that you should be aware of is that you write and post differently for each one. What you post on Facebook will be different from what you post on Twitter or LinkedIn, even if the posts are about the same topic. The main rules of good content writing for any platform are:

 1. Concise writing—avoid extra words; social media posts should be
 short and direct, starting with an interesting title or lead. 2. Write to engage your readers and give lots of interesting information
 within two to three sentences or paragraphs, depending on your platform. 3. Encourage readers to leave comments on your post by asking “Do
 you agree?” or “What do you think?”

 CREATE BUSINESS ACCOUNTS

 Create a business page account rather than using a personal page account to market your products or services. This is a more professional way to brand your company and keep the brand uppermost in readers’ minds when they view your content. Using a personal page account to support your business

### brand makes you look unprofessional and amateurish, unless your name is the brand.
 One woman recently sponsored one of her business posts with 500 words of content, which took up the whole length of the page, once opened. There were five or six sentences per paragraph, making it difficult to read through quickly.
 Save long content for blogs. Most social media readers prefer to read a few small paragraphs and move on after “liking” the post.
 Have the following information available for readers on your business page, such as:

 1. The business name and logo. 2. A way to contact you, such as an e-mail address, or phone number if
 you want calls. 3. Information about your business and what the business offers to
 clients.

 USING A FUNNEL APPROACH

 Use a different title for each piece of content you post, based on the platform you use. Each title must still relate to your same subject matter that you are sending all readers to, if that is your post’s intent. If you write a blog located on your business Web site, you can funnel readers from each of your social media platform posts, with a link to that blog placed at the end of the post. Here are examples of changing content and titles across platforms, leading to the same blog.

 Your strategy for each of your social media accounts becomes part of your overall multichannel marketing strategy of getting your product or services noticed everywhere on the Internet. To do that, you must write short, interesting, informative posts, like the samples shown above that grab the readers’ attention so that they continue down the funnel to your blog or landing page. They may also sign up to receive your newsletters or e-mails, once they have read your blog.

### TIPS FOR WRITING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

 Posts are where you can express your opinion, share content, and have conversations. You pretty much have free reign to say or show whatever you want, with a few possible exceptions—but not many. Among the social media networks that allow comments are YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and of course blogs. Your posts are most likely to be seen by your Facebook friends, though they are viewable by many other FB users as well. Your tweets will be seen by your Twitter followers, your LinkedIn posts and articles by your LinkedIn connections.
 Here are some guidelines for writing on social media:

 Have an objective. Do you want to express an opinion or your feelings? Speak out on major issues of the day? Share advice, information, tips, or instruction? Make an offer such as a free e-book download? Start or participate in interesting conversation threads? Promote your business and your brand? Or just have fun? Know why you are doing Facebook posts. If you can’t think of a reason, why bother? When you write content, be personable, and write as if you were speaking to each of your readers individually.

-----

### Be conservative when it comes to cutesy words and especially profanity. Some people can get away with that, but you may find it a difficult persona to carry off if you are new to the marketplace. People will want to know you better, but if they are regularly bombarded with the C word or F word, more than a few readers may be offended and complain on social media about your business postings. For the vast majority of FB users, the C and F words do not serve them well. Participate in threads and respond when appropriate to comments left on your posts. Social media is an interactive two-way medium. So it can generate involvement and engagement as well as build relationships. If posting on Facebook for business, avoid controversial topics such as anything concerned with politics, religion, race, or gender issues. Facebook may suspend your account if you are sharing negative news about world events or people and making derogatory, coarse comments that are slanted. In your posts, end the post with a phrase that openly encourages and asks for feedback and comments. Some of the ones that work well include:
 “What say you?” “What do you think?” “Do you agree or disagree?” “How does this sound to you—good, fair, bad, or terrible?”

 KEEP YOUR READERS ENGAGED THROUGH REGULAR POSTING SCHEDULES

 You can design a schedule for posting your content on a regular basis, such as every Tuesday and Friday. You can even create a themed post that your readers can expect to see on those days. Keep your posts interesting and focused on a topic that your readers look forward to reading.
 For example, you can create original content posts about search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to use, which you post on Mondays and Thursday. On Wednesday and Friday, you post content about multichannel

### marketing tactics. At the end of each post, ask readers what they think. Each post can have a link leading to your business blog of the day, relating to those posts.

 FIVE RULES FOR FACEBOOK CONVERSATIONS

Remember “netiquette,” the rules for acceptable online communication? We need a
handbook, “Netiquette for Facebook,” to show people how to behave civilly during a FB
discussion, thread, or argument.

Rule #1: Don’t directly say or even imply that the other person is stupid because you
disagree with what he says.

Rule #2: When someone presents a link to a resource with data supporting their point,
don’t dismiss it simply by saying it is false, fake, or wrong. Why not? Because you don’t
know that for a fact. It’s just your opinion. So say it’s your opinion and back up your
assertion with evidence supporting YOUR viewpoint. But just saying an article, Web site,
study, or other proof from a credible source is B.S. without facts or logic to back you up is,
well, a lot of B.S. on your part.

Rule #3: You cannot use logic and rational discourse to remove a thought from
someone’s mind that was not put there with logic in the first place. So don’t even try to
engage them. It is a fruitless endeavor and an enormous waste of your time and energy.

Rule #4: Don’t state opinions as if they were indisputable facts. Opinion: filet mignon is
better than chopped liver. Fact: Bob Bly likes chopped liver better than filet mignon.

Rule #5: As the writer Harlan Ellison states, you are actually not entitled to an opinion
about everything and anything. You are entitled only to your INFORMED opinion. The
average person is well-informed in only a handful of subject matter areas. But you see them
on FB arguing and giving their opinions about everything and anything. Don’t do that. The
only way to know what you are talking about, said author Robert B. Parker, is to talk about
only things that you know.

### FACEBOOK

 Facebook, in the first quarter of 2019, had 2.38 billion active users worldwide, according to Statista.com. This statistic covers all users who have logged in at least once in the last thirty days.
 SproutSocial.com reports that, on a global level, India has the highest number of Facebook users at 300 million, and is in first place over the United States, which has 210 million. You can go to either of these Web sites to get more information on demographics when deciding where your

-----

### best target market group can be found, by platform usage and other associated criteria, such as age and gender.

 • Business page vs. personal page

 You may already have a personal page account with Facebook, where you have connected with family members and friends. Separate your personal life from your business life to be more professional when it comes to marketing your business.
 Create a business page that is attached to your personal account. The home page is where you create posts and type in your business name and set your logo. You will also see where you can promote your page and create event listings.

 • Add professional images and information

 Upload all of your high-quality images to your business page account— such as your brand logo, images for company history sections on what the company offers to its customers, your administrator profile picture—and set up messaging and contact information, too. You are guided by Facebook on each part. After filling out the information, you can start posting.

 • Develop a posting schedule

 Plan to add posts at least twice a week to begin adding readers and followers. Facebook is good at “nudging” you to add a post, so your business stays in the public eye. If you have the budget, use Facebook Ads to help bring in relevant readers interested in what you offer. You select the demographics of the target readers you want, and Facebook does all the rest. This can build your follower rates faster than if you were to not advertise at all.
 SproutSocial.com suggests the number of characters to use in a post, including spaces between words and punctuation marks. If you do not want to spend time counting character spaces, insert your copy into the free social media character counter located on its page here: sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-character-counter/.

-----

### • Structure of a Facebook post

 1. Start with a good attention-grabbing headline consisting of roughly
 five words. 2. Write, at most, two or three paragraphs, with one or two short
 sentences in each, about 80 characters in total for your whole post. 3. Keep your content brief, interesting, and always related to the
 headline. 4. Add a topic-related image, photograph, or video. 5. Add a link to your topic-related blog, or to an e-mail or newsletter
 sign-up page (optional).

 Facebook posts I make are intended to be thought-provoking and also to elicit comments on the subject matter, both positive and negative. If you are a small business, a one-person sole proprietor, you can create interesting posts that grab readers’ attention. As a business on a Facebook business page, create a post that does not give an opinion, but encourages readers to respond with their own viewpoints. See the samples below.

### This one got a lot of emotional response.

 LINKEDIN

 The focus of LinkedIn is connecting with business professionals who want to contact other professionals and build business relationships. When you want to attract or connect with a certain type of business professional, have some knowledge of their area of expertise before you make a connection with them. Again, doing research will give you important information you can use to gain an initial contact and speak their “language.”
 This is not a place to chat with friends and family members. You will not find children here, so if you are marketing toys to parents and children, this platform may not work for you.

### However, you may find professionals who can help you market your product, or a specialist in search engine optimization (SEO) who can help enhance your Web site and your advertising.
