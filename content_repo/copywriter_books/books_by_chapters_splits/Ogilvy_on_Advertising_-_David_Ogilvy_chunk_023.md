The editors of The Digest are in possession of a remarkable technique: _they know how to_

_present complicated subjects in a way that engages the reader._

This gives The Digest’s editors great in�uence in the world. They put their in�uence to

admirable use.

They are on the side of the angels. They are crusaders, and they carry their crusades, in 14

languages, to 75 million souls a month.

They crusade against cigarettes, which kill people. They crusade against bill-boards, which

make the world hideous. They crusade against boxing, which turns men into vegetables.

They crusade against pornography.

They crusade for integration, for the inter-faith movement, for the Public Defender system,

for human freedom in all its forms.

Good Pope John once told The Digest editors, “How comforting it will be for you, when

you come to the close of your lives on earth, to be able to say to yourselves: We have served

_the truth.”_

**No log-rolling, no backscratching**

Ten years ago Reader’s Digest �rst opened its columns to advertising. This worried me. I

was afraid that The Digest editors would start pulling their punches in deference to

-----

advertisers and even give editorial support to advertisers—an obvious temptation to

magazine editors. But this has not happened; The Digest has remained incorruptible. No

log-rolling, no back-scratching.

The success of The Digest is deserved. It does not depend on prurience, voyeurism or cheap

sensationalism. What The Digest editors o�er their readers are _ideas, education (practical_

and spiritual) and self-improvement.

The instinct of these editors is toward _clarity of_ _expression. The current issue, as I write,_

includes articles on religion in schools, on the Congo, urban renewal, violence on

television, Abraham Lincoln and safe driving. Each of these subjects is presented in a way

which I can understand. If I did not read about them in The Digest, I wouldn’t read about

them anywhere. I wouldn’t have time.

Some highbrows may look down their noses at The Digest, charging it with super�ciality

and over-simpli�cation. There is a modicum of justice in this charge; you can learn more

about the Congo if you read about it in Foreign A�airs Quarterly, and you can learn more

about Abraham Lincoln in Carl Sandburg’s books about him. But have you time?

**Never boring**

I seldom read a highbrow magazine without wishing that a Digest editor had worked his

will upon it. I would then �nd it more readable. The Digest articles are never long-winded,

never obscure, never boring.

I also admire the editors’ _courage. They have the guts to open their readers’ minds on_

delicate subjects. They grasp nettles. Like venereal disease, cancer, mental illness. They are

not humorless prigs. Their sense of humor is uproarious. They make me laugh.

**Editorial technique**

Their _techniques fascinate me. First, the way they present the contents on the cover—a_

tantalizing menu which invites you to the feast inside. (I have never understood why _all_

magazines don’t do this.)

Second, the ingenious way they write the titles on their articles. They pique your curiosity

—and they promise to satisfy it. For example:

_What Truckers Say About your Driving_

-----

Professional drivers sound o� on the most common — and dangerous — faults of the

amateur.

How could anybody resist reading an article with a title like that?

I earn my living as a copywriter in an advertising agency. It is a matter of life and death for

me to get people to read my advertisements. I have discovered that more than half the

battle is to write headlines which grab people’s attention and force them to read the copy. I

_learned how to donhis by studying headlines in The Digest._

The Digest editors do not start their articles in the front of the magazine and carry them

over in the back. They carry you through their magazine without this maddening

interruption, and I bless them for it.

**The battle for men’s minds**

You and I, gentle reader, live in the United States, and we think of The Reader’s Digest as

an American magazine. So it is— 15 million Americans buy it every month. But it is also

published in 20 other countries—10,500,000 copies a month. It is the most popular

magazine in several countries abroad, including all of the Spanish-speaking countries.

The International editions of The Digest carry more or less the same articles as the U.S.

editions. The editors have discovered that subjects which are important to people in Iowa,

California and New York are equally important to people in France, Tokyo and Rio.

Thus it comes about that Digest editors have a profound in�uence on people who are free

to read what they want. This magazine exports the best in American life.

In my opinion, The Digest is doing as much as the United States Information Agency to win

the battle for men’s minds.

Credit where credit is due. I know nobody who deserves the gratitude of their fellow

Americans more than DeWitt and Lila Acheson Wallace. The Digest is the lengthened

shadow of these two great editors. Theirs are the names at the top of the masthead. It is the

most formidable of all mastheads: no less than 208 men and women. Among them you will

�nd some of the most distinguished journalists in the world. No other magazine is so richly

endowed with professional competence.

-----

Some magazines are dominated by the men who sell advertising space. In my experience,

there has never been a good magazine which was not, like The Digest, dominated by its

_edttors._

Long live The Reader’s Digest!

**“Reader’s Digest asked me if I would comment on why I think so many people all**

**over the world read it,” Mr. Ogiivy says. “I agreed to try, because I regard The Digest**

**as a major force for good in the world, and I wanted to say so. In return for my work**

**The Digest will make a donation to Fettes, the Scottish school which gave me my**

**education on a full scholarship.”**

##### GUINNESS GUIDE TO OYSTERS

**CAPE CODS : An oyster of superb �avor. Its chief enemy is the star�sh, which wraps its arms**

about the oyster and forces the valves open with its feet. The battle lasts for hours, until

the star�sh is rewarded with a good meal, but alas, no Guinness.

**OREENPORT : These oysters have a salty �avor all their own. They were a smash hit with the**

whalers who shipped out of Greenport in olden days. Oysters contain iron, copper, iodine,,

calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, Vitamin A, thiamine, ribo�avin and niacin. The

Emperor Tiberius practically lived on oysters.

**BLUEPOINTS : These delicious little oysters from Great. South Bay somewhat resemble the**

famous English ‘natives’ of which Disraeli wrote: “I dined or rather supped at the

Carlton … o� oysters, Guinness and broiled bones,’ and got to bed at half past twelve.

Thus, ended the most remarkable day hitherto of my life.”

**CHINCOTEAGUES : Many epicures regard Chincoteagues as the supreme aristocrats of the**

oyster tribe, but some West Coast gourmets prefer the Olympia oyster, which is no bigger

than your thumbnail. Both Chincoteagues and Olympias are at their best with Guinness.

**OYSTER BAY: Oyster Bays are mild and heavy-shelled. It is said that oysters yawn at night.**

Monkeys know this and arm themselves with small stones. They watch for an oyster to

yawn and then pop the stone in between the shells. “Thus the oyster is exposed to the

greed of the monkeys.”

**LYNNHAVEN : These gigantic oysters were Diamond Jim Brady’s favorites. More �shermen**

are employed catching oysters than any other sea food. The Damariscotta mound in Maine

contains three million bushels of oyster shells, piled there by prehistoric Bradys.

-----

**LL OYSTERS taste their best when xA. washed down with drafts of Guinness—what**

Professor Saintsbury in “Notes On A Cellar-Book” called “that noble liquor—the comeliest

of black malts.” Most of the malt used in brewing Guinness comes from the fertile farms of

### ASouthern Ireland, and the yeast is descended from the yeast used by Guinness in Dublin

one hundred and ninety years ago.

_For a free reprint of this advertisement, suitable for framing, write Arthur Guinness Son & Co.,_

_Inc., 47-24 27th Street. Long Island City, New York._

**NEW ORLEANS: This was Jean La�tte’s oyster, which is now used in Oysters Rockefeller.**

Valuable pearls are never found in ostrea virginica, the family to which East Coast oysters

belong.

**TANGIER : This is one of the sweetest and most succulent oysters. It comes from the Eastern**

Shore of Maryland. Pocahontas fed Tangiers to Captain John Smith, with famous results.

Oysters go down best with Guinness, which has long been regarded as the perfect

complement for all sea-food.

**DELAWARE BAY : This was William Penn’s favorite oyster. Only 15% of oysters are eaten on**

the half-shell. The rest �nd their way into stews, or end their days in a blaze of glory as

“Angels on Horseback.” One oyster was distinctly heard to whistle.

##### Renaissance in Puerto Rico—as seen by a girl of
 �fteen

HE HIGH SCHOOL GIRL in the foreground of our photograph is �fteen. When she was born,

### TPuerto Rico was a “stricken land.”

-----

We wish you could be here to talk to this Puerto Rican girl today.

She might start by telling you about everyday things. The good food her mother buys in

the new supermarket. The new house her family lives in. Her father’s job in one of Puerto

Rico’s new factories.

Then, as she warmed up, she would probably have something to say about her lessons

and her teachers. How they teach her two languages—Spanish and English. How they take

her to museums and art exhibitions and concerts.

And she would surely want to tell you about the interesting television programs that she

and her classmates watch on Channel Six, an admirable new station in San Juan. Channel

Six is an educational station. And it broadcasts to a larger area than any other educational

television station in the Western Hemisphere.

Education is one of the chief goals of Puerto Rico’s remarkable new Operation Serenity. It

receives nearly a third of Puerto Rico’s entire budget. No other country except Israel spends

so much of its budget on education.

Beyond this, the Commonwealth will actually dip into emergency funds to help a gifted

student continue his studies.

Today, one third of Puerto Rico’s total population is going to school — grade school,

high school, vocational school, or one of the island’s universities.

Puerto Rico is proud of her spectacular industrial renaissance. But this “sunny, scrubbed,

and cultured land” is prouder still of the way her people are putting their prosperity to use.

##### Darling, I’m having the most extraordinary
 experience…

###### I’m head over heels in DOVE!

No, darling—DOVE. D—like in delicious.

I told you, sweet. I’m in the tub. Taking a bath. A DOVE bath—my very �rst.

And what a positively gorgeous time I’m having! It’s just as if I’d never _really bathed_

before!

No, dear, it isn’t a soap. Soap was never like this ! So wickedly creamy. That man on TV

said that DOVE is one-quarter cleansing cream—that it creams my skin while I bathe—and

now I really believe him.

Why, DOVE even smells creamy. Such a lovely, lush, expensive smell!

Remember “The Great Ziegfeld,” dear? How Anna Held bathed in milk? And Cleopatra—

one hundred mares or something milked every day for her bath?

Well, darling, I’m all over cream. Just imagine, cream tip to toe. Arms. Legs. All of me!

And clean! Simply smothered in suds. Oodles of suds! Oceans of. I don’t know what I ever

did to deserve DOVE!

And you know how soap leaves your skin so _dry? That nasty stretched feeling? Well,_

DOVE makes me feel all velvet and silk, all soft and smooth. Just the most pampered, most

spoiled, girliest girl in the world.

Darling, I’m purring.

And did I tell you DOVE is sort of me-shaped ? That it’s curved to �t my hand, so it doesn’t

keep slithering away in the tub ? Soap is soap, but a bath with DOVE is heaven!

_And just think, darling—tomorrow night, I can do it again._

NOTE TO EAVESDROPPERS

-----

You can buy the remarkable new bath and toilet bar called DOVE today, DOVE is a

completely new formula. DOVE makes rich lather in hardest water. DOVE leaves _no_

bathtub ring. Lever Brothers guarantee that DOVE is better for your face, your hands, all

_of you, than regular toilet soap. If you don’t agree, well return every penny you paid._

##### Lemon.

This Volkswagen missed the boot.

The chrome strip on the glove compartment is blemished end must be replaced. Chances

ore you wouldn’t have noticed it; Inspector Kurt Kroner did.

There are 3,389 men at our Wolfsburg factory with only one job: to inspect Volkswagens

at each stage of production. 13000 Volkswagens are produced doily; there are more

inspectors than cars.)

Every shock absorber is tested (spot checking won’t do), every windshield is scanned.

VWs have been rejected for surface scratches barely visible to the eye.

Final inspection is really something! VW inspectors run each car o� the line onto the

Funk�onsprufslond (car test stand), tote up 189 check points, gun ahead to the automatic

brake stond, and soy “no” to one VW out of �fty.

This preoccupation with detail means the VW lasts longer and requires less maintenance,

by ond large, thon other cars, lit also means a used VW depreciates less than any other cor.

##### How to take out STAINS

**USE RINSO AND FOLLOW THESE EASY DIRECTIONS**

If you have ever used Rinso in your washer, you’ve probably noticed that it gets clothes

exceptionally white. This is due to the SOLIUM in Rinso.

What many women _don’t know is that Rinso also works like a charm on most common_

stains — if you know how to go about it. Here are some simple, tested hints from the

scientists at Lever Brothers Company. Be _sure fabric is colorfast and washable before_

following these directions.

1. CREASE & OIL. Use warm Rinso suds. Put plenty of Rinso on stained part, rub between

hands.

2. BLOOD. Soak in cold water until stains turn light brown, then wash in warm Rinso suds.

.1. COFFEE & TEA. To remove fresh stains, pour boiling water on stain from 2- or 3-foot

height, then wash in warm Rinso suds. If any stain remains, dry in sun or use bleach. Do

not bleach silk or wool.

4. CRASS. Use hot water and Rinso, rubbing well. If stains remain, use bleach. Once again,

do not bleach silk or wool.

5. OIL PAINT. VARNISH, ENAMEL. Remove fresh stains from washable materials by washing with

plenty of Rinso suds. If stain has dried, soften it �rst by rubbing in Spry, lard or vaseline.

6. MILDEW. Rinso suds will remove very fresh mildew stains from washable materials.

Drying in sun h e lp bleach spots. If stain remains, use bleach except on silk or wool.

-----

7. INDELIBLE LIPSTICK. Work vaseline or lard into stain. Then sponge with cleaning �uid.

Remove any ring which may remain by laundering in Rinso suds. On rayon and colored

materials, use 1 part alcohol to 2 parts water. Then launder with Rinso.

8. CHOCOLATE & COCOA. First scrape o� excess with dull knife, then launder in warm Rinso

suds.

9. CHLOROPHYLL. Wash with warm Rinso suds. If stain remains, use bleach except on silk or
