##### Hundreds of retailers throughout the country have been selling the Nautilus Lower Back machine for its full retail price of $485. Nautilus designed it for the consumer market. Their $3,000 hospital version, used for rehabilitation purposes, was too costly for the average consumer. So Nautilus designed one for the home and sold thousands. Then JS&A got hold of a few thousand and felt that an entirely new market would develope if the unit could sell for $250 or less. But the manufacturer would obviously be concerned as the machine would upset those who had sold the unit for its full price. So by running this special sale and listing the full retail price and with nobody really knowing what price we’re really offering the unit for anyway (I told you my grammar wasn’t good), we can make everybody happy—especially those of you with good spelling skills and with lower backs you want to strengthen. The rules are really quite simple.

# THE RULES

##### Look through this ad trying to find several mispelled words. Circle each mispelled word you find and put the total number of mispelled words in the circle above. Please don’t correct my grammar. Then multiply the number of mispelled words by $10 and then deduct that amount from the $500 price show in this advertisment. We promise to deliver a unit to you for the price you earn. But be careful. If you circle a word that is not mispelled, we reserve the right to return your order and have you arrested. All orders must be mailed in and paid for by check or money order. (We can’t afford the credit card charges, and COD’s are more bother than they are worth and at this price we don’t need the extra espense.) If you just want to enter this sale without purchasing anything, simply send the ad in with the number in the circle. If you guess the correct number of mispelled words, you will get a $10 credit towards all the products listed in our catalog which we will also send you (not all the products, just our catalog). There are a few disclamers. We only have a few thousand of these machines so we reserve the right to run out of them. We also reserve the right to return any order that claims more mispelled words than we’ve actually made. We will ship each unit freight collect with charges usually running around $50 east of the Mississippi or a little more in California. And finally, a little clue. There are three mispelled words in this paragraph.

# DESIGNED FOR THE LOWER
 BACK

##### The Nautilus Lower Back machine is designed to strengthen your lower back. If you’re an executive who sits at a desk for long hours, your back muscles soon grow weak and cannot support your spine and your skeletal frame as it was designed to do. What I like about the back machine is how easy it works to strengthen the back. As little as five minutes a day and three days a week is all the exercise you need to start the program. And since the exercise time is so short and not very strenuous, you can exercise anytime of the day or night. There are ten tension positions. You start at the smallest setting and gradually build up as you increase your strength. In a relatively short time, you’ll be able to feel the difference. I can’t guarantee that your lower back problems will be gone forever, but the Nautilus Lower Back machine can really make a difference. And even with its low price, the Nautilus comes with a 30-day exercise trial period. If the unit doesn’t make a big difference in your exercise program, return the unit to JS&A for a full refund of your purchase price. But act quickly. Once we sell all these units, that’s all we can get. One last thing. Please don’t call our operators to find out the number of mispelled words. The Nautilus Lower Back machine is made out of tubular steel that will take a tremendous amount of abuse. All the contact surfaces are cushioned and covered with black Naugahyde. It takes only a few minutes to assemble it with a screwdriver and wrench and it measures 34½″ × 51″ x 54″ and weighs 150 pounds. The unit comes with a 90- day manufacturer’s limited warranty and complete instructions. Take advantage of this unique opportunity to own one of the finest pieces of exercise equiptment at the lowest possible cost for just being able to count our mispelled words. To order, ask for product by number shown below or send a check to the address below.

I had two surprises with the results from this ad. The first was the number of people who missed many of the words. We made more profit than I had anticipated. There were exactly 25 misspelled words, but on average most people found around 20 of them.
 The second surprise was the number of people who called me to tell me that they had spent hours reading and rereading the ad to find the number of misspelled words even though they had no intention of buying the unit.
 I then used this technique to sell the Franklin Spelling Computer. For the spelling computer, it certainly made sense as it tied into the product nicely. But it was this first Nautilus ad that really launched the concept.
 One of the strong points of this ad was the involvement that it created on the part of the reader. I received mail months later asking me for the correct number of misspelled words. People were spending hours reading my ad. How many ads can claim that distinction?
 The people who found most or all of the words really had a bargain too. And we eventually sold all of our inventory in what was a very successful ad. Bad spelling, bad grammar, who cared? We broke a few rules and came up with a very unique marketing concept that could still work today.

# Preview

##### Let us assume by now that you have understood and mastered the material I have presented. You know how to write great copy and build that slippery slide. You understand the psychological triggers and how effectively they can be used to sell your product or service. And finally, you understand the role of a powerful satisfaction conviction.
 Once you understand the principles of a print mail order ad, you’re ready to apply those principles to enhance all your communication skills. Whether in a radio commercial or on a web site, all the principles apply, with one caveat—some principles are more important than others depending on the format or the medium. Let me explain.
 Whereas in a mail order ad your copy is very important, what techniques work best on TV? What psychological triggers work best on radio or on the Internet? For example, on the Internet there is greater involvement on the part of the prospect. He or she must take an action such as clicking on a button or on a link. So interactivity is an important concept.
 The remainder of this handbook focuses on the various media and how they differ from a print ad, and consequently how to write copy for each format.
 I am also including a large amount of marketing information to help guide you in the copywriting process. If you don’t know the best way to market a particular product or service in a specific medium, how can you write copy for it? So I go into depth and explain the differences and the quirks to watch for as you examine all the media possibilities and their potential.

# Chapter 36

 Writing for Different Media

 Catalogs

##### Here’s a format where copy and graphics play a big role. The catalog cover should present the best picture—the most dramatic shot in the entire catalog or a product that best represents what can be found inside.
 I used to feature a product on the cover of my catalogs that was unusual, novel and different and looked dramatic. It didn’t matter if it wasn’t a big seller. The important point was that it caused the prospect to pause and not just throw the catalog away. The cover is like the headline in a print ad. Its sole purpose is to get you into the catalog and to start reviewing the other products or to put it aside for reading later. You want to avoid it being simply thrown in the trash.
 A good catalog should have a message from the president in the front of the catalog along with his or her picture. This is important. A catalog is like a store. If the store lacked a proprietor, it would seem cold, too big or corporate.
 That personal message at the front of the catalog is like a Wal-Mart associate standing at the entrance of a Wal-Mart store greeting visitors as they walk in. It makes the store more human, makes the proprietor a friendly face you can contact should things not work out to your satisfaction. You feel safe in dealing with the company because you know there is a human behind the catalog and that human is real and reachable. Your copy should reflect this. It should read like a personal letter to your prospects and should express your sincerity and commitment to satisfying their needs. I would rank this letter as one of the most important pieces of copy in the entire catalog.
 Producing a catalog is a matter of arranging graphics and copy in a pleasing and easy-to-follow format. Combining the graphics and copy is

##### similar to creating a print ad. You should have a short but enticing headline, a subheadline that explains a little more about what you are offering and then copy that covers each aspect of the product and its benefits to your prospect.
 It is extremely important to include all the salient features of the product you are selling. Leave out one small fact—even one that may seem insignificant such as a product’s weight—and you’ll reduce your sales. A catalog description should contain all the information you need for your prospect to make a buying decision. Leave out one small fact, and you run the risk of reducing your response. The missing fact gives the buyer an excuse to delay his or her decision. And it raises a question as to whether the product will fit his or her needs. Nobody wants to buy something and then have to return it. So being thorough in your description will make a big difference in the minds of your prospects. They will feel confident that what they buy they will like and keep—always knowing, of course, that they can return the item for any reason.
 The next thing to consider is the environment you create through the graphics and the look of the catalog. If you are sending your catalog to sophisticated buyers, make sure that the copy and the look of the catalog are upscale. If you are selling products in a closeout catalog, you don’t want your catalog to look too slick. Your customer doesn’t expect to see an expensive catalog selling products at really cheap prices. As a guide, set the environment based on the price points you are selling your products for.
 In a mail order ad you should feature a single product or service, leaving variations of that product out of the sales message. But in a catalog you have the opportunity of offering several variations of the main product you might sell in a mail order print ad. In fact, that’s what your customers expect.
 A good example of this was given earlier in this handbook (“Simplicity” in Chapter 19). I offered a single style of the Swiss Army watch and tested it against several styles. The single style offer worked best in the mail order ad, whereas the other watch styles worked best in our catalog.
 Finally, what works exceptionally well for product catalogs is the personal sales message—something that I have used for years with great success. Let each product description sound like a personal conversation with the prospect.

-----

##### Say “I” or “me” or “my,” and talk as if you were a friendly person chatting with your prospect. Your conversation might sound something like, “I was walking down the street when I had this neat idea for my catalog.” Such rhetoric combines storytelling and the personal approach to advertisng, which I strongly recommend.
 In the case of a catalog, think of it as a store, sell in it like you would in a store and show your enthusiasm for the products you sell through your copy and your use of the first person.
 If something is important, give it more space. Make sure you have your toll-free phone number on each page. Often a prospect will tear out a page and throw away the rest of the catalog only to discover later that the toll- free number is missing. And even if your prospect keeps the entire catalog, having your phone number on each page will make ordering easier.
 Use an easy-to-remember toll-free phone number. Use words to make up the number. When I call FedEx for a pickup, all I have to remember is 1- 800-GOFEDEX. And if you do use words to convey a phone number, also include the actual numbers to make it easier for the prospect to dial.
 The toll-free number should be large and rather obvious on the order form. Most people will order over the phone or go to a web site to order. So why not make the order form show that toll-free number and web site address loud and clear?
 Then make sure that your order form is easy to fill out and provides plenty of room to list all the necessary information. If most people respond on the phone with the toll-free number or on your web site, though, why even have a catalog order form? The answer is that many catalog buyers first list their purchases on the order form before they actually call and order. It makes the ordering process go faster and is a convenient record for the customer.
 Finally, make sure that each operator who takes an order on the phone has a script to sell something else after the customer places an order. This will certainly add incremental business and increase catalog profits.

# Flyers: Insert Stuffers, Bounce
 Backs, and Broadsides

##### The common thread that all of these formats have is that they are after-the- sale advertisements. Once you’ve made the sale, you should place something in the package you are shipping that offers something your new customer might also be interested in.
 The piece might contain offers on some of the other products you sell. It might even be a catalog designed specifically for new customers. Or even the catalog from which the order was originally made. It usually doesn’t cost any more postage to ship these solicitations. And since it is being sent to a customer, there is a better chance that it will be read and acted upon than if it was simply sent to a prospect.
 Insert stuffers and bounce backs are flyers that are placed in packages going to customers. A broadside is the flyer folded to fit in a standard-sized #10 business envelope.
 In the case of these solicitations, the piece you design should use a similar format to your catalog page to provide a level of continuity. Use an attention-getting headline, use bullet points where appropriate and don’t forget to provide that all-important ordering information—a coupon with your address, toll-free phone number, and web site address.
