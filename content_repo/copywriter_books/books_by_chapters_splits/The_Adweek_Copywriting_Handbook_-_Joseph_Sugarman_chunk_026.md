##### mechanisms programmed in his or her brain. The copy seems to flow out through a filter that comes only from experience.
 However, the need for editing is sometimes unpredictable regardless of your experience. You could produce copy that needs plenty of editing or you could end up with excellent copy that never needs much at all.

# Read the Periodicals

##### I’m always amazed at the lack of editing I see in many of the periodicals I read. Phrases like “Finally, it is important to note that . . .” can be totally eliminated and not affect the flow or understanding of what follows. Another example: “Fortunately or unfortunately as the case may be . . .” is not really required to make the information that follows clearer. Many of the articles written in periodicals contain these unnecessary preliminaries that fill up space but mean very little. In writing effective copy you can’t afford to be too wordy.
 If you’d like a little practice, take a look at the examples that follow and edit them yourself, or read any periodical and edit the copy by seeing how many extraneous words can be eliminated. Or write a draft and practice this critical skill.
 Example 1: About the only redeeming feature of this product is that we don’t have huge quantities to sell. The importer is afraid to order too many for fear that nobody in their right mind would buy it let alone sell it. So we only have a few hundred to sell as part of this test program. Example 2: I was sitting in an office in New York City talking to a very successful friend and businessman whom we’ll call Stuart. I told Stuart that I had to make a very critical decision in my business. I needed some guidance and advice. When I started writing a great deal of copy in the 1970s, I would use a legal pad and ballpoint pen and write my draft in longhand. I would then give it to my secretary, who would type it out for me in rough draft form, usually double-spaced.
 I would then make my editing corrections and hand it back to my secretary for her to retype. And this process would continue for several drafts until it was in a final form for the typesetter.

# Computers Are a Great Help

##### When computers with word processing programs first came on the scene, I resisted using them. I was used to writing the copy in longhand and to switch to a computer and keyboard seemed difficult. But I made the transition sometime in the early 1980s on an Apple II computer and I haven’t looked back since.
 Writing copy on a computer makes the editing process very easy. Word processing allows you to pick words or entire sentences and drag them to another place in the copy. Sophisticated spell-checkers whiz through copy and correct your spelling even as you type. Thesauruses, grammar-checkers and all sorts of editing aids are built into every decent word processing program. Today, I never have to give a draft to a secretary. I type it in draft form first on the computer and then do all my editing, often before I even print my copy. The computer has done more for my copywriting and editing than any other single factor, and it is making a difference for copywriters everywhere.
 Another technique that will help you in the editing process is time. If you can put aside your copy after you edit it and look at it the next day or even in a few days, you will often discover things that you never saw before. If time is critical, put the copy down for a short while and then get back to it. The key is to allow time for your subconscious mind to digest what you’ve done and pick out the areas that need work.
 Many other rules for editing can be found in English textbooks and style books. There are also other books on writing that cover this subject very nicely. In fact, it was a book I read in college that really opened my mind to the importance of editing in the copywriting process.
 Finally, after you think you have that perfect final draft—a draft so well edited that you can’t possibly make one more correction—ask somebody who is a professional editor or an English major to correct the English and grammar that you missed. This does not mean that you have to accept all of the changes. Sure, you want to correct the spelling and the dangling modifiers and any other instances of terrible grammar that may negatively impress your prospects. But then simply weigh each one of the changes and if you feel that any interfere with the style of your writing and your original

# The Use of Commas

##### A good example is the use of commas. There are two schools of thought— one that uses a lot of commas and the other that does not. I do not believe in too many commas as they take up space. And as a copywriter you don’t have much space to work with. So I use commas where the rules of grammar are clear that they are needed for clarification. I don’t use commas in places where I am not violating any grammatical rules or where they are considered optional. For example, when three items are grouped together, such as “apples, oranges and tomatoes,” I don’t use a serial comma after “oranges.”
 I would have both my sister Judy, who is a high school teacher, and Mary Stanke, my associate at JS&A, proof all my copy. I didn’t accept all their changes but I certainly paid a lot of attention to them.
 It is important that you do make your copy as free from error as possible. If you don’t, it reflects badly on the integrity of your offer. It raises doubts in the minds of your readers. They may think, “If this guy can’t get his grammar straight, how do I know he runs his business right?”
 A good example of how a prospect thinks is reflected in a letter I received from an irate reader of one of the airline magazines in which we ran the ad for our Consumers Hero club. We received the following:
 Dear Sir: Despite the intended conversational tone of the attached advertisement, no license within consumer-oriented ad writing permits the type of glaring poor grammar usage circled in paragraph five of your copy. “We better not” may occur in sloppy, colloquial speech, but it is not acceptable in writing. The phrase should read, “we’d better not,” of course. I cannot believe that your ad agency would permit such poor proofing in an ad which finds its way into the hands of a sharp consumer such as the type which pays the kind of money required to purchase an airline ticket today, and thus is inflicted with this bad grammar in a captive audience magazine like the attached. The above individual took the time to write us about a simple grammar error. How many others saw it and didn’t respond? And whenever we do

##### make a mistake, our readers do usually find it.
 One editing error was actually quite funny. In copy describing a blood pressure unit, I wrote, “blood pressure can be very dangerous” instead of “high blood pressure can be very dangerous.” Nobody picked it up. Sometimes I’m amazed at what the public misses and what they complain about, but the fact remains that in the editing process you really do want to be as thorough as possible.
 What I have conveyed in this chapter is simply how important the editing process is, the value of editing in terms of the final copy, and some of the logic I use in the editing process.
 Now you’re ready for some interesting, subtle and sophisticated insights into copywriting. By now you understand the entire copywriting process, can write an ad and edit it. In Section Two, I give you some of the significant insights I’ve gained during years of experience.

##### Now comes the fun part. In the following chapters you’ll find not only insights and tips on how to write copy but also revelations of what has worked exceptionally well during my 30-year career as a copywriter.
 This section contains only five chapters. But packed into these chapters is the heart of this book—the basis for the copy I write and many of my copywriting secrets. It’s an education that cost me millions to learn and you’re going to learn it for the simple price of this book.
 In my seminar promotional outline, I listed several topics that would be presented, one of which was “The 64 Points Every Ad Should Cover.” And very often, my seminar participants, in anticipation of coming to the seminar, would sit down and in advance list some points to see if they could guess what I taught in the course.
 Typically, they knew maybe six or seven of the points. And typically, they were amazed at what they didn’t know. You’ve already learned the first 10 of these points, the graphic elements of an ad, in Chapter 4. You’re now about to discover the rest—23 copy elements and 31 psychological triggers to buying. And from the other chapters in this section you will further build the base you need in order to write incredibly effective copy.
 So study this section completely and continue to build your solid copywriting foundation.

# Chapter 18

 Powerful Copy Elements Explained

##### Remember our discussion about graphic elements in Chapter 4? We explained that each of these elements was designed to get prospects to do only one thing—read the first sentence. And we explained how important the first sentence was in your copy.
 And if we know that all those graphic elements are designed to get you to read the first sentence and eventually all of the copy, then the next thing we should address is the nature of the copy elements in an advertisement.
 In this chapter, I will cover all the copy elements and their relationship to the advertisement—23 concepts that you should review for each ad you write.
 1. Typeface: This element is really important. If you’re a graphic designer, you know that each typeface has its own personality, emotion and legibility. And that’s the point of this subject. You’ve got to determine the combination of personality and legibility that will make your ad easy to read and inviting. Since we are talking about copy here, we are talking about only one style of type, called “serif” type. Serif type has short protruding lines whereas the other style of type, called “sans serif,” doesn’t. The type used for the text of this book is serif type. Why? Because in legibility tests, serif type produced greater comprehension than sans serif type and by a 5 to 1 margin. I didn’t discover this until well into my writing career, but now all my ads are printed in serif type. This was one test I wish I had known about earlier. Another important factor is the legibility of all your typefaces in other parts of your ad such as the headline, subheadline and various headings. Fancy type might look elegant to the type designer, but if it can’t be read it has no value. It’s like talking to a foreigner and finding the words difficult to understand. The most important role a typeface has is to allow the

##### greatest comprehension possible, and the second role, less important by far, is to convey the image of a company.
 2. First Sentence: This we discussed in Chapter 4 as the purpose of all the graphic elements of an ad—to get the prospect to read that all- important first sentence. Keep your first sentence short, easy to read and compelling enough to cause the reader to read the next sentence. 3. Second Sentence: This sentence is almost as important as the first. You’ve got to maintain interest, so you must also create another sentence with a compelling reason to cause your reader to want to continue. You must continue this momentum throughout the first and second paragraphs. Put aside any facts, benefits or product features. Your only goal is to get the momentum going and create that buying environment. 4. Paragraph Headings: In Chapter 4, paragraph headings are mentioned as one of the graphic elements in a print ad. They are supposed to make the copy look less intimidating, and thus encourage the reader to read all the copy. But paragraph headings are also a copy element that needs to be addressed in this chapter as well. Paragraph headings could introduce material in the paragraph that follows or they could have absolutely nothing to do with the copy underneath or the copy in the entire ad for that matter. Remember, they are designed to break up the copy and make it look less intimidating. They have little to do with selling or presenting your product. They simply make the copy look more inviting so your reader will start the reading process.
 When a reader looks at copy that appears like one continuous paragraph, subconsciously it looks a lot more difficult to read than copy that is broken up into neat little chunks headed by various paragraph headings.
 Use paragraph headings to break up copy in the middle of columns but not at the very end or beginning. Avoid placing paragraph headings right next to each other in two adjoining columns.
 As I just mentioned, your paragraph headings could say anything. I once ran an ad for a radar speed indicator, and as a test I used the most outrageous paragraph headings you could think of. They included “Scrambled Eggs,” “Working and Playing” and “Success and Good Things.” Even though the headings had absolutely nothing to do with the ad copy, they drew absolutely no attention. Nobody ever asked me what the headings meant or commented that they were not consistent with the copy.

##### But had I misspelled a word in the body of the ad, I would have heard plenty about it.
 The primary purpose of paragraph headings is to get the reader to read the copy by making the copy look less intimidating.
 A secondary purpose might be to arouse curiosity. Maybe my “Scrambled Eggs” paragraph heading did just that—created curiosity and caused somebody to start reading the copy to find out what scrambled eggs had to do with the product I was offering. Although I’ve never tested to see if this was the case, my experience with paragraph headings tells me that curiosity does play a minor role but the main purpose of these headings is to make the copy less intimidating.
 5. Product Explanation: Sounds simple. Sounds basic. But you’ll be amazed at how many ads leave out the simple step of explaining what the product does. A rule of thumb here is to explain a complicated product in a very simple way and explain a simple product in a very complex way. For example, I once sold a smoke detector. At the time it was a very common household product whose function was clearly understood by the consumer. In short, the product was simple. In the ad I wrote for an expensive brand, I told a story about the inside workings of my smoke detector. I described the gold contacts (which every other smoke detector had) and even explained how the comparator circuit functioned to determine if there was smoke in the room. Even though this smoke detector cost $10 more than the average market price, it was a big success. The ad illustrates a way to present a simple product in a complicated way. You should sell a simple product that is clearly understood by the consumer in a more complicated way and a more complicated product in a very simple way.
 When I first explained the computer to my customers, it was always a very simple explanation of what it could do for them. My ad was not about the technology inside (although some reference was made to the inside) but focused on the simplicity of the product and its use. At this time, consumers were just getting into computers. They were new, seemed complicated to use and indeed many were. By explaining computers in very simple and basic terms without getting too complicated, I was able to ease them into a purchase.
