By far the biggest development in public relations in the twenty-first century is “DTC PR”—direct-to-consumer public relations.
 In the twentieth century, press releases were sent to and seen by media outlets only: newspaper editors and reporters, magazine editors, program directors and radio stations, and television producers. This is “DTM PR”— direct-to-media public relations—and indeed virtually all PR was DTM PR.
 These media professionals either threw the press releases in the trash because the content was not of interest to them or used some of the material in their publication or broadcast. Most commonly, some of the content in the release was used as source material for stories the reporters and editors were working on.
 Or sometimes, most notably in trade magazines and newsletters, an excerpt from the press release was published as a short stand-alone item. On occasion, the publication would print the entire release almost word for word as you gave it to them, when the topic was of great interest to readers and all the content was interesting or useful—or it saved the publication’s staff writer from having to do the work herself.
 Now, press releases are also used in DTC PR. The marketer’s Web site typically has a section called “Press Releases,” “Press Room,” “News,” or

-----

### “Media.” All or at least major press releases distributed to the media are also posted in the PR section of the site, typically in HTML, where visitors can read them directly, as they were written, without the vetting or editing by the media.
 There is virtually no difference between DTM and DTC press releases save one. When preparing to post your DTC PR on your Web site, make sure to judiciously add relevant keywords to the text. This can help ensure that the press release shows up when prospects are searching that keyword. In addition, having a lot of press releases on your site can raise your search engine rankings, because Google and other search engines give higher ranking to content than to sales copy such as product pages.

 WHAT IS A PRESS RELEASE?

 A press release is a news story prepared by an organization and distributed to the media for the purpose of publicizing the organization’s products, services, or activities.
 Here’s a sample of an effective release typed in the proper press-release format:

**INTRODUCTORY KIT FOR NEW “RUFF-PROOFS” COLOR COMPS OFFERED BY**
**PINWHEEL SYSTEMS**

A special Introductory Kit of watercolor dyes and other supplies which can be used with its
new “Ruff-Proofs” do-it-yourself coloring system has been developed by Pinwheel Systems,
New York, it was announced today by John N. Schaedler, president of the company.

Ruff-Proofs are latent-image prints made from black and white artwork. They can be
transformed into multicolor art for layout and design comps, packaging, flip charts and other
graphics, Schaedler said, merely by applying watercolor dyes or markers. (Patents are pending
on the process.)

The prints are delivered in sets of four to give the artist an opportunity to experiment with
different colors and explore varying color combinations. They are available from franchised
Pinwheel Studios.

The Introductory Kit has a retail value of $45, Schaedler said, and is being offered to artists
and designers for $20 with the purchase of Ruff-Proofs. It contains a complete set of coloring
materials:

A 36-bottle assortment of Dr. P. H. Martin’s Synchromatic Transparent Watercolor Dyes,
with a swatch card of actual color chips.

A 30-cup palette for mixing colors, squeeze-bottle dispensers for water and cleanup
solution, plus absorbent tissues and cotton swabs used in the coloring process.

More information about the kits and the Ruff-Proofs process is available from John Schaedler
at Pinwheel Systems, 404 Park Avenue South, New York, NY, telephone XXX-ABC-DEFG.

### Here are twelve tips on press-release format and content.

 1. What you say is more important than using fancy PR letterheads or layouts. Clarity and accuracy are critical.
 2. When an outside public relations firm writes the release for you, its name and your own should appear as the sources for the release. If you wrote the release yourself, you become the sole source for more information. Either way, be sure to include names and phone numbers so the editor can get more information if needed.
 3. The release can be dated with a release date or with the phrase “For Immediate Release.” Date the release one day in advance of the actual distribution date to make it timely.
 4. Place the release date under the headline and underline it. 5. The headline should sum up your story. Maximum length: two to three lines. This tells a busy editor, at a glance, if the story is worth considering.
 6. The lead contains the “who, what, when, where, why, and how.” If the editor chops everything else, at least you’ve gotten the guts of your story across.
 7. Include a person to be credited if there’s something worth quoting or if you make any claims. Editors don’t want to take the position they are

-----

### claiming something—they’d rather hang it on you. The personal credits often get deleted, but it’s wise to put them in where needed.
 8. The body of the story picks up the additional facts. Lay off the superlatives and complimentary adjectives. Remember, the press releases is content, not advertising.
 9. Length: shoot for a single page, no more than two pages. Beyond that, reading becomes a burden for the editor.
 10. When the reader might need it, include the name, address, phone number, and e-mail of someone to contact for more information.
 11. Photos, visuals, and graphics can be pasted into the body of the e- mail. But add a note to the editor that separate image files of 300 dots per inch (dpi) are available upon request.
 12. Keep the release simple, straightforward, newsy. If you need only two paragraphs, don’t write ten. Excess verbiage turns editors off, especially now that most releases are distributed via e-mail or online PR distribution services rather than mailed as hard copies.

 YES, BUT IS IT NEWS?

 Editors look for press releases containing news. Like a good ad, the headline of the press release must instantly transmit the news to the reader.
 Editors are flooded with press releases and don’t have time to wade through your release and dig for the real story: an editor at a technology magazine said her staff received two thousand press releases a month. Your release must telegraph the news in the first five seconds of reading.
 But what makes for a news story? It depends on your industry and your audience. Forbes and Fortune would not consider publication of your new ball-bearing catalog to be news. But the editors of Machine Design, Design News, and other trade magazines whose readers use ball bearings might very well run a short news release on the catalog and a picture of its cover.
 One thing that is not news is advertising and promotion. Editors will not publish descriptive stories about your product, service, or organization unless the story tells them something new or provides service information useful to the publication’s readers.

-----

### A press release with the headline, “Ajax Dry Cleaners Provides Top- Quality Cleaning at Reasonable Prices” will not generate any coverage. But if Ajax sent out a release titled “Ajax Dry Cleaners Offers Expert Advice on How to Remove Tough Stains,” editors might reprint the advice as a how-to article. Ajax gets publicity by being listed as the source of the expert advice.
 Here is a list of possible topics for news releases about your company. They all hold interest because they contain either news or useful information, or both. You can write a press release about:

 A new product An old product with a new name or package A product improvement A new version or model of an old product An old product available in new materials, colors, or sizes A new application of an old product New accessories available for an old product The publication of new or revised sales literature—brochures, catalogs, data sheets, surveys, reports, reprints, white papers A speech or presentation given by an executive An expert opinion on any subject A controversial issue New employees Promotions within the firm Awards and honors won by your organization or its employees Original discoveries or innovations (such as patents) New stores, branch offices, headquarters, facilities New sales reps, distributors, agents Major contracts awarded to your firm Joint ventures Management reorganization Major achievements, such as number of products sold, increase in sales, quarterly earnings, safety record Unusual people, products, ways of doing business

-----

### Case histories of successful applications, installations, projects Tips and hints (“how-to” advice) Change of company name, slogan, or logo Opening of a new business Special events such as a sale, party, open house, plant tour, contest, or sweepstakes Charitable acts or other community relations

 The only type of press release that does not need to contain news is the “background release,” or “backgrounder.” Backgrounders present a brief overview of your company.
 Even though the backgrounder is not, strictly speaking, a news story, you should try to put something new, or at least some little-known fact or startling piece of information, in the backgrounders you write. This will grab an editor’s interest more strongly than a bland summary of your organizational chart.
 Another special type of press release is the “fact sheet.” Fact sheets contain detailed information, usually in list form, too lengthy to be included in the body of the main release.
 A press release announcing the opening of a new gourmet food store might be distributed with a fact sheet listing recipes for three or four of the store’s specialties. A fact sheet for a consulting firm could contain a list of clients or brief biographies of the firm’s principals.
 Often copywriters are faced with a client who wants publicity and asks us to write a press release but has nothing new to report. In such instances, a creative publicist or copywriter can “manufacture” a hook or angle strong enough to gain the media’s attention.
 For instance, when Jericho Communications, a New York City PR firm, was looking for a way to gain publicity for its client Domino’s Pizza, someone said, “When we work late at night, we order pizza. Maybe the White House does the same thing. Can we see whether pizza deliveries to the White House increase when there is a national emergency?”
 Sure enough, they did. And Jericho created the “Pizza Meter,” publicizing the fact that you could judge the state of the nation by the

### volume of pizza delivery to the White House. The tactic was successful, garnering major media coverage for the pizza maker.
 When Giga Pets were the rage, my then seven-year-old son dropped his into the toilet and was upset that it “died” (the water shorted out the electronics). To make him feel better, we buried the Giga Pet in our backyard and held a mock funeral, which gave me an idea for some PR.
 I sent out the press release below, and within a week a major New Jersey newspaper did a large feature article on our “Giga Pet cemetery” (please don’t send for the booklet, which I lost track of long ago).

MICROCHIP GARDENS, WORLD’S FIRST “GIGAPET CEMETERY,” OPENS IN
NORTHERN NJ

When 7-year-old Alex Bly’s Giga Pet died after he dropped it in the toilet, he couldn’t find a
place to bury it. So his father, NJ-based entrepreneur Bob Bly, created Microchip Gardens—
the world’s first Giga Pet cemetery—in the family’s suburban backyard.

Now if your child’s Giga Pet dies and can’t be revived, instead of unceremoniously tossing it
in the trash, you can give it a proper burial in a beautiful, tree-lined resting place.

For fees starting at $5, based on plot location and method of interment (burial, mausoleum,
cremation), Bly will give your dearly departed Giga Pet an eternal resting place in Microchip
Gardens, complete with funeral service and burial certificate.

“Even Giga Pets don’t last forever,” said Bly. “There are pet cemeteries for dogs and cats; now
Giga Pets have one, too.”

To help owners get the most pleasure from Giga Pet ownership, Bly—author of 35 published
books including _The “I Hate Kathie Lee Gifford” Book (Kensington) and_ _The Ultimate_
_Unauthorized Star Trek Quiz Book (HarperCollins)—has written an informative new booklet,_
“Raising Your Giga Pet.”

The booklet covers such topics as purchasing your first Giga Pet; taking the pet home; care and
feeding; and play and discipline. Giga Pet burial rituals and the origins of Microchip Gardens
are also covered.

To get your copy of “Raising Your Giga Pet,” which includes complete information on the
Microchip Gardens Giga Pet cemetery, send $4 to: CTC, 22 E. Quackenbush Avenue, Dumont,
NJ 07628.

### QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PRESS RELEASES

 Here are some questions I’m frequently asked by companies that are just getting into public relations:

**Q:** _What’s the best length for a press release?_
**A: For a new product release, one to two pages. If you have a lot to tell, three pages is acceptable.**
But certainly no longer than that.

Case histories and backgrounders usually run longer; three to five pages is average. If it takes
more than five pages to tell your story, make it a feature article, not a press release.

**Q:** _Is it better if the release comes from a PR firm or straight from the company?_
**A: What counts is not who wrote the release, but whether the release contains interesting news**
clearly presented. Some people have a theory that editors are wary of dealing with public relations
people and prefer to go straight to the source. I know a few editors who feel this way. But the
majority don’t.

**Q:** _How do I reproduce the release?_
**A: Offset printing is best and doesn’t cost very much. Photocopies are acceptable if they are crisp,**
sharp, and free of smudges or streaks. Or you can run off copies on your laser printer. Today, most
releases are distributed electronically.

**Q:** _Do I need to send a photo out with my release?_
**A: It’s helpful but not mandatory. An interesting photo of a product, person, plant, process, or**
package will heighten the editor’s interest. Remember, most magazines and papers publish
pictures as well as words.

Paste a few of your most interesting photos in the body of the e-mail, and also offer to send
them as 300 dpi color images in a separate file the editor can request. If the photo files are too
large, send in a Dropbox.

**Q:** _What’s the best way to distribute a press release?_
**A: The basic methods are postal mail and online, with most marketers using the latter.**

Do not send a press release or any other copy as an attached e-mail file to an editor who does
not know you and is not expecting it; the editor will delete it without opening it for fear of
catching malware or a computer virus. When in doubt, call editors prior to sending your release
and ask how they prefer to receive materials.

### WRITING A FEATURE ARTICLE

 Copywriters also get called upon to “ghostwrite” full-length feature stories for trade and business publications.
 Take a look at some trade journals. They contain many articles written by outside contributors: scientists, engineers, managers, and other professionals employed by companies.

-----

### These contributors write not for pay (most trade journals pay a small honorarium or nothing at all) but to promote their own careers as well as the companies they work for. Many companies have a regular scheduled program of placing feature articles in magazines. And they hire professional writers to ghostwrite these articles.
 Another option is to post the article on your blog. Include a link to a page with more detail on the subject matter. Opinions on optimal blog length vary, but 500 to 1,000 words is common.
 Although each article is different, there are four basic types of articles that magazines publish:

 1. Case Histories

 A case history article is a product “success story.” It tells the story of how a product, service, or system was helpful to a specific customer.
 Case history reporting derives its effectiveness from the principle that what works for one customer might work for others. Case histories are effective, too, because they’re credible. They deal in specifics rather than in claims or generalities. Finally, case histories are an inherently storytelling approach to selling.
 Here’s how a typical case history article gets started. A telephone manufacturer installs a new office phone system in a customer’s sales office. The office manager finds that the new system has increased the productivity of the sales force by 25 percent and cut phone bills in half.
 When the telephone manufacturer gets wind of this, he asks the office manager or other company executive if he can write up this success story and place it with an appropriate trade journal. If the manager agrees, the telephone manufacturer hires a writer.
 The writer interviews the office manager at the sales firm and writes the story. After it is approved, it is submitted to the magazine and published. The byline may be that of the manufacturer, the manager, the magazine editor, or the writer. It depends on the nature of the article.

 2. How-to Articles
