##### of the CB frequencies, I was able to capture a major chunk of the CB market.
 The minute there is a lot of publicity about something and it has the potential to turn into a fad, you could have a great opportunity to link it onto something that you’re doing either to get publicity or to promote a product.
 Fads are very powerful. And you now understand the basic concept of linking. But how does this help you as a copywriter?
 Whenever I sell a new product or a unique feature of a new concept, I use linking. I take what is familiar to the prospect, relate it to the object I am selling, and create a bridge in the mind of my prospect. Because of this linking, the prospect needs to think a lot less to understand the new product. The product is easier to relate to the needs of the prospect. Everybody wins.

## Linking a Body Part

##### My ad for a smoke detector was an example of this process. The headline read: “The Nose.” I talked about the smoke detector not as a smoke detector (many such devices were already being sold) but as a nose that sat on your ceiling and sniffed the air. When it smelled smoke, it set off an alarm. I took the very human and simple concept of a nose—a part of the body whose function is well understood—and then linked it to an electronic device.
 In the ad I also used linking to express quality. For example, I talked about the integrated circuits using gold for the contact points. My prospect was then able to link the expense and quality of gold to this product to arrive at a quality link and justify its higher price. In actuality, every integrated circuit used gold for its contact points, so this wasn’t revolutionary, but nobody had taken the time to explain it to the consumer.
 I have used linking in many other ways. For example, I had a product that was a remote car starter. You pressed a button on a remote control device and your car automatically started. I called it “The Mafia Auto Gadget.” Can you see the linkage with this product? No? Well, I explained it in the ad. The Mafia often used explosives activated by a car’s ignition to eliminate competition. Because this device started the car for you at a distance, it eliminated the fear and concern for any Mafia member. Of course, the market was also broadened to include those people who simply liked the convenience of prestarting their cars on hot or cold days and having the cars reach a pleasant temperature before they got in. But the positioning of the product was done with a link that the consumer could understand—the Mafia.
 Today, such a device might be linked to the terrorist car bombings in Iraq or a threat to homeland security—both strong but unpleasant trends. I doubt the product would be popular today, not to mention the poor association this link would make. This is also a perfect example of why it often doesn’t pay to copy a successful campaign of the past. But that is another issue.
 I could give you many examples. The main point to remember about linking, though, is that it should relate the product or service you are selling to something that is easy for your prospect to identify with so that you bridge the mental gap in the mind of the prospect.

##### Usually products are simply improved versions of previously sold products. You need to relate the older product to the new version to explain the differences.
 One of the hardest things to use linking for is a miracle product—a product that is too good to believe. For example, I was selling a pill to be put in the gas tank of your car; it would improve gas mileage and clean out the engine, and had 10 times the fuel additives of super unleaded fuel. It was truly an amazing product and difficult to link to anything that existed in the marketplace. We used the phrases “vitamins for your car” and “tuneup in a pill” as a few of our links.
 Linking is a basic human emotional system of storing experiences and knowledge and then recalling those experiences and linking them to something we have to deal with on a daily basis or that is in the public’s consciousness. We often link. When President John F. Kennedy died, I was in the military in Frankfurt, Germany, and his assassination took place in the evening Frankfurt time. I remember where I was at that precise moment and remember the confusion and the personal pain I felt. I linked every image and emotion to that moment in time. Do you remember where you were when you first found out about the attacks on September 11th?

# 15. Consistency

##### As a direct marketer, I have determined that the most important thing you can do to turn a prospect into a customer is to make it incredibly easy for that prospect to commit to a purchase, regardless of how small that purchase may be. It is therefore imperative that the commitment be simple, small, and in line with the prospect’s needs.
 Once the commitment is made and the prospect becomes a customer, the playing field suddenly changes. There now exists a level of commitment and consistency, directed in your favor, to encourage future purchases.
 A good example of this can be seen at a car dealership. The salesperson tallies your purchase, gets approval from the general manager, and then has you sign the paperwork. As she is walking away to get the car prepped and ready for you to drive away, she turns to you and says, “And you do want that undercoating, don’t you?” You instinctively nod your head. The charge is added to your invoice. “And you’ll also want our floor mats to keep your car clean as well, won’t you?”
 Or how about the times when you order something from a catalog and say to yourself, “Since I’m going through the trouble or ordering, let’s see what else they have that I might like,” and you end up ordering more.
 Once a commitment is made, the tendency is to act consistently with that commitment. The customer nods his head.
 A good example of this phenomenon was told to me by Jon Spoelstra, the former general manager of the Portland Trailblazers basketball team and president of the New Jersey Nets. One of his primary jobs was to sell tickets. “I would personally visit a prospect, sell him a simple yet basic ticket package, start to leave, and then turn around just as I was about to walk out the door and offer something else. Very often my customer would simply nod his head and say under his breath, ‘Yeah, sure, add that to it, too.’ ”
 One of the important points to remember is to always make that first sale simple. Once the prospect makes the commitment to purchase from you, you can then easily offer more to increase your sales. This is equally true for products sold from a mail order ad or from a TV infomercial. I have learned to keep the initial offer extremely simple. Then, once the prospect

##### calls and orders the product I am offering, and while the prospect is on the phone, I offer other items and end up with a larger total sale. An additional sale occurs over 50 percent of the time, depending on my added offer.
 Once you’ve committed to the original purchase, you are poised for a course of action consistent with what you have already undertaken. In the case of buying, you are now primed to buy more by virtue of the original commitment to buy.

# 16. Harmonize

##### An important lesson I taught at the seminar was learned from the story of how the late Bobby Darin, a popular singer of the 1950s and 1960s, became famous.
 As a young singer in New York, for a long time Darin tried unsuccessfully to break into the music business. He would go from record company to record company trying to convince them to make an album of him singing old popular standards.
 He was rejected. Nobody believed that the music industry would accept old popular songs from an unknown young singer. Besides, the hot music at the time was good old rock and roll sung by black artists and called the Motown sound.
 Darin was quite frustrated, so he took things into his own hands. Did he cut his own album by himself? No, he didn’t have the money. Did he convince a record company to record him? Yes, but not the songs he so desperately wanted to record. Instead he sat down and wrote a tune that fitted or harmonized with what the public was buying at the time.
 The tune he wrote was called “Splish Splash,” and the lyrics started out, “Splish splash, I was takin’ a bath, ‘round about a Saturday night.” It went on to tell a story about what happened when he took that bath. The song was good old Motown rock and roll and he easily sold this music to a record company, which recorded it with Darin singing the lead. “Splish Splash” became a smash hit and sold millions of records. In the recording, he even sounded like a Motown recording artist.
 Darin recognized what the market wanted and was buying at the time, and he created something that harmonized perfectly with that market, even though his song was far from the music that was in his heart. He made the practical choice to put aside his desires, put aside his ego and goals, and just cut a record that would sell and earn him the recognition he needed to record the type of music he really wanted to record.
 Despite the hit record, which became a million seller, he still couldn’t interest any record company in recording him for a pop album. So he took all his earnings from the success of “Splish Splash” and made the album himself. One of the songs he recorded was his version of an old Kurt Weill

##### song called “Mack the Knife.” Not only was his album a smash hit, but “Mack the Knife” became a multimillion-selling single throughout the world. Bobby Darin went on to be known not for “Splish Splash” but for the music he loved best—popular jazz oldies.

## Lessons from Bobby Darin

##### There are many lessons to be learned from this one example. First, realize that often you must go with the established way of doing things in order to accomplish your goals. You’ve got to pattern yourself after what is working and then harmonize with the marketplace. Once you have an established reputation, it’s easier to try something different that you yourself want to do.
 So first you meet the needs of the market to raise the capital you need and then you go for your dreams. Once you’ve raised your own funds, you can do anything you want. You can pursue a course of action that nobody else would believe possible.
 I also use the Bobby Darin example to convince people who come to me with a concept or idea that seems really too far out of the mainstream that they have to harmonize with the marketplace. In some cases, their product needs a slightly different twist to work, even though that is not what they envisioned for the product. The change usually involves removing a component or making the product cheaper or presenting it in a totally new and simple way. Let me cite one perfect example.
 It was 1973 and the president and national sales manager of a calculator company, APF, came to me with their new product. They were all excited about it and felt that they had the greatest and most exciting breakthrough in electronics since the calculator was invented.
 So confident were they that they were willing to pay for the cost of my test ad. “Joe, this product is so hot that you’ll sell millions,” said the president of the company.
 At the time, prices were still quite high for calculators, so $69.95 was a very attractive price back then for a good desk calculator with a large display. APF had sold their calculators successfully at $69.95 but felt that with their latest innovation, they had the ultimate product for my company —truly a revolution in electronics (or so they thought).
 “What’s the innovation?” I asked. The company president and his national sales manager unwrapped a special box to show me their prototype.
 The calculator was the same calculator they had been selling for the past year but with a new feature—a clock that ran in the calculator display when

##### the calculator wasn’t being used. “What do you think?” the president beamed. “We plan on selling this for $99.95.”
 I didn’t like the idea. I explained that the consumer felt that a calculator was a serious business tool, turned on when it was needed and turned it off when it was not. I had been selling them for almost two years and had a pretty good sense of the product and its emotional appeal. Putting a clock into the display and keeping the calculator on all the time was not in harmony with what would impress the consumer and therefore it would not be successful. Increasing the price was a mistake. If I had a choice, I would have offered the product for less, or about $39.95, in order to get rid of their inventory. I just felt that it wouldn’t sell.
 The company president didn’t believe me. “What?” he blurted out. “It costs more to make than the standard model and it’s so revolutionary—why should we even consider selling it for less?”
 I agreed to write an ad to prove my point. “I will write a great ad and let you approve it. I will then run the ad in the Wall Street Journal. We’ll measure the response and if it’s successful, we’ll create a nice advertising campaign for you.”
 I sent APF the ad and they loved it. “If this doesn’t work, I’m getting out of the calculator business,” said the president. And so I ran the ad.
 It failed miserably. The product was closed out at $39.95 shortly thereafter. When you are not in harmony with the market, the marketplace doesn’t respond. Taking a product and making it harmonize with the prospect is simply a matter of good listening and observation. It doesn’t take genius. It takes a good eye and ear, and a little intuition helps, too.
 It is important that your product harmonize with or fill the needs of your prospect. If it doesn’t, it is up to you to figure out how to change it so it does. It might mean showing it in a different color, removing or adding an accessory—the point is that the customer is the king. Your goal is to harmonize not only with the marketplace but in particular with your customer.

# 17. Desire to Belong

##### The desire to belong is a strong motivational factor in marketing but it is often not appreciated. Think about it.
 Why do people own a Mercedes? Why do they smoke Marlboro cigarettes? Why do certain fads catch on? It could be that these people buy a specific product because they subconsciously want to belong to the group that already owns or uses that specific product.
 In the case of Marlboros, the smokers subconsciously want to join that group of smokers who have responded to the rugged western image the cigarette’s ad agency has created.
 The people who buy a Mercedes often want to belong to that special group of Mercedes owners. Do you think it’s because of the special braking or suspension system? Forget it. They’re going out and spending megabucks to buy something that’s maybe slightly better than many of the other automobiles. The other cars can take you to the same places at the same speed and yet these people—all very intelligent—will go out and spend plenty more to buy a Mercedes.
 And the list goes on. You name a product that has an established image and I’ll show you a consumer who, somewhere in his or her subconscious value system, wants to belong to the group of people who own that product. Fashion, automobiles, cigarettes, gadgets, whatever the category—the consumer who buys a specific brand has been motivated to buy that brand by virtue of the desire to belong to the group of people who already own that brand.
 When Volvo discovered that its customer base had one of the highest educational levels of any of the car manufacturers, they publicized this fact. They then noticed that when the same survey was conducted a few years later, the percentage jumped even higher. The increase was caused, in my judgment, by the association that other highly educated new buyers wanted to make with the Volvo owners—they wanted to belong to that group.
 Some students have said to me, “Well, what about hermits? Don’t tell me they have the desire to belong.”
 And my answer has been that they want to belong to the group of people who are hermits. To identify with the group doesn’t necessarily mean you
