## WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN

#### StoryBrand Principle Four: Customers trust a guide who gives them a plan in the form of baby
 steps.

### At this point in our customer’s journey, we’ve identified something they
###### want, which got the story started. Then we proved we understood their deepest challenges and pain points, which further opened a story gap and drew them to our brand. Then we introduced ourselves as the guide by expressing empathy and providing evidence of competency, which helped establish trust. Yet even with all this, the customer isn’t likely to place an order. Some customers will go ahead at this point and place an order, but a percentage are wanting more.
 If we’ve positioned ourselves as the guide, our customers likely want to know more and are feeling hopeful that we can help them. But feeling hopeful about our ability to help them and jumping into a commitment by pulling out their pocketbooks are two different things. When a customer places an order, they’re essentially saying, “I believe you can help me solve my problem, and I believe it so much I’m willing to put skin in the game. I’m willing to part with my hard-earned dollars.”
 Commitments are tricky for our customers because as soon as they make a commitment, they run the risk of losing their money. But more than their money, their time and their identity as a person who makes smart buying decisions are also at risk. Most customers are not going to take that chance just yet.
 When a customer is deciding whether to buy something, we should picture them standing on the edge of a large, rushing creek. It’s true they

-----

###### want what’s on the other side of the creek, but as they stand there, they hear a waterfall downstream. What happens if they fall into the creek? What would life look like if they went over those falls? These are the kinds of subconscious questions our customers ponder as they hover their little arrow over the “Buy Now” button. What if it doesn’t work? What if I’m a fool for buying this? How long will it take to work? What if I buy it and never use it?
 Your customer is also asking another question: How do I get from where I am to the place where I’ve adopted this new product in my life? After all, your customer’s life, as unstable as it is, is familiar. And change is hard. So installing a new software or changing toothpaste or living with a new schedule or driving somewhere they’ve never been or changing banks or breakfast routines or vitamin supplements presents a kind of mystery about how life will be different, and that just seems like something they are going to want to deal with tomorrow.
 For years I wanted a new wearable fitness tracker called a Whoop, and I mean for years. My friends had all raved about it and I knew it would help me, but I had this subconscious cognitive dissonance about whether I had to plug it in all the time or download a smart phone application or enter my credit card or wear it to bed. So I just put it off. It wasn’t until I went to their website and saw a simple three-step instruction on how to get started that I bought the thing. Honestly, it took me all of three minutes to set it up and start using it. To think I went years without buying it because, well, adopting a new habit created a slight amount of cognitive dissonance I just didn’t want to deal with. That story may sound silly, but I assure you there are thousands of people who “feel” cognitive dissonance about your products or services, and if you don’t give them a few simple steps they can take to easily cross from unknowing into knowing, they are less likely to spend money with you.
 Cognitive dissonance shows up in your customers’ behavior as indecisiveness and indifference. Essentially, your customer is thinking, I’ve got this problem I need to solve but I can probably live with it a little longer, so maybe I will just deal with finding the solution tomorrow or the next day. Metaphorically, your customer is stuck on the wrong side of the creek, but the shore is dry, so why figure out how to cross the creek at all? In order to ease our customers’ concerns and relieve their cognitive dissonance, we need to place large stones in that rushing creek. When we identify a few

###### baby steps our customers can take to get across the creek, we remove much of the perceived risk and increase their comfort level about placing an order. It’s as though we’re saying, “First, step here. See, it’s easy. Then step here, then here, and then you’ll be on the other side, and your problem will be resolved.”
 In the StoryBrand framework, we refer to these baby steps as a plan. Once, while consulting for a national mattress brand, I asked their sales representatives to give the customer a three-step plan just before asking for the order. Instead of saying, “Can I write this mattress up for you?” the retail sales representative said, “The process of buying a mattress from us works in three steps: you choose a mattress; then we deliver it; then, if you want, we remove your old mattress so you don’t have to worry about how you will dispose of it. This mattress seems to be the one that is perfect for you. Would you like to make a purchase?” Not to my surprise, when the mattress representatives inserted a simple three-step plan in the sales process, sales went up. Why? Because cognitive dissonance was removed before the sales rep asked for the money.
 Whenever a customer says, “Let me think about it” or “Let me get back to you,” what they are really saying is that they’ve got some cognitive dissonance and could use some space before making a buying decision. Of course, nobody goes home with them to answer questions and relieve the cognitive dissonance, so the customer never places an order. To be sure, I don’t think the customer is trying to get out of placing an order; I think they actually want to place an order, but as long as they feel that cognitive dissonance, they aren’t going to. Therefore, we’ve got to relieve that cognitive dissonance right there in the conversation, or in the email, or on the website, or even in the product sales copy.
 Even in stories, the guide often gives the hero a plan. In the movie Moneyball, for example, Peter Brand (the guide) gives Billy Beane (the hero) a plan he can employ to turn his baseball team around. In a series of steps, Billy will begin using an algorithm to choose players rather than relying on anecdotal evidence from his antiquated coaching staff. In the new way of running a baseball team, Billy is going to begin to trust the numbers and run the team the way a hedge-fund manager might run his hedge fund. Step one: trust the numbers. Step two: turn the coaching culture around. Step three: win games.

###### In Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke Skywalker is told to fly his X-wing fighter into the trench on the Death Star, shoot a photon torpedo through an exhaust valve, and then get out of there before the Death Star blows up. In other words, he’s given a three-step plan.
 In nearly every movie you can think of, the guide gives the hero a plan. The plan is the bridge the hero must cross in order to arrive at the climactic scene. Rocky has to train using nontraditional methods, Tommy Boy has to embark on a national sales trip, and Juliet must drink the potion the apothecary gives her in order to trick her family into thinking she’s died so she can be free to run away with Romeo.
 A plan serves the narrative by narrowing the focus of the plot. It also, quite pragmatically, gives the hero something to do that kills twenty minutes in the second half of act 2.

##### THE PLAN ENCOURAGES THE CUSTOMER TO MOVE
 FORWARD

###### In business, the plan can take many forms, but all effective plans do two things: they clarify what doing business with us will look like and they remove the sense of risk a customer might feel before committing to our product or service.
 Remember the mantra “If you confuse, you lose”? Not having a plan is a guaranteed way to create cognitive dissonance.
 After potential customers visit our website or listen to us give a keynote or read an email we’ve sent, they’re all wondering the same thing: What would my next step be if I wanted to move forward? If we don’t clearly guide them with next steps, the customer experiences a little bit of confusion, and because they can hear that waterfall downstream, they use that confusion as an excuse not to do business with us.
 The fact we have communicated our offer clearly is not enough to motivate our customer at this point. If we’re selling a storage system a customer can install in their garage, they hover over that “Buy Now” button, subconsciously wondering whether it will work for them, how hard it will be to install, and whether it will sit in boxes unopened like the last product they bought. But when we spell out how easy the storage system is

-----

###### to install and let them know they can get started in three easy steps, they are more likely to place an order.
 Specifically, if you are selling garage shelves, you want to tell them to

 1. measure their space, 2. order the items that fit, and 3. install it in minutes using basic tools.

 Even though these steps may seem obvious to the people who made the product, the steps aren’t obvious to the customer. Placing stones in the creek greatly increases the chance the customer will cross the creek.

##### THE PROCESS PLAN

###### At StoryBrand we’ve identified two plans you can use to effectively encourage customers to do business with you. The first kind of plan, and the one we recommend all our clients employ, is a process plan.
 A process plan can describe the steps a customer needs to take to buy our product, or the steps they need to take to use our product after they buy it, or a mixture of both.
 For instance, if you’re selling an expensive, service-based product, you might break down the steps like this:

 1. Schedule an appointment. 2. Allow us to create a customized plan. 3. Let’s execute the plan together.

 Whether we’re selling a financial product, a medical procedure, a university education, or any other complicated solution, a process plan takes the confusion out of our customer’s journey by breaking down the process into baby steps.
 Another kind of process plan would be the post-purchase process plan. This plan is best used when our customers might have problems imagining how they would use our product after they buy it. For instance, with a

-----

###### complicated piece of software, we might want to spell out the steps or even the phases a customer would take after they make the purchase:

 1. Download the software. 2. Integrate your database into the new system. 3. Revolutionize your customer interaction.

 The post-purchase process plan does the same thing as a pre-purchase process plan in the sense that it alleviates confusion. When a customer is looking at the wide span between themselves and the integration of a complicated product, they’re less likely to make a purchase. But when they read your plan, they think to themselves, Oh, I can do that. That’s not so hard, and then they click “Buy Now.”
 A process plan can also combine the pre- and post-purchase steps. For instance:

 1. Test-drive a car. 2. Purchase the car. 3. Enjoy free maintenance for life.

 Again, the key to any plan’s success is to alleviate confusion about next steps. What steps do they need to take to do business with you? Spell out those steps, and it’ll be as though you’ve paved a sidewalk through a field. More people will cross the field.
 We frequently get questions about how many steps a process plan should have. The answer varies, of course, but we recommend at least three and no more than six. If doing business with you requires more than six steps, break down those steps into phases and describe the phases. In reality, you might guide your customer through twenty or thirty steps, but studies show when you bombard customers with information, buying decreases.
 Remember, the whole point of creating a plan is to alleviate customers’ confusion. Having more than four steps may actually add to, rather than reduce, confusion. The key is to simplify their journey so they are more likely to do business with you.

##### THE AGREEMENT PLAN

###### If process plans are about alleviating confusion, agreement plans are about alleviating fears.
 An agreement plan is best understood as a list of agreements you make with your customers to help them overcome their fear of doing business with you.
 Earlier I talked about CarMax and how they resolve the customer’s agitation of having to deal with a used car salesman. One of the tools they use to communicate that customers don’t have to encounter this internal fear is an agreement plan. CarMax’s four-point agreement plan includes the promise that customers will never have to haggle. Afraid you’ll be stuck with a lemon? CarMax refuses to sell a car that doesn’t meet their standards, and they put every car through a renewal process to be sure it earns their quality certification seal.[1]
 Today, CarMax sells more cars than its next three competitors combined. In fact, not long ago, Automotive News named CarMax the undisputed used car champion.[2] As I mentioned in chapter 5, CarMax rarely advertises the solution to their customers’ external problems (that is, the need for a used car). Instead, they focus on their customers’ internal problem, the fear of interacting with a used car dealer, and they alleviate this fear with an agreement plan.
 An agreement plan can also work to increase the perceived value of a service you promise to provide. For instance, Newt Gingrich’s “Contract with America” is an example of an agreement plan. Newt was a relatively unknown congressman from Georgia who led a takeover in both houses of Congress by making an agreement with voters. Newt simply took age-old conservative talking points, turned them into a list, and said, “If you vote for us, we’ll do all these things.” More than three hundred conservative legislators signed on, and Newt became an overnight presidential hopeful.
 Another benefit of an agreement plan is that it can work to clarify shared values between our customers and us. Whole Foods’ list of values has attracted millions to their stores and works as an agreement to source food in a way that is socially and environmentally responsible.
 Unlike a process plan, an agreement plan often works in the background. Agreement plans do not have to be featured on the home page

-----

###### of your website (though they could be), but as customers get to know you, they’ll sense a deeper level to your service and may realize why when they finally encounter your agreement plan.
 The best way to arrive at an agreement plan is to list all the things your customer might be concerned about as it relates to your product or service and then counter that list with agreements that will alleviate those concerns.
 If it’s short enough (we’re fans of brevity, obviously), you can feature your agreement plan on the wall of your business or even on your packaging or shopping bags.

##### WHAT’S THE PLAN CALLED?

###### Once you create your process or agreement plan (or both), consider giving each plan a title that will formalize the plan in the minds of your customers. For instance, your process plan might be called the “easy installation plan” or the “world’s best night’s sleep plan.” Your agreement plan might be titled the “customer satisfaction agreement” or even “our quality guarantee.” Titling your plan will frame it in the customer’s mind and will increase the perceived seriousness of your offer and your commitment to customer satisfaction.
 Now that you’ve given your customer a plan, they will be much more likely to do business with you. You’ve lifted the fog, made the baby steps clear, and alleviated their concerns, and now they are ready to continue the journey.
 Yet before many customers make a commitment, they will need one more thing from you. They will need you to call them to action. In other words, you’re going to have to ask them for the money. Sadly, very few business leaders enjoy asking for the money, but that’s because you’re thinking of the transaction the wrong way. I’ll teach you the right and wrong ways to call customers to action in the next chapter and, more importantly, I hope to transform you into somebody who boldly represents their brand with pride.
 First, though, spend some time defining the plan or plans you want to implement to ease your customers’ fears and guide them toward next steps.
