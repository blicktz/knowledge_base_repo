##### In selling, it is important to understand not only the nature of the product you are offering but the nature of your prospect as well. When I was in college and thinking about joining a fraternity, I had an experience that really points out the value of understanding this very important trigger.
 Of all the fraternities I could have joined in college, I chose the worst one. Why? After spending time visiting various fraternities, I had figured out the nature of why guys join a fraternity in the first place.
 I reasoned that with this knowledge, I could single-handedly take the worst fraternity on campus and turn it into the best one, simply by coming up with an effective marketing plan to dramatically increase membership. My approach would take into account the nature of my prospect (the student) and, using this information, seduce that student into wanting to join my fraternity at the exclusion of all others. I would thus, by building a large membership, transform my fraternity into a top-rated organization, regardless of how bad it had been when I joined. This may seem like a rather naive plan, but I was convinced that I personally could make a difference.
 After joining and going through the initiation period, I got sworn in, went before my fraternity brothers, and laid out my plan—“Operation Survival” as I called it. I explained that guys join a fraternity for two psychological and motivating factors: One was as a vehicle to meet girls and the other was to experience the camaraderie and brotherhood of a group of guys. I showed that an illusion could be created to capture this effect of social interaction in a fraternity for the sake of acquiring new members or pledges. The goal was to have more guys wanting to join our fraternity than any other on campus. And we needed this big infusion of new faces or our fraternity would surely die—that’s how bad this place was and how badly we were doing attracting new members. It truly was Operation Survival.
 My plan was simple and consisted of two parts. The first part was to invite the most beautiful and sexy girls to act as hostesses for our get- acquainted events. I didn’t want the active brothers’ girlfriends to act as hostesses as was usually the case. No, these gals had to be world-class— girls the guys would talk about for days after our event.

##### The second was the way each brother had to introduce a fellow brother to a prospective member. I insisted that the brother should say to a prospect something very loving and warm about his fellow fraternity brother. I said, “Put your arms around your brother and tell the prospect what a wonderful person your brother is and how much you genuinely admire and love this guy.”
 The plan was not as easy to execute as it might seem. First, no world- class gal on campus wanted any part of my fraternity. Second, the guys hated each other, and expressing love about a fellow brother whom you hated seemed a rather difficult gesture, if not impossible. But I did a few things that made it work.
 We hired four of the most beautiful strippers from the local strip clubs. They were young, sexy, and welcomed the opportunity to assume roles as sexy university coeds and hostesses for our three planned get-acquainted parties. I then rehearsed the guys and made them put their arms around each other, expressing this new brotherly love that was so foreign and repulsive to them. They could barely stand it. But the charade worked.
 Not only did we end up with the biggest pledge class in our history, beating all the other fraternities, but some of the guys actually got closer to their fellow brothers, and an entire new spirit spread throughout the fraternity. There was such a buzz around campus about the girls who were acting as our hostesses that by the time we held our third party, we didn’t have room for the crowd that we attracted. In fact, the strippers enjoyed their experience so much that they invited some of their beautiful girlfriends to join the fun. The guests were so impressed with the love, brotherhood, and display of beautiful women that when it came time to join, they were literally begging to sign up.
 I had understood the psychological trigger of my product (the fraternity) and of my prospect (the young man looking for a place to find love and social interaction). The key in this case was the power of knowing the nature of the prospect—those emotional aspects of the prospect that would respond best to a planned pitch. Operation Survival was a huge success and transformed my fraternity into one of the best on campus—all from a simple marketing plan and in a few short weeks.
 Let me cite a few more examples to illustrate this very important principle. If I was selling a home, I would get to know the motivations of my prospects and what they are looking for in a home. I would find out

##### their history. I would ask them about their other home-buying experiences and what their hobbies are. I would gather as much information about them as possible and then I would develop a sense of what emotional needs they might have.
 Understanding their needs and the nature of the prospect in general would give me enough information to craft a very effective sales presentation that, ideally, would match the nature of my product with the nature of my prospect.
 The prospect has basic emotional needs that your product or service will solve, regardless of how sophisticated or simple your product offering is. Examine those emotional needs. It is from the perspective of emotion that you will reach the core essence of your prospect’s motivation. And it is from this essence that you will get all the clues you need to uncover the way to that prospect’s heart and soul and eventually to his or her pocketbook.

# 12. Current Fads

##### There are always a number of fads taking place at the same time. One might be a clothing fad, another might be an unusual expression made popular by a TV show or commercial, or a fad might be a popular trend.
 There are also fads in direct response. On TV right now, the hottest products are exercise devices. There was a time when real estate shows were popular. Be aware of the current fads so you can determine the hottest product categories and also the new language of our time. You want to recognize them and harmonize with them.
 A good example of recognizing fads and knowing what to do with them comes from an experience I had with Richard Guilfoyle, a direct marketer from Boston. He had a strong sense of history and prided himself on creating replicas of historic American objects—Paul Revere’s lantern, a statue of George Washington at Valley Forge, a salt and pepper set from the time of the Revolutionary War. In 1975 his company was doing quite well.
 And no wonder. The country was about to celebrate its bicentennial anniversary, and this class of merchandise was being recognized as a way of celebrating the birth of our nation 200 years before. Sales were brisk. Richard was capitalizing on this current fad for American Revolutionary period products.
 Then the bottom of his business fell out. Sales plummeted and he couldn’t figure out why. And it all happened just prior to July 4th, 1976—the date of the bicentennial celebration.
 When he attended my seminar, he was really quite disappointed with his business. What happened? I suggested that maybe it was because people were associating his merchandise with the anniversary of the United States. Since that date had already passed, his sales reflected this perception.
 But Richard insisted that this wasn’t the case. “My products have true historic significance and have nothing to do with the bicentennial.” Could I simply look at his copy and help him improve it?
 After looking over his copy, which was actually quite good, I saw clearly what the problem was. He had not recognized that consumers perceived his products as part of the excitement of the bicentennial and not as a part of American history that they could save and own.

##### He then showed me a few ads he had prepared as a result of attending my seminar. One of them was for a necklace with a small replica of a Paul Revere lantern that had a diamond in the center representing the light. It was a beautiful piece of jewelry.
 I read the copy and said, “You have a winner here. This ad will do well— not because of the historic nature of the necklace but because of the beautiful piece of jewelry that it is. You’re now selling jewelry, Richard, not good old Americana.”
 Sure enough, the ad was a huge success and he soon realized how a powerful fad can grow and fade.

## Fads Generate Publicity

##### I used fads as a way of generating publicity when I was doing public relations for a few of my clients. One owned a ski resort and was trying to increase the awareness of snowmobiles at his resort. At the time, during the mid to late 1960s, the women’s lib movement was new, strong and vocal. I suggested that the resort owner ban women snowmobile drivers and issue a press release proudly announcing the fact. He did and the publicity went national. He rescinded his ban and snowmobile sales grew dramatically from the national publicity and attention.
 At the same time, one of my accounts—Jerry Herman, owner of the Spot pizza restaurant near Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois— wanted national publicity, too. Women were in the middle of an unusual fad —throwing their bras away and going braless. I suggested to Jerry that he design a brashaped pizza and he, too, got national publicity. While these publicity stunts might seem a bit silly in retrospect, back then they were effective because they tied into a fad of the times.
 A fad can die just as quickly as it can grow. So you must capture the moment early enough and get out right after the fad peaks. The people who came out with radar detectors when they became a fad did exceptionally well. A few of them attended my seminar and wrote great ads and built their companies into very successful entities.
 One of the companies selling radar detectors—Cincinnati Microwave— sent three of their top people to my seminar before it really took off and became a $140 million company with over $40 million in profits.
 But be careful. I can tell you stories (I should say nightmares) that show how dangerous fads can be to your financial health. During the Watergate scandal, I once introduced “The Watergate Game—a game of intrigue and deception for the whole family.” But no store would carry it because of the controversy and I lost my shirt. I once created the Batman credit card to capture the Batman fad of the 1960s and printed 250,000 of them only to be denied a license to sell them.
 But as you can see, knowing how to recognize a fad and capitalize on it can be a very powerful tool if your timing is right. This brings us very nicely to the next topic.

# 13. Timing

##### How many times have you been too early with an idea or too late? I’ve heard complaints from many of my students who have failed because their timing just wasn’t right.
 Timing certainly has a lot to do with fads. You want to be involved at the beginning of a fad and not enter in the middle or the end. That’s smart timing. But there are products that have just been introduced too early or too late, and that relates to timing, too. When do you introduce a new product? Is America ready for it? And how do you know?
 The answer really is quite simple: Nobody knows. That’s why I always test every product that I sell first. The consumer will tell me if I’m too early or too late or right on target.
 When crime increased, it was good common sense to offer burglar alarms. When the O.J. Simpson case unraveled, there were plenty of opportunities to capitalize on it and the media sure did.
 President Carter went on television in 1980 and reprimanded Americans, accusing us of running up too much debt. “Stop using your credit cards” was his suggestion. And millions of Americans did just that. Direct response rates plummeted overnight. Tests we had previously run that showed great promise were coming up as losses. Our timing obviously was bad but through no fault of ours. Knowing the cause of the problem helped us keep our sanity.
 It’s just as important to know when the timing is bad. We came out with a product called the Bone Fone, a portable radio worn around the neck. It was perfect timing until a product called the Walkman came out and killed our new product. Timing. It can kill a product or make it.
 I once ran a media test on an electronic blood pressure unit we were thinking of putting in our catalog. I thought it would do well and when the results were presented to me, I was amazed at how well it had done. Armed with a great deal of confidence, I placed a major national advertising campaign in all the magazines we normally advertised in—spending almost $300,000 at the time. But even before the ads started to run I discovered that the report I thought was so good was actually produced in error. The product did not do well in the media test and in fact did quite poorly.

-----

##### Since I had already placed the advertising, I braced myself for the bad response. But my timing proved to be coincidentally right on target. About the same time as the ads started to run, the American Heart Association started running a major advertising campaign suggesting that Americans take their blood pressure regularly. Our sales jumped and what was destined to become one of our biggest losses turned into a nice profit. And we even won the Life Extension Award from the Life Extension Association for our work in alerting the public to the need for measuring their blood pressure regularly.

# 14. Linking

##### A very critical technique that I have used in mail order ads is a process called linking. Basically, it is the technique of relating what the consumer already knows and understands with what you are selling to make the new product easy to understand and relate to.
 One of the easiest ways to explain this trigger is to describe how it works in a fad—a craze that captures the public’s consciousness and quickly creates strong demand, awareness or behavioral changes. The demand can be for a product such as for the Beanie Babies in the 1990s or the citizens band (CB) radios back in the 1970s. It can be simply the strong awareness of a new or different product or concept, such as the Viagra introduction in 1998, or it can be for behavioral changes, such as women throwing away their bras during the women’s liberation movement of the late 1960s.
 There are also fads within specific industries. For example, in the exercise industry there might be a fad for abdominal devices; on infomercials, there might be a glut of business opportunity shows.
 Usually the fads come and go quickly. But the importance of the fad examples is to show you the process of linking on its most basic and obvious levels. Then I’ll take it deeper to give you a sense of how linking can be used to effectively sell any product or service.
 For example, I used the awareness of a presidential act as a way of selling products. When it was discovered in 1973 that Nixon was using phone tap equipment to record all his phone conversations, there was enormous publicity about it. I immediately put together a JS&A offer for a system with which anybody could tap their phones and ran it in the Wall Street Journal under the headline “Tap Your Phone.”
 That ad was a mistake. The FBI showed up at my door and the Wall Street Journal threatened not to run my ads any more. Even worse, I didn’t sell many of the systems and lost money on the ad. You see, what Nixon did was illegal and so my offer encouraged illegal activity even though I had done nothing illegal myself.
 In contrast, I caught another fad at just the right time. I offered a walkie- talkie right at the height of the citizens band (CB) radio boom in the United States. By calling my walkie-talkie a Pocket CB because it broadcast on one
