###### Tourism advertising works well in magazines, but it can work even better on television. Doyle Dane Bernbach’s commercials for France were enchanting. I particularly remember one which sought to persuade American tourists to visit the French provinces. ‘When you’ve seen France, you will never go back to Paris.’
 I believe that charm works well in tourism advertising. And di�erentiation. If you write your headlines in French, everybody will know you are advertising France.

1Two Frenchmen were driving through the Cotswolds in England. One said to the other,

‘You must admit this is a very beautiful country.’ ‘Yes,’ replied his friend, ‘it is beautiful.

Thank God they can’t cook it.’

 The secrets of success in business- to-business advertising

###### It used to be called trade advertising, or industrial advertising, but its practitioners have taken to calling it ‘business-to-business,’ which sounds classier. It means products that people buy for their companies, not for themselves. I will tell you what I have learned about it, drawing heavily and gratefully on research conducted by McGraw-Hill.

 Print McGraw-Hill tells us that the average salesman’s call costs $178, a letter $6.63 and a phone call $6.35, while you can reach a prospect through advertising for only 17 cents.
 Admittedly an advertisement, however e�cient, can seldom close a sale itself. Its function is to pave the way for salesmen, by pre- selling your product and attracting leads.
 In industrial companies there are an average of four ‘buying in�uences.’ Your sales force is unlikely to know all four. Sixty per cent of ‘speci�ers’ – people who set down the speci�cations that must be met – read advertisements to learn what’s on the market.
 By and large, the advertising techniques that work in this kind of advertising are the same as the techniques that work in consumer advertising – like promising the reader a bene�t, news, testimonials, and helpful information.
 Make sure that what you promise is important to your customer. A supplier of computer software was proud of the size of his company and wanted to make it the feature of his advertising, but

-----

###### research found that his customers were not interested in size. They were looking for responsiveness, support, service – and a good product.
 Make your promise speci�c. Instead of generalities, use percentages, time elapsed, dollars saved. You are talking to engineers.
 Testimonials work well, as long as they come from experts in reputable companies. A testimonial from Bud Dacus impresses tugboat engineers because Bud has worked the Mississippi for 25 years – longer than Mark Twain.
 Demonstrations are most e�ective when they compare your product’s performance with your competitors’. Try to devise a simple demonstration that your reader can perform himself, like inviting him to scrape the liner of your air-duct with a coin to see how tough it is.

-----

_Testimonials work well when they come from recognized experts in well-known companies._

###### News works well. It appears that readers scan the advertisements in technical journals looking for new products. To my surprise, a McGraw-Hill study found that advertising is twice as e�ective as an article in the same journal. Be sure to proclaim your news, loud and clear.
 Information that is useful to the reader in his job can also be e�ective, provided the information involves your product. For example, you can show the reader how to calculate the amount of money he could save by using your product.

-----

###### Some copywriters, assuming that the reader will �nd the product as boring as they do, try to inveigle him into their ads with pictures of babies, beagles and bosoms. This is a mistake. A buyer of �exible pipe for o�shore oil rigs is more interested in pipe than anything else in the world. So play it straight.
 Layouts should be simple, avoiding the arty devices dear to second-rate art directors – like type which is too big to be readable, eccentric designs and headlines at the bottom of the page. If you make your ads look like editorial pages, you will get more readers. Far more.

_Some copywriters, assuming that the reader will �nd the product as boring as they do, try to inveigle him into their ads with_

_pictures of babies, beagles and bosoms. A mistake._

###### Headlines get �ve times the readership of the body copy. If your headline doesn’t sell, you have wasted your money. Your headline should promise a bene�t, or deliver news, or o�er a service, or tell a signi�cant story, or recognize a problem, or quote a satis�ed customer.
 Body copy is seldom read by more than 10 per cent of the readers of a publication. But that 10 per cent consists of prospects – people

-----

###### interested enough in what you are selling to take the trouble to read about it. What you say to them determines the success of your advertisement.
 When you advertise bubblegum or underwear, there isn’t much to say, but a computer or a generator calls for long copy. Don’t be afraid to write it. Long copy – more than 350 words – actually attracts more readers than short copy.
 In business publications four-color ads cost only a third more than black and white, but they attract twice as many readers. Four-color is a good buy.
 Captions should appear under all your photographs. Twice as many people read them as read body copy. And use your captions to sell. The best captions are mini-advertisements in themselves.

 Television Business-to-business advertisers are turning increasingly to television. The audiences for many sports and news programs include a high percentage of business people and are therefore e�cient buys. The principles that apply to consumer advertising on television are equally valid for business-to-business commercials.

###### News and demonstrations work particularly well. Even humor has its place, as in the hilarious Ally and Gargano commercials for Federal Express. But it is worth noting that the humor in these commercials always supports the powerful end promise: ‘Federal Express – when it absolutely has to be there overnight.’
 Some products used by business cannot be sold in 30 seconds. In such cases, I advise you to sacri�ce frequency to delivering a thorough sales message. For IBM computers we used three minutes.
 Many small business-to-business advertisers shy away from television because commercials cost so much to produce, but inexpensive commercials can be highly e�ective – if they come directly, to the point and o�er something of genuine interest. I have seen a television commercial for an industrial product produce so many inquiries that it had to be taken o� the air; the salesmen couldn’t handle any more. One commercial for another industrial product produced more inquiries in two months than print advertising had produced in a year. (However, the print advertising produced a higher rate of conversion to sales.)

-----

###### Di�erentiating commodity products Many industrial products are thought to be little more than commodities, with no apparent di�erences between them. How do you di�erentiate your bolts, washers or machine tools from those of your competitors? But, says Professor Levitt, ‘there is no such thing as a commodity. All goods and services are di�erentiable.’
 In a Harvard Business Review article, Professor William K. Hall reported on a study of eight industries, from steel to beer. The most successful companies were those that best di�erentiated their product or service.
 According to Professor Hall, the most successful commodity products di�erentiated themselves in one of two ways: either by low cost or by having the best reputation for quality or service. Advertising can help you spread the news about any price advantage you may have, and it can work wonders in creating a reputation for quality or service.
 Before 1972, Owens-Corning sold its insulation to builders for use in new homes. In those days insulation was all the same – a commodity. And so the Owens-Corning advertising looked pretty much like its competitors. Later, when fuel prices went up and construction of new homes went down, Owens-Corning di�erentiated its insulation as the brand of choice for owners of old homes who want to reduce their fuel costs. This was done by latching onto an apparently unimportant feature: the unique color of the Owens-Corning product.
 Today Owens-Corning Fiberglas has escaped from the ‘commodity trap.’ It has by far the best reputation for quality among all insulation material, being preferred 3 to 1 over the second brand.

 How to stimulate inquiries McGraw-Hill reports that nearly all inquiries come from people who have a speci�c need or application in mind; and a substantial percentage of them buy within six months of their inquiry.
 Always put a toll-free number in your advertisements, to make the inquiry as fast and as easy as possible. In the United States, seven

-----

###### out of ten readers of trade journals now use such numbers. Include a business reply card and a coupon requesting more information. This combination guarantees you the greatest number of productive inquiries.
 In addition, close your body copy with your o�er, your address and phone number. The average business publication is read by three readers besides the subscriber. If the �rst reader cuts out the coupon, the others cannot respond to the o�er without the second address.

 Analyse your inquiries Analyse your inquiries and the action they produce. This will enable you to answer your boss’s inevitable question: ‘What tangible results am I getting from my advertising?’ Here are three ways to analyse inquiries:

 1 Survey a sample of inquirers. Do they intend to buy your product? To bide their time until a salesman calls? Or simply to keep your product in mind for the future?

 2 Question the sales people who follow up the inquiries. Did the inquiry lead to a sale? Was this account a new prospect? How did the salesman rate this prospect – a one-time sale, a growth account, a dead end? The discovery of a single major sale resulting from an inquiry can do more than anything else to demonstrate the value of your advertising.

 3 Relate inquiries to the media that produced them. This can help you �ne-tune your media selection. By doing this, one manufacturer was able to reduce his advertising budget by 25 per cent.

###### Advertising to top management Many business purchases require approval from top management as well as the purchasing agent. Top managers may not respond to, or even understand, the details that are important to the speci�ers. They are only interested in the broad bene�ts – particularly cost savings.
 It sometimes pays to run separate campaigns – one addressed to top management, the other to the specialists who read trade publications.

 Direct mail, my �rst love and secret weapon

##### With tips on direct advertising in magazines and television

###### ne day a man walked into a London agency and asked to see the boss. He had bought a country house and was about to open it

## O

###### as a hotel. Could the agency help him to get customers? He had $500 to spend. Not surprisingly, the head of the agency turned him over to the o�ce boy, who happened to be the author of this book. I invested his money in penny postcards and mailed them to well- heeled people living in the neighborhood. Six weeks later the hotel opened to a full house. I had tasted blood.
 From that day on, I have been a voice crying in the wilderness, trying to persuade the advertising establishment to take direct mail more seriously and to stop treating its practitioners as noncommissioned o�cers. It was my secret weapon in the avalanche of new business acquisitions which made Ogilvy & Mather an instant success.
 Today, direct mail has exploded – an explosion caused more than anything by computers. They make it possible to select names from mailing lists by every imaginable demographic classi�cation, by frequency of purchase and by amount of purchase. With a computer you can remove duplication between mailing lists and within a list – a process called ‘merge and purge.’ You can even avoid mailing to people who don’t like receiving mailings.

-----

###### Computers make it possible for every letter in a mailing of millions to include the name of each addressee, not only in the salutation, but several times in the body of the letter.
 Most direct-response buying is now done with a credit card, and the companies that issue the cards know who has bought what. If you have charged a trip to Disney World in Florida, I can send you a mailing for Disneyland in California.
 The biggest users of direct mail are magazine publishers in search of subscriptions, catalog houses, food stores, department stores, record clubs and book clubs. It has been estimated that total sales by direct mail in the United States are now more than a hundred billion dollars a year.
 Unfortunately, there are a lot of �y-by-night frauds in the direct- mail business, including, say the New York Times, ten thousand phoney ‘pastors.’ In 1980, 1,500,000 consumers complained to the Better Business Bureau about �rms which had failed to deliver the merchandise they had ordered, or had delivered it too late or in damaged condition. In the whole spectrum of marketing, direct mail is where you �nd the swindlers. That said, the vast bulk of advertising by direct mail is on the level.
 Advertisers who distribute their products in the normal way, through wholesalers and retailers, have great di�culty in isolating the results of their advertising from the other factors in their marketing mix, but direct-mail advertisers can measure the results of their mailings to the dollar. This makes it possible for them to test everything they do. In direct mail, testing is the name of the game.
 You can test every variable in your mailings and determine exactly its e�ect on your sales. But because you can only test one variable at a time, you cannot a�ord to test them all. So you have to choose which to test. Experienced practitioners always test some variables, but seldom those which experience has taught them make little di�erence in results. Next to the positioning of your product, the most important variables to be tested are pricing, terms of payment, premiums and the format of your mailing.
 The price you ask and the terms of payment you o�er are critical, and they can be tested by sample mailings. A highbrow magazine

-----

###### tested three terms of payment for subscriptions. In one, the subscriber was asked to pay $65 for 56 issues. In another, $42.50 for 39 issues. In the third, $29.95 for 29 issues. Guess which won? Although it cut the price 40 per cent, the third generated 35 per cent more net revenue.
 When collections of Moscow Olympic Games silver, gold and platinum coins were sold by direct mail, a mailing which o�ered only the silver coins led to more sales of the complete collection than a mailing which o�ered the complete collection itself.
 When your pro�t margin allows, it pays to o�er a free premium. Always test di�erent premiums. One of the most e�ective is cash prizes in sweepstakes. Sweepstakes, premiums, free o�ers, and low prices will build up your initial response, but the customer who is attracted by these devices is not always the customer who turns into a long-term buyer.
 Asking for the full price and cash with the order will reduce the number of people who respond. But it may turn up more customers who are likely to stay with you over the years. Only testing will tell. The more you test, the more pro�table your direct mail will become.
 Once you have evolved a mailing which produces pro�table results, treat it as the ‘control’ and start testing ways to beat it. Try adding a premium, or putting in an expiration date, or adding enclosures – like a personalized letter from your President. They cost money, but if they increase your pro�t, why worry?
 Sometimes an expensive control can be made less expensive without reducing your orders. You can test a smaller mailing piece, or eliminate the personalization, or print your brochure in two colors instead of four, or eliminate the brochure altogether. You may be in for a pleasant surprise. Less can be more.
 Innovations, provided you test them, can work wonders. Prospects for a new Cessna Citation business jet were surprised when we sent them live carrier pigeons, with an invitation to take a free ride in a Citation. The recipient was asked to release our carrier pigeon with his address tied to its leg. Some of the recipients ate the pigeons, but

###### several returned alive, and at least one Citation was sold – for $600,000.

###### My brother Francis wrote a letter in Greek to the headmasters of private schools, selling cooking stoves. When some wrote back that they could not read Greek, he sent them another letter – in Latin. This produced orders.
 Successful mailings do not always depend on premiums, brochures and other such paraphernalia. I have seen letters produce satisfactory results all by themselves. But they have to be long letters. When Mercedes-Benz were saddled with 1,170 obsolete diesels, we mailed a �ve-page letter and unloaded the surplus. For Cunard we used an eight-page letter with marked success.
