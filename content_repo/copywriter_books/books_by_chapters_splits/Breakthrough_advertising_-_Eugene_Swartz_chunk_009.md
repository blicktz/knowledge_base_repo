So we've come full circle. You start vour ad bv creating your
headline. You develop your copv storv from that headline. But if
the copv story doesn't develop—if vou gradually find that the
headline isn't really that good after all—then perhaps the very
_elements that are begging to come out of your 6-point type should_
_be at the top of your ad._

This is what makes this copv writing so interesting. You're
always being surprised—with ideas from the most ungodly places.
Just make sure you've got vour eves open wide enough to catch
all of them.

**Momentum—How to Draw Your Reader Deeper and**

**Deeper Into Your Copy**

There are two other devices we should discuss. Both of them
help tie your ad together, though that's not their primary function.

The first is Momentum. How to draw your reader into vour
copy . . . keep him reading . . . making sure he doesn't quit vou in
the middle.

THE FINAL TOUCHES

Copy's first job, of course, is to be read. If its not read, it
can't sell. And if you take some time to make your points—to intensify your desire, to build and rebuild vour believability, to reinforce one claim with another—then you'd better make darn
sure that you've put plentv of momentum-builders into vour copv

There are two types:
1. Actual momentum phrases; and

2. Incomplete statements, or teasers, that draw the reader
further into the copy in order to complete them.

The first type, the momentum-phrases, are time-honored.
They are used in almost any sort of persuasive or educational
writing. You insert them in your copy primarily in your transitionsentences, to keep interest from flagging, to indicate to vour
reader the general type of material that's going to follow. They
are "addy," but they work. Here are a few examples, taken from
the four book ads we looked at in the last section:

"They paid up to $22.50 a person to learn priceless
techniques like these:"

"You can learn them all, in your own home next weekend, without risking a penny. Here's how"

_"Here is the information you will find in this hook."_

_"Let me explain."_

"All I ask from you is this."

_"What you are going to do, in the very first hour that_
you receive the book, is this."

"And yet it's only the beginning."

_"THEN put this simple trick to work for uou—that_
_VERY SAME HOUR"_

_"For example—"_

_"Read the thrilling answer below."_

". • . to start with . . ."

_"Just wait till you try this."_

And so on. These are actual invitations to read on. H YOU
write long copv, thev should be spotted throughout it.

The second category of momentum-builder is much more
subtle, and giyes YOU thousands of waYs to keep drawing vour
reader along after vour developing thought. It's based on the
simple principle that if YOU make a statement that interests vour
reader, and if vou purposelv and skillinllv do not complete that
statement, so that there is a question of how it can be done, then
_he will read on to find out more._

In other words, YOU are continuallv throughout the copv:
1. Creating interest in a specific point;
2. Raising a question in his mind about that point; and
3. Implying an answer to that question later in the copv.
Here are some examples of this technique:

"And YOU will do it often using nothing more than ordinarv tap water, vour own ten fingers, and the contents
of vour garden and vour refrigerator."

"But now. when vou turn on the ignition, a modem
_miracle of engineering science comes to life underneath your_
_hood!"_

"Yes! Here at last is the Engineering Miracle vou Ye

performance of .812,000 cars! The revolutionarv new GasSaver that actuallv gives compact-car economv to Fords.

added efficiency to any car that used it—that the officials
_were forced to rule that it gave these cars an UNFAIR AD-_
_VANTAGE over those drivers who couldn't obtain it!"_

"How to Grow Thousands of Flowers—Without Dirtying Your Hands."

life in many ways as satisfying as when thev were in their
twenties—if they are only shown how to combat the hid_den forces within their minds and bodies that literally drive_
_them into impotent!/!"_

"Caught! 120 Fish in One Hour!"

"Just picture the scene as these college horticulturists

for a single plant. Row upon row of roses . . . prize-winners
in international competition . . . the best the world has to
offer . . . AND THEN, NEARLY-WILD STARTED TO
BLOOM!"

And so on. The objective here is to keep lite reader going—
for one more sentence, one more paragraph, one more sequence.
Notice, of course, that every one of these examples not only produces momentum, not only raises questions in the reader's mind
that he virtually must read on to answer—but is also, at exactly
the same time, loaded with sell. Again, interweaving—making
each element in the ad accomplish two objectives. No waste
words.

**Mood—How to Pack Your Copy With Drama, Excitement,**
**Sincerity or Any Other Emotion You Wish**

Now we come to the matter of words—and the color which
words create.

I have given you dozens of different examples in this book
of selling copy. All these examples had certain elements in common—they were strong, successful, convincing and so on. But,
at the same time, each of these copy blocks differed from the
others in one immediately apparent way—in the mood that each
set, simply by the rhythm and words that the copy writer used
to express his thoughts.

Words and rhythms. They are to the copy writer what line

THE FINAL TOUCHES 223

and color are to the painter. They set the mood of your story—
carry the emotion so subtly that vour reader never really realizes
where the excitement or the image or the conviction is actually
coming from.

For example, here are several of the passages we've looked
at before. Now let's italicize the mood-builders within them, that
make each so different from the others:

Objective: to emphasize color, beauty, excitement, visual
image:

And when that third precious ingredient reaches those
buds—then that very morning vou will open the door to
vour house—AND YOU WILL BE BLINDED BY THE
_EXPLOSION OF COLOR THAT GREETS YOU IN YOUR_
GARDEN! . . . You will see rose bushes weighted down by_masses of blossoms, of a richness and perfume and color_
you have never imagined before! You will walk past solid,
_blazing rows of chrysanthemums so thick that you can't_
_even see a leaf in between. . . ._

Notice that you don't even distinguish many of the separate
images until they are called to vour attention. Notice also that
some of the words are primarily visual image-sharpeners (weighted
down . . . solid, blazing rows . . . so thick you can't even see a leaf
in between). While others convey, not image, but emotion (precious . . . that very morning . . . blinded . . . greets . . . you never
imagined before).

These words are emotion-definers. They tell the reader what
_to feel about the images and ideas you are presenting to him._
Their very essence is that they are so subtle that he does not see
them . . . that thev do not call attention to themselves, but simply
flavor and evaluate the images your copy is forming in his mind.

Certain classes of readers will notice these emotion definers.
When they do, your copy becomes either questionable or corny to
them, and vou have lost them. Therefore, vou have to know always whom you are writing for. What their level of sophistication
is—in tone as well as product-awareness. And vou may have to

^ [Z 4] THE FINAL TOUCHES

change your tone when you take the same ad from one class of
media to another—down as well as up.

Of course, when everybody sees vour emotion words, then
you've got a bad ad, and you'd better rewrite, fast.

And don't forget the rhythms. Read the ad out loud. See
how you can almost scan it, as though it were close to blankverse. This richness of rhythm parallels the richness of image—
helps build the excitement and sensuousness of the mood.

Now let's look at another piece of pounding copv, and see
how words and rhvthms add to the power and momentum that
are put behind its staccato stream of claims:

_"This letter says that if you could onlv liberate the_
_exact same talent and intelligence and abilitv that vou have_
_tied up inside you today—then you could:_

"read anything you wish, twice as fast as vou can read
it today..."

_"absorb facts like a sponge, and repeat them almost_
_word for word years later . . ._

_"flash through math, business, financial problems that_
have you stopped cold todav. . .

_"hold people spellbound with the power of vour speech_
and your written word . . .

_"out-think others when you have to. tower over them_
in judgement, outshine them completely in imagination . . ."

Here again, there are two types of emotion-definers. The
power words (liberate . . . hold spellbound . . . out-think . . . tower
over . . . outshine completely), which build a subconscious current
of potency that permeates each individual claim as it occurs in
the copy. And the frankness, man-to-man, lets-let-our-hair-down
tone-builders (this letter says . . . tied up inside vou . . . like a
sponge . . . stopped cold) that say silently that there's no nonsense
here, no high-faluting phrases—just common-sense which can be
absorbed bv anvone.

And, of course, the machine-gun rhvthm. Short, choppy
sentences. Verb . . . verb . . . verb. Claim . . . claim . . . claim. Pro

THE FINAL TOUCHES 225

pelling the reader through the copy. Piling promise upon promise, image upon image in an attempt to overwhelm him.

Notice especially the vast difference between these two
highly-successful pieces of copy. Their vocabulary, the type of
emotions they strive to arouse, the images they use, the models
of speech they borrow, the length of sentence and paragraph, the
ratio of adjectives to nouns and verbs, etc.

We could go on, of course. Go back to the Volkswagen copy,
and see how the emotional tone of sincerity is conveyed by the
_absence of adjectives, in all the places you'd ordinarily expect to_
find them. As well as whimsey. a continuous self-kidding, which
builds, first, a sort of corporate affection, and then trust.

Try the fire injector ad again. Notice how the long, rather
clumsv sentences give a feeling of ingenuousness and reason to
the copy Try to read them out loud. You can't. They don't scan;
they have no definable rlrythm: they don't look like a "copy writer"
wrote them at all. And, of course, there is the same straightfrom-the-shoulder phraseology, to reinforce this feeling of honest appraisal.

All this, I repeat, is done unconsciously. You do not see it
unless vou look for it. And sometimes you have to dig very deep
indeed to get every piece of it.

Mood-building is deliberate on the part of the copywriter—
unnoticed on the part of his reader. As with so much of the
rest of the ad, it lies underneath the surface, to do its work
imperceptibly.

# EPILOGUE A COPY WRITER'S LIBRARY

I have now given you what I've
learned about writing copy. It has taken many years to learn it—
three more to set it down to my own satisfaction. I hope it will
help vou in the onlv way that really counts: to do a better job
and make a little more money.

There are, of course, manv many men in this industry who
know far more about these techniques, and who can produce far
better copy than I. Mv excuse for writing this book is that they
don't seem to have included—at least to my present knowledge—
manv of the specific techniques which I've discussed with you
here.

Some of them' have written books on the subject—great
books—and I'd like to list them here for you. I think you should
buy and read, every one of them, and then thumb through them
again everv year or so, just to catch what you may have forgotten.

Here they are:
Indispensable, of course, is Julian Watkins' great anthology:
_The 100 Greatest Advertisements, Moore Publishing, 1949._

228 EPILOGUE —A COPY WRITERS LIBRARY

Claude Hopkins wrote a great book, My Life in Advertising,
Harper, 1927. Make them dig it up for you. And see if vou can't
get some of the old Hopkins ads.

John E. Kennedy (not F.) wrote a little pamphlet manv years
ago called Intensive Advertising, which has just been republished
by Printer's Ink. Get it. It'll be the most profitable evening's reading you've ever done.

J. K. Lasker, who worked with both these great writers, never
wrote anything himself. But he did give a series of talks before
his staff one week, and Printers Ink has again captured them.
They're called The Lasker Story.

Robert Collier's Letter Book is published bv Prentice-Hall.
It's a gold mine.

David Ogilw wrote Confessions of an Advertising Man, which
you can buv as a paperback. Charming and wonderfully profitable.

Rosser Reeves' very short book, Reality in Advertising, is
published by Knopf, and must be read several times before vou
get everything out of it vou should.

Milton Biow's book, Butting In, is marvelous in the first half,
repetitive in the second.

And don't forget Campbell's book, Writing Non-Fiction. Or
those by Caples. Young, Glim and Bedell. Or the motivation research books bv Dichter and Martineau. Or the great book on
layout, Visual Persuasion, bv Baker.

Then there are the books on American society' todav—bv
Mills, Riesman, Fromm, Kardiner and all the rest. And the articles on the emerging trends in the media. And the media themselves. And of course—your primarv source—the ads themselves.

Keep reading. Keep analvzing. Keep writing. Keep looking
for the new idea—the million dollars hidden somewhere in that
typewriter of yours. Always shoot for the moon—it's one of the
few real thrills left today!
