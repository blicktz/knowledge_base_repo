According to Constant Content, 50 percent of marketers say white papers are a valuable tool for lead generation. More than 49 percent of B2B buyers used a white paper to help them make technology purchase decisions.
 Over the years, I’ve seen a number of direct-mail and e-mail tests in which offering a free white paper or other free content increased response rates by 10 percent to 100 percent or more. I do think, however, that we have to broaden our notion of how to use free content offers, which is essentially what a white paper is: free information designed to educate our prospects and motivate them to inquire about our product or service.
 To begin with, I think it’s not white papers themselves that are tiring but the name itself. “White paper” signals to some prospects a document that is an obvious selling tool. And with virtually every white paper in the world available for free, white papers have a low perceived value as a giveaway.
 The solution is to keep using white papers in your marketing but to call them something else. The mailing list broker Edith Roman used to publish a print catalog of mailing lists. But instead of calling it a catalog, the broker called it the “Direct Mail Encyclopedia.” Offering a free Direct Mail Encyclopedia helped generate more inquiries for its brokerage services.
 Copywriter Ivan Levison calls his white papers “guides.” Marketer David Yale uses “executive briefing.” I’m partial to “special report.” For consumer marketing, marketing expert Joe Polish suggests “consumer awareness guide,” and for a B2B white paper giving product selection tips, I’d change this to “buyer’s guide” or “selection guide.” For a white paper giving tips or instructions on a process, I might call it a “manual.” If you publish a print version that fits in a #10 envelope and is saddle stitched, you can call it a “free booklet.”

-----

### Does what you call your lead magnet really matter? I think it does, because calling it a report or guide creates a perception of greater value— after all, thousands of publishers actually sell special reports and booklets for prices ranging from $3 to $40 or more. I often put a dollar price for the report in the upper right corner of the front cover, which strengthens the perception that the freebie has value; I don’t think this would be credible on a document labeled as a white paper.
 What about the complaint that prospects already have too much to read? I am reminded of a quotation from Rutherford Rogers: “We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge.” There is more information on the Internet than you could process in a thousand lifetimes.
 But good white papers don’t merely present information; they offer solutions to business and technical problems. Virtually every sale you make is because someone thinks your product or service is the solution to their problem. A white paper can help clarify the problem as well as convince the reader that your idea or method is the best of many options for addressing it.
 Every marketing campaign has an objective, yet if you ask most managers what the objective of their white paper is, they probably couldn’t tell you. Too many see white papers as an opportunity to merely collect and publish a pile of research material they found on the Web using Google. To make your white paper successful, you must define the marketing objective before writing a single word.
 For example, a manufacturer found that consumers were not buying their do-it-yourself (DIY) underground sprinkler kits, because home owners perceived installing the irrigation system by themselves as too difficult. Solution: a free DIY manual on how to install an underground sprinkler system in a single weekend. Clearly written and illustrated, the manual overcame the perception that this was a tough project, making it look easy.
 In the pre-Internet era, bait pieces such as the sprinkler guide were mainly paper and ink. Thanks to the PC and the Internet, bait pieces can now be produced as PDF files and instantly downloaded online. But at the receiving end, they are usually printed by the prospect and read on paper.

-----

### It may be that what’s wearing out is not free content, but the standard white paper format: pages of black ink on 8½ x 11–inch sheets of paper. To make your bait piece stand out, consider using alternative formats: DVDs, CDs, data on thumb drives, podcasts, webinars, tele-seminars, flash cards, stickers, posters, software, games, and slide guides.
 A slide guide is a cardboard promotional item with a moving slide or wheel that allows the prospect to perform some simple calculation (e.g., convert inches to centimeters or determine the monthly payments on a mortgage).
 Most white papers are six to ten pages—about 3,000 to 4,000 words— but you are not locked into that length. You can go shorter or longer, depending on the content you want to present and the marketing objective of the bait piece. The bait piece can be as short and simple as a list of tips printed on one side of a sheet of paper. Or it can be as long as a self- published paperback book.
 Free content offers have been used effectively in marketing for decades, and rather than tiring, they have been given new life, thanks in part to the information-oriented culture spawned by the Internet. “Every organization possesses particular expertise that has value in the new e-marketplace of ideas,” writes David Meerman Scott. “Organizations gain credibility and loyalty with customers, employees, the media, investors, and suppliers through content.”[3]

 9 STEPS TO MARKETING WITH WHITE PAPERS

 This section shows how to plan a white paper marketing campaign for your product or service. Elements of the plan include:

 1. Target markets—the groups of buyers who share a common problem,
 including their demographic and psychographic profile. 2. Problem identification—a clear definition of the pressing problem
 your product can help these buyers to solve. 3. Solution identification—why your product or methodology is a
 superior solution. Includes an evaluation of strengths and weaknesses

-----

### of your product versus the competition. 4. Content—the type and format of the information you are going to
 provide these prospects in your marketing (e.g., online tutorials, regional seminars, standard white papers). 5. Media—where to reach these buyers (i.e., lists, databases,
 publications, Web sites, other media). 6. Tactics—means by which you will reach these prospects (i.e., direct
 mail, advertising, e-mail marketing, print advertising, radio spots, trade shows, and other marketing communications). 7. Schedule—quantities of promotions and when they are to run. 8. Budget—what it will cost. 9. Metrics—how you will measure results to evaluate whether the
 objectives have been achieved.

 STEP ONE: DETERMINE YOUR TARGET MARKET

 Your target market is the group of buyers who share a common problem, including their demographic and psychographic profile. Most marketers already have a pretty good idea of their target market. For instance, if you sell dental office equipment, your prospect is the dentist and his or her office staff.
 Big corporations routinely spend thousands of dollars on expensive and elaborate market research studies designed to help them get inside the minds of their customers. These can include mail and online surveys, telephone interviews, and focus groups. Entrepreneurs running small businesses become worried that if they don’t do this kind of expensive market research, they won’t know how to reach their prospects and will fail miserably.
 But for many small companies, the cost of even one study from one of the big market research companies would wipe out their entire marketing budget for the year. Relax. The good news is that focus groups and other formal market research studies are completely unnecessary.
 “But how will I understand my customers?” you may ask. Simple: just use my colleague Michael Masterson’s BDF formula, which stands for

-----

### Beliefs, Desires, and Feelings. The BDF formula says that you can understand your prospect by asking yourself three simple questions:

 “What do my prospects believe? What are their attitudes?” “What do my prospects desire? What do they want?” “What do my prospects feel? What are their emotions?”

 There’s little or no market research required, because you probably already know these things about your prospects. You really do! As Dr. Benjamin Spock used to say: “Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.”
 For instance, a company that provides “soft skills” training to information technology (IT) professionals was promoting a new on-site seminar. It sent out a flyer with the title of the program as the headline: “Interpersonal Skills for IT Professionals.” It generated less than half a percent response. (The offer was more detailed information about the program and registration.)
 So the marketing manager and the owner brainstormed and asked themselves the BDF questions. Here’s part of what they came up with:

 IT professionals BELIEVE that technology is all important … and that they are smarter than the non-techies they serve. IT professionals DESIRE recognition … respect … continuing opportunity to update their skill set in new technologies and platforms … job security … more money. IT professionals FEEL an adversarial relationship with end users … they are constantly arguing with them … and they resent having to explain their technology to us ignoramuses.

 Based on this BDF analysis, the company rewrote the letter and tested it. This time, it generated a 3 percent response, outperforming the old mailing by 6 to 1. And one-third of those inquiries purchased an on-site one-day training seminar for $3,000. That means for every one hundred pieces

-----

### mailed, at a total cost of about $100, they got three leads … and one order for $3,000 … a 30-to-1 return on their marketing investment.
 Oh, and the headline based on the BDF analysis? It was this:

 IMPORTANT NEWS FOR ANY IT PROFESSIONAL WHO HAS EVER FELT LIKE TELLING AN END USER, “GO TO HELL.”

 Says the company owner, “The BDF formula forced us to focus on the prospect instead of the product (our seminar), and the result was a winning promotion.”
 Amount of money spent on market research before the mailing? Not a dime.

 STEP TWO: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

 Next, you need a clear definition of the pressing problem your product can help these buyers solve. What are your customers most concerned about that your product can help them with? Or as my colleague Don Hauptman is fond of asking, “What’s keeping these prospects up at night?”
 Marketing reaches prospects on a deeper level when it starts with those prospects—their needs, problems, concerns, worries, fears, and desires— and then connects those needs and wants to the benefits the product delivers.

 ONE THING CONTENT MARKETING CANNOT DO

White papers, and in fact all the marketing you do, cannot create a need or make someone
want a benefit they do not already want. As Eugene Schwartz explains in his book
_Breakthrough Advertising:_

“The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work,
comes from the market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a
product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears, and desires that already exist in the hearts
of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product.
This is the copywriter’s task: not to create this mass desire—but to channel and direct it.”

-----

### Content marketing does not, for instance, create the desire among IT professionals to keep their computer systems safe from hacking and computer viruses. It was not until that desire already existed as a major concern that sales of firewalls, antivirus software, and other security solutions took off.
 What you as a marketer can do in this instance is (a) dramatize the severity and urgency of the problem to create even greater awareness among IT professionals, and (b) educate them about the best, most reliable, and most affordable solutions for solving the problem.
 For instance, SurfControl, a company since acquired by Websense, had a product that filtered unwanted Internet content. One of the goals of its content marketing program was to educate prospects about the dangers that unwanted Internet content, such as that delivered by spam and instant messaging, as well as use of the company computers for personal purposes, (e.g., checking stocks) pose to their networks and corporate productivity.

 STEP THREE: SOLUTION IDENTIFICATION

 Once you have clearly identified the problem, you want to offer a solution. In a conventional marketing campaign, this solution would clearly be the product or service you are selling. But in a content marketing campaign, we often position the white paper itself as a solution (albeit, a partial solution) to the prospect’s problem.
 So, for instance, if the prospect is a Web master struggling with the question of whether to spend a lot of his company’s money on a content management system (CMS), a white paper on “How to Calculate ROI from Your CMS” may be just the thing he needs to make the decision.
 Should your marketing materials focus on the product or the lead magnet? It’s not always clear. But here’s a rule of thumb that direct marketers have been using for decades with good results:
 If you have an exceptionally strong free content offer, LEAD WITH THE OFFER in your copy. On the other hand, if the offer is not strong, lead with the prospect’s problems and then offer the product as the solution. Therefore, I suggest the following guidelines:

-----

### If your white paper is just average—meaning the content is either average or not of compelling interest to the prospect, or there is already a lot of similar information on the topic available—do not stress it in your advertising. If your white paper is superior—great quality content, valuable information, hard-to-get data, unique format or manner of presentation —consider stressing it early in your copy, perhaps even in the headline. If your product is similar to other products in its category, find an important aspect of the product that your competitors do not stress, and educate your prospects about this by offering them a free white paper explaining it. If your product is superior—more features, innovative technology, superior quality—devote a lot of your copy to making the case for its superiority, and then close with the offer of a white paper as an added incentive for prospects to response.

 STEP FOUR: CONTENT

 Here are a few more tips for writing white papers:

 The narrower the topic, the better. Tailor the content to the primary prospects (e.g., CEO, process engineer, plant manager). Craft the content so it helps move readers to the next step in the buying process.

 What main points and secondary points should be covered? You can determine this by making a content outline. Show it to subject matter experts (SMEs) in the company. They will tell you what doesn’t belong and add what you may have left out, as well as correct technical errors.

 STEP FIVE: MEDIA

-----

### Where and how can you reach potential buyers—your target audience? To get results, you must promote your offer of a free white paper to prospects, and that is usually accomplished through some form of direct marketing.
 Direct marketing through postal mail or e-mail is difficult unless you can obtain a list of prospects in your target market. Look around to see what’s available in your target market with regard to mailing lists, databases, publications, Web sites, trade shows, conventions, professional associations, newsletters, e-zines, and other media. The more targeted your list, the greater the response rate to your marketing campaign.
 On an episode of President Donald Trump’s reality TV program The Apprentice, Trump gave the same assignment to two competing groups: create a bridal shop and hold an evening sale; whichever team had the higher sales would win.
 Team A’s marketing strategy was to print up flyers on the sale and hand them out at Penn Station during rush hour. Trump questioned the wisdom of this strategy, asking, “How many people are thinking of getting married when they get off the train to go to work in the morning?”
 Team B’s marketing strategy was to obtain a large e-mail list of New Yorkers who are getting married and e-mail a notice about the sale to the list.
 I think you can guess the outcome: Team A’s store was virtually empty. They had only a handful of shoppers, and sold just two dresses, grossing $1,000.
 Team B’s more targeted e-mail marketing strategy was the winner: they had people waiting in line to get into the shop, sold twenty-six dresses, and grossed more than $12,000 in sales, outselling Team A by better than twelve to one. (Sure enough, Trump fired Team A’s leader that week.)
 The point: the more targeted your media-mailing lists, online lists, banner ads, magazine and newspaper ads, radio and TV commercials, the more prospects who will download your white paper.

 STEP SIX: TACTICS

-----

### Tactics are the means by which you will reach your prospects (i.e., direct mail, advertising, e-mail marketing, print advertising, radio spots, trade shows, banner ads, pay-per-click ads, joint ventures, and other marketing communications).
 Part of your decision regarding tactics is governed by cost and availability. For instance, if there is no list you can rent of prospects with their e-mail addresses, you probably can’t use e-mail marketing to reach them. Sometimes there is a mailing list priced at a reasonable rental cost of $100 per thousand e-mails. But if the list owner wants $1,000 per thousand, e-mail is not going to be economically feasible.
 Another factor governing tactic selection is your prospects. E-mail marketing will not work if the majority of your prospects don’t have access to the Internet—which, surprisingly, is still about half of the world’s population.[4]

 STEP SEVEN: SCHEDULE
