This is what it sounds like because it takes so long to identify each one of these devices and show vou how to work them.
Because of this need for analysis—which always requires that vou
cut individual elements out of the "life-flow" of a growing ad—
it sounds like you should actually be conscious of each device as
_you are using it to write that ad—even going so far as to name_
the device as vou weave it in.

I don't think I have to tell you that this mechanical approach
is not my idea, and that it won't work. What I'm trying to do is
exactly the same procedure that a golf pro uses when he wants
to improve your game. He doesn't just let you go out and plav.
He stops you, makes you notice your hands, rationalize your grip.
shift your fingers, get used to the new feel of the club as you lift
it this new way, and then take a few practice swings—all at the
same time that he's telling you why you're doing it this way.

When you're swinging for the first few times, this new wav.
you feel pretty awkward, and you're conscious of everv muscle
in your arms. That's why he has you keep swinging—through one
bucket. . . two buckets ... ten buckets of balls.

Pretty soon, though, those arm muscles are going to feel
comfortable in that new swing. And you're going to lose your

conscious awareness of them. At that point, what was mechanical before becomes intuitive now. But it's a new kind of intu_ition—far more, skillful and effective than you had before._

This is the kind of intuition I'm trying to build in vou. I'm
trying to take you from Creatix itv #1 to Creativity #2. Both are
intuitive states, where you write from the full depths of vour
emotions as well as your mind, and when [1] vou are no more conscious of the mechanisms and devices that vou are employing to
gain your effects, than you are of the movements of vour fingers
on the typewriter kevs.

But, to get you from State #1 to State #2. 1 have to bring
all these details to consciousness—and make vou awkward in a
new and more effective wav than vou were when vou first learned
to write copy—so that you can take these insights and techniques
and bury them inside your own talent—so that vou can automatically employ them, without thinking about them at all. when
vou want to express most powerfully vour ideas, vour emotions
and vour sales philosophy.

This whole process of "New Awkwardness leading to NewAbility" is seen quite clearly in the very simple technique of Interweaving, which I learned from a brilliant man bv the name of
Walter S. Campbell.

Every copy writer should read Campbell's book, Writing Non_Fiction (The Writer, Inc., 1961). In the next chapter I'll list other_
books you should have. But this is certainly one of the important ones that you can probably master in a weekend.

Campbell is talking about reporting and not copy writing,
but the structural principles are the same. He savs that even
in the most factual reporting, no sentence can be effective if it
_contains only the facts alone._ It must also contain emotion,
evaluation, impact—if those facts are to be given meaning and
importance to the reader.

The same is true for every sentence you write of copy. That
sentence should contain not only promise . . . not only image
not only logic—but as much of all three as possible.

-----

204 THE FINAL TOl'CIII>

_Weave together your promise, vour logic, vonr emotion, vour_
image. Pack vour sentences full of every one of them. Make them
blend into each other, till its almost impossible to pull out the
individual threads of the rich pattern of conviction and desire
vou're weaving.

For example, go back to the fire injector ad in Chapter 12.
and see how promise is interwoven in even sentence of the believabilitv copy where the injectors are being contrasted with the
old-fashioned plugs. In these two sentences, for instance:

_"With ordinary spark plugs you are using, or should he using_
_premium gas (disadvantage) which costs from 4 to 8 cents more_
than ordinary gas (disadvantage), and despite this (disadvantage
you're getting inefficient (disadvantage), wasteful (disadvantage[1 ]

gas consumption (disadvantage)."

Ill this first sentence, which is part of a logical sequence offered as proof of superiority through comparison of performance
characteristics, the copv writer has managed to insert six
disadvantage-images for the reader to remember the next time
he considers buying ordinary plugs.

Now the copv writer goes on to his contrasting sentence
about the injectors:

_"Willi fire injectors regular gas (promise) will give i/ou up_
_to 8 miles more per gallon (promise), up to 31 more horsepower_
_(promise), plus easier starting (promise) in all weather (prom-_
ise)."

Five promises in this second sentence. The packing in of
image upon image to build an overwhelming effect.

Or, as an even more complicated example, involving the interweaving of almost everv copv element in the book, let's look
at this sentence:

_"And, most important, (a mood-builder, indicating the value_
to the reader of the promises which are about to follow) these
_experts (reference to authority to build believabilitv) liave dis-_
_covered (more believabilitv through the use of the scientific_
idiom) that i/ou do not have to he a handyman (the core-promise [1 ]

or « mcc/wmr (restatement of the core-promise) in order to
_coax (promise of ease) this performance (promise, condensing_
all the claims of superior reception that have already been detailed in the previous copy) out of i/our set."

Now, is this done consciously[1]/Not at all. But the copy writer
knew the principle of internet in-r . . . |1U(I experimented with it
before . . . and had it stored axvax in Ins unconscious as one more
tool to be used—intuitiyely-to urain the effect he wanted, at the
exact moment he needed it.

Try it yourself. See how mam different emotions you can
pack into a single sentence . . . paragraph . . . sequence. See how
much richer and more powerful xour cop\ becomes. How much

**Sensitivity-How to Give Your Reader What He Demands**

**Step In Step Throughout the Copy**

Now; if you continue to pile promise upon promise, identification upon identification, documentation upon documentation element upon element, where do you stop, Where does it become
_too much? Where does the reader become satiated or bored_ _and_
_want to go on to a new image or new promise, or even the close?_

_At what point are you starting to oversell? How do uou catch_
_yourself, and switch_ _off?_

_We have already touched on this problem before in Chap-_
ter 11. I suggest that vou reread that discussion now. even though
we re going to expand on it at this point.

Here you are reiving on your own powers of empathy You
must be, at the same time, not only the writer of your ad but
its reader. You must anticipate that point in the copy flow--as it
is transformed into a series of impressions in your readers m i n d where he is going to sax-: "I've read enough about this. Give me
this instead."

-----

2 0 6 THE FINAL TOUCHED

And then vou must shift the direction of the copv to meet
his new direction of interest.

In other words, what we are talking about now is the over_all structure of your ad. Not a sentence, or a paragraph, or a se-_
quence: but the architecture of the ad as a ichole.

Every ad has an architecture, as I'm sure YOU know. This is
the over-all pattern of the ad, including when and where and how
mam- times you shift from one t\pe of copy to another. It is the
ability to recognize these shift points, and to change when YOU
encounter them from—sa\-—promise copy to mechanism copy to
documentation copy to promise copy again, that makes vour ad
stick together, or fall apart.

This is an almost impossible skill to communicate, since it
relies so much on the feel of each individual situation. However.
I can show it to YOU after it's occurred, in a series of four ads
on the same general type of product—books—and how each differs from the others in the way large blocks of copy elements are
blended in and out of the oyer-all sell.

As IYe said before, I use mail order as m\ example because
mail order is the longest general form of copy, because it usually sells the hardest, and because the techniques I'm talking
about are usually outlined most clearly in this type of copy.

Let's look at our four ads, and see how each approaches the
basic task of selling a similar product in a different way and with
a different blend of elements:

**Sample Ad #1**

This is the friend-winning ad we looked at in our last chapter. IYe indicated each major block of copy, in sequence, by a
letter of the alphabet; and each of the shift points b\- a number.

I am using as examples all direct-promise headlines. The
promise in this headline is almost universal (A): that vou can
make anybody like YOU. (See page 208.)

Instead of intensifying the promise immediately, however, as

-----

THE FINAL TOUCHES 207

many other ads in this category have done, this copv starts out
by restating the original headline promise (making anybody like
_you becomes popularity) and by defining the previously unrec-_
ognized fact that this popularity can be taught. (B).

Why was this done? For two reasons: (1) because this novel,
almost paradoxical redefinition _iCan popularity be purchased?)_
established an immediate point of difference between this book
and the dozens of similar titles that had come before it
always a critical problem. And (2> because this ad's subject was
a teacher, and the ad's whole believabilitv rested upon the fact
that so many large and respected corporations had paid this
man so much money to reach these techniques to their employees.

This is established by the ads first shift point and first transitional sentence (1). This has hern proved by ., . leads directlv
into the first documentation block (.'•. in which the corporations
are named.

Thus we have the developing pattern of the ad as:
Promise
Definition
Documentation . . .
Right up to the next transition sentence (2), which brings in
the first detailed promise block iD). and which then echoes again
the documentation (E) and price comparison.

Now, after a brief transitional promise (F), the ad defines
again the importance of the over-all promise (G), backs it up
with a third restatement of the documentation (H), and then
states directly the price comparison and monev-back guarantee (I).

Then, with the classic transition (3), it goes on to devote the
rest of the ad to a detailed cataloguing of the promise (f). A
recitation of promises that are far stronger now—because of the
preparation of definition and documentation that has been laid
for them, than they would have ever been had thev simply been
put at the beginning of the ad without such preparation.

210 THE FINAL TOUCHES

Incidentalh', notice how the negative promises (K), and the
full list of documentation (L), have been placed out of the main
stream of the ad where they can be read, or not read, by those
that are interested in them.

**Sample Ad #2**

An ad for a book on improving the power of vour mind.
Again the promise-headline (A), intensified by—this time—an
elaboration of this promise (B). (See page 212.)

Now, using its first transitional sentence (1), the ad moves
into two paragraphs of negative (C) and positive (D) redefinition.
And then, with a single transition-word {Simph/—2), again elaborates the promise, making it stronger and stronger and more
and more detailed, and at the same time giving it the believabilitvtone of definition.

This definition-tone is unchanged throughout (F), where
promise is again interwoven with fact, leading immediately into
a transition (3) in which the tone is that of proof, but the content is straight promise (G).

Then this proof is connected (4) with the entire promise
catalog (H) which fills the rest of the ad.

This ad—enormously successful—is one of the best examples
of interweaving we have. There is so subtle a blending here of
definition, documentation and promise, that everv word of the
copy soon takes on the aura of pure fact.

**Sample Ad #3**

Now we move on to the straight-promise ad. This is the
rock-em, sock-em type, dominated by promise and mechanismpromise, which gains its power from the sheer momentum and
relentlessness of its claims. (See page 216.)

It again starts with the over-all promise (A), which it immediately follows up with a second, elaborating promise (B).

-----

THE FINAL TOUCHES 211

Then it moves directly into its fundamental definition (C),
which it equates in a' single phrase (then t/oti could—I) with a
greatly detailed promise (D), and then follows up with a beautifully condensed paragraph which consists of a transition in (2) to
a restatement of its fundamental redefinition (E). and out again
(3) to the remainder of the ad. (F>. which is sheer promise and
promise-mechanism from then on.

Here, documentation is disregarded entirely. The full weight
of the sale depends on the power and momentum of the promisetrain.

**Sample Ad #4**

And finally, we have a beauty book. Here, the main promiseheadline (B) is preceded by the critical authority-reference (A)
which: first, sets it apart from the other similar products it must
erase from the prospects mind: and second, brings in immediately the key persuader of its author. (See page 220.)

(C) block, while promise copy, also serves the simultaneous
purpose of being a momentum-builder—a technique we will discuss in a moment.

Using the different type faces and sizes as transitional elements, the copy then introduces its crucial concentration copy
(D), in which it redefines what the woman can now expect from
her appearance, and in which it outdates other approaches to giving this fulfillment to her.

After (1) _Because... comes_ the first promise-elaboration
#### block.

But there is no piling up of claim upon claim here. There is
too much ingrained skepticism in this prospect—too much awareness of other, previous claims that have disappointed her in the
past. This skepticism must be anticipated, and answered. This is
done, first (F) by agreeing with it, and then (G) bv shifting the
entire story onto the doctor for twelve paragraphs—bv far the
longest reference to authority of any of our four sample ads.

214 THE FINAL TOUCHES

Then a transition (2) back to promise (H), which fills out
the rest of the ad.

**See How the Structure Differs**

Let me say this. Although I have not pointed out everv transition, nor everv blending of different tvpes of copv, I have, 1
hope, given you enough material to see clearlv how ads differ in
overall structure, as they differ in content, as the demands of
their material differ.

They range from the simplest promise-elaboration (example
3), to the most subtle blending of all the various elements of desire, image, proof, definition and what have vou (example 2), to
the most complicated promise-and-proof. . . promise-and-proof
reinforcement (example 4).

Each problem demands a different structure. Each signals.
as you write it, that here—at this precise point—your copy has
_left your reader. You have gone on straight when lie wants to_
turn left. You are piling on promise after promise, when lie no
longer believes you. You are burving him under a sea of statistics, when he is convinced you are telling the truth, and wants
you to make those delicious promises all over again.

This is what you feel when you are writing the ad. Probablv
a kind of irritating confusion. A blockage. A sense that the copv
has suddenly gone dead, and all you are writing now is words.

So you stop, and think, and look for a new direction. I hope.
in this section, that I have given you a faint indication of what
some of these directions might be.

What, on the other hand, can vou learn from analvzing the
structure of your ads (or other writers') after vou have finished
them?

Primarily—what kind of ad you have written. Is it straight
promise? Too much documentation? Too little definition of the
new world of possibilities vour product has created?

Does it still sound too much like evervone else's copv. Or

-----

THE FINAL TOUCHES 215

product? Could you put another brand-name on it, and not make
any difference?

_Have you left anything out? Will this bare promise earrv the_
sale? Or could you increase its impact bv paving its wav with
some mechanism or believabilitv copv? How about a proof section? A use photo? A fuller description of the wav it works?

Mind you, this is not content alone that ice are discussing.
If you take the same content, and give it a new structure, you
are going to create a new ad. Trv it. See for yourself. If vou're
stuck sometime, throw awav vour headline, throw awav vour rough
copy flow, and start off again ISO degrees away from where you
started before.

I want to repeat this again: A new structure is a new ad. It
brings out new ideas. Gives vour promises new sharpness, new
flavor, new believabilitv and even begins to create whole new sections that you never dreamed were there in the product before.
