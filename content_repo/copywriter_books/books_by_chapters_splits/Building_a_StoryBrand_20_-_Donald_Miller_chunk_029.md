###### A good way to craft each nurture email is to use an effective formula that offers simple, helpful advice to a customer. I’ve been using this formula for years because it helps me offer clear value.

 Paragraph #1: Talk about a problem. Paragraph #2: Offer a plan, idea, recipe, or formula that solves the
 problem. Paragraph #3: Describe what life can look like if the problem is solved. Paragraph #4: If possible, turn the advice into a three-step plan and use
 those steps to summarize your advice.

 I also recommend including a postscript, aka the PS. Often, the PS is the only part of the text somebody who opens a mass email will actually read.
 That’s really it. If you cover these four areas as efficiently as possible, you’ll be crafting emails your customers open, read, and remember. And don’t forget, StoryBrand.AI can actually write a rough draft of these emails for you.

 WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF A GOOD NURTURE EMAIL? Here’s how a nurture email campaign works: Recently we consulted with the owner of a dog boarding company interested in growing her business. We recommended she create a lead-generating PDF called “5 Things Your Dog Thinks About When You’re Away” in exchange for the email addresses of qualified customers. What dog lover wouldn’t want to read a PDF with a title like that? Perfect.
 A few days after somebody downloaded the PDF, they would get the first email in the nurture campaign. That email looked like this:

Subject: Should We Free Feed Our Dogs?

Dear ______,

At Crest Hill Boarding we’re often asked whether it’s okay to free feed our dogs. Free feeding
a dog is certainly the easiest way to make sure a dog always has food and never goes hungry,
but there are some problems you should know about when it comes to free feeding. Dogs that
are free fed often gain excess fat later in life and other health problems can occur without our
noticing.

-----

We recommend feeding your dog a set amount, once or twice per day. After twenty minutes, if
your pet hasn’t eaten their food, we recommend discarding the excess and waiting until the
next set time to feed them again.

By sticking to a set amount of food and a set feeding schedule, you’ll be able to monitor what
your dog eats and also be able to diagnose any illness your pet may be suffering from that is
making them lose their appetite. This will ensure your dog stays healthy and happy long into
their life.

Here’s to enjoying our pets for a long, long time.

Sincerely,
X

PS. As for how much each dog should be fed, it really depends on how old your dog is and
how big. Next time you and your dog are in the shop, introduce us to your dog and we’ll tell
you everything we know about the breed.

###### The bottom of this email contained our client’s logo, their one-liner, and a phone number in case anyone was ready to place an order. Still, getting an order wasn’t the primary concern. The primary concern was to offer something of value, position the business as the guide, create reciprocity, and, most importantly, stay familiar to the customer.
 You can see how getting a weekly email like this would make our client’s kennel stand out in any dog owner’s mind. The next time a potential customer had to suddenly leave town, they’d fondly remember her kennel and take their dog in for boarding.
 After three more emails like this, our client included an email that contained an offer and a call to action.

 How to Write the Offer and Call-to-Action Email
 About every third or fourth email in a nurture campaign should offer a product or service the customer can buy. The key here is to be direct. Making a passive offer is only going to make you look weak, so know going into it that your sales email is just that—an email that sells something.

**THE SALES FORMULA WE PREFER LOOKS LIKE THIS:**

###### Paragraph #1: Talk about the customer’s problem.

-----

###### Paragraph #2: Describe a product you offer that solves this problem. Paragraph #3: Describe what life can look like for the reader once the
 problem is solved. Paragraph #4: Ensure that purchasing your product is the right decision
 if they want to solve their problem, let them know how much it costs, mention any special discounts or bonuses, and then ask the customer to place an order.

 A GOOD OFFER AND CALL-TO-ACTION EMAIL Similar to the nurture email, the offer and call-to-action email aims to solve a problem. The only difference is that the solution to the problem is your product and a strong call to action has been inserted. You are inviting this customer to do business with you. Here’s an offer and call-to-action email we wrote for Crest Hill dog kennel:

Subject: A solution for scary boarding

Dear ______,

If you’re anything like us, you hate leaving your dog behind when you go out of town. And
you hate the idea of your dog being locked in a crate next to a bunch of other stress-inducing,
barking dogs. As dog lovers, we used to hate that feeling too, and that’s why we created Crest
Hill Boarding.

At Crest Hill, your dog plays so hard all day, they are eager to lie down at night. We have three
full-time staff members throwing tennis balls and enticing dogs to run and play so they’re far
too distracted to realize they’re anywhere other than in paradise. This means that by the end of
the day all the other dogs are eager to sleep too, and so your dog rests comfortably in a mostly
quiet environment. You won’t believe how quiet our kennels are once we put the dogs to bed
at 8 p.m.

Right now you can book three nights at Crest Hill at half price. This is a onetime offer, and it’s
meant to introduce you to how differently we take care of your pet. We think once you see
how eager your dog will be to join us, you’ll feel better when you have to leave town. No
more guilt. No more sad goodbyes.

To take advantage of this offer, just call us. You don’t even have to know when the next time
you’re going to leave town. We will just mark you in our system as having taken advantage of
the offer.

Call us today at 555–5555.

We can’t wait for your dog to experience the Crest Hill difference.

Sincerely,
X

PS: Make sure to call today. The call will only take a couple of minutes, and you’ll be in our
system forever. After you call, your dog’s favorite home away from home will be waiting
whenever you’re in need of a safe, reliable, and fun-for-your-dog solution.

###### This email weaves in a tremendous amount of content from Crest Hill’s StoryBrand BrandScript, including the external problem and internal problem along with sound bites from the success element. The gist of the email is that if a subscriber purchases Crest Hill’s offer, one of their concerns will be resolved.
 Note that the call to action is strong and contains a degree of scarcity: it is a onetime offer. Anyone who reads this email knows exactly what we want them to do: call and secure a discount so they can later board their dog at Crest Hill.

 What Software Should We Use?
 There are many software options when it comes to creating an automated email campaign. If you’re working with a designer or advertising agency, this is likely a question for them. You want your designer to work with whatever software they’re accustomed to using. We are big fans of Keap because the CRM is designed for businesses that have between one and twenty-five thousand email subscribers, which covers the needs of the majority of small- to medium-size businesses. Keap also consulted with us to help build our artificial intelligence tools, and they know what they’re talking about.

 Start Small
 Getting an email campaign up and running can feel intimidating, but the process of creating and using a CRM doesn’t have to be a fearful experience. Start small. To get started, simply open a Word document and start crafting your emails or, better, use StoryBrand.AI to craft rough draft emails and then edit them to your liking. You can paste these drafts into an email or CRM later. Writing that initial email is the first step. Once you read it back to yourself, you’re going to want to send it to customers. That’s the beginning. When you start automating that email, you’re going to start

###### getting results, which is going to make you want to write more of them. Before you know it, you’ll have a robust campaign of emails that will engage customers at all hours of the day, even while you sleep.

##### STEP SIX: COLLECT AND TELL STORIES OF
 TRANSFORMATION

###### As we learned earlier in the book, few things are more foundational to a compelling story than a hero’s transformation. Why? Because transformation is a core desire for every human being. That’s why so many stories are about the hero transforming into a better version of themselves and specifically into a person who is competent to defeat the villain and solve their problem.
 People love movies about characters who transform, and they love businesses that help them experience transformation too. One of the best ways we can demonstrate how we help our customers transform is through testimonials.
 Great testimonials give future customers the gift of going second. The challenge lies in getting the right kind of testimonial: one that showcases your value (the results you get for customers) and the experience people had working with you. Simply asking for a testimonial usually won’t work because customers will share their feelings about you by default. “Nancy is a great friend! We highly recommend Nancy and her team!”
 While those are nice words, they do very little in telling their story of transformation. In a testimonial like that, there are no specific results mentioned or details about what life is like now that the transformation has taken place.
 If you’re asking customers to write a testimonial for you, it’s likely they are (1) too busy to give deep thought to writing the testimonial or (2) subpar writers or communicators.
 Weaving together a compelling tale of transformation means you have to ask the right questions—you need some raw materials to work with. The following questions will allow you to build a bank of compelling testimonials that work with nearly any customer quickly and easily.

-----

###### These questions work because they “lead” the client down a specific train of thought. Simply use these questions to create a form customers can fill out. Once they complete the form, the natural flow of the sentences will allow you to copy and paste the answers to build a client case study.
 These same questions can also be used to create video testimonials. Simply invite customers to be interviewed and ask them the following questions. Once the video is edited and B-roll is inserted, you can feature your video on your website or in a sales or nurture email campaign or on a landing page.
 Here are five questions most likely to generate the best response for a customer testimonial:

 1. What was the problem you were having before you discovered
 our product? 2. What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve that
 problem? 3. What was different about our product? 4. Take us to the moment when you realized our product was
 actually working to solve your problem. 5. Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved or
 being solved.

 You can see the arc of the questions naturally yields a transformation story. Once you capture the testimonial, feature it everywhere: emails, promo videos, keynote speeches, live interviews, or at events. One season we closed each episode of the Building a StoryBrand podcast with an interview with someone who transformed their business and their life by applying the StoryBrand framework. The response was overwhelming. We noted an immediate uptick in book purchases and interest in becoming a StoryBrand Certified Guide.
 The point is that people are drawn to transformation. When they see transformation in others, they want it for themselves. The more we feature the transformation journey our customers have experienced, the faster our business will grow.

##### STEP SEVEN: CREATE A SYSTEM THAT GENERATES
 REFERRALS

###### If you ask any business owner how they get new customers, the majority will say “word of mouth.” It would seem obvious, then, that every business out there has a system for generating more word-of-mouth referrals. Unfortunately, that’s seldom the case.
 Once you create a system that funnels potential customers into becoming actual customers, the final step is to turn around and invite happy customers to become evangelists for your brand. This will happen only if you create a system that invites and incentivizes people to spread the word. Various studies conducted by the American Marketing Association have shown that referrals and peer recommendations are up to 2.5 times more responsive than any other marketing channel. A marketing effort with a 250 percent increase in efficacy means we’re talking about something to take seriously.
 If you’ve done the simple, fun work of creating your StoryBrand BrandScript, your message should be clear. When you create a process that encourages referrals, you get more and more people repeating that message to their friends and family.
 Let’s take a step-by-step look at what it takes to create an effective referral system.

 Identify Your Existing, Ideal Customers
 At the top of the current Domino’s Pizza website there’s a link that says, “Don’t have a pizza profile? Create one.” That link, even though it’s in small print, is likely a huge moneymaker. Those who frequently order from the restaurant chain use this link to build their perfect pizza and then enter their credit card information to order it. Domino’s then sends them occasional prompts to reorder, especially before big events like football games or holiday weekends when they know their customers are more likely to enjoy their product.
 Now imagine taking that strategy to the next level. What if creating a special database of existing, passionate customers and communicating with them differently could help you generate referrals? Developing a simple campaign using tools your existing fans can use to spread word about your

-----

###### brand is possible. Not only could you increase your existing business but many of these happy customers will become an activated salesforce and invite others. How do you do it? Simple: Email or text your list offering a bonus if people tell their friends. For example, you might offer “one month free” or “a special discount code” that could be used when folks email the specific link you’ve offered to a friend or family member.
 The key here is to make the technology easy to use. Give them their own link. Or, if your product is a high-ticket item, you might even skin a landing page for your customer to use. The easiest way, though, is to offer a “friends and family” discount in the form of a specific coupon code they can pass along to others.

 Give Your Customers a Helpful Tool They Can Use to Spread the Word
 A few years ago, I utilized the services of a consulting firm that, as part of their system, asked me for a list of referrals. The request made me immediately uncomfortable. I felt like they wanted to use me for my friends, or worse, turn me into one of their salespeople.
 That said, the service they provided was good, and had they framed the request another way, I might have complied. Specifically, it would have been nice if they’d have created a small, educational video that would have been valuable to my friends. I’d much more quickly pass along a video than I would hand over my friends’ email addresses.
 Consider creating a PDF or video that you automatically send to new and happy clients along with an email that goes something like this:

Dear Friend,

Thanks for doing business with us. A number of our clients have wanted to tell their friends
about how we help customers, but they aren’t sure how to do so. We’ve put together a little
video that will help your friends solve X problem. If you have any friends with X problem, feel
free to send it along. We’d be happy to follow up with any of them, and we’ll be sure to let you
know whether we were able to help them, giving you all the credit!

We know you value your relationships and so do we. If your friends are experiencing a
problem we’ve helped you solve, we’d love to help them too. If there’s anything else we can
do, please let us know.

Sincerely,
Nancy

PS. X problem can be frustrating. If you’d rather introduce us to your friend in person, just let
us know. We are more than happy to meet with them in their place of business or at our office.
