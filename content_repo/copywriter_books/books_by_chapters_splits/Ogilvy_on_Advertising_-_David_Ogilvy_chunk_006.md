###### The most e�ective leader is the one who satis�es the psychological needs of his followers. For example, it is one thing to be a good leader of Americans, who are raised in a tradition of democracy and have a high need for independence. But the American brand of democratic leadership doesn’t work so well in Europe, where executives have a psychological need for more autocratic leadership. That is one of many reasons why it is wise for American agencies to appoint locals to lead their foreign subsidiaries.
 It does an agency no good when its leader never shares his leadership functions with his lieutenants. The more centers of leadership you create, the stronger your agency will become.
 There is an art in being a good follower. On the night before a major battle, the �rst Duke of Marlborough was reconnoitering the terrain. He and his sta� were on horseback. Marlborough dropped his glove. Cadogan, his chief of sta�, dismounted, picked up the glove and handed it to Marlborough. The other o�cers thought this remarkably civil of Cadogan. Later that evening, Marlborough issued his �nal order: ‘Cadogan, put a battery of guns where I dropped my glove.’
 ‘I have already done so,’ replied Cadogan. He had read Marlborough’s mind, and anticipated his order. Cadogan was the kind of follower who makes leadership easy. I have known men whom nobody could lead.
 Most of the great leaders I know have the ability to inspire people with their speeches. If you cannot write inspiring speeches yourself, use ghost-writers – but use good ones. Roosevelt used the poet Archibald MacLeish, the playwright Robert Sherwood and Judge Rosenmann. That is why he was more inspiring than any of the Presidents we have had since, with the exception of John F. Kennedy, who also used outstanding ghost-writers.
 Very few chief executives are good on their feet. Whoever writes the speeches, the CEO delivers them atrociously. Competence, however, can be learned. All major politicians hire experts to teach them the art of delivery.[3]

###### The man who said the wisest things about leadership was Field Marshal Montgomery:
 ‘The leader must have infectious optimism, and the determination to persevere in the face of di�culties. He must also radiate con�dence, even when he himself is not too certain of the outcome.
 ‘The �nal test of a leader is the feeling you have when you leave his presence after a conference. Have you a feeling of uplift and con�dence?’

 Alcoholics It is reliably reported that seven out of every hundred executives in American business are alcoholics, and it is reasonable to assume that the proportion in your agency is at least as high. By alcoholic, I mean somebody whose drinking seriously interferes with his family life and his performance in the agency. He is on the way to losing his job, wrecking his marriage and dying of cirrhosis.
 Your alcoholics may include some of your brightest stars. The problem is to identify them, protected as they always are by their secretaries and their colleagues. Invite the alcoholic’s wife to join you in a surprise confrontation with her husband. Start by telling him that all present are devoted to him. Then say how worried you are about his drinking. His wife and his children are about to leave him, and you are about to �re him – unless he does what you ask. A reservation has been made for him to enter a treatment center that very day.
 Most alcoholics agree to go. It takes a week for the center to dry them out, and another four weeks to rehabilitate them. On returning home, they must go to daily meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for at least a year.
 This procedure works in about 60 per cent of cases. I have seen it salvage some valuable people of both sexes. If you would like further advice on the subject, consult the nearest chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous.

###### Written principles Marvin Bower, who made McKinsey what it is today, believes that every company should have a written set of principles and purposes. So I drafted mine and sent them to Marvin for comment. On the �rst page I had listed seven purposes, starting with Earn an increased pro�t every year. Marvin gave me holy hell. He said that any service business which gave higher priority to pro�ts than to serving its clients deserved to fail. So I relegated pro�t to seventh place on my list.
 Do you think it childish to use a set of written principles to guide the management of an advertising agency? I can only tell you that mine have proved invaluable in keeping a complicated enterprise on course.

 Pro�t and all that I do not fancy myself as a �nancial wizard, but I have learned a thing or two from my partner Shelby Page, who has presided over the �nances of Ogilvy & Mather since the �rst day. The average pro�t in agencies is less than 1 per cent after taxes. If you chisel on service, you can make more than that, but your clients will leave you. If your service is too generous, your clients will love you, but you will go broke.
 Size and pro�t are not the same thing. In 1981, Ogilvy & Mather made more pro�t than an agency which bills twice as much.
 Agencies add new services the way universities add new courses. Nothing wrong with that if you also discontinue services which have outlived their relevance. To keep your boat moving through the water, keep scraping the barnacles o� its bottom.
 Seven of the twelve biggest agencies are public companies. Their share prices have increased 439 per cent during the last ten years, compared with 37 per cent for Standard & Poor’s 500.
 Many security analysts still believe that agencies are a poor investment. Not so Warren Bu�ett, one of the most successful investors in the world. He has taken substantial positions in three publicly held agencies, and is quoted as saying, ‘The best business is

###### a royalty on the growth of others, requiring very little capital itself…such as the top international advertising agencies.’
 If you read the advertising columns in newspapers, you get the impression that the agency business is dangerously unstable. The reason is that the newspapers only report movements of accounts from one agency to another. Yet only 4 per cent of total US advertising changes agencies during a year.
 The 25 biggest agencies in 1972 are, with only one exception, the 25 biggest today, 11 years later. Eight of the top ten are in their �fth or sixth generation of management. Only Ogilvy & Mather has its founder still on board.

 How to get paid You will have to choose between the traditional commission system and the newer system of fees.[4] The fee system has four advantages:

 1 The advertiser pays for the services he wants – no more, no less.

 2 Every fee account pays its own way. Unpro�table accounts do not ride on the coat-tails of pro�table accounts, which is the case with the commission system.

 3 Temporary cuts in clients’ budgets do not oblige you to cut sta�.

 4 When you advise a client to increase his advertising, he does not suspect your motive.

 I pioneered the fee system, but I no longer care how I get paid, provided I make a reasonable pro�t. In 1981, the average net pro�t of American agencies was 0.83 per cent of billing. Does that strike you as unreasonable?
 When a client frets about the price of his agency’s services, he ends up getting a low price and poor advertising.

###### What to do with your pro�ts First, you have to pay 52 per cent corporation tax. If you distribute what is left as dividends, your shareholders have to pay a further 40 per cent as income tax. When they spend their dividends, they have to pay sales tax. The Government has taken 73 cents out of every dollar you made as pro�t.
 Some agencies have invested their pro�ts in ventures outside their competence – an insurance company, a travel agency, a retail chain, a �sh cannery, a motion picture company, even a small oil company. Not surprisingly, they all burned their �ngers. (I resisted that temptation.)
 The current fad is to invest part of your pro�t in buying other agencies. Beware! Agencies are seldom for sale unless they are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you give their key people �ve-year contracts, because you think their clients would vamoose if they retired. But their ways are not your ways and the friction can be abominable.
 Are there more sensible ways of investing your pro�ts? I know of three:

 1 You can open branch o�ces in other cities or other countries. This has the advantage that you don’t inherit other people’s mistakes, and you preserve you own ethos, pure and unde�led. The disadvantage is that your start-up costs cannot be capitalized, so they reduce your earnings per share.

 2 You can buy the building which houses your o�ce. Young & Rubicam did this in New York two years ago.

 3 You can build a reserve against a rainy day. On Wall Street they regard this as lunacy, but when times get hard, the lunatics may survive longer than their more adventurous competitors.

 A new gimmick is to acquire agencies and leave them to their own devices, even allowing them to compete with you in new business

###### contests. One of the giant agencies has become little more than a holding company for a miscellaneous collection of independently operated subsidiaries.

 Fortunes The agency man who made the largest fortune was Albert Lasker of Lord & Thomas (now Foote, Cone & Belding), followed by Ted Bates, Jim Mathes, Ray Mithune and Cli� Fitzgerald. I estimate an average of about $20,000,000 each.
 Some people have made fortunes out of selling their agencies to Interpublic, including David Williams, Tom Adams, Al Seaman and Hagen Bayles; my guess is that they averaged about $6,000,000 each. The admirable Bill Marsteller probably made more than that when he sold his agency to Young & Rubicam, as did the senior partners in Esty when they sold to Bates, and the senior partners in Compton when they sold to Saatchi & Saatchi.
 Ed Ney, the head of Young & Rubicam, is the only present-day head of an agency who has built a large nest egg without selling out or going public. However big the egg, Ney is worth every penny.

 Five tips 1 Never allow two people to do a job which one could do. George Washington observed, ‘Whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty by close application thereto, it is worse executed by two persons, and scarcely done at all if three or more are employed therein.’

 2 Never summon people to your o�ce; it frightens them. Instead, go to see them in their o�ces, unannounced. A boss who never wanders about his agency becomes an invisible hermit.

 3 If you want to get action, communicate verbally. If you want the voting to go your way at meetings, go to the meeting. Remember the French saying: ‘He who is absent is always wrong.’

###### 4 It is bad manners to use products which compete with your clients’ products. When I got the Sears Roebuck account, I started buying all my clothes at Sears. This bugged my wife, but the following year a convention of clothing manufacturers voted me the best-dressed man in America. I would not dream of using any travelers checks except American Express, or drinking any co�ee but Maxwell House, or washing with any soap except Dove. As the number of brands advertised by Ogilvy & Mather now exceeds two thousand, my personal inventory is getting complicated.

 5 Never allow yourself the luxury of writing letters of complaint. After my �rst transatlantic voyage I wrote to my travel agency complaining that the service on the Queen Mary was slovenly and the decoration vulgar. Three months later we were on the point of getting the Cunard account when they happened to see my letter. It took them twenty years to forgive me and give us their account.

the agency has bought space on behalf of its client. Under this arrangement, the agency

�nances services to its clients out of commissions, rather than charge fees direct to the

###### have matched my record as a new business collector.
 In my Confessions, I told how I started by making a list of the clients I most wanted – General Foods, Lever Brothers, Bristol Myers, Campbell Soup Company and Shell. It took time, but in due course I got them all, plus American Express, Sears Roebuck, IBM, Morgan Guaranty, Merrill Lynch and a few others, including three governments. While some of these clients have since defected, their total billings with Ogilvy & Mather add up to more than three billion dollars – so far.

_A big account walks in. (From White Collar Zoo by Clare Barnes Jr.)_

###### My policy has always been that of J.P. Morgan – ‘only �rst-class business, and that in a �rst-class way’ – but at �rst I had to take anything I could get, to pay the rent. A patent hairbrush, a tortoise, an English motorbike.
 But I also had the good fortune to get four small accounts which gave me a chance to produce the kind of sophisticated advertising which attracts attention to an agency: Guinness, Hathaway shirts, Schweppes and Rolls-Royce.
 The easiest way to get new clients is to do good advertising. During one period of seven years, we never failed to win an account for which we competed, and all I did was to show the campaigns we had created. Sometimes, I did not even have to do that. One afternoon, a man walked into my o�ce without an appointment and gave me the IBM account; he knew our work.
 This unparalleled run of success gave me a swelled head. When Dr. Anton Rupert told me that he had it in mind to market Rothmans cigarettes in the United States and asked me to do the

 In recent years, manufacturers have complicated the process of selecting agencies beyond reason. They start by sending long questionnaires to a dozen or more agencies. Idiotic questions like: ‘How many persons are employed in your print production department?’ To which I answered, ‘I haven’t the foggiest idea. I haven’t been in the department for seven years. Why do you think it matters?’

_To get clients, do good advertising._

###### If you are more polite and give enough right answers, you get on the short list, and a delegation comes to inspect you. They want to know what commission you will charge. I answer, ‘If you are going to choose your agency on the basis of price, you are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. What you should worry about is not the price you pay for your agency’s services, but the selling power of your advertising.’
 The selectors show scant interest in the campaigns you have produced for other manufacturers. They want to know what you

###### could do for them, so they invite you to analyse their problems and make �nished commercials. They then have your commercials tested. If you get a higher score than your competitors, you win the account.
 Some agencies now spend as much as $500,000 on new business presentations. They �gure that if they win and keep the account for 20 years, they may come out ahead. Agencies which don’t have the money to make such bets are at a disadvantage.
 This long and expensive process does not necessarily result in the selection of the best agency. The agency which would create the best advertising over a period of years may not have the luck to come up with the best campaign in the few weeks allotted to the contest. In the next chapter I will suggest a better way to go about choosing an agency.
