## AND ENDS IN A SUCCESS

#### StoryBrand Principle Seven: Never assume people know how your brand can change their
 lives. Tell them.

### Years ago, a friend gave me good leadership advice. He said, “Don, always
###### remember, people want to be taken somewhere. Figure out where you want to take them and state it clearly, then repeat yourself over and over until you get them there.”
 I’ve found that advice applies to my family, my team, the books I write, and the speeches I give. And it certainly applies to my brand messaging.
 Where is your brand taking people? Are you taking them to financial security? To the day when they’ll move into their dream home? To a fun weekend with friends? Stories are about people who are going places, and, perhaps without knowing it, every potential customer we meet is asking us where our brand can take them.
 Clarifying the message of your brand, at its core, is about leadership. The job of your brand is to guide the hero out of a hole and into a better life. And casting a vision might be the most important element in any leadership campaign. Ronald Reagan envisioned America as a shining city on a hill. Bill Clinton promised to build a bridge to the twenty-first century. Casting a clear, aspirational vision has always served a presidential candidate.
 By foreshadowing a potential successful ending to a story, or, as Stew Friedman at the Wharton School puts it, defining a “compelling image of an achievable future,”[1] leaders captivate the imaginations of their audiences.
 Successful brands, like successful leaders, make it clear what life will look like if somebody engages their products or services. Nike promised to

###### bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete. Likewise, Starbucks offered to inspire and nurture their customers, one cup at a time. For years, Men’s Wearhouse promised, “You’re gonna like the way you look,” and they even guaranteed it.
 Without a vision, the people perish. And so do brands. In the final and most important element of the StoryBrand framework, we’re going to offer our customers what they want most: a happy ending to their story.

##### THE VISION SHOULD BE SPECIFIC AND CLEAR

###### One of the problems we run into with StoryBrand clients is the vision they paint for their customer’s future is too fuzzy. Nobody gets excited about a muddled vision. Stories aren’t vague, they’re defined; they’re about specific things happening to specific people. Otherwise they’re not stories; they’re just the telling of random events.
 Harrison Ford had to defeat the terrorists in Air Force One to return to a peaceful White House. Erin Brockovich had to win the final verdict against Pacific Gas and Electric so the citizens of Hinkley, California, could be rightly compensated for their pain. In a good story, the resolution must be clearly defined so the audience knows exactly what to hope for.
 Being specific matters. President Kennedy would have bored the world had he cast a vision for a “highly competitive and productive space program.” Instead, he defined the ambition specifically and visually and as such inspired a nation: “We’re going to put a man on the moon.”

##### BEFORE AND AFTER

###### My friend Ryan Deiss at DigitalMarketer created a great tool to help us imagine the success our customers will experience if they use our products and services.
 In a simple grid, Ryan allows us to see how our customers’ lives will look after they engage us, how they will feel, what their average day will

###### look like, and what kind of new status they will enjoy.
 Filling out this grid for your brand will clarify the vision you have for your customers. Once you know how your customers’ lives will change after they engage your brand, you will have plenty of effective copy to use in your marketing collateral.

What is their status?

###### The next step is to say it clearly. We must tell our customers what their lives will look like after they buy our products, or they will have no motivation to do so. We have to talk about the end vision we have for their lives in our keynotes, in our email blasts, on our websites, and everywhere else.
 Images are also important when it comes to casting a vision for our customers. If you’re selling kitchen flooring, your website might show a happy mom picking up her child from the beautiful and sparkling kitchen floor. If you’re selling education, show us students in the classroom having a great time learning in the environment you provide. Regardless of what you sell, if possible, show us people happily engaging with your product.

##### HOW THE STORY ENDS MATTERS

###### Ultimately, the success module of your StoryBrand BrandScript should solve all three levels of your customers’ problems: external, internal, and philosophical. As you contemplate the vision you will cast for the story you’re inviting customers into, consider what their life will look like when they solve the physical problem, then think about how that resolution will make them feel, then consider why the resolution to their problem has made the world a more just place for them. When we resolve our customers’ external, internal, and philosophical problems, we’ve truly envisioned an appealing resolution to their story and have increased the chances they will step into that story.
 To make a story satisfying to an audience, storytellers often work hard to resolve all three levels of the hero’s conflict in what’s called an obligatory (or climactic) scene. If written well, the scene happens just before the end of the movie, usually about nine minutes before the credit rolls. It’s referred to as the obligatory scene because the storyteller is “obligated” to make it happen. If, for instance, a man meets a woman and falls in love in act 1, the storyteller is obligated to bring them together at the end (that is, if the storyteller is trying to make us feel good). The key to a stellar ending, though, is to successfully open the external, internal, and philosophical story loops early in the story and then close them all through a single event at the end.
 Here’s an example: At the end of George Lucas’s film Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke Skywalker resolves the external conflict (he must destroy the Death Star by shooting a proton torpedo through the exhaust valve of the Death Star), his internal conflict (the persistent doubt that he has what it takes to be a Jedi), and the philosophical conflict (good versus evil as depicted by himself being pursued by the violent Darth Vader) in a single shot. When Luke lands the shot (spoiler alert), all three levels of conflict are resolved at once, giving the audience three levels of satisfaction and causing me, at the age of nine, to stand on my seat and throw popcorn into the air, much to my mother and sister’s embarrassment.
 Consider the end of David Seidler and Tom Hooper’s Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. The end of that movie utilizes the same narrative device as Lucas’s Star Wars, and to the same stellar result. If King George VI is going to inspire the British people to stay in the fight and win the war

-----

###### against Hitler, the king must deliver a speech without a stutter (external problem), a task that has forced him to face his own struggling self- confidence (internal conflict). The stakes are high. Should he fail, Hitler’s Nazis will conquer all of Europe on their way to world domination (good versus evil). Much to the audience’s pleasure, of course, he delivers the speech perfectly and thus resolves all three levels of conflict in a single event of narrative harmony. Cue the Oscar music.
 The strategy for your brand, then, is to spend your marketing copy opening external, internal, and philosophical story loops and then offer to resolve them through the use of your product. For example, here’s a bit of sample copy for a fictional toothpaste company:

 You want a bright smile but are concerned about the harmful effects of fluoride in most toothpastes. You know you shouldn’t have to compromise your health just to brush your teeth, so you’ve been looking for a better alternative. When you brush your teeth with Gel Fresh, though, you get clean teeth without the harmful effects and will feel better about how you’re taking care of your teeth and yourself. You shouldn’t have to compromise your health just to have a great smile.

 Let’s break down this climactic scene as it relates to brand messaging:

 External: I need to clean my teeth. Internal: I feel bad about what fluoride might be doing to my health. Philosophical: I shouldn’t have to use a toothpaste that is bad for my
 body.

 If we have successfully opened up the three levels of story loops in our messaging, then writing an ending to our customers’ story is simple: when you brush your teeth with Gel Fresh, you get clean teeth without the harmful effects (external) and will feel better about how you’re taking care of your teeth (internal) because you shouldn’t have to compromise your overall health just to have a great smile (philosophical).

##### HERE ARE MORE WAYS TO STICK THE LANDING

###### If you want to take the idea of sticking the landing a little further, it’s worth exploring how stories are resolved by narrative experts. After a good storyteller closes the three open story loops in a single scene, the hero steps into a new reality framed by an external or internal resolution (or both) that represents a new world.
 The three dominant ways storytellers paint this new world are by providing the hero with

 1. greater power or position, 2. unity with somebody or something that represents their
 wholeness, and 3. an experience of self-realization that also makes them whole.

 What’s important for us as we clarify our brand message is this: the fact that these are the three most-employed resolutions in popular stories implies these are three dominant psychological desires shared by most human beings.
 If our brand can promise a resolution that associates with one of these driving desires, our BrandScript will be even more enticing.
 This is important, so let’s explore these three primal desires more closely:

 1. Winning Power and Position (The Need for Status)
 When I was in high school, a film came out called Can’t Buy Me Love in which a likable loser named Ronald Miller falls in love with a popular cheerleader named Cindy Mancini. Unfortunately for me, in the script, Ronald’s character was so overlooked in his school that most of the other characters in the movie accidentally called him Donald. You can imagine the teasing I received.
 But we loved the movie all the same. Why? Because in the end, of course, Ronald gets the girl. But he gets more than the girl. He gains status. After winning Cindy’s heart, he becomes one of the popular kids, or, more accurately, he realizes trying to be somebody else is a waste of time, which, of course, makes him more popular.

###### Regardless, it’s a universal human desire to want status, which is evidenced by the number of “coming of age” stories in which a character realizes they’ve got what it takes to run with the big dogs. Even those who convince themselves they do not want status often want the status that comes with not wanting status.
 As I mentioned earlier in the book, the primary function of our brain is to help us survive and thrive, and status, by some, can be perceived as gaining more security in a tribe or society. If our brand, then, can help our customers become more esteemed, respected, and appealing in a social context, we are likely offering something they want.
 So how can our brand offer status? Here are four ideas:

 Offer access: My wife loves using her Starbucks membership card
 because it gains her points, which gains her status and the occasional free latte. We’ve had many conversations about the intangibility of said status, but I’ve learned not to argue. She’s excited to be on her way to some kind of double-pump jazzy diamond level, which I’m pretty sure means she can cut in front of people at the drive-through. Create scarcity: Offering a limited number of a specific item creates
 scarcity, and owning something that is scarce is often seen as a status symbol. When Jeep puts a badge that reads “limited” on the back of their Grand Cherokee, they’re promoting the scarcity of that particular packaging of the luxury SUV, thus making it more desirable. Offer a premium: Most companies earn 70 percent or more of their
 revenue from a small percentage of their clients. Few, though, identify those clients and offer them a title such as “Preferred” or “Diamond Member.” I love being an “Emerald Club” member with National Car Rental because it means I get to bypass the counter, jump in a car, and drive off. We even recommend a status-associated title for the nonprofit brands we work with. People will be much more likely to donate if they know they are an “Anchor Donor” and even more likely if they get special privileges like updates from the founder or access to other donors at special, elite-level fundraisers. Offer identity association: Premium brands like Mercedes and Rolex
 sell status as much as they do luxury. Is it worth it? Depends on who

###### you ask. Status really does open doors, and by associating their brand (and thus their customers) with success and refinement, they offer the sort of status that may make others esteem or even envy them.

 2. Union That Makes the Hero Whole (The Need for Something External to Create Completeness)
 Another way to offer a satisfying resolution is for your brand to offer some kind of perceived completeness. The reason stories often end with the union of lovers has little to do with the desire for love or sex. Rather, union between male and female characteristics in a story symbolizes the achievement of completeness.
 When the prince rescues the princess and the two characters unite at the end of the story, the audience witnesses what they subconsciously consider the joining of two halves. The subconscious idea is that the man needs to be tamed and the woman needs provision and protection in order for the two to become “whole,” and in this context, “whole” really means safe and/or useful in the context of a family-building unit, which is tied to survival in the sense that it’s the safest way to contribute to the continuation of our species. Traditional though it may seem, the formula works for most moviegoing audiences. This same popular formula is used in a million or more love songs and, in its opposite form, the million or more empathetic rants belted out by those who aren’t getting any.
 This need to be completed by an external source doesn’t have to include a wedding or even a male or female character, however. Many buddy comedies use the same formula. Arnold Schwarzenegger comically portrays a more feminine, refined personality compared to his rough-and-tumble brother played by Danny DeVito in the hit comedy Twins. The principle, however, is the same: two likable but different characters come together to form a complete unit in order to accomplish a specific survival objective.
 The controlling idea of this kind of ending is that the character is made complete (or equipped to defeat a foe) by somebody or something outside themselves. In love stories, of course, it’s all about the union of male and female characteristics, but the emotional need this kind of story delivers is much greater. These stories are about being made whole by external provision.
