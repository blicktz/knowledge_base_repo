‘It it not uncommon for a change in headlines to multiply returns from �ve to ten times over.’

 ‘Brief ads are never keyed. Every traced ad tells a complete story.’

 Nowadays Hopkins is remembered, if at all, as an uncompromising advocate of ‘hard sell’. Yet he perceived the importance of brand images – a generation before that term came into use. ‘Try to give each advertiser a becoming style. To create the right individuality is a supreme accomplishment.’
 Raymond Rubicam abhorred Hopkins, believing that he had devoted his life to cheating the public. He once told me, ‘You are Claude Hopkins with a college education.’ A backhanded compliment if ever I heard one.
 Five years before he died Hopkins wrote, ‘My chief work in advertising has been meeting emergencies. Nobody ever called me in when the skies were bright and the seas were calm. Nearly every client quit me when he got into smooth waters.’ Sick of rescuing clients from the jaws of bankruptcy and making them richer than himself, he resigned from Lord & Thomas and went into business for himself Too late.
 Hopkins was interested in nothing but advertising. There is macabre pathos in the last sentence of his autobiography: ‘The happiest are those who live closest to nature, an essential to advertising success.’

 BILL BERNBACH 1911-1982

 Bill Bernbach and I started our agencies in the same year, and we both made our reputations as copywriters.
 He was born 19 years after the youngest of my �ve other giants. After graduating from New York University with a degree in English Literature, he got a job in the mailroom of Schenley and became the

-----

###### protégé of Grover Whalen, who was the chairman. When Whalen left to run the New York’s World Fair, he took Bill with him as his speech writer. After the Fair ended, Bill joined the Weintraub agency, where he worked with Paul Rand, a distinguished art director who was a fugitive from the Bauhaus.
 During World War II, he spent two years in the Army, and then went to the Grey agency, where he quickly became creative head. Four years later, with Ned Doyle and Max Dane, he started his own agency, with an investment of $1,200. While his name appeared last on the letterhead, there was never any doubt whose agency it was. Today, Doyle Dane Bernbach is the tenth biggest in the world, with billings of more than a billion dollars.
 Bill always created an atmosphere in which talented people blossomed. A woman who wrote deadly dull copy for me wrote brilliant copy for Bill. He was an irresistible salesman of his agency’s work, and terrifyingly obstinate. When I was chairman of the United Negro College Fund, he volunteered to make a television commercial for purposes of fund-raising. I dared to warn him that his storyboard, while a work of art, was not calculated to produce cash contributions. Bill replied, ‘David, you don’t have to worry. There are plenty of other agencies that would be happy to do the job for you.’ Bill’s commercial ran as presented.
 I am told that he used to carry a card which bore the self- admonition Maybe he’s right. I once actually heard him admit that a client was right. This precedent-shattering event happened at lunch in the White House, when one of President Johnson’s assistants criticized an anti-Goldwater commercial that Bill had put on the air the previous night.

###### He had a genius for integrating copy with illustration, and never made my mistake of subordinating copywriters to art directors.
 He held, as I do, that the quality of the idea and the excellence of its execution was the alpha and omega of successful advertising.
 He worshipped at the altar of originality, and was never tired of denouncing research as the enemy of creativity. This may have irritated some of his clients, but it made him the hero of the creative fraternity.
 Of all his wonderful campaigns, those I most admire are Volkswagen and Avis. He was less successful with package-goods clients who tried to impose orthodox disciplines. I have often

-----

###### wondered if his output would have been less elegant if, like me, he had started as a door-to-door salesman.
 He spoke in a quiet voice and looked modest. But he wasn’t. The last time I saw him, he and Rosser Reeves were my guests at lunch. Bill lectured Rosser and me as if we were trainees in his agency. When some of his stodgier competitors started raiding his agency in search of swingers, Bill told me, ‘They don’t realize that these people will be helpless without my guiding hand.’ And guide them he did, always insisting that their advertising, however clever and original, should make the product the hero.
 He was a philosopher. He lived without ostentation, and organized his time with a self-discipline that is rare among heads of agencies. He once told me that he never stayed in the o�ce after �ve, never took work home, and never worked at weekends. ‘You see, David, I love my family.’
 Shortly before he died, Bill was asked what changes he expected in advertising in the eighties. He replied, ‘Human nature hasn’t changed for a billion years. It won’t even vary in the next billion years. Only the super�cial things have changed. It is fashionable to talk about changing man. A communicator must be concerned with unchanging man – what compulsions drive him, what instincts dominate his every action, even though his language too often camou�ages what really motivates him. For if you know these things about a man, you can touch him at the core of his being. One thing is unchangingly sure. The creative man with an insight into human nature, with the artistry to touch and move people, will succeed. Without them he will fail.’
 A gentleman with brains.

 If I had to choose �ve more giants to complete my All-Time All- American team, they would be three copywriters – James Webb Young of J. Walter Thompson, George Cecil of N. W. Ayer, and Jack Rosebrook of Young & Rubicam; one art director – Vaughn Flannery

 And who would I choose from the living stars? Their names are locked in my safe.

 What’s wrong with advertising?

##### Toynbee and Galbraith vs. Roosevelt and Churchill

###### n my Confessions I quoted the classic denunciations of advertising by Arnold Toynbee, John Kenneth Galbraith and a galaxy of earlier

###### economists, and wheeled up Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill as witnesses for the defense.
 Twenty years later the dons are still tilting at their old windmill. Thus a professor at the New School of Social Research in New York teaches his students that ‘advertising is a profoundly subversive force in American life. It is intellectual and moral pollution. It trivializes, manipulates, is insincere and vulgarizes. It is undermining our faith in our nation and in ourselves.’
 Holy smoke, is that what I do for a living? Some of the defenders of advertising are equally guilty of overstating their case. Said Leo Burnett, the great Chicago advertising man: ‘Advertising is not the noblest creation of man’s mind, as so many of its advocates would like the public to think. It does not, single-handedly, sustain the whole structure of capitalism and democracy and the Free World. It is just as nonsensical to suggest that we are superhuman as to accept the indictment that we are subhuman. We are merely human, trying to do a necessary human job with dignity, with decency and with competence.’
 My view is that advertising is no more and no less than a reasonably e�cient way to sell. Procter & Gamble spends more than $600,000,000 a year on advertising. Howard Morgens, their former

-----

###### president, is quoted as saying, ‘We believe that advertising is the most e�ective and e�cient way to sell to the consumer. If we should ever �nd better methods of selling our type of products to the consumer, we’ll leave advertising and turn to these other methods.’
 Few of us admen lie awake nights feeling guilty about the way we earn our living. In Churchill’s phrase, we just K.B.O.[1] We don’t feel ‘subversive’ when we write advertisements for toothpaste. If we do it well, children may not have to go to the dentist so often.

###### I did not feel ‘evil’ when I wrote advertisements for Puerto Rico. They helped attract industry and tourists to a country which had been living on the edge of starvation for 400 years.
 I do not think that I am ‘trivializing’ when I write advertisements for the World Wildlife Fund.
 My children were grateful when I wrote an advertisement which recovered their dog Teddy from dognappers.

###### Nobody suggests that the printing press is evil because it is used to print pornography. It is also used to print the Bible. Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things. Nobody I know in advertising would advertise a brothel, and some refuse to advertise booze or cigarettes.
 Left-wing economists, ever eager to snatch the scourge from the hand of God, hold that advertising tempts people to squander money on things they don’t need. Who are these élitists to decide what you need? Do you need a dishwasher? Do you need a deodorant? Do you need a trip to Rome? I feel no qualms of conscience about persuading you that you do. What the Calvinistic dons don’t seem to know is that buying things can be one of life’s more innocent pleasures, whether you need them or not. Remember your euphoria when you bought your �rst car? Most people enjoy window-shopping the ads, whether for bargains or for luxuries. For 40 years I shopped the ads for country houses, and �nally saved up enough money to buy one.
 It is not unknown for an advertisement in a newspaper to be read by more people than any news item. When all the New York newspapers went on strike for several weeks in 1963, research showed that it was the advertisements which readers missed most.
 If advertising were abolished, what would be done with the money? Would it be spent on public works? Or distributed to stock- holders in the form of extra dividends? Or given to the media to compensate them for the loss of their largest source of revenue? Perhaps it could be used to reduce prices to the consumer – by about 3 per cent.[2]

###### Is advertising a pack of lies? Introducing me at an Asian Advertising Congress in New Delhi the other day, the Vice-President and former Chief Justice of India said that I had ‘mastered what Stephen Leacock called the art of arresting the human intelligence long enough to get money from it.’
 If there are still any natural-born liars in advertising, we are under control. Every advertisement we write is scrutinized by lawyers, by the National Association of Broadcasters and other such bodies. The Better Business Bureau and the National Advertising Review Board (in Britain, the Advertising Standards Authority)

###### review suspected violations of the various codes, and the Federal Trade Commission stands ready to prosecute us for deception. Caveat emptor has given way to caveat vendor.
 But how odd that the Commission does not monitor the advertising put out by departments of the US Government. Writes Milton Friedman, ‘Anyone who has bought government bonds over the past decade has been taken to the cleaners. The amount he received on maturity would buy less in goods and services than the amount he paid for the bond, and he has to pay taxes on the mislabeled “interest”. Yet the Treasury continues to advertise the bonds as “building personal security,” and a “gift that keeps on growing”.’[3]

 ‘The dirge of our times’ While very little advertising can be convicted of crimes against humanity, exposure to 30,000 TV commercials every year – the average dosage in American homes – suggests that Wilfrid Sheed had a point when he wrote that ‘the sound of selling is the dirge of our times’. When I lived in New York, I did not notice it, either because I was too busy to watch for more than half an hour a day (Walter Cronkite), or because I was corrupted by familiarity. But when I went to live in Europe, I grew accustomed to smaller doses of advertising. Today, when I return to the United States, I am enraged by the barrage to which I am subjected. And this does not apply only to television. On Sundays, the New York Times often carries 350 pages of advertisements, and some of the radio stations devote 40 minutes in every hour to commercials. I don’t know how all this clutter can ever be brought under control; the pro�t motive is too strong in those who own the media.
 In the average American home, the TV is turned on, if not watched, for �ve hours a day, which adds up to 25 years in the average life. But don’t blame the commercials for this addiction.

###### Manipulation? You may have heard it said that advertising is ‘manipulation’. I know of only two examples, and neither of them actually happened. In 1957 a market researcher called James Vicary hypothesized that it might be possible to �ash commands on television screens so fast that the viewer would not be conscious of seeing them, but his unconscious would see them – and obey them. He called this gimmick ‘subliminal’ advertising, but he never even got around to testing it, and no advertiser has ever used it. Unfortunately word of his hypothesis found its way into the public prints, and provided grist for the mills of the anti-advertising brigade. The British Institute of Practitioners in Advertising solemnly banned the use of subliminal advertising – which did not exist.
 My only other example of manipulation will make you shudder. I myself once came near to doing something so diabolical that I hesitate to confess it even now, 30 years later. Suspecting that hypnotism might be an element in successful advertising, I engaged a professional hypnotist to make a commercial. When I saw it in the

-----

###### projection room, it was so powerful that I had visions of millions of suggestible consumers getting up from their armchairs and rushing like zombies through the tra�c on their way to buy the product at the nearest store. Had I invented the ultimate advertisement? I burned it, and never told my client how close I had come to landing him in a national scandal.
 One way and another, the odds against your being manipulated by advertising are now very long indeed. Even if I wanted to manipulate you, I wouldn’t know how to circumvent the legal regulations.
 Hold your horses – I almost forgot. There is one category of advertising which is totally uncontrolled and �agrantly dishonest: the television commercials for candidates in Presidential elections.

 Political chicanery While statesmen in England, France and Persia have sometimes consulted me, I have never taken political parties as clients of Ogilvy & Mather. First, because they would preoccupy the best brains of the agency, to the detriment of its permanent clients. Second, because they are bad credit risks. Third, because it would be unfair to those people in the agency who pray for the victory of the opposing party. And �nally, because it would be di�cult to avoid the chicanery which is endemic in all political campaigns.
 The �rst politician to use television was Governor Dewey in his 1950 campaign for the governorship of New York. On one program, Happy Felton, the entertainer, interviewed passers-by under the marquee of the Astor Hotel on 7th Avenue. They would say what interested them in the campaign, and ask questions of the Governor. Dewey watched them on a monitor in the studio, and answered their questions. The day before, his sta� had carefully selected the passers-by. They had told them what they were interested in, and rehearsed their questions. On the last day of the campaign, Dewey was on television from 6 am to midnight. People could telephone the studio. Four women on camera answered the calls and passed

_Governor Dewey, a scienti�c demagogue._

###### Dewey, the ex-District Attorney, the battler against corruption, the Governor of the State, thought of himself as an honorable man. It never occurred to him that he was involved in deception. I doubt that it would occur to anyone, honorable or dishonorable, to pull such a play today, thirty years later. Times change.
