##### Notice the use of the editorial “we” in the ad copy. It would have been more personal had I used the word “I” instead. Also see if there is one place in the ad that might offend a woman currently employed in a primarily male job category.
 Headline: Gold Space Chains Subheadline: Dress her in style for that next trip through outer space with America’s first space-age gold chains. Copy: Our good friend, Bob Ross, is one of America’s top wholesale jewelry representatives. A few months ago, Bob approached us with a suggestion, “Why not offer gold chains to your customers?” We rejected the idea, for our catalog must only contain products that relate to space-age technology. And besides, it was too late; we had just passed our deadline. But Bob persisted, “Most of your readers are men. Why not give them something they could buy for their wives or loved ones? After all, you offer them all sorts of neat things to buy for themselves, but other than a good watch, there’s nothing for the lady.”

# SUGGESTION REJECTED

##### We could not accept Bob’s argument. Although we have a 90% male readership, and although we felt that our customers might indeed want to buy jewelry from our catalog, we felt that our strict adherence to the principles of space-age product selection precluded our making any variation in our philosophy. Then Bob tried to appeal to our sense of profit. “Your customers are wealthy and smart. Offer them gold chains at very low prices. You’ll sell a ton because they have the money to spend, and they have the brains to recognize good value.” Again we had to disappoint Bob. True, our customers earn an average of $50,000 a year, higher than practically any other buying group in the country. And true, our customers include some of the nation’s leading businessmen, politicians, newscasters, doctors, and even movie stars. But we could not justify the violation of our principles and take advantage of an opportunity just because our customers are above average. “Sorry Bob,” we said. “JS&A has an important reputation to maintain.”

# HE DOESN’T GIVE UP

##### Bob is quite a successful salesman. He never gives up until he has exhausted all arguments. A good salesman is persistent, and Bob certainly persisted. He just wouldn’t give up. “Why don’t you call the gold chains ‘Space Chains’—space-age jewelry for the lady you want to take on that trip through outer space? After all, giving it a space-age theme really makes it tie nicely into your catalog, and besides, gold is a valuable metal found on many of the planets in outer space.” “That would be deceiving,” we told Bob. To think that we could use a flimsy theme like that to tie such an unrelated product to space-age technology was almost an insult. It was at this point that we thought seriously of asking Bob to leave. “Bob, you’re a nice guy and we’ve known you for years, but you’ll have to leave now.”

####

# ENTER BOB’S COUSIN

##### But Bob pleaded, “Let me show you one thing before I leave. My cousin Joy is very pretty, and I’m sure she would be happy to model the jewelry for you in your advertisement.” Bob then took a photograph from his wallet and showed it to us. At this point, Bob had worn out his welcome. We were surprised to discover that he would stoop so low as to use one of his relatives as a means of getting his products displayed in our catalog. But then we gave the whole matter some very serious thought. “Actually Bob, space-age jewelry isn’t a bad idea for our catalog. After all, the only items we have for women are watches. Gold Space Chains might go very well. Of course we would keep our prices low to provide some real bargains, and I’m sure our customers would appreciate the convenience of being able to buy such a valuable gift. Bob, can she be at our photographer Tuesday so we can make our extended deadline?” “Sure,” said Bob. “But what about the selection?” “Who cares about the selection? Why don’t you just pick the most popular styles in various price ranges, and we’ll have those photographed too.” Bob left quickly. He selected the chains and his cousin is shown above. We did keep our prices considerably less than any jewelry store or catalog discount showroom. In fact, if you have a chance, you might compare. Or compare them after you receive the chains. 14 carat gold makes a nice gift for any lady and with our space-age theme, what a combination! Bob’s a funny guy. He probably thinks he’s quite a salesman. Actually, if it weren’t for our open-mindedness, our keen ability to recognize outstanding new space-age-oriented products, and our compelling desire to satisfy the needs of our customers, Bob wouldn’t have a chance.
 [Prices were then listed for different styles on the order form.]

##### In the above ad, I mentioned that our customers earn, on average, $50,000 a year. In 1978 when this ad was written, a $50,000 salary was very high.
 Did you find the offending passages? What could I have said that would have made it less offensive without changing the basic premise of the ad? And what was the premise of the ad? Let me answer this last question.
 The premise of the ad was to introduce a product that had nothing to do with our product line and could not be justified as an offering in our catalog —unless we created a very strong reason for including it. The strong reason was Bob’s beautiful cousin, Joy, who agreed to model the jewelry for us. After all, we were human and Joy was a beautiful girl.
 As I mentioned, the ad did quite well but it was primarily because of the dramatic increase in the price of gold right after our catalog was published.

 Consumers Hero

##### This ad was one of the best examples of the slippery slide theory. If you just read the headline, subheadline and the bold “Impossible-to-trace Guarantee,” you would be compelled to read the first sentence.
 Once you started to read, you wouldn’t be able to stop until you reached the end of the copy. It was a highly effective piece of advertising copy that I wrote in 1976.
 This was one of my favorite ads in that it was not the typical JS&A ad. In the JS&A ads I was the expert in space-age products. In the Consumers Hero ad I was a consumer advocate speaking the language of the consumer. It showed that I could write copy for two totally diverse businesses. Each ad had its own set of expressions and method of delivery. It was also a good example of relating in a human way without being humorous. It remains one of my personal favorites.

 Once you started reading this ad, you couldn’t put it down.

-----

##### Headline: HOT Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen merchandise if you’re willing to take a risk. Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing concept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing! Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being robbed. Inflation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered, robbed and stepped on. So the poor consumer tries to strike back. First, he forms consumer groups. He lobbies in Washington. He fights price increases. He looks for value. So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was to steal from the rich companies and give to the poor consumer, save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, make a buck.

####

# A MODERN DAY ROBIN HOOD

##### To explain our concept, let’s take a typical clock radio retailing for $39.95 at a major retailer whose name we better not mention or we’ll be sued. It costs the manufacturer $9.72 to make. The manufacturer sells the unit to the retailer for $16.

####

-----

# THE UNCLE HENRY PROBLEM

##### Let’s say that retailer sells the clock radio to your Uncle Henry. Uncle Henry brings it home, turns it on and it doesn’t work. So Uncle Henry trudges back to the store to exchange his “lousy rotten” clock radio for a new one that works (“lousy” and “rotten” are Uncle Henry’s words). Now, the defective one goes right back to the manufacturer along with all the other clock radios that didn’t work. And if this major retail chain sells 40,000 clock radios with a 5% defective rate, that’s 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock radios.

####

-----

# CONSUMERS PROTECTED
 ALREADY

##### Consumers are protected against ever seeing these products again because even if the manufacturer repairs them, he can’t recycle them as new units. He’s got to put a label on the product clearly stating that it is repaired, not new and if Uncle Henry had his way the label would also say that the product was “lousy” and “rotten.” It’s hard enough selling a new clock radio, let alone one that is used. So the manufacturer looks for somebody willing to buy his bad product for a super fantastic price. Like $10. But who wants a clock radio that doesn’t work at any price!

####

-----

# ENTER CONSUMERS HERO

##### We approach the manufacturer and offer to steal that $39.95 radio for $3 per unit. Now think of it. The manufacturer has already spent $9.72 to make it, would have to spend another $5 in labor to fix and repackage it, and still would have to mark the unit as having been previously used. So he would be better off selling it to us for $3, taking a small loss and getting rid of his defective merchandise. Consumers Hero is now sitting with 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock radios in its warehouse. Here comes the good part. We take that clock radio, test it, check it and repair it. Then we life test it, clean it up, replace anything that makes the unit look used, put a new label on it and presto—a $39.95 clock radio and it only costs us $3 plus maybe $7 to repair it.

 Impossible-to-trace Guarantee

**We guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand new merchandise without**
**any trace of previous brand identification or ownership.**

##### We take more care in bringing that clock radio to life than the original manufacturer took to make it. We put it through more tests, more fine tuning than any repair service could afford. We get more out of that $10 heap of parts and labor than even the most quality-conscious manufacturer. And we did our bit for ecology by not wasting good raw materials.

####

-----

# NOW THE BEST PART

##### We offer that product to the consumer for $20—the same product that costs us $3 to steal and $7 to make work. And we make $10 clear profit. But the poor consumer is glad we made our profit because:
 1) We provide a better product than the original version. 2) The better product costs one half the retail price. 3) We are nice people.

####

-----

# BUT THERE’S MORE

##### Because we are so proud of the merchandise we refurbish, we offer a longer warranty. Instead of 90 days (the original warranty), we offer a five-year warranty. So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into super new products with five-year warranties. We steal from the rich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hard and make a glorious profit. To make our concept work, we’ve organized a private membership of quality and price-conscious consumers and we send bulletins to this membership about the products available in our program. Items range from microwave ovens to TV sets to clock radios, digital watches, and stereo sets. There are home appliances from toasters to electric can openers. Discounts generally range between 40 and 70 percent off the retail price. Each product has a considerably longer warranty than the original one and a two week money-back trial period. If you are not absolutely satisfied, for any reason, return your purchase within two weeks after receipt for a prompt refund. Many items are in great abundance but when we only have a few of something, we select, at random, a very small number of members for the mailing. A good example was our $39.95 TV set (we had 62 of them) or a $1 AM radio (we had 1,257). In short, we try to make it fair for everybody without disappointing a member and returning a check.

Since the time I wrote the Consumers Hero ad I have written many different ads for many different companies. The point I wish to make is simply this: A good copywriter can write to fit any market. His or her ads can sound very upscale for one client and then very downscale for the next. Simply by understanding and applying the principles, one can rise to any copywriting challenge—through understanding the jargon of the customer and using the appropriate words that will resonate with that customer.

# Chapter 35

 Nautilus Spelling Sale

##### Imagine writing an ad with dozens of misspelled words and bad grammar and running it in the Wall Street Journal. That’s exactly what I did in what was one of my most unusual advertising approaches.
 I was presented with a closeout product. The Nautilus Lower Back machine had stopped selling at retail. As a result, the manufacturer, loaded with inventory, decided to liquidate the entire load to one of the barter companies in New York.
 There was only one proviso in the closeout sale. The manufacturer did not want the product offered at a discount because it would embarrass his retailers who sold customers this product at its full retail price. “If it had to be advertised, it had to be at the full retail price,” was the directive from the barter company representative who called me on the phone.

 There were 25 misspelled words in this ad and some pretty bad grammar.

-----

##### The product was going to cost me only around $100. And I could easily sell it for $250 and make a nice profit. But I was being forced to offer it for $485. If it died at retail, chances were slim to none that I could sell any at $485.
 So I created a novel strategy. I would offer the product at $500, even more than the full retail price. I would then allow readers of the ad to circle any misspelled words and I would give them $10 off the retail price for each misspelled word they found. I could then misspell 25 words and sell the machine for $250 without creating a problem with my vendor. Nobody except the buyer would know the actual price each machine sold for, as it depended on the spelling skills of my readers.
 So in June of 1985, I ran the following ad. I had fun writing it—purposely misspelling words as well as using bad grammar. Read the ad and see how you would have done in the Nautilus Spelling Sale.
 Headline: Nautilus Spelling Sale Subheadline: Every mispelled word you find in this advertisement is worth $10 towards the purchase of this popular exercise product. Bold Copy:

**Americans have two weaknesses. The first is spelling and the second is in our lower**
**backs. JS&A intends to do something about both problems.**

##### Byline: By Joseph Sugarman, President Copy: This advertisment has several mispelled words. Some of them are intentionally mispelled and others are because my spelling is pretty lousy. (My grammar’s bad too.) For every mispelled word you find in this advertisment, I’ll reduce the price of the product shown here by $10. If you find 10 words mispelled, you get $100 off the price. If you find 25 words mispelled, you get $250 off the price. And if you find 50 words mispelled, you get the product for absolutely nothing. Why such generosity?
