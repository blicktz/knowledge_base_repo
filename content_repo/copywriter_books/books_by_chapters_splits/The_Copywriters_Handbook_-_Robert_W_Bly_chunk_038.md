The best way to work with your copywriter is to leave him alone during the first-draft stage of the project. He knows what he’s doing, and you trust him. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have hired him in the first place.
 But, even when the copywriter is working at a distance, it’s important that the two of you start off with a comfortable, mutually agreeable working relationship. Copywriting is a partnership: you provide the information and direction, the copywriter provides the persuasive writing, and together you sell more of a product or service.
 If one or both partners aren’t happy, someone won’t be doing his job with enthusiasm. And a job done without enthusiasm is a job done poorly.
 Here are some suggestions for maintaining a good working relationship between client and copywriter:

 1. Pay fairly

 Pay fair rates for copywriting services performed. Remember, an underpaid worker is an unhappy and unproductive worker. Writers writing for extremely low wages rarely produce exciting prose.
 Everything in life is negotiable, but only so far. A good writer with a steady business may take 10 or 20 percent off the price if your assignment

### interests her. But she can’t afford to—and probably won’t—go much below that.
 A writer who needs the work may come very cheaply. But even if you sense you can get it for less, pay a fair wage. If you force the writer down to the bargain-basement price, she’s not going to feel very good about your project. And you want your writer to be enthusiastic, not apathetic.

 2. Pay on time

 There are few things as unpleasant in business life as trying to collect an unpaid invoice. Unfortunately, it’s not unusual for clients to be four, six, even eight weeks or more behind in their payments to their freelancers.
 Pay on time—in thirty days—and the freelancer will get a warm glow inside whenever you call. Better still, get a check out in ten days or less, and the freelancer will try to perform miracles for you on your next ad or campaign.

 3. Cooperate

 Provide complete background information on the product, your audience, and your objectives. Be available to answer questions or give direction. Review outlines and rough drafts in a timely fashion.
 One person from the client organization should be the contact between the company and the copywriter. It is inefficient for the copywriter to have to track down executives from half a dozen different departments of your firm, and this can result in conflicting instructions.

 4. Don’t waste time

 Avoid unnecessary meetings. Maybe a meeting or two will be needed, but most of the writing and revision can be handled by e-mail and phone.
 Don’t feed information or revisions to the writer one piece at a time. Give him the background information or the instructions for the rewrite in one shot.
 It is good manners not to keep people waiting when they have an appointment with you. This applies to copywriters, too.

-----

### To the copywriter, time is money. If you do not waste their time, your account will be profitable to them, and they will gladly devote themselves to giving you the best copy possible.
 On the other hand, the more you waste the writer’s time, the less profitable the project becomes. The writer might either devote less time to writing your copy or drop your account.
 In general, writing copy should not require a great deal of contact between client and copywriter. The fewer number of contacts, the better. Meetings should never be more than two hours long and should follow a tight agenda. Phone conferences should be brief and to the point.
 Not only will the writer save time (and possibly charge you less as a result), but you will save time, too.

 5. Let them hear from you

 The copywriter mails his copy and never hears from the client until the next project. His insides are twisted with worry. Did the client hate the copy or did they love it? Probably they loved it—no news is good news—but the writer doesn’t know.
 A kind word from a client—a quick phone call or a brief, one-line note of praise—can do wonders for the copywriter’s ego. Writers seldom receive feedback on their work, even when the reaction is favorable.
 A thank-you note will be much appreciated by the writer starved for praise and ego gratification. Sincere flattery can quickly put you at the top of the writer’s “favorite clients” list. And the benefits of this—better service, better copy—are far in excess of the effort involved.

 6. Critique copy rationally

 “I don’t like it” is a meaningless critique and a frustrating response for the copywriter to deal with.
 The key to reviewing copy is to give specific, objective criticisms. Subjective and vague comments don’t give the writer any guidelines for revision and often lead to hurt feelings, defensiveness, and a gradual collapse of the client-copywriter relationship.

-----

### Below are nine rules for reviewing and approving copy. They will eliminate bad feelings and misunderstandings and give the copywriter the guidelines he or she needs to rewrite the copy so that it will be acceptable and effective.

 THE #1 MISTAKE IN CRITIQUING COPY

 Simply put, you should not hire copywriters to write ads exactly as you would have written them if only you had the time.
 Rather, you select a good copywriter whose style you like, then sit back and let them write it in their own natural style.
 If there are rules or guidelines your company abides by (e.g., never just say your product is “better,” but rather be highly specific about what makes it different and superior to other products in its category), make note of those errors in your copy critique. Even better would be to inform the writer about your rules and guidelines before he starts writing.
 The key here is not to edit and rewrite strong copy from an experienced writer so that it sounds exactly like you would have written it. If you feel compelled to do so, don’t assign the project to other writers. Instead, write it yourself.
 There are two reasons for this. First, copywriters are not mind readers, so it’s impossible for them to know exactly how you’d write the ad. Second, hamstring good writers, and they concentrate on trying to please you rather than writing copy that sells the product. And serving two masters, in this case you and the market, almost never works.

 MORE WAYS TO REVIEW AND APPROVE COPY

 Reading and reviewing copy is as much an art as writing copy is. Here are some other guidelines to help you review copy in such a way that you end up with the strongest promotion possible:

 1. Be specific

-----

### Make your critique of the copy factual and specific. Show the copywriter where he went wrong—and how you want him to fix it.
 Some examples of nonspecific versus specific criticisms:

_Nonspecific:_ _Specific:_

“Our product is the only one that offers these features. The copy
“Not enough pizzazz.”
should stress its uniqueness more strongly.”

“The copy doesn’t
‘position’ the product.”

“The ad is dull and
boring.”

“Our process is 20 percent more efficient than the competition’s. That
should be in the headline.”

“Put in less about the technical features and more about what the
product can do for people.”

“It doesn’t tell the story
“Here are the four consumer benefits the copy should cover.”
we want to tell.”

“This is a good start. But there are some specific changes I’d like to
“I don’t like it.”
see. Let me tell you what I have in mind.”

### Remember, it is not enough to say you want changes in the copy; you must specify what those changes are.
 This does not mean that you should do the copywriter’s job and rewrite the copy yourself. It does require that you write down specific, factual changes and corrections you want made and give them to the copywriter so he can rewrite your copy to incorporate these changes.
 And be sure to give these instructions in writing, not orally (unless they are very brief and very minor). The act of writing out your comments forces you to be more specific. Use Word’s Track Changes or Comments feature to mark up the electronic draft; this makes your edits easier to read and eliminates the need for the copywriter to struggle with your handwritten notes.

 2. The fewer levels of approval, the better

 Who should have approval authority? A product manager. A technical expert, usually an engineer or scientist. The marketing manager. The sales manager. And the company president. But certainly no more than that.

-----

### Everybody has a different opinion of what should appear in an ad. By trying to please a committee, you end up with an ad that is too spread out, one that is weak and watered down, with no strong selling message or point of view.
 Four or fewer reviewers is ideal. Six should be the maximum. Any more, and you are writing ads by committee—and committees cannot write effective ads.
 When I write for small companies, my copy is usually approved by one person: the company owner or president. Some of my best copy has been published this way. If others in your organization want to see the copy before it is published, put them on a “cc” list of people who receive informational copies. These people can give you their opinion if they want to, but they have no right of approval or disapproval. Only a handful of team members should have a say over what the final content of the ad will be.

 THE 25-50-25 PRINCIPLE OF COPY REVISIONS

About 25 percent of the changes made by the client improve the copy. Around 25 percent
make the copy weaker. The other 50 percent make no difference either way.

My reaction? I make the 25 percent changes that improve the copy and thank the client
for their careful review. I also make the 50 percent of changes that won’t affect the copy’s
effectiveness one way or the other, and I do it without question or quibble.

For the 25 percent of changes that I believe will adversely affect the campaign’s results, I
voice my reasons why to the client. If they do not agree with me, I acquiesce pleasantly.

### 3. What about compliance?

 Compliance means making sure your copy meets all the legal and regulatory requirements required by the federal government and its departments.
 For instance, when writing copy to sell dietary supplements, you cannot say that your pill cures a disease. So you can’t say your joint supplement cures or eliminates arthritis. You can say that your supplement supports

-----

### optimal joint health. Even safer is to say it “can” or “may help” support optimal joint health.
 I am not an attorney. I can’t advise you on legal matters or compliance issues.
 However, different companies nonetheless follow regulatory rules at varying levels. Some play it looser while others publish compliance copy as tight as a drum.
 One experienced direct marketer told me his compliance rule: “For each 10 percent your copy gets closer to strict 100 percent compliance, your response rate drops about 10 percent.”

 4. Be civil

 Some clients love to tear apart a writer’s work. Others are merely insensitive. They don’t realize that writing is a highly personal act, and writers take criticism on a personal level.
 Adman Amil Gargano says that some people “take delight in browbeating creative people. These are people who have a very fragile ego and a difficult time handling rejection. You should comment on their work in a way that is thoughtful, considerate, and articulate.”
 You don’t have to baby writers. Just remember they’re people. And, like your own employees, they are quick to respond to praise and to insult.
 Be tactful when you have to tell a writer that his work doesn’t meet your standards. Don’t say, “The copy isn’t very good, and we need a total rewrite.”
 Rather, start with praise, then get to the defects. Say, “Overall you’ve done a good job in putting this together. Let me show you our reactions and the changes we’d like you to make.”
 Companies spend a great deal of money motivating employees. Outside vendors also respond to the motivators of praise, kindness, courtesy, and decency. Treat your copywriters well, and they’ll give you their best.
 My former boss at Westinghouse, T. C. Smith, has a smart and effective way for giving critiques. The first step is to say “What I like about this is” and then praise one or two of the strong points, which you can always find if you look hard enough.

-----

### Then you say, “If it were mine to do” and give your criticisms, sometimes referred to as “crits.”
 Copywriters are more accepting and less negative about the crits when you start with some words of praise first, as T. C. does in the example above.

 5. Let writers write

 “Good clients don’t write copy,” says Malcolm MacDougall, president of SSC&B. “Good clients know in their hearts that nobody from Harvard Business School ever wrote a great ad campaign. That is why they have an agency.”
 Let your writers do their job. Don’t write or rewrite copy. If you want changes made, write out what these changes are. But don’t make them yourself. Give them to the copywriter and let him redo the words.
 Don’t play schoolteacher or amateur grammarian. The copywriter is the expert on how to use language as a selling tool.
 If you think the ad doesn’t reflect your strategy and objective, say so. If there’s a wrong fact, point it out. But don’t change commas to semicolons or dot i’s and cross t’s. Leave writing to the writer.

 6. Don’t take opinion polls

 One of my clients had me come up with two versions of a brochure cover. He made his selection by asking his mother, his father, his wife, his wife’s parents, his grandfather, and several friends which they liked better. Cover “B” got more votes and that’s the one he went with. Don’t make the same mistake as my client. Ad copy should be judged by professional businesspeople, not by friends, relatives, and neighbors.
 When viewing an ad layout or reading a piece of copy, amateurs judge the ad by aesthetics, not by whether it would move them to buy the product. They’ll pick the pretty layout, the flowery, poetic-sounding copy every time. So, nice as these folks may be, their opinion of your ad shouldn’t play a part in your approval process.

-----

### Some marketers circulate the copy, often on Google Docs, to many people, because they believe that the more opinions they get, the better this makes the copy.
 I am of the same mind as another former boss of mine, David Koch. One day at the office, more than half a dozen of us were arguing about whether we liked a piece of copy or not.
 Then David spoke up and asked us: “Do you know what a moose is?” We didn’t know what to say, so David told us: “It’s a cow designed by committee.” From this, I formulated my own rule of copy review:
 I have found that the quality of marketing copy is inversely proportional to the number of people who review it.

 7. Read copy as a customer, not as an advertiser or as an editor

 I worry when the client reads copy with pen or pencil in hand. It tells me he’s reading the ad as an editor, and not as a buyer.
 Instead, read the copy from the customer’s point of view. Ask, “If I were my customer, would this ad get my attention? Does it hold my interest strongly enough to get me to read or at least skim the body copy? Would I remember the ad, want to buy the product, or be moved to clip the coupon and respond?”
 Don’t worry if the ad doesn’t show a picture of the company president or talk about the new conveyor belts in the Kentucky factory. If the customer doesn’t care, then you shouldn’t, either.

 8. Develop and publish guidelines for copy review

 As I said, the copywriter can’t read your mind. He can’t know your corporate guidelines, your company’s likes and dislikes, unless you tell him what they are.
 Develop a set of rules and guidelines for your writers to follow. These rules should contain both mandatory stylistic requirements (for example, “The company name is to be set in all caps and followed by a registered trademark symbol”) and suggested guidelines.

-----

### The suggested guidelines clue copywriters on the way you’re used to doing things. (For example, you might prefer long, informative subheads in brochures rather than short, snappy ones.) However, the copywriter should consider these guidelines as suggestions only. Rules can be bent and broken to make the copy more effective.
 You can enlist the aid of your freelance copywriter, advertising consultant, or ad agency in developing these rules and guidelines. Together you may decide to add new rules or delete those guidelines that serve no real purpose.
 Ideally, copy guidelines should be formulated and refined based on analysis of tested data. For instance, one of my clients has found, through extensive testing, that headlines in half-page newspaper ads of 8 to 12 words generate the most orders. He has many other guidelines, also based on tested experience, that he uses to boost his ad response.
