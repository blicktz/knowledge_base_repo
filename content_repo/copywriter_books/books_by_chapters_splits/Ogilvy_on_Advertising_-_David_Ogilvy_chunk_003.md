The cult of ‘creativity’ The Benton & Bowles agency holds that ‘if it doesn’t sell, it isn’t creative.’ Amen.
 You won’t �nd ‘creativity’ in the 12-volume Oxford Dictionary. Do you think it means originality? Says Reeves, ‘Originality is the most dangerous word in advertising. Preoccupied with originality, copywriters pursue something as illusory as swamp �re, for which the Latin phrase is ignis fatuus.’
 Mozart said, ‘I have never made the slightest e�ort to compose anything original.’
 I occasionally use the hideous word creative myself, for lack of a better. If you take the subject more seriously than I do, I suggest you read The Creative Organization, published by the University of Chicago Press. Meanwhile, I have to invent a Big Idea for a new advertising campaign, and I have to invent it before Tuesday. ‘Creativity’ strikes me as a high-falutin word for the work I have to do between now and Tuesday.
 A few years ago, Harry McMahan drew attention to the kind of commercials which were winning the famous Clio awards for creativity:

 Agencies that won four of the Clios had lost the accounts.

 Another Clio winner was out of business.

 Another Clio winner had taken its budget out of TV.

 Another Clio winner had given half his account to another agency.

-----

###### Another refused to put his winning entry on the air.

 Of 81 television classics picked by the Clio festival in previous years, 36 of the agencies involved had either lost the account or gone out of business.

###### What about sex? The �rst advertisement I ever produced showed a naked woman. It was a mistake, not because it was sexy, but because it was irrelevant to the product – a cooking stove.

-----

_This is my �rst advertisement and it embarrasses me to reproduce it. No headline, no promise, no information about the_

_product. Certainly, nobody had ever shown a nude in an advertisement before, but, in this case, it was irrelevant to the_

_product – a cooking stove._

###### The test is relevance. To show bosoms in a detergent advertisement would not sell the detergent. Nor is there any excuse for the sexy girls you sometimes see draped across the hoods in automobile advertisements. On the other hand, there is a functional reason to show nudes in advertisements for beauty products.
 Advertising re�ects the mores of society, but does not in�uence them. Thus it is that you �nd more explicit sex in magazines and

###### novels than in advertisements. The word fuck is commonplace in contemporary literature, but has yet to appear in advertisements.
 There used to be an unwritten law against showing women in advertisements for cigarettes. It was not until long after people got used to seeing them smoke in public that this taboo was lifted. I was the �rst to show women in liquor advertisements – 30 years after they started drinking in public.
 Not long ago, all Paris was agog over a series of posters which appeared on the hoardings. The �rst showed a nubile girl in a bikini, saying, ‘On September 2, I will take o� the top.’ On September 2 a new poster appeared – she had taken o� the top. This time she promised, ‘On September 4, I will take o� the bottom’. All Paris was asking if she would also keep this promise. She did.
 Few Parisians were shocked. But I would not advise you to put up these posters in South Dakota.
 In Pakistan, an Islamic authority recently complained that ‘our women are being exploited and commercialized on television and in the newspapers. This goes against God’s will and violates the tradition of purdah dictated in the Koran.’ He proposed a ban on women appearing in advertisements. In Saudi Arabia it is illegal to use photographs of women in advertising, but OK to use drawings, provided you don’t show bare arms or cleavage. When a commercial for a soft drink showed a little girl licking her lips because she liked the taste, it was banned as obscene.

_In 1981 all Paris was agog over this series of posters. The �rst promised, ‘On September 2, I take o� the top.’_

_The second promised, ‘On September 4, I take o� the bottom.’ Would she keep that promise too?_

_She did. (It was meant to prove that posters are a good medium for advertising.)_

_For a long time, the idea that women might drink liquor as well as men a�ronted American puritanism su�ciently to keep_

###### While we are on the subject of taste, I deplore the current fashion of using clergymen, monks and angels as comic �gures in advertising. It may amuse you, but it shocks a lot of people.
 But I don’t object to scatological humor in advertising. I had no qualms about presenting the Grand Prize in a Clio ceremony to a Japanese soap commercial which featured a small boy farting in a public bath.
 The most risqué copy I have seen was for Paco Rabanne men’s cologne. Sales went up 25 per cent, and the advertisement was voted the best to appear in magazines in 1981.
 The Health Education Council in England uses advertising to encourage girls to get free contraceptives from Family Planning Clinics.

 In later chapters I will uncork some of the things I have learned about producing print advertisements which make the cash register ring. After that, television.

 Jobs in advertising – and how to get them

##### Cosimo de Medici persuaded Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine sculptor, to enter his service by writing him a letter which concluded, ‘Come, I will choke you with gold’

###### Advertising o�ers four di�erent career paths:

 1 You can join a television network, a radio station, a magazine or a newspaper and sell time or space to advertisers and their agencies.

 2 You can join a retailer like Sears Roebuck, and work as a copywriter, art director or advertising manager.

 3 You can join a manufacturing company like Procter & Gamble, and work as a brand manager.

 4 You can join an advertising agency.

 These are not watertight compartments. Copywriters trained at Sears Roebuck sometimes migrate to agencies. Brand managers escape from Procter & Gamble to join agencies. Time-buyers at agencies move to broadcasting networks.
 I am competent to write only about jobs in agencies. I don’t know any other trade which o�ers such variety. The atmosphere is

-----

###### extraordinarily stimulating. Agencies are psychological hothouses. You will never be bored.
 All the big agencies are international and o�er job opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. If you are �uent in a foreign language, it helps.
 At the start of your career in advertising, what you learn is more important than what you earn. Some agencies take great pains to train their people. As in teaching hospitals, their top people devote an enormous amount of time to teaching the interns. Agency employees in countries where advertising is relatively mature do not always welcome attempts to teach them. However wet behind the ears, they believe that they have nothing to learn. But in Asia and other developing areas, they welcome lecturers with open arms and hang on their every word. Not surprisingly, Asian standards of competence are rapidly improving. I now see campaigns in India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia which are better than many campaigns coming out of Europe and the United States. (See Chapter 17.)

 Copywriters Like all trades and professions, advertising has its establishment. You will �nd the names in the roster of 84 men and four women who have been elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame since its foundation 32 years ago. I regret to say that only 13 of them are copywriters.
 Copywriters may not be the most visible people in agencies, but they are the most important. The hallmarks of a potentially successful copywriter include:

 Obsessive curiosity about products, people and advertising.

 A sense of humor.

 A habit of hard work.

 The ability to write interesting prose for printed media, and natural dialogue for television.

-----

###### The ability to think visually. Television commercials depend more on pictures than words.

 The ambition to write better campaigns than anyone has ever written before.

 ‘Most good copywriters’, says William Maynard of the Bates agency, ‘fall into two categories. Poets. And killers. Poets see an ad as an end. Killers as a means to an end.’ If you are both killer and poet, you get rich.

 Art directors You cannot get a job as an art director unless you have had some training in �lm, layout, photography and typography. It helps to be endowed with good taste.
 Since print went out of fashion, many art directors have turned themselves into television producers. Television, being a visual medium, is a natural outlet for their talents.
 Art directors used to be the handmaidens of copywriters, but they have now gone up in the world. Indeed, some art directors have risen to become distinguished Creative Directors – notably Bob Gage at Doyle Dane Bernbach, Hal Riney at Ogilvy & Mather, and Keith Reinhard at Needham, Harper & Steers.

 Account executives The chief role of account executives is to extract the best possible work from the other departments of the agency. They are in daily touch with clients.
 If I wanted to become an account executive, I would �rst spend a couple of years at Procter & Gamble in brand management, followed by a year in a consumer research company, learning what makes people tick – particularly people who are less well educated than I am.
 Some agencies now hire more women account executives than men. In the New York o�ce of Ogilvy & Mather, 69 per cent of the

-----

###### account executives are women.
 It used to be that account executives were better paid than the brand managers who were their opposite numbers on the client side, and were often responsible not only for the advertising, but for the total marketing plan. But those days are over. The clients now recruit at the same business schools, and pay higher salaries than agencies. As a result, the role of the account executive at many agencies has been reduced to one of co-ordination. On an airplane not long ago, I overheard the following conversation:

 ‘What business are you in?’ ‘Engineer. You?’ ‘I’m an account executive in an ad agency.’ ‘You write the ads?’ ‘No, copywriters do that.’ ‘That must be a fun job.’ ‘It’s not that easy. We do a lot of research.’ ‘You do the research?’ ‘No, we have research people for that.’ ‘Do you bring in the new clients?’ ‘That’s not my job.’ ‘Forgive me, but what is your job?’ ‘Marketing.’ ‘You do the marketing for the clients?’ ‘No, they do it themselves.’ ‘Are you in management?’ ‘No, but I soon will be.’

-----

###### If this dismal dialogue does not put you o�, and you still want to start your career as an account executive, I repeat the advice I o�ered in my Confessions. Set yourself to becoming the best- informed person in the agency on the account to which you are assigned. If, for example, it is a gasoline account, read books on oil geology and the production of petroleum products. Read the trade journals in the �eld. Spend Saturday mornings in service stations, talking to motorists. Visit your client’s re�neries and research laboratories. At the end of your �rst year, you will know more about the oil business than your boss, and be ready to succeed him.

-----

###### Most of the work you do will be routine maintenance. Your golden opportunity will come when you rise to a great occasion. Some years ago, Lever Brothers asked their seven agencies to submit policy papers on the television medium, which was then quite new. The other agencies put in adequate papers of �ve or six pages, but a young man on my sta� took the trouble to assemble every conceivable statistic and, after working day and night for three weeks, came up with an analysis which covered one hundred and seventy-seven pages. The following year he was elected to our board of directors.
 Some young men and women are attracted by the travel and entertainment which attach to the work of an account executive. They soon �nd that lunching in expensive restaurants is no fun if you have to explain a declining share-of-market while eating the sou�é. Riding the circuit of test markets can be a nightmare if one of your children is in hospital.
 Account executives can be divided into custodians and contributors. You can probably get by if you never function as more than a channel of communication between your client and your service departments, like a waiter who shuttles between the chefs in the kitchen and the customers in the dining room. No doubt you will perform this function with aplomb, but I hope you will contribute more than that. Like inventing big ideas for selling the product.
 However hard you work, and however knowledgeable you become, you will be unable to represent your agency at the client’s policy levels until you are at least 30 years old. One of my partners owes the rapidity of his ascent to the fact that he had the good fortune to have his hair turn white at twenty-seven.
 You will never become a successful account executive unless you learn to make good presentations. Most of your clients will be corporations, and you must be able to sell campaigns to their committees. Your presentations must be well written, and well delivered.
 Do not make the common mistake of regarding your clients as dopes. Make friends with them. Buy shares in their companies. But

-----

###### try not to become entangled in their politics. Emulate Talleyrand, who served France through seven regimes.
 Always tell your client what you would do if you were in his shoes, but don’t grudge him the prerogative of deciding what advertising to run. It is his product, his money, and ultimately his responsibility.
 In your day-to-day dealings with clients and colleagues, �ght for the kings, queens and bishops, but throw away the pawns. A habit of graceful surrender on trivial issues will make you di�cult to resist when you stand and �ght on a major issue.
 Don’t discuss your clients’ business in public places. Keep their secrets under lock and key. A reputation for leaking can ruin you.
 Learn to write lucid memoranda. The senior people to whom they are addressed have more homework than you do. The longer and more turgid your memos, the less likely they are to be read by executives who have the power to act on them. In 1941, Winston Churchill sent the following memo to the First Lord of the Admiralty:

 ‘Pray state this day, on one side of a sheet of paper, how the Royal Navy is being adapted to meet the conditions of modern warfare.’

 Researchers To get a job in the Research Department of a good agency, you probably need a degree in statistics or psychology. You also need an analytical mind, and the ability to write readable reports.
 You must also be able to work sympathetically with creative people, most of whom are stubbornly allergic to research. Above all you must be intellectually honest. A researcher who injects bias into his reports does awful damage.

-----

###### Grateful as I am to the researchers who have helped me to produce e�ective advertising, I have nine bones to pick with them:

 1 They take three months when I only have three weeks. When Eisenhower was President, the White House called Dr. Gallup one evening at six o’clock. Eisenhower wanted to know the state of public opinion on an important issue of foreign policy. The report had to be on the President’s desk at eight o’clock the next morning. Gallup sent for six of his henchmen and dictated three questions. Then each of the henchmen telephoned six interviewers in di�erent parts of the country, and they interviewed ten people each. By midnight they had called in their results. Gallup tabulated them, wrote his report and dictated it to a White House stenographer. The report was on Eisenhower’s desk two hours before it was due.
 Nor is this merely an example of presidential clout. When Robert Kennedy lost the Oregon primary in 1968, his campaign manager had a research report on his desk eighteen hours after the polls closed, analysing the reasons for his defeat.
 When I �rst went to run the Audience Research Institute for Dr. Gallup, it took our statisticians two months to deliver their reports. I bullied them into telescoping the work into two days,
