### Small words are better than big words whether you’re writing to farmers or physicists, fishermen or financiers. “Even the best-educated people don’t resent simple words,” says John Caples. “But [simple words] are the only words many people understand.”
 Ernest Hemingway famously said, “Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don’t know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.”
 And don’t think your copy will be ignored because you write in plain English. In Shakespeare’s most famous sentence—“To be or not to be?”— the biggest word is three letters long.

 6. Avoid Technical Jargon

 Industrial copy isn’t the only writing that uses technical jargon. Here’s a sample from a Porsche ad that ran in Forbes:

The new Porsche has a new 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder, aluminum-silicon alloy Porsche engine—
designed at Weissach, and built at Zuffen-hausen.

It achieves maximum torque of 137.2 ft-lbs as early as 3,000 rpm, and produces 143 hp at
5,500 rpm.

The new model also has the Porsche transaxle design, Porsche aerodynamics, and Porsche
handling.

### Like many Forbes readers, I’m not an automotive engineer. I didn’t know that torque is achieved in foot-pounds, or that 3,000 rpm is considered early for achieving it. I know hp is “horsepower” and rpm is

-----

### “revolutions per minute,” but I don’t know whether 143 hp at 5,500 rpm is good, bad, or mediocre.
 The point is: don’t use jargon when writing to an audience that doesn’t speak your special language. Jargon is useful for communicating within a small group of experts. But used in copy aimed at outsiders, it confuses the reader and obscures the selling message.
 IT professionals have created a new language: machine intelligence, quantum computing, terabyte, gigahertz, raster image, and wireframe. But non-computer people may not know the vocabulary.
 A business executive may know the meaning of “software” and “hardware,” but not understand terms like “interprocess message buffer,” “asynchronous software interrupt,” and “four-byte integer data type.” When you use jargon, you enjoy an economy of words, but you risk turning off readers who don’t understand this technical shorthand.
 Computer experts aren’t the only technicians who baffle us with their lingo. Wall Streeters use an alien tongue when they speak of downside ticks, standstills, sideways consolidation, and revenue enhancements. Hospital administrators, too, have a language all their own: cost outliers, prospective payments, catchment areas, diagnostic-related groups, and ICD- 9 codes.
 Because advertisers are specialists, it is they—not their copywriters— who most often inflict jargon on readers. One of my clients rewrote some brochure copy so that their storage silo didn’t merely dump grain; the grain was “gravimetrically conveyed.”
 When is it okay to use technical terms, and when is it best to explain the concept in plain English? I have two rules:

RULE #1: Don’t use a technical term unless 95 percent or more of your readers will understand
it. If your client insists you use jargon that is unfamiliar to your readers, be sure to explain
these terms in your copy.
RULE #2: Don’t use a technical term unless it precisely communicates your meaning. I would
use software because there is no simpler, shorter way to say it. But instead of using deplane, I
would just say, “Get off the plane.”

### 7. Be Concise

-----

### Good copy is concise. Unnecessary words waste the reader’s time, dilute the sales message, and take up space that could be put to better use.
 Rewriting is the key to producing concise copy. When you write your first draft, the words just flow, and you can’t help being chatty. In the editing stage, unnecessary words are deleted to make the writing sparkle with vigor and clarity.
 One copywriter I know describes her copy as a “velvet slide”—a smooth path leading the prospect from initial interest to final sale. Excess words are bumps and obstacles that block the slide.
 For example, a writing consultant’s Web site says his clients receive “informed editorial consideration of their work.” As opposed to uninformed? Delete informed.
 An ad in a writer’s magazine refers to “incomplete manuscripts still in progress.” Obviously, a manuscript still in progress is incomplete.
 Make your writing concise. Avoid redundancies, run-on sentences, wordy phrases, the passive voice, unnecessary adjectives, and other poor stylistic habits that take up space but add little to meaning or clarity. Edit your writing to remove unnecessary words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.
 Here are some examples of wordy phrases and how to make them more concise.

### 8. Be Specific

 Advertising persuades us by giving specific information about the product being advertised. The more facts you include in your copy, the better. Copywriters who don’t bother to dig for specifics produce vague, weak, meaningless copy.
 “If those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one point,” write Strunk and White in The Elements of Style, “it is this: the surest way to arouse and hold the attention of the reader is by being specific, definite, and concrete. The greatest writers—Homer, Dante, Shakespeare—are effective largely because they deal in particulars and report the details that matter.”
 When you sit down at the PC, your file of background information should have at least twice as much material as you will end up using in the final version of your ad. When you have a warehouse of facts to choose from, writing copy is easy: you just select the most important facts and describe them in a clear, concise, direct fashion.
 But when copywriters have little to say, they fall back on fancy phrases and puffed-up expressions to fill the empty space on the page. The words sound nice but say nothing of value. And the ad doesn’t sell because it doesn’t inform.

 9. Go Straight to the Point

 If the headline is the most important part of an ad, then the lead paragraph is surely the second most important part. It is this lead that either lures the reader into the text by fulfilling the promise of the headline, or bores the reader with uninteresting, irrelevant, unnecessary words.
 The first piece of copy I ever wrote was a brochure describing an airport radar system. Here’s the lead:

Times change. Today’s airports handle a far greater volume of traffic than the airports of the
late 1960s.

-----

Radars of that era were not built with an eye toward the future and could not handle the rapidly
increasing demands placed upon terminal air traffic control systems.
The air traffic handled by today’s airports continues to increase at a tremendous rate. An
airport surveillance radar must be built to handle not only today’s airport traffic but also the
more complex air traffic control requirements of tomorrow’s airports.

### All this is true, and as a layman I found it interesting. But the person reading the brochure is in charge of air traffic control at a large or medium- size airport. Doesn’t he already know that air traffic volume is increasing? If so, I am wasting his time by repeating the obvious. Many novice copywriters fall into this trap. They spend the first few paragraphs “warming up” before they get to the sales pitch. By the time they do start talking about the product, most readers have fled.
 Start selling with the very first line of copy. Here’s how I should have written the lead to that radar brochure:

The X-900 radar detects even the smallest commercial aircraft out to a range of 145 miles.
What’s more, the system’s L-band operating efficiency makes it 40 times more efficient than
S-band radars.

### If you feel the need to “warm up” as you set your thoughts on paper, do so. But delete these warm-ups from your final draft. The finished copy should sell from the first word to the last.
 Here’s another example of copy that fails to get to the point:

**AIM HIGH. REACH FOR NEW HORIZONS**
It’s never easy. But reaching for new horizons is what aiming high is all about. Because to
reach for new horizons you must have the vision to see things not only as they are, but as they
could be.…

### Why write vague copy like this? The ad tries to be dramatic, but the result is empty rhetoric; the copy does not give a clue as to what is being advertised.
 This copy appeared in a U.S. Air Force recruitment ad. The benefits of joining the air force are travel, vocational training, and the chance to fly jets. Why not feature these points right off?

### 10. Write in a Friendly, Conversational Style

 Ann Landers was one of the most widely read columnists in the country. Why was she so popular? Said Ann, “I was taught to write like I talk.”
 People enjoy reading clear, simple, easy-to-understand writing. And the simplest, clearest style is to write the way you talk. (The writing experts call this “conversational tone.”)
 Conversational tone is especially important in advertising, where the printed page is an economical substitute for a salesperson. (The only reason companies advertise is that advertising can reach more people at less cost than a traveling salesperson can.) A light, conversational style is much easier to read than the stiff, formal prose of business, science, and academia. And when you write simply, you become the reader’s friend. When you write pompously, you become a bore.
 In the 1980s, IBM’s famous Charlie Chaplin ads and commercials launched IBM’s first PC and helped make it a bestseller. This ad series was a model of friendly, helpful, conversational copy. Here’s a sample:

There’s a world of information just waiting for you. But to use it, study it, enjoy it and profit
from it, you first have to get at it. Yet the facts can literally be right at your fingertips—with
your own telephone, a modem, and the IBM Personal Computer.

### Note the use of colloquial expressions (“a world of information,” “at your fingertips”) and the informal language (“just waiting for you,” “you first have to get at it”). IBM seems to want to help us on a person-to-person level, and its copy has the sound of one friend talking to another.
 So how do you go about it? In an article in the Wall Street Journal, John Louis DiGaetani recommends this simple test for conversational tone: “As you revise, ask yourself if you would ever say to your reader what you are writing. Or imagine yourself speaking to the person instead of writing.”
 My former boss once wrote a sales letter that began, “Enclosed please find the literature you requested.” I asked him, “If you were handing this envelope to me instead of mailing it, what would you say?”
 “Well, I’d say, ‘Here is the information you asked for’ or ‘I’ve enclosed the brochure you requested’ or something like that.” “Then why not write it

-----

### that way?” I replied. He did.
 And to help you write the way you talk, here are some tips for achieving a natural, conversational style:

 Use pronouns—I, we, you, they. Use colloquial expressions—a sure thing, turn-on, rip-off, okay. Use contractions—they’re, you’re, it’s, here’s, we’ve, I’m. Use simple words. If you must choose between writing naturally and being grammatically correct, write naturally.

 11. Editing to Avoid Sexist Language

 The day of the advertising man, salesman, and Good Humor man are over. Now it’s the advertising professional, salesperson, and Good Humor vendor.
 Copywriters must avoid sexist language. Like it or not, sexist language offends a large portion of the population, and you don’t sell things to people by getting them angry at you.
 In this age of LGBTQ, handling gender in writing is a sensitive issue. Here are a few tips:

 • Use plurals. Instead of “the doctor receives a report on his patients,” write, “the doctors receive reports on their patients.”

 • Rewrite to avoid reference to gender. Instead of “the manager called a meeting of his staff,” write, “the manager called a staff meeting.”

 • Alternate gender references. In the past, I used his and he throughout my copy. Now, I alternate he with she and his with her.

 • Use “he and she” and “his and her.” This works in simple sentences. But it can become cumbersome in such sentences as, “When he or she punches his or her time card, he or she is automatically switched to his or her overtime pay rate.” When you use he and she and his and her, alternate these with she and he and her and his.

-----

### • Do not use the awkward constructions he/she or his/her. Instead, write “he or she” or “his or her.”

 • Create an imaginary person to establish gender. For example: “Let’s say Doris Franklin is working overtime. When she punches her time card, she is automatically switched to her overtime pay rate.”

### A FEW TRICKS OF THE TRADE

 Copywriters use a number of stylistic techniques to pack a lot of information into a few short paragraphs of smooth-flowing copy. Here are a few tricks of the trade.

 End with a Preposition

 Ending a sentence with a preposition adds to the conversational tone of the copy. And it’s a perfectly acceptable technique endorsed by William Zinsser, Rudolf Flesch, Henry Fowler, and most other authorities on modern writing. Some examples:

He’s the kind of fellow with whom you love to
have a chat.

Air pollution is something of which we want to get
rid.

He’s the kind of fellow you love to have a
chat with.

Air pollution is something we want to get rid
of.

For what are we fighting? What are we fighting for?

### Use Sentence Fragments

 Sentence fragments help keep your average sentence length to a respectable number of words. And sentence fragments can add drama and rhythm to your copy.

Basic Eye Emphasizer does it all. It’s the one eye makeup everyone needs. The only one.

Not one of the Fortune 1000 companies even comes close to our rate of growth. And no
wonder. Smartphones are the hottest product of the 2020s, with no end to demand in sight.

It doesn’t take much to block the door to success. A flash of an idea that slips your mind. A
note that never gets written.

### Begin Sentences with Conjunctions

-----

### Beginning a sentence with and, or, but, or for makes for a smooth, easy transition between thoughts.
 Use these simple words instead of more complex connectives. But is a shorter, better way of saying nevertheless, notwithstanding, and conversely. And don’t use such antiquated phrases as equally important, moreover, and furthermore when and will do just as well.

The first lesson is free. But I can’t call you. You have to take the first step.

The choice is simple. Be a pencil pusher. Or get the Messenger. And move ahead at the speed
of sound.

ECS phones the first two numbers you’ve selected until someone answers. It announces the
emergency. Gives your address. And repeats it.

### Use One-Sentence Paragraphs

 An occasional one-sentence paragraph provides a change of pace that can liven up a piece of copy. When all sentences and paragraphs are pretty much the same, the reader is lulled into a stupor, just as a driver can be hypnotized by a long stretch of straight road. A one-sentence paragraph is like a sudden curve in the road—it can shock your reader to wakefulness again. Here’s an example from a sales letter pitching freelance copy-writing services:

For many ad agency people, industrial advertising is a difficult chore. It’s detailed work, and
highly technical. To write the copy, you need someone with the technical know-how of an
engineer and the communications skills of a copywriter.

That’s where I can help.

### Use Graphic Techniques to Emphasize Words or Phrases in the Copy

 College students use yellow markers to highlight sentences in their textbooks. This saves time in studying, since the highlights allow them to reread only the important material and not the entire book.
 Highlighting and underlining can make words and phrases stand out in print advertising and promotion as well as in schoolbooks. Many readers
