##### have to be with anyone or be very social. And maybe the key word here is identify. The Mercedes owner wants to be identified with the class or group of people who also own a Mercedes.
 Owning a Rolls-Royce in California in the 1970s was the ultimate status symbol. I couldn’t believe how impressed people were with other people who owned one. Being a Midwestern boy and not having grown up on the car-conscious West Coast, it was culture shock to realize how much a Rolls meant to somebody from the West Coast. Yet when you look at the car, it is one of the most conservative and old-fashioned-looking automobiles on the road today.
 The desire to belong to and identify with a group of people who own a specific product is one of the most powerful psychological motivators to be aware of in marketing and copywriting. But one of the best examples I can give was a personal experience, which leads me to my next psychological point.

# 18. Desire to Collect

##### There must be a natural instinct in the human race to collect, as I learned from my marketing experience.
 If you are selling a collectible, it’s pretty easy to understand that this urge exists and therefore, as a direct marketer, you need to capitalize on it. But often overlooked is the fact that it can be used to sell any other product, too. Let’s take the watch buyer. An enthusiastic watch buyer is your perfect prospect for another watch.
 When I was selling watches in print, I would send mailings to those customers who had previously ordered from me and offer them other watches. I received a great response. My best list for watches consisted of my existing watch owners. Now you would think that if you had a watch, what would you need another one for? Wrong. Many people actually collect them. They’ll have several watches, several pairs of sunglasses, several pairs of jeans, a library of videos or compact disks. The list is endless.
 I’m always amazed at the number of dolls collected by QVC viewers. Some of the viewers are older women, long past childhood, yet among QVC’s most avid collectors. And they have dozens of dolls.
 Small car models are also sold on QVC. They are some of the most popular products. And not to be outdone, there must be thousands of viewers who own many BluBlocker sunglasses—often in several different styles.

 You’d be amazed at what people collect.

##### The point is, when selling, whether in print or on TV or the Internet, recognize that there is a very large segment of the population who, for whatever reason, has an emotional need to collect a series of similar products. These products bring great joy and satisfaction and in some cases utility.
 And think about those who collect the real cars. Many who can afford them have collections that range up to hundreds of full-sized automobiles. What kind of emotional need are they fulfilling?
 One of the ways that direct marketers optimize on the collecting instinct is by sending, free of charge with their very first shipment, some sort of device to hold the collection.
 I can remember ordering a series of silver airplane tails with various airline logos embossed on them from the Franklin Mint. I started collecting them to see how the Franklin Mint conducted its program rather than from any interest in collecting airplane tails.
 I received a beautiful chest with cutouts for each of the silver tails. And they came once a month and each month I put one more tail in the chest. I looked at my collection each time I put in a new tail and felt the pride of knowing that my tail collection was growing. Finally, I had enough to fill the chest so that when guests came over, I could display my entire tail collection. I finally sobered up and stopped collecting. It was costing me a small fortune, and after all, the only reason I had started was for the research. And the collection was kind of silly to begin with. The airlines were either merging, going out of business or changing their names so fast that even the Franklin Mint couldn’t keep up.

##### But it was this experience that convinced me that there were lots of opportunities for selling to collectors.

# 19. Curiosity

##### If I had to pick the one major psychological reason that makes direct marketing so successful today, it would be curiosity. At retail, a customer can touch and experience the product first-hand and then decide. A mail order customer can’t do that. The product might look good and do exactly what the customer expects it to do, yet there is always that level of curiosity that makes the product attractive to the prospect. “What is that product really like?” might be the typical thought of a prospect.
 When I sold BluBlocker sunglasses on TV, I deliberately created an enormous amount of curiosity. I had my subjects—ordinary people we would find on the streets—try on a pair of BluBlocker sunglasses. I would then videotape their reactions. Some of the reactions were great and when I presented them on TV, the viewers were wondering, “What was it like to look through these glasses—that pair of sunglasses with the orange lenses that was making everybody go wild?”
 I didn’t take the TV camera and look through a pair. That would have destroyed the curiosity and would not have given the true picture of what the sunglasses would do for you. (Your brain adjusts to the color shift when you look through the lens, whereas the TV camera does not.) Instead, I enhanced curiosity by not showing the view. The only way you could look through them was to buy a pair. And buy the public did—almost 8 million pairs from a series of commercials that ran for six years.
 Curiosity also works well with books. You can tease prospects by telling them what they will find out by reading your books. In fact, the strongest motivating factor in selling books is curiosity, followed only by notoriety and credibility.
 Because a prospect can’t touch or experience the product, curiosity is the strongest motivating factor in mail order. Immediate gratification is the strongest factor in retail. So if I recognize that fact and can deliver your product promptly—let’s say with FedEx—I’m capitalizing on the curiosity in mail order and coming close to the retail advantage.
 I’ve sold products relying completely on the factor of curiosity. In 1973 I offered a pocket calculator without ever showing a picture of it. By creating such compelling curiosity about that product, I sold thousands of them. Sure

##### the price was good and the product was great, but without showing the product or even mentioning the brand name, I was still able to make the selling message very compelling.
 How do you use curiosity in selling your products? First realize that when you sell books, curiosity is the key motivating factor and you should use it as your prime selling tool. But realize also that there are many other products that lend themselves to holding back part of the story in order to arouse curiosity and create a demand.
 Show too much, tell too much, and you run the risk of killing whatever advantage you have using mail order as a medium.
 A friend of mine, Steve Dworman, who publishes an infomercial trade newsletter, was fascinated by my success using curiosity as the main selling tool in my BluBlocker commercial. He thought to himself, “Could the same technique be used to sell something that was impossible to sell on TV in a direct response commercial? Like perfume?” So he organized the shooting of a commercial using curiosity as its main motivating factor.
 In the commercial, everybody was raving about the perfume but there was no way the TV sets allowed viewers to sniff it unless they bought Steve’s product. The commercial generated enough curiosity to work.
 How many times have you said too much, shown too much or failed to use the power of curiosity? It is one of the leading motivating factors in all direct response marketing.

# 20. Sense of Urgency

##### You might have already figured this one out. You’ve almost sold the prospect. The prospect believes in your product and is ready to buy. But like many of your customers, this one says, “Well, let me think about it.”
 It is a proven fact that when this happens, chances are the prospect won’t buy. And the reasons are really very logical. First, in time that excellent sales message you wrote will most likely be forgotten. Second, if you’re lucky and it isn’t forgotten, it won’t have the same impact it had when it was first read. That old saying, “Out of sight, out of mind,” holds true in a case like this.
 Therefore, to avoid the delaying tactic, you’ve got to provide prospects with an incentive or reason to buy now. In fact, if you do your job right, customers have to feel guilty if they don’t buy right now. But how do you do it?
 First, here’s what you don’t want to do. The prospect has spent a lot of time with your ad and you’ve convinced him or her to buy. The one thing you don’t want to do is blow your integrity at the very end of the ad by making a statement that is not true. A statement like, “If you don’t respond within the next few days, we’ll be sold out,” or some other deceit will turn off the prospect. So be careful. Whatever you say at the end should be the truth and should be crafted to maintain the same integrity that has been expressed throughout your ad.
 Now, what can you do to provide a sense of urgency? Some ads reek with a sense of urgency and nothing has to be said. For example, I once ran a retraction for an ad that said that the price listed for a calculator was the wrong price and that the new price was $20 higher, but you had a few days to purchase the product at the old price before the new price went into effect. That approach was an integral part of the concept and provided a sense of urgency that was obvious and very real.
 You can also convey a sense of urgency by offering limited editions. “We have only 1,000 sets and this will be our last advertisement” can be persuasive and motivate the buyer to act right away.
 You might have a great ad with a good sense of urgency but a fatal error might still kill your ad’s effectiveness. What is that fatal error? Omitting

##### important information that the buyer needs in order to make that buying decision. Then the buyer has the excuse, “There’s a question I have but I’m too busy to call and find out the answer,” or a similar reason. In short, even a great sense of urgency can be wasted if you leave out some critical information from your ad copy.
 You can use the sense of urgency in many different ways—low supplies, closeout opportunity, price rise, product shortages, limited-time price opportunity or limited-edition opportunity. How about “Buy now so you can start enjoying the benefits of my product tomorrow.” Or even “Buy one during the next three days and you’ll get a second one free.”
 Another way to provide a sense of urgency is through your shipping methods. “We’ll ship your purchase via FedEx if you order by (a certain date).” Or “Since you are one of our customers, you can buy this wonderful product prior to our national introduction if you order by (a certain date).”
 We used to run all our new product introductions with the phrase, “National Introductory Price.” This didn’t mean that much but it raised the possibility that the price was the introductory price and later might go up. In actuality, the prices of calculators and electronics always went down, so we eventually dropped that phrase.
 The number of possibilities is limited only by your imagination. The sense-of-urgency statements always go at the end of your advertising. And if there are two critical locations in your advertising, they are the very beginning and the very end. And it is at the end where the sense of urgency and several other important concepts meet and must be considered and blended seamlessly together.

# 21. Fear

##### Fear is one of the great motivators that will cause us to take action. Give a person a reason to act based on the fact that they may lose the opportunity to buy something and they will usually act in a positive way toward your offer. As just discussed, sense of urgency is an important psychological trigger.
 A part of the sense of urgency is based on fear. Your customer fears that he or she will lose out on the opportunity of buying a product or service because it won’t be available in the future or it won’t be available at the same price. But fear can be a motivating factor in other situations as well.
 For example, when a new flu virus or strain threatens, this would be an opportunity to sell products that build the immune system or products that may help prevent the disease. People are buying these products because they want to protect themselves from the virus, which today is a real and present danger. They fear the consequences if they don’t buy something to protect themselves. Even though it is easier to sell something that cures a disease than it is to sell a preventive, this rule is often violated when fear is a major factor.

## Fear of Crime

##### Another example is the purchase of a burglar alarm or even a gun. There might be an outbreak of crime in a certain city and residents who are fearful they might be attacked or robbed will take action to protect themselves and their homes.
 There are products that play to our fear of aging. Creams, lotions and pills offering a fountain of youth are bought because people fear the aging process and are concerned about what others think of their looks.
 It is common to hear of people who take action and show irrational behavior based on their fears. The stock market is a good example of irrational behavior when it comes to a person’s fear of losing money. When the market crashes and is near the bottom of what is called a bear cycle and the economy looks extremely grim, consumers start dumping stocks fearing that the market will continue to collapse and they will lose more money. In reality, this usually is the best time to buy stocks. Or when the viability of the dollar is questioned, many investors, out of fear, protect themselves and buy gold coins or hoard cash.
 Fear can be a great motivator if used carefully in response to some perceived danger or loss that one might have to face.

# 22. Instant Gratification

##### This is a big advantage at retail. Think about it. At retail, you pick something up, hold it, touch it and look it over completely. You can make your decision to buy and then you can take it home with you where you can enjoy and use it immediately. You don’t have that advantage in mail order.
 So to compensate, you should convey to your customer either the advantages in ordering from you via mail or the assurance that you ship promptly and that the customer will have his or her purchase within a few days.
 The effort by direct marketers to provide that instant gratification— shipping promptly—has made mail order one of the fastest methods of distribution in the United States and has thus taken a great deal away from the retail industry. I can call a computer mail order company and order a piece of software on Monday morning and use it by Monday evening. That’s so much easier than running to the store, parking, finding the right department and then having to deal with the salesclerk. It’s no wonder direct marketing has taken a dramatic bite out of many of the traditional retail categories.
 The mail order computer industry created giants such as Dell Inc. and Gateway 2000 that specialize in next-day delivery.
 And so if you have a product and want to capitalize on the main advantage that a retailer has, find a way to ship your merchandise out quicker, deliver it faster and provide better service than any retailer could ever offer.
