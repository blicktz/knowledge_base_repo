LinkedIn allows you to create a personal professional profile page. I have included a copy of my LinkedIn profile page to show one way to structure LI profiles that I and others have found effective. Here is the outline:
 #1—Under my name at top is a one-sentence abstract of who I am and what I do. Note that it talks not just about me but, more important, about results I produce for clients.
 #2—Instead of showing the standard head shot photo, I instead opted for an image of the cover of my book. Not only does it stand out because almost no one else does it, but it further establishes my brand as a recognized expert in my field.
 #3—Scroll down a little to the paragraph “Copywriting for me is thrilling,” which communicates my love of my profession and my objective, which is to win sales for my clients, not creative awards.

-----

-----

### #4—My capabilities and the types of work I do are denoted in a bulleted list with the items in all caps (e.g., CONTENT MARKETING) to make them stand out.
 #5—Each area has a concise, one-sentence description so the list does not have a lot of text, looks very clean, and is easy to scan quickly.
 #6—In the bullets I don’t focus on what the item is, but instead give highly specific results, with numbers. Numbers increase readership and results are what matter to potential clients.
 #7—Even though there is a button under my name at the top for sending me a message, after the bulleted list I also give my phone number and invite a call. A phone icon helps attract the eye to this call to action.

 • Building Your LinkedIn Post

 LinkedIn post viewers like images, but cat pictures and videos will not work well on this platform. It is always best to use professional images or, if you are artistically talented, to create images that are eye-catching and interesting. As always, any image you use should relate to your topic content. Here is how to create a post on LinkedIn.

 1. Create a headline that focuses on your subject content. 2. Add a few sentences of content to grab readers’ interest, about 50 to
 100 characters (including spaces). 3. Either add an image of your brand logo or use a relevant topic image. 4. Add a link at the end of your content, so people can click through to
 your landing page or blog where they can learn more about your topic in depth. Add your call to action (CTA) there. Here are a few sample posts from some of my friends in the industry. You can see that posts are very short but effective.

-----

-----

### TWITTER

 You can use Twitter as a personal page or as a business page, or both. Twitter is a more informal platform and postings consist of short “blurbs” of up to 280 characters at most, along with a link. It depends on the content you want to share, but keep the character count down as much as possible, preferably not more than 100 characters. Concise content is easier to read when information runs about two sentences long.

 • Twitter hashtags

 Twitter hashtags are included at the front of a keyword or a phrase, which helps anyone searching for that topic to find your post, along with other posts fitting that trending topic. It is essentially a way to code your tweet.
 For instance, #keto would help people find your tweet if they are interested in learning more about the keto diet.
 The narrower and more focused the hashtag name, the more you’ll attract the prospects you want. Therefore, if you sell keto diet information, #keto will bring you more qualified views than #weightloss or #diet.
 Hashtags are not tweets. They are labels on tweets that tell Twitter users what your tweet is about. So if you want to reach people who hate or love Donald Trump, use #Trump.
 Search a hashtag before you use it to see which version of it is most popular, so your post is found more readily in that category.

 SUMMARIZING HOW TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

 When you are starting a new professional page on a particular platform, spend time checking out how posts, especially popular posts, are being presented on the platform. Get a feel for what the “tone” of the platform is, so that you can meld with it, but still stand out in the right way through your posts.
 If your goal is to use social media as part of an integrated multichannel marketing strategy to promote your business, the content can be a combination of business-related and personal.

-----

### As noted, the business content can give the reader data, links to content of interest, instruction, tips, news, or trends of interest to your target market. This content shows that you are an expert who delivers value.
 The personal content is part of the online phenomenon known as transparency. People want to know more about you: who you are, your family, travels, hobbies, interests, activities.
 I advise you to stay away from controversial topics such as religion, sex, and politics if you use social media to promote your business.
 Why? Because it risks damage to your reputation and losing followers and potential customers. If you say that in your opinion religion is a bad thing and you do not believe in God or Jesus, what effect will that have on prospects who are devoted Christians? Giving such an opinion may offend and anger many of your friends, followers, and contacts.
 Remember what happened to Salman Rushdie when he published The Satanic Verses, the reaction to which included serious threats against his life. While that is highly unlikely to happen in reaction to one of your tweets, even a single comment can make people irate and harm your reputation. And remember, once something gets onto the Internet, it becomes highly visible and may be extremely difficult to remove.
 There are many more platforms available, such as Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, Flickr, Nextdoor (neighborhood focused), Foursquare, Myspace, Tumblr, and more. As a final mention, many of these platforms have phone apps that allow mobile phone viewers to connect with contacts on social media platforms throughout the day.
 Always check your post to see how it looks through the phone app version of any social media platform. If something does not look quite right, fix it as soon as possible. Then recheck the post again until you are happy with how it looks, and then share your post.

## WRITING FOR VIDEO

### Video is taking over marketing and the world. According to a study by Cisco, in 2019 video will have accounted for up to 80 percent of all online traffic. And consumers are 85 percent more likely to buy your product after viewing your video. I have been writing video scripts continually since 1979 and in this chapter will share the best practices.

 TYPES OF VIDEO SCRIPTS

 Video scripts can range from a sixty-second commercial shown at halftime during the Super Bowl to a one-hour video sales letter (VSL). Here are a few types of scripts:

 • The sixty-second television advertisement

 These videos can also be cut down to thirty seconds or fifteen seconds for shorter viewing times, when several ads are run together during the program break. Under this category, you will see advertisements for brands of beer, other types of drinks, food, and restaurants and commercials for car and home insurance, home improvement tools, and much more.

 • Explainer video script

 Explainer scripts are typically one to two minutes long and explain what a business does for its clients, how a new product works, or why you need a specific new service. One person is either on the video screen talking or is

-----

### speaking in the background throughout the video. For example, a software- as-a-service (SaaS) company has come up with a new software platform geared toward dentists’ offices that consolidates all parts of the business into one platform. The SaaS president opens the first scene by stating the problem dentists’ offices have. Then the president offers a solution, and this is what viewers see in the video. The video shows the software in action, with typed lists of what reports can be pulled from the software.

 • Interviewing video script

 This can be done in several ways. The interviewer first develops a structure script for each part of the interview. This helps with planning a camera operation, such as moving from camera A to camera B at the right time. Think of an interview done on a news session, where a candidate for president is being interviewed.
 Next, a list of leading questions is drawn up to ask the interviewee, and those are given to him or her in advance, so that the interviewee plans on what to say in the response. The responses can be written out as well, by the interviewee, so that everything is scripted for the time span allowed, say, fifteen minutes in total.
 A teleprompter can be used for this, placed at and just behind camera level. This way, the interviewee remembers what he or she wanted to say for that question, yet still speaks to the audience (the camera) as well as the interviewer.

 • Corporate script

 A president of a company wants to create a video about the successful previous year’s financial performance, so a script is written to cover all aspects of the financial statement. The president may start speaking while facing the camera, but other video shots should pull in components of the statement created as charts and graphs to keep viewer interest engaged.
 Alternatively, if the president comes off well on camera, the main shot can be on the president during the full video, interspersed with relevant graphs, tables, and charts.

-----

### • Training script

 Many companies create training videos so that new employees can get up to speed with using specific software that the company uses, and how to pull reports. Training videos also incorporate best practices, company culture, behavior expectations, what is considered a firing offense, and more.
 These are only a few of the types of video scripts that you might be hired to write, and more marketers are now creating videos for their own Web sites, giving a more personal touch. What was once the domain of corporations with huge budgets for marketing services and products has now become so much easier and affordable. Anyone can write and build a video if they have the talent.

 • Online video script

 The average online video posted on a Web site home page today is short, running two to three minutes. B2B videos have an average run time of about four minutes, and about half of viewers watch these videos in their entirety. Videos on second-level pages, especially those dealing with products and their applications, can go to five to seven minutes or longer.
 As for script length, figure your narration at 120 words per minute. A ten-minute script would then have 1,200 words—the equivalent of five double-spaced pages in Word with 12-point Times Roman.
 The best guideline for writing video scripts is: “One presentation, one topic.” Your video should talk about only one product, one idea, or one offer. After all, you have a limited time to tell your story before viewer attention wanes and they click away.

 HOW TO START YOUR SCRIPTWRITING PROJECT

 In this section, I’ll show you how to plan your script and then begin writing it. Let’s say you are hired by an agency that is creating a commercial for SaaS, the software company that has developed a new software platform for all dentists’ offices to use.

-----

### As part of the contract, it should be made clear that your client will provide you with all available information that you need to create the script, including any storyboards already completed, which can help guide your script.

 • Creative brief

 The creative brief that you get from your client outlines everything they have on the topic of the video, so you can build the script. This includes any discussions about how the video will be shot and who will be in it, such as hired actors or the employees of SaaS. Here is a typical list of what you want to know before creating the script.

 What is the message that this software company wants everyone to know? (buy the product or service, or sign up for something) What problem does this service or product solve for the customer? Will the video be shot inside or outside? Where can the customer get the product or service?

 THE SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

 We will call the new software platform PantherWorks and the software company that produces it Biedermort. And let’s say there will be one on- camera speaking actor. The video will take place in an actual dentist’s office, although the name of the dentist or of the practice will not be acknowledged. The office is background material to fit the message. You will want to use an audiovisual format for the script. You should also know how many minutes the video will run for.
 If your client has not created a storyboard or an outline, you can do so, just for yourself, to guide the script. We can call this an outline script, although the actual script is not yet written. See the example below.

 The speaker begins talking about
 the common problem Biedermort had heard a lot about from dentists everywhere. States that the problem has now been solved.

 The speaker describes how
 PantherWorks is a fully integrated software platform. Any information can be easily called up from one single platform instantly.

 The speaker continues with
 showing how reports can be custom-designed to be pulled with only a little information input.

 The speaker turns to the camera
 and states to call a number for a consultation or to go to the Web site shown below on the screen.

### Always keep in mind what the audience is seeing and hearing. Put yourself in their place and feel what they feel when seeing the video and hearing the speaker solve a problem for them.

 HOW TO WRITE THE SCRIPT

-----

### Once you have the structure, you can start out by writing a sentence for each scene that informs what should be covered. That will help guide what you write for the script.

 1. Here is what you should remember whenever you write any script for
 any type of video: know who your target audience is (i.e., dentists and office associates). 2. Always start with an introduction and make every word count. Get
 the message across in one to two sentences. Keep the total script to no longer than two pages with 100 to 120 words per minute. 3. Write concisely and effectively. Do not use fluff or big exotic words.
 Keep it simple. 4. Use the word “you” and speak conversationally to the audience. 5. Show what the problem was and then show how it was solved, or how
 it can be solved. 6. Show the outcome of how using the product or service makes life
 better and/or easier. 7. Give a call to action (CTA) and show how to get that product or
 service quickly, or how to sign up for something, such as an e-mail or a consultation.

 AFTER YOU WRITE THE SCRIPT

 Read it aloud and, if you want, record yourself reading it to see how it sounds when you play it back. Making a recording through your smartphone is an easy way to do this. You can time each section to see how it fits the visual scenes that will be in the video. The cadence of the script should have a natural rhythm and speed, not too fast, and not so slow that you fall asleep listening to it. Now we build the sample script, so you can see what one looks like:

TITLE: “Your Dentistry Office, Moving Faster and Better!”
LENGTH: Four (4) minutes
PRODUCT: PantherWorks Software Platform by Biedermort, Inc.
