 HAS THE INTERNET CHANGED COPYWRITING FOR BOTH WRITERS AND READERS?

 The major event that has taken place since the publication of the first edition of The Copywriter’s Handbook is the rise of the Internet as a marketing medium and channel of commerce.
 Many readers of the first edition have asked me, “Are the copywriting techniques The Copywriter’s Handbook teaches still applicable in the Internet era in general, and particularly to writing for the Web?”
 The answer is: well, yes and no. The core of persuasion is pretty much the same. What has changed is what today is known as the “sales funnel” or “customer journey.” Or as the great copywriter Gary Halbert astutely observed: “Fundamentals never change but current variations of how to best use those fundamentals are something you must always stay on top of.”[1]
 Undeniably, the Internet has revolutionized marketing because of its speed, accessibility, ease, and low cost: sending an e-mail marketing campaign is faster, easier, and less costly than distributing the same promotional material through the mail or running it as magazine ads or on TV. Facebook ads can directly target the prospects you want to reach through access to consumer ads. Also, you know the preliminary results within minutes of broadcasting your e-mail or your ads going live. In direct mail, it sometimes takes weeks before you know how well you’ve done.

 THE THREE KEYS TO WRITING COPY THAT WORKS IN THE DIGITAL AGE

 Here are three ways the Internet has affected the manner in which copy is written, evaluated, and tested today:

-----

### 1—Human emotion. First, good copy used to be primarily driven by an understanding of human emotion. That was the main factor that guided good copywriters to create winning copy.
 But today, there are not one but three key factors that influence how you create copy and make it work: human emotion, data, and compliance (fig. 1.1).

**Fig. 1.1: Copywriting is based on three factors: human emotion, data, and compliance.**

### Copywriter Frank Joseph writes, “There’s never been any marketing of any type that is not enhanced by emotion and sincerity.” Tyler Kelley of SLAM! Agency says, “I think we’re going to see the rise of digital marketing professionals who not only understand digital but understand people—how they think, what motivates them, and why they purchase.”[2]
 An important point is that the Internet has not changed human nature, nor does people’s buying psychology change simply because they are reading your message online instead of offline. As Claude Hopkins wrote in his classic book Scientific Advertising (see appendix D):

Human nature is perpetual. In most respects it is the same today as in the time of Caesar. So
the principles of psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to unlearn what you
learn about them.

### 2—Data analytics. Human emotion remains important, but copywriting is increasingly driven by data as reported by analytics.

### A white paper from Signal notes, “Decision-makers can no longer depend on experience, intuition, and secondhand information.… Data … is the single source of truth—the north star guiding marketers in a world where change is the only constant.”[3] Or, as Jordan Pritikin from HubSpot puts it, “Great marketers listen to their numbers.”
 Of the marketers surveyed by eMarketer, 55 percent said better use of data for more effective audience segmentation and targeting is among their three top priorities.[4]
 You ignore data at your peril, because they show what’s working today. Also, quantitative measurement based on live data and tests trumps subjective opinion every time.
 As for data and information used as source material for copywriting projects, there is so much raw data and content on the Web on every subject imaginable, some of my clients send me new links every five minutes for the project I am writing for them.
 For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.
 Renowned journalist John McPhee says: “Writing is selection.”[5] In an era of Information Overload, selectivity in writing is more important than ever.
 Some marketers are so data-driven that they ignore strong emotional copy, which frequently generates higher response rates than the mediocre copy used in so many tests.
 They also impose rules, based on their extensive testing of ads in their product category and preferred medium, which are contrary to what experienced copywriters think they know. For instance, one client in a niche industry finds that the optimal length for a half-page newspaper ad headline is 8 to 12 words. Longer or shorter and response drops. This is something I had never heard before writing for them, but their data trump my training, opinions, and instincts.

### 3—Digital compliance. You must follow the ad guidelines and rules for whatever search engine, social network, Web site, ad network, e-mail service provider, or other digital platform on which you want to run your ad. If you do not, your ad won’t run, and no one will ever see it.
 Compliance with these requirements often makes it difficult to create online advertising that says what you want it to say.
 For instance, as of this writing, Facebook rejects ads that talk about weight loss with specific promises (e.g., lose 10 pounds in 7 days). So how is one to run an effective weight loss ad there? And in 2018, Google dropped 3.2 billion ads that violated its advertising policies.[6]
 Marketers are finding hacks around these restrictions. For weight loss and other health claims, product benefit ads have widely been replaced by food-based Facebook ads (e.g., “Top Doctors Say to Throw This Vegetable in the Garbage!”).
 Smart marketers are increasingly finding honest and clever ways to get their stronger, bolder, more specific ads approved by Facebook and other media controlling compliance.
 Still, data and compliance restrict us in ways we didn’t have to deal with back in the day. Copywriter Richard Armstrong sums up the debilitating effects of digital ad requirements #2 and #3 as follows:
 “We’ve gone from ‘They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano … But When I Started to Play’ to ‘It’s Feasibly Possible that the Correspondence Course Being Sold in this Advertisement May Be of Some Assistance in Helping You Familiarize Yourself with Learning How to Play the Piano If You’re Willing to Put in Many Hours of Study and Practice.’”
 Although compliance is important, what constitutes compliance is sometimes open to interpretation. The rule of thumb, though, is this: for each 10 percent closer you get to perfect compliance, your response rates drop by 10 percent. The plain and simple truth is that overly zealous compliance in many cases results in weaker copy.

### SOME GOOD NEWS FOR OLD-SCHOOL COPYWRITERS

 The good news for you is that the vast body of the copywriting techniques and selling principles you’ve learned throughout your career, including the ones in this book, remain viable and effective.
 Well then, has the Internet changed anything for your readers? Yes, plenty—and here are the changes I see:

 1. The Internet, computers, video games, and other screen-based electronic media have caused a reduction in the human attention span. Being concise has always been a virtue in writing, but now it is even more important. This does not mean that long copy doesn’t work, that people don’t read anymore (as some erroneously claim), or that all copy should be minimal (some of my video sales letter scripts run to sixty-five hundred words). It does mean you must follow the wise advice of Strunk and White in The Elements of Style and “omit needless words,” keeping your copy clean and concise.
 2. Readers are bombarded by more ad messages and information overload than at any time in human history. As Yale librarian Rutherford D. Rogers once said, “We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.” That means you must strive to make your copy relevant to the reader, understand what keeps him or her up at night, and address that need, desire, want, or fear in your ad.

### 3. The Internet has made consumers more savvy, training them to shun promotion, better able to spot hype, and become increasingly skeptical. Both in print and on the Web, buyers often prefer educational-type advertising material: advertising that respects their intelligence, does not talk down to them, and conveys useful and practical information they perceive as valuable in solving their problem or making a purchasing decision.
 4. Copy that is mostly information rather than sales is today called “content marketing.” Advertising that looks more like an article than a paid ad is called either an advertorial or “native advertising.”
 5. Your prospects are busy and are pressed for time. Convenience and speed of delivery are big selling points today for products and services, as is time saving.
 6. Marketers now have the option of putting their product information in print material, online, or a combination of the two. “Multichannel marketing campaigns” typically alternate promotions between print and digital.
 7. Because print and digital to a large degree have become integrated, the sales funnel and customer journey—the steps marketers take to generate leads and sales, as well as the buying process the customer goes through— are multistep and more sophisticated than they were before the advent of Internet marketing. Chapters 11 through 17 cover these changes in detail.

 Here’s good news for copywriters: because of the rapidly growing use of digital marketing and all the new channels it has spawned, copywriting is a critical skill—both online and offline.
 Why? Consumers today are better educated and more skeptical. Thanks in part to the Internet, they have easier, faster access to product information and pricing for comparative shopping. There are more products and brands to choose from, and also more advertising messages—commercials, e- mails, banner ads, mailers—competing for our attention.
 As a result, our prospects are bombarded by more communications than were previous generations of consumers. There are more than a billion Web sites they can visit, and over eight hundred channels of television they can

### watch. Not to mention the hundreds of e-mails and even a dozen or so telemarketing calls some of us get each day.
 With all of that information competing for the prospect’s attention, you have to work extra hard to make your promotion—whether print or online —stand out and grab the prospect’s attention. And of course that means one thing primarily: strong copy with a message that readers actually care about.
 Yes, lists, media, and offers are tremendously important. But you can identify, fairly quickly and easily, those lists and offers that work best for your product. Once you’ve found the right lists, ad networks, and offers, then the only additional leverage you have for boosting response is through —you guessed it—copy.
 Writing is critical to success on the Web. As Nick Usborne points out in his book Net Words, “Go to your favorite Web site, strip away the glamour of the design and technology, and you’re left with words—your last, best way to differentiate yourself online.” In marketing, whether on the Internet or the printed page, copy is still king.

 HOW ONLINE VIDEO HAS CHANGED COPYWRITING

 Platforms including Vimeo and YouTube have flooded the Web with marketing videos ranging from twenty seconds to forty-five minutes or longer.
 YouTube is the leading online video platform, with almost five billion videos watched daily, and three hundred hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[7][,][8]
 Back in the day, marketing videos were burned onto DVDs and sent to prospects by mail, or else shown to prospects by salespeople on their laptops. Some DVDs and video are still used as inserts in direct-mail packages or in video brochures.
 There are four basic modes of learning: watching, listening, reading, and doing—the latter also called “experiential learning.” The problem is, it’s difficult to segment your market by their preferred learning mode. Therefore, we produce our content in multiple formats:

-----

### Video mp4 files for people who like to watch. Audio mp3 files for people who prefer to listen. Books and e-books for readers. Workshops, training exercises, and other live events for people who learn by doing.

 (According to an article in ClickZ [May 1, 2019], 73 percent of people who participate in a brand’s experiential marketing are more likely to purchase the brand involved.)
