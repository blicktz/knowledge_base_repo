An array of examples of how nature’s plant and animal fraud artists operate is described by
Stevens (2016). Examples of the similar tricks of human fraudsters can be found in Shadel (2012)
and Stevens (2016).
7. For a full account of the Cornell researchers’ study, see Ott et al. (2011). The comparisons
between online-review readers in 2014 and 2018 was provided by Shrestha (2018). In 2019, the US
Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint against the owner of a cosmetics company accused of
creating false product reviews. The complaint included a quote from the owner to her employees that
illustrates how well the manufacturers of fake reviews understand their potency: “If you notice
someone saying things like I didn’t like ‘x’ about it, write a review that says the opposite. The power
of reviews is mighty; people look to what others are saying to persuade them and answer potential
questions they have” (Maheshwari, 2019).

By no means was my friend original in her particular use of the expensive = good rule to snare
those seeking a bargain. Thirty years of research indicates that the strategy of marking an item as
“Reduced from . . .” works extremely well (Kan et al., 2014). Indeed, retailers have been using it
successfully even before researchers confirmed its effectiveness. Culturist and author Leo Rosten
gives the example of the Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men’s tailor shop in
Rosten’s neighborhood in the 1930s. Whenever Sid had a new customer trying on suits in front of the
shop’s three-sided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem and repeatedly request that the man
speak more loudly to him. Once the customer had found a suit he liked and asked for the price, Sid
would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room, “Harry, how much for this suit?”
Looking up from his work—and greatly exaggerating the suit’s true price—Harry would call back,
“For that beautiful, all wool suit, forty-two dollars.” Pretending not to have heard and cupping his
hand to his ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply, “Forty-two dollars.” At this
point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, “He says twenty-two dollars.” Many a man would
hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the shop with his expensive = good bargain before poor Sid
discovered the “mistake.”
8. Alexander Chernev (2011) conducted the study on calorie counts. The experiment showing a
decline in sexual attraction to current mates after exposure to naked bodies in the media was done by
Kenrick, Gutierres, & Goldberg (1989). Other researchers have found similar effects on attraction to
works of art, showing that an abstract painting will be rated as significantly less attractive if viewed
after a higher-quality abstract painting than if viewed by itself (Mallon, Redies, & HaynLeichsenring, 2014). Evidence that the contrast effect can operate without cognitive recognition
(Tormala & Petty, 2007) is reinforced by evidence that it even works on rats (Dwyer et al., 2018).

#### Chapter 2: Reciprocation
1. Certain societies have formalized the rule of reciprocation into ritual. Consider, for example, the
Vartan Bhanji, an institutionalized custom of gift exchange common to parts of Pakistan and India. In
commenting upon the Vartan Bhanji, Alvin Gouldner (1960) remarks:

-----

_It is . . . notable that the system painstakingly prevents the total elimination of outstanding_
_obligations. Thus, on the occasion of a marriage, departing guests are given gifts of sweets. In_
_weighing them out, the hostess may say, “These five are yours,” meaning “These are a_
_repayment for what you formerly gave me,” and then she adds an extra measure, saying, “These_
_are mine.” On the next occasion, she will receive these back along with an additional measure_
_which she later returns, and so on. (p. 175)_

The original holiday-card study was done by Phillip Kunz (Kunz & Woolcott, 1976) and, in a
noteworthy instance of continuity, was extended a quarter-century later by his behavioral-scientist
daughter Jenifer Kunz (2000), who found a stronger reciprocation rate if the sender of the first card
was of high status. Access to a fuller account of the request for a day of pay from investment bankers
can be found at
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203
286/BIT_Charitable_Giving_Paper.pdf (pp. 20–21).

The desirability of reciprocal exchange within and between societies was recognized by social
scientists long before sociologists such as Gouldner (1960), archaeologists such as Leakey and Lewin
(1978), and cultural anthropologists such as Tiger & Fox (1989). See, for example, Bronisław
Malinowski’s groundbreaking ethnographic examination of the trading patterns of Trobriand
Islanders, Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922). More recent evidence shows that the rule doesn’t
only apply to positive exchanges; it fuels negative ones as well (Hugh-Jones, Ron, & Zultan, 2019;
Keysar et al., 2008), all of which fits with W. H. Auden’s famous line of poetry: “I and the public
know / what every schoolboy learns / Those to whom evil is done / do evil in return.” More
generally, it can be said that the rule of reciprocation assures that whether the fruit of our actions is
sweet or bitter, we reap what we sow (Oliver, 2019). This is also true of human–machine exchanges.
Users who had received high-quality information from a computer then gave better information to
that computer than to a different one; what’s more, users receiving low-quality information from a
particular computer retaliated by providing it lower-quality information than that given to a different
computer (Fogg & Nass, 1997a). In general, reciprocity in all of its forms is a driver of human
conduct (Melamed, Simpson, & Abernathy, 2020).
2. The longevity of Ethiopia’s obligation to help Mexico (“Ethiopian Red Cross,” 1985) and Lord
Weidenfeld’s obligation to help Christian families (Coghlan, 2015) may be outdone by the case of a
group of French children’s cross-generational desire to aid a group of Australian children they had
never met. On April 23–24, 1918, near the end of World War I, several battalions of Australian
soldiers lost their lives freeing the French village of Villers-Bretonneux from German forces. When,
in 2009, the schoolchildren of Villers-Bretonneux learned of a bushfire that destroyed the Australian
town of Strathewen, they collected $21,000 to help rebuild Strathewen’s primary school. According
to one newspaper account, “They knew little of the children they would be helping. They only knew
their great-grandparents had promised 91 years ago never to forget Australia and the 1200 Australian
solders who died liberating their village” (The Australian, 2009).

Although highly consequential and memorable first forms of assistance, like those covered above,
can create lasting feelings of obligation, it would be a mistake to think all such actions do the same.
In fact, there’s good evidence that everyday favors lose their obligating powers as time passes
(Burger et al., 1997; Flynn, 2003). One set of studies even found that recipients feel most indebted to
a favor-doer before the act is completed (Converse & Fishbach, 2012). The upshot? Small acts of
help conform to the “rule of the bagel”: People appreciate them more when they are warm and fresh
than cold and old.
3. Even before they enter school, children come to understand the obligation to give back after
receiving and to respond accordingly (Chernyak et al., 2019; Dunfield & Kuhlmeier, 2010; Yang et
al., 2018). The Regan (1971) study was conducted at Stanford University. Pulitzer Prize–winning
journalist Joby Warrick (2008) reported the case of the indebted Afghan tribal chief, which fits with

-----

related evidence that, in the Middle East, “soft” methods, such as reciprocity-inducing favors, bring
better results than coercive interrogation techniques involving deprivation, hardship, or torture do
(Alison & Alison, 2017; Ghosh, 2009; Goodman-Delahunty, Martschuk, & Dhami, 2014). For links
to additional such evidence, see www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/were-onlyhuman/the-science-of-interrogation-rapport-not-torture.html.
4. The data pattern of the $5-“gift check” experiment (James & Bolstein, 1992) fits with newer
research showing that surveys providing payment before participation (wherein the money is
included in a request letter) get more compliance than those providing equal or larger payment after
participation (Mercer et al., 2015). It fits as well with a study in which hotel guests encountered a
card in their rooms asking them to reuse their towels. They also read either that the hotel had already
_made a financial contribution to an environmental-protection organization in the name of its guests or_
that it would make such a contribution _after guests did reuse their towels. The before-the-act_
donation proved significantly more effective than the after-the-act one (Goldstein, Griskevicius, &
Cialdini, 2011). Waiters’ gift of a candy before patrons paid their checks significantly increased tips
by Americans in a New Jersey restaurant (Strohmetz et al., 2002) and by guests of each of seven
nationalities in a Polish restaurant (Żemła & Gladka, 2016). Finally, the McDonald’s gift-balloon
study was done by my Influence AtWork.com colleagues Steve J. Martin and Helen Mankin in
conjunction with Daniel Gertsacov, at the time the chief marketing officer of Arcos Dorados S.A.,
which owned the McDonald’s locations. For additional details on this and other McDonald’s studies
done by our team, see www.influenceatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Persuasion-PilotsMcDonalds-Arcos-Dorados-INFLUENCE-AT-WORKpdf.pdf.

The benefits of giving first in business are presented and traced forward particularly convincingly
in a pair of books by Adam Grant (2013) and Tom Rollins (2020). For a humorous illustration, see
https://youtu.be/c6V_zUGVlTk. For a collection of reciprocity-based approaches favored by emarketers, see https://sleeknote.com/blog/reciprocity-marketing-examples.
5. It’s not just the case that drug companies’ gifts affect scientists’ findings about the effectiveness
of their drugs (Stelfox et al., 1998), such gifts also affect physicians’ tendencies to prescribe them.
Pharmaceutical-industry payments to doctors (for educational training, speaking fees, travel,
consulting fees, conference registrations, and so on) are linked to the frequency of doctors’
prescriptions for the sponsored drugs (Hadland et al., 2018; Wall & Brown, 2007; Yeh et al., 2016).
Even the low price of a single free meal is enough to do the trick—although more expensive meals
are associated with higher prescription rates (DeJong et al., 2016). Studies showing the effects of
donations to legislators are described by Salant (2003) and Brown, Drake, & Wellman (2014).
6. The most thoroughgoing scholarship supporting the new account of how the Cuban missile
crisis ended belongs to Sheldon Stern (2012), who served for twenty-three years as the historian at
the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. See also Benjamin Schwartz’s enlightening review at
www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/the-real-cuban-missile-crisis/309190.
7. The candy-shop research was performed by Lammers (1991). In another purchasing pattern that
fits with the rule of reciprocation, supermarket shoppers given a surprise gift coupon for a particular
type of item then bought significantly more additional items from the store, resulting in a 10 percent
increase in total purchase size (Heilman, Nakamoto, & Rao, 2002). The Costco experience was
described by Pinsker (2014). Anderson & Zimbardo (1984) reported on the reciprocity-rule wisdom
of Diane Louie at Jonestown.
8. The key ring–versus-yogurt data pattern (Friedman & Rahman, 2011) also appeared in a
supermarket study (Fombelle et al., 2010) that gave entering shoppers either a nonfood gift (key ring)
or a food-related gift (Pringles chips), which increased overall purchases by 28 percent and 60
percent, respectively. Michael Schrange (2004) wrote the article describing the disappointing results
of a hotel chain’s seamless customer-experience program on customer satisfaction. Customizing the
gift to the need doesn’t just work in commercial settings. Giving support within a relationship leads

-----

to greater relationship satisfaction only when it fits the recipient’s current need (Maisel & Gable,
2009).
9. Paese & Gilin (2000) demonstrated the force of unsolicited favors within negotiation situations.
Unsolicited cooperative offers produced return acts of cooperation from recipients even when doing
so ran counter to their financial interests. In a real-world illustration of the influence of uninvited
favors, Uber was able to significantly increase ridership in Boston after giving the city an unsolicited
gift: During the 2013 city-bus strike, the company rented buses and provided free service to all
Boston public schools.

Marcel Mauss published his masterwork _The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in_
_Archaic Societies in 1925, but an excellent English translation can be found in a 1990 reprint_
published by Routledge.
10. Although it is clear that we dislike those who take without giving in return (e.g., Wedekind &
Milinski, 2000), a cross-cultural study has shown that those who break the reciprocity rule in the
reverse direction—by giving without allowing the recipient an opportunity to repay—are also
disliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of the three nationalities investigated—
Americans, Swedes, and Japanese (Gergen et al., 1975). There’s ample evidence that people
frequently fail to ask for aid to avoid feeling socially indebted (DePaulo, Nadler, & Fisher, 1983;
Greenberg & Shapiro, 1971; Riley & Eckenrode, 1986). One study is noteworthy for its ten-year
duration and its investigation of a dilemma many of us have faced: whether to ask friends and family
to help us relocate to a new residence or to give the entire task to commercial movers. The study
found that often people avoid enlisting the help of those they know, not from fears that these
nonprofessionals would damage valuable property but from fears of the “indebtedness” such
assistance would generate in them as a result (Marcoux, 2009).

Other research has pointed to the driving force of indebtedness in reciprocal exchanges. For
example, Belmi & Pfeffer (2015), Goldstein, Griskevicius, & Cialdini (2011), and Pillutla, Malhotra,
& Murnighan (2003) identified a main reason that giving first can work so well: it produces a sense
of obligation on the part of the recipient to give back. Still, it’s worth noting that in the family of
factors related to reciprocity, obligation has an equally active but sweeter sister—gratitude—that
operates to stimulate returns, not so much because recipients of favors feel a sense debt but because
recipients feel a sense of appreciation. Although both feelings reliably spur positive reciprocation,
gratitude appears to be related to the intensification of relationships rather than just the instigation or
maintenance of them. Evidence in this regard is available in the research of Sara Algoe and her
associates (Algoe, 2012; Algoe, Gable, & Maisel, 2010; Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016).

George, Gournic, & McAfee (1988) did the research attesting to the perceived sexual availability
of a woman who allows a man to buy her drinks. See Clark, Mills, & Corcoran (1989) for a review of
data demonstrating a difference in the type of reciprocal norm that applies among family and close
friends (communal norm) versus strangers (exchange norm). More recently, Clark et al. (2010)
showed that strong communal norms inside a marriage are associated with marital success. Kenrick
(2020) offers an updated perspective on the distinction between communal and exchange norms that
applies to friendships; see http://spsp.org/news-center/blog/kenrick-true-friendships#gsc.tab=0.
11. The results of my team’s zoo-trip experiment were reported in Cialdini et al. (1975). The Israeli
study of the effects of unreasonable first requests was conducted by Schwarzwald, Raz, & Zvibel
(1979). The rejection-then-retreat technique has proved successful in other cultures as well, such as
Greece (Rodafinos, Vucevic, & Sideridis, 2005). Perhaps my favorite such demonstration occurred in
France, where patrons of three restaurants were asked by their server as she cleared the table whether
they’d like dessert. If a patron said no, the waitress immediately retreated to a proposal of coffee or
tea, which nearly tripled the percentage of such orders. What I found particularly instructive appeared
in another condition of the study in which, rather than immediately retreating to a proposal of coffee
or tea, the waitress waited three minutes to do so. In this treatment, hot-drink orders only doubled
(Guéguen, Jacob, & Meineri, 2011). Apparently, the finding that the obligation to reciprocate small

-----

favors declines over time (Flynn, 2003) also applies to the obligation to reciprocate small
concessions.
12. As I’ve claimed, the findings that the rejection-then-retreat tactic leads its targets to be more
likely to actually perform a requested favor (Miller et al., 1976) and to agree to perform similar
favors (Cialdini & Ascani, 1976) are consistent with the resulting feelings of responsibility and
satisfaction that were found in the UCLA experiment (Benton, Kelley, & Liebling, 1972). Recall that
there was another result of the UCLA experiment—starting with an extreme position and then
retreating to a moderate one proved much more effective than starting with a moderate position and
sticking to it. That outcome is consistent with the negotiation lesson learned by the Canadian petsupply business owners described on p. 38. The studies by Robert Schindler of retail customers’
satisfaction levels were published in 1998.

#### Chapter 3: Liking
1. The data on the percentage of Americans who believe humans evolved entirely through natural
processes came from a Pew Research Center survey (www.pewresearch.org/facttank/2019/02/11/darwin-day), which also documented the large role of religious belief in resistance
to evolutionary theory. Analyses by Andrew Shtulman (2006) and Dan Kahan
(www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2014/5/24/weekend-update-youd-have-to-be-science-illiterate-tothink-b.html) show the lack of relationship between the understanding of evolutionary theory and
belief in it. The quote from medical-malpractice attorney, Alice Burkin, came from an interview with
Berkeley Rice (2000).
