ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
obook is ever a soloachievement, even when thenameofa single author
NI
graces the cover. Let me take this opportunity to thank my various
collaborators and coconspirators.
I'm grateful to my original editor, Danielle Egan-Miller, for suggesting this
project and guiding me through the early stages. Her successor, Denise Betts, rook
the reins with grace and good humor; she would have won my loyalty even if she
hadn't told me that my introduction was one of the best she’s ever read. | owe a
further debt of gratitude to editorial team leader Craig Bolt and his skilled staff,
who managed to transform my manuscript into a book despite a hailstorm of last-
minute author's alterations, Thanks, too, to Scott Rattray for his sleek and elegant
interior design.
My wife, Anne, deserves credit for tolerating my eccentric work habits,
offering friendly encouragement, and donating her limited free time to tackle my
household chores during the deadline crunch, Our cat, Henry, and our German
shepherd, Frieda, also provided critical emotional support.
Finally, | would like to thank all the anonymous copywriters whose skill as
phrasemakers and persuaders provided me with the foundation for this book.
These hardworking scribes—these professional Cyranos—woo customers with
their words but never receive due credit for their eloquence. I'd like to give them
credit right here, right now.

INTRODUCTION
ack in 1984, when |was a young and underpaid copywriter toiling in the
[3
lower-middle regions of the publishing industry, a former colleague came to
me with an intriguing challenge. My mission, if I chose to accept it, was to
compile a thesaurus of words and phrases used in advertising.
It seemed like a worthwhile project, and I ran with it.
| looked forward to
creating a useful little idea-starter for my fellow copy writers—at least the direct-
mail, in-house breed scattered here and there at isolated outposts across our
republic. If the book sold a thousand copies and I could use it in my own work, |
would be content.
As it turned out, Words That Sell sold way more than a thousand copies. In
fact, it became one of those well-thumbed reference books that adorn the desks of
hardworking folks everywhere. Its enduring popularity amazed me.
What also amazed me was the range of people who responded to the book:
not only advertising copywriters like me, but marketing managers, small business
owners, trainers, corporate CEOs, public relations professionals—anybody who
did anything that required the right words to put it across.
Words That Sell had made its mark, and I was pleased. But | wasn't completely
satisfied,
| had written the book under a tight deadline, and I knew it had just
scratched the surface. | wanted a chance to dig deeper.
My publisher gave me that chance by commissioning me to write the present
book. I wondered how to create a second Words That Sell without perplexing the
people who owned the first book. It's not easy to juggle two reference books thar
serve the same purpose. Imagine if Roget had written a second thesaurus, forcing
you to shuttle back and forth between the two volumes!
vil


--- Page 10 ---

INTRODUCTION
No, More Words That Sell would have to be fundamentally different from its
predecessor, | would let the original book stand as a thesaurus for all-purpose
advertising and promotional messages. The new book would take the concept to
the next level: specialized lists of words and phrases you can use to fine-tune your
copy and target it to specific audiences.
Ideally, you'll be using the two books as partners, dipping into Words That Sell
for your basic features and benefits, then turning to More Words That Sell to
refine your copy for your intended market. But you can also use each volume
independently.
Think of More Words That Sell as your special-purpose word-and-phrase
resource, the book that takes up where Words Thar Sell leaves off. To my
knowledge, no other book supplies you with the tools you need to target your copy
60 precisely.
Here’s what you'll find in More Words That Sell:
* Lists of words and phrases for niche markets like business-to-business,
nonprofit, young people, seniors, subscriptions, and technology
* Unique lists of “upscale,” “emotional,” “cerebral,” and other special-
impact words, Use these lists to tweak your copy for the precise tone you
want—not an easy task if you try iton your own,
* In-depth lists of colors, flavors, fragrances, sounds, and textures to give
your copy more vivid sensory appeal. (The color list also comes in handy if
you need to select just the right names for your product color choices.)
* Words and phrases for writing concise but effective classified ads—
including personals, (Who said advertising had to be all business?!)
* Extensive lists of powerful verbs that add musele to your copy
* Personal qualities arranged by category—ideal for updating your résumé,
writing letters of recommendation, or finding the right words for annual
employee reviews
* A long list of negative qualities for knocking the competition or conjuring
up nightmare scenarios that your product or service can fix
* A powerful selection of “magic-response words”—those can't-miss
advertising perennials that boost results by appealing to basic human
needs
How have I organized all these lists? At first
| considered arranging them by
category (special markets, “tweakers,” sensory words, verbs, personal qualities,
vill


--- Page 11 ---

INTRODUCTION
and so on), which would have given the book an admirably logical structure. But
logic doesn’t always make sense—in books, advertising, or real life. In the end, it
seemed more practical to organize More Words That Sell alphabetically from start
to finish—from “Business-to-Business” to “Youth Market.” That way, you can go
straight to the list you want instead of having to guess the category and turn to the
relevant section of the book.
Keep in mind that the words and phrases in each list aren't necessarily
synonymous. (This book is less a thesaurus than a series of word menus.) I've
simply gathered the most useful expressions under each heading to help you choose
the most appropriate words.
At first glanee, there seems to be no discernible pattern to the way I've
arranged the contents of each list. But if you look more closely, you might notice
an underlying stream-of-consciousness approach that sweeps you along from one
concept to the mext. As in the original Words That Sell, I’ve taken care to see that
closely related words and phrases “clump together” within each list. That makes it
a lot easier for you to compare your choices.
You'll notice, too, that many of the phrases contain blanks or trail off in
ellipses |...) where the phrase breaks off. Here I've supplied you with the pattern
of a phrase that you can adapt to your needs by filling in the missing words or
fleshing out the sentence as you see fit.
For special help with copy techniques (including writing for the Internet), rurn
to the four appendixes at the back of the book. I've also supplied you witha list of
books for further reading. All the titles are worth looking at, and many of them
would help you form the solid nucleus of a personal advertising and marketing
library.
Before I sign off and leave you to explore the lists in this book, let me address
a nagging issue, While most of the business world greeted the original Words That
Sell with enthusiasm and gratitude, a few critics from ad agencies have sniped at its
“color-by-numbers” approach to what is, for them, an art form. They claim that
such books promote clichés and otherwise uninspired copy. These critics have a
point, but they miss the larger one.
If you work for a boutique ad agency that prizes image and edginess over
bottom-line effectiveness, my Words That Sell books probably aren't for you, But
if you need proven words and phrases that actually motivate customers to bicy, the
color-by-numbers argument becomes irrelevant. It's always nice to win advertising
awards (and I’ve won my share), but it’s even more satisfying to see your words get
results.

INTRODUCTION
Like its predecessor, More Words That Sell does not pretend to be exhaustive.
In the coming months and years, you'll run across plenry of words and phrases that
would have made first-rate entries. When you do, just jot them down under the
appropriate heading and expand the collection. After all,
I want my book to
become your book.

BUSINESS-TO-
re you in the business of doing business with other businesses? [f so, always
A:member that you're still in the businessof reachingindividual people—
the people behind those desks who read your advertising and decide
whether to order your products and services. You're not talking to an institution,
so your language shouldn't sound institutional. Professional, yes—but also warm
and inviting.
Keep in mind that recipients of business advertising are motivated by most of
the same drives as ordinary consumers: they have wants, needs, and fears just like
anyone else. They want to succeed. They want their organization to succeed. They
need to be respected by their colleagues. They fear being left behind. They dread
failure. In short, they're you and me.
This list begins with a basic business advertising vocabulary and then supplies
you with a collection of phrases that I’ve found to be especially effective.

ome words appeal to the head rather than the heart or the gut. Most of the
S= on this extensive list arederived from Latin, and they still projectan
unmistakable whiff of respectability.
I've restricted the list to vocabulary thar a businessperson or professional
might use, so you won't stumble across intellectual gems like otiose or objurgate
here. Perhaps in a future book.
Use these words to fortify your résumé, business correspondence, in-house
reports, and other documents that demand a tone of maturity and competence. If
you're not sure of a word's meaning, be sure to look it up. Impressive words badly
used can subvert the professional image you're trying to create.
The list is arranged alphabetically. You can scan it for five-dollar words to
incorporate into your business writing, Or use it as a glossary (without definitions,
of course) for the purpose of building a solid working vocabulary.
A word of warning: Don’t become too intimate with these words; they're
respectable but not especially lovable. Treat them as colleagues who can help you
in the workplace. Then go home for the day and relax with unpretentious old
friends like swift, swipe, and shuffle.
Note: Don’t make a point of using these words in your advertising copy. In
fact, you might want to go out of your way to avoid most of them. This list is
primarily for professional image building.

CLASSIFIED ADS:.
eed to hire some qualified help for your growing company? Maybe it’s
N
time to write a want ad. You can place an ad in your local paper, in trade
Magazines, on your website, or on some of the more popular job market
sites.
You'll want to say a few words about your organization; the nature of the job;
the professional qualifications you expect; the personal traits you'd like the
applicant to possess; your relaxed (or high-pressure) work environment; the salary
level (at least a hint); and, of course, how you'd like the applicant to contact you.
The trick is to pack all that information into a space the size of an address label.
I’ve assembled some of the most effective words and phrases used by human
resources departments. When you write your ad, put yourself in the shoes of the
porential applicants and see if you'd be motivated to respond. Tweak the ad copy
until the job sounds like an offer you (and they) can’t refuse!
Make your mark.

hat’s this? A section on personal ads in a Serious Advertising
(J riser Absolutely, Who says advertising has to be all business?
The fact is, some of the most effective short ads are written by people
speaking passionately on behalf of themselves, in search of kindred spirits and
elusive chemistry.
If you're unattached and unafraid of personal ads, turn to this section to
describe yourself and the person of your dreams. I’ve omitted all the specialized
interests (jazz, bird-watching, long walks on the beach, etc.) that tend to fill such
ads. (You can fill in the blanks yourself.) But you'll find a smorgasbord of desirable
human traits to choose from. Happy hunting!

M
a property to sell and you want to bypass the middleperson, you'll have to
write your own ad,
I don’t have to tell you that real estate is very expensive and real estate ads are
very brief. That means each word in your ad bears a colossal sales burden, You
have to write a tight ad that manages to cover the essential details and convey the
pleasure of owning the property. Most newspaper staffs will help you to shorten
your ad through tactical abbreviations of longer words, but check in advance to see
if they do,
Sounds like a tough challenge, doesn’t it? The good news is that you don’t have
to close the sale through your ad. You merely have to entice your readers to come
out and visit the property (without creating unrealistic expectations), Then it’s up
to you to close the sale in person.
By the way, if you happen to be a real estate professional, feel free to crib from
this list!

he world glows with a dazzling array of hues that no crayon box could
|
possibly contain, and we've given them an equally dazzling array of names.
This list was a joy to compile, and it’s one of the few in this book that you
can turn to for sheer pleasure on a rainy day. (Try “Flavors,” “Fragrances,” and
“Sexy Words,” roo.)
If you're in the business of marketing products in various colors, use this list
when you need to give those colors appropriate and appealing names. Color names
can be direct or subtly evocative, classic or playful. Be sure to choose a name that
fits the image of your product. (For example, you probably wouldn't want to
market Wedgwood blwe to kids or include bubblegum pink in a catalog of upscale
men’s wear.}
This section begins with a list of prefixes that you can use to modify your
color names. Then we run the gamut of colors through the spectrum from reds to
purples, followed by earth tones, neutrals, and metallic hues.

from indifference and propel them to action. The words in this section will
help you break through the indifference barrier. They're packed with varying
degrees of emotional voltage.
The first few lists are full of positive emotional words. Then we descend into
what looks like a pit of darkness and despair. Don’t shy away from negative words
like pain, heartache, and shame. They're powerful motivators for people who
want to avoid grief in their lives—and who doesn't?
You'll find the negative words especially useful if you're trying to tug at the
heartstrings of prospective charity donors. They'll help you paint a vivid picture
of the dire conditions your organization is trying to correct.

pportunity, convenience, privilege, and trust—those are the four
= of financial advertising. First you appeal to the nearly
universal desire to save or make money—ideally accompanied by visions
of the wonderful things your reader can do with that money. Then stress how easy
it is to do business with your organization—and how the reader will enjoy VIP
treatment after opening an account. Finally, back up your promises with the
assurance that your company is as sound as the Federal Reserve. (If your product
or service involves financial risk, always be up-front about it.)
Whether you're advertising a lending service, a credit card, a stock brokerage
firm, or a financial seminar, you can use this list to pepper your ad with response-
petting phrases. The list begins with key words I’ve culled from the financial
advertising that has found its way into my mailbox, then moves on to more
elaborate phrases.
Note: Sorry, you won't find any phrases here for multilevel marketing schemes.
If you're about to follow that career path, all I can say is, “Turn back!”

ords are miraculous in their ability to evoke sensations. Think about
VV you're looking at a series of black squiggleson a white background.
But when you see a phrase like wood smoke in print, your brain can
trick you into experiencing the memory of a chilly autumn day in your childhood,
Words that evoke fragrances have the power to rouse our senses (and make us
more receptive to the message), You don’t even have to be selling perfume or food
products to harness this power.
This list begins with generic “smell words” and phrases that are descriptive in
nature. The second part of the list bombards you with examples of distinctive
fragrances you can use to make your copy more sensually evocative. I've only
scratched the surface. When you have a free moment or two, you might want to jot
down your own favorite smells,

eoplewho feel sick wantto feel well. That much is obvious. But over the past
P
few decades we've come to expect more from our mortal bodies: people who
already feel well want to feel even better, They want to live to be a hundred
and go to their final reward looking fifty. Baby boomers, especially, tend to be
obsessed with their own well-being (I'm one of them), and they're petting older
every day.
If you have a legitimate product or service that promotes “wellness,” you have
a huge market ready to grab your offer. That's the good news. The bad news is that
you have at least pwo major hurdles to overcome: an abundance of competition and
an almost equal abundance of public skepticism regarding instant cures.
Since half of any cure is in the mind, you'll want your advertising to convey
how it feels to feel well—strong, vibrant, confident, and renewed. Once your
prospects can visualize their own good health, you (and they) are halfway there.
The other half is assuring your audience that you can deliver on your promises,
Feel free to use gentle scare tactics (the dangers of a sedentary life, the specter
of an early demise or an infirm old age) to motivate your readers to respond. But
don’t let the negative outweigh the positive; introduce your product or service as
the proverbial white knight. Make liberal use of testimonials (especially from
recognized experts) to lend extra credibility to your message.

| had to sift through this book and pick out a single list for you to memorize,
this would be it. (Of course, since you have the book, you can simply flip to this
page.) You're looking at the timeless words and phrases that have always
“worked like magic” to win customers and probably always will. As long as
customers are human, these words won't go out of style.
Notice that the words on this list appeal directly to the reader's elemental
needs: a bargain, a flecting opportunity, the urge to belong, the urge to possess, the
pursuit of happiness, and the avoidance of pain. Professional copywriters
(especially direct-marketing copy writers, whose success depends on measurable
results) have been using these words for decades to convert prospects into
customers and keep customers coming back for more. Pay close attention to this
list and use it often.

ost advertising and promotional writingaccentuates thepositive. That's
M
understandable. But don’t overlook the power of negative words and
feelings. These emotionally loaded words and phrases trigger basic
human instincts (like fear, anger, or sympathy) that can drive a response in your
favor,
How do you use negativity to sell? Well, you can always badmouth the
competition (politicians have been doing it for ages). Without naming names, you
can contrast the shoddiness of similar products with the virtues of your own. I've
provided a bundle of words and phrases for that purpose. But there are more
sophisticated strategies for using negativity in advertising. The key is to set up a
nightmare scenario that the reader dreads: financial
hardship,
ill health,
cockroaches in the kitchen sink. Then you point to your product or organization
as the white knight charging to the rescue.
Sift through this compilation of wretchedness and inferiority whenever you
want to harness the unique power of negativity to get your message across. I've
clumped the words into alphabetically arranged categories for easy reference.

ou're looking ar one of the most difficult and rewarding forms of
Y srs. Your prospects have already been bombarded with countless
pleas from other worthy organizations, so you have to make your own plea
stand out from the crowd. On top of that, you have no concrete benefits to offer—
just the warm ripple of satisfaction that comes from making a small but positive
difference in the world. That's your ball, and you have to run with it.
You have an arsenal of strategies at your disposal. Start with a bleak picture of
conditions as they are (or have been in the past), then portray your organization as
the unique bridge between despair and hope, disaster and relief. Always stress the
urgency of the situation. Praise your readers for their concern and generosity.
Emphasize how little you're really asking of them in terms of time and money.
Remind them how much their small contribution can help—whether they're
coming to the aid of impoverished children or endangered grizzly bears. And be
sure to let them know how good it feels to help.
This isn't crass manipulation. [f you believe in the mission of your orga-

of online marketing services. No matter how much of a battering the tech
sector might take (and we all know it has taken plenty), Web commerce is
here to stay. Nearly every business or organization needs its own site to stay viable.
Nearly every site needs expert help from professionals who can design it, optimize
it, and reach customers through E-mail advertising.
When you promote online marketing services, remember that you're creating
business-to-business advertising first and foremost. Emphasize what you can do for
the bottom line of your potential client and how you go about doing it. It’s fine to
impress your audience with a handful of high-tech buzzwords, but the three most
important words to keep in mind are traffic, traffic, traffic! Always subordinate
the tech details to the main message of generating greater revenue for your client.
This list starts with a brief catalog of basic Internet vocabulary to keep in mind
as you write. Then it continues with the most effective phrases I've culled from all
those E-mail messages that have reached my desktop. I’ve even concocted a few of

T= self-improvement movement may have peaked in the late twentieth
century, but people will always feel a need to improve their lot. That means
they’re already receptive to your proposition, at least in theory.
Whether you're trying to sell a book, a seminar, or a personal organizer, what
you need to remember (and remind your readers of) is (1) that so few of us are
using our potential, (2) that it feels absolutely wonderful to achieve things we
didn’t know we could achieve, and (3) that your program or product can help us
achieve them. Always keep your tone warm and positive.
To help people become their best selves is one of the nobler callings in the
world of marketing. I've supplied you with a list of commonly used words and
phrases that ripple with the thrill of self-empowerment. Use them freely, but be
creative as well, Try to combine some of these words into exciting new patterns.
Better yet, see if you cam come up with the next great self-improvement
catchphrase—a fitting heir to Your Erroneous Zones or 7 Habits of Highly

I've collected the most positive-sounding personal qualities and grouped them
inte ten major categories for easy reference. These are the traits employers and
college admissions officials look for when they evaluate applicants. Use these lists
whenever you need to compose a dynamic cover letter, update your résumé, fill out
an application, write a letter of recommendation, or run for office,
Of course, you won't always want to use glowing terms to describe other
people, especially if you're a politician or a journalist. If you feel the need to sling

ome of us have to unlearn what we learned im college. (That's one of the
S
ironies of writing effective advertising copy.) Don's worry—I'm not asking
you to forget about political science, art history, or other worthy subjects.
Instead, you should try to reduce your reliance on the kind of abstract language
you picked up as you were writing all thase term papers.
This section should help you rediscover the power of earthy, tactile words—
the kind of words that bleed if you cut them. Think of Churchill’s “blood, toil,
tears, and sweat.” These physical words summon up visceral responses in the
reader's mind, They help make your message more immediate, more alive, more
likely to break through the reader’s indifference barrier.

oday’s old people were yesterday's young people, You shouldn't feeltheneed

to treat them as relics. They want to enjoy life as much as anyone. And now
that retirement has liberated them from the daily grind, they actually have
the time to indulge their desires, Only two factors might prevent them from doing
so: their health and their finances. No wonder these two concerns loom so large in
most advertising for the senior market.
Put yourself in the shoes of your senior audience before you craft your
message. Old age isn’t for sissies. Your readers face a limited and uncertain future,
but most of them are gritty survivors and they're not ready to roll over. They just
want assurance that you can make life easier for them in some small way.
Note the special concerns of the senior market: staying healthy, active, and
connected; enjoying the security of a steady income; finding a good bargain;
avoiding scams that could drain their resources; discovering new interests to keep
their minds alive; remembering the old days with tenderness; enjoying vacations,
hobbies, socializing, and time with their families; and preparing for the eventual
shift to assisted living.
Treat old people kindly and fairly. Their generation nurtured ours, after all,
and someday we'll be in their shoes.

et’s face it: sex sells. Generations of successful advertisers have enticed us
|
with images that light our inner fires. You can do it with pictures (too easy,
I say) or you can do it with words alone,
Ive shaped this list to include the obvious (#ude and sinful, for example) as
well as more subtly suggestive words (e.g., whisper, blush, and rustle) that I think
are even sexier. The right words, especially those with the right sounds and
mental associations, can work magic on the page—and in the minds of your
readers.
Note: You don't have to be writing about sex (or even sexy products) to use
sexy words. You could be describing fruit baskets or office products. The key is to
use the scintillating verbal imagery of sex to stimulate lust for your products.

(All right, probably most of them look silly.) Bur never underestimate the
importance of sound-related images in bringing your message to life.
Alka-Seltzer scored an unforgettable triumph with its old “Plop-plop, fizz-fizz”
campaign. And Rice Krispies won a permanent spot in the marketing pantheon
with its catchy “snap, crackle, and pop.”
Why do these odd sounds work? Anything that lifts your words off the flat
surface of the page or screen will lift response. The same goes for anything that
makes your message stand out in the reader's (or listener’s) memory. “Sound
words” are both vivid and memorable.
If you're writing a space ad or radio campaign, see if you can find a signature
sound for your product. (Feel free to join two or more sound words in brave new
combinations.) When you write direct-mail or Internet advertising, you can use
these colorful words to add sizzle to the proverbial steak. In other words, sound
words can make your message sing.

elling the public on a magazine (or any other serial publication) can be
SG to a predictable formula. You tantalize your prospects with tasty
nuggets culled from recent issues. You create a sales letter that flarters and
invites your audience. You offer a free (and relevant) gift as well as a price break on
the subscription plus an ironclad guarantee of satisfaction. You includea lift note
from an authority figure to convert the hesitant. You attach (wherever possible)
rave reviews from esteemed publications and individual eminentoes. You insert an
inviting and easy-to-use order form. Piece of cake, right?
Not so fast. What separates inspired subscription advertising from the also-
rans can be boiled down to two basic elements: excitement and imagination, No
formula can help you here; it’s up to you to get excited about your publication and

ech advertising is like tightrope-walking: a fine line between dangerous
extremes. On the one hand, you don't want to sound mundane; you need to
dazzle your readers with the cutting-edge possibilities of your product or
organization. On the other hand, you don’t want to leave your audience in the dust,
dumbfounded and uncomprehending. The true path is a narrow one—the mean
between the extremes.
It helps to know your audience, as it always does in any form of advertising. If
you're speaking directly to information technology professionals, for example, you
can cut loose and fling all manner of buzzwords at their receptive eyes. Lf you're
addressing nontechnical managers or general consumers, it’s best not to get carried
away with technospeak, In either case, remember that the benefits of your glittery
features, not the features themselves, are going to carry the day for you.
This section begins witha list of frequently used tech terms to keep in mind as
you write. The longer phrases that follow should come in handy as you craft your
copy.
Caution: I probably don’t have to remind you that the vocabulary of
technology mutates as rapidly as teenage slang. Today's state-of-the-art buzzword
is tomorrow’s antique. (That goes for “state-of-the-art,” too.) Keep this list updated
by adding new terms as you hear them and crossing off the more dated ones.

IH] ow doyou describe the feel ofa product thatyour readers can’t touch? By
choosing words they can touch.
Maybe your reader can see the product in your catalog photos. Your copy
description helps complete the picture. But you can bring that picture to life by
helping your reader touch the item through your words. How does the product feel
when you hold it? What does its surface remind you of? By describing the texture
of a product, you help the reader experience what it would be like to own it. And
that’s a powerful selling advantage.
The first part of this list is a fairly thorough catalog of textures, from furry to
crunchy to misty. Notice that similar textures are grouped together for easy
searching. The second part of the list helps you compare the texture of your
product to something the reader will instantly recognize. This section is nowhere
close to exhaustive, since the world is full of wondrous and intriguing textures that
remind you of ofber textures. But it should help you get started.

|
upmarket prospects when you're selling expensive and finely crafted
products, Bur this list will also serve you when you need to appeal to the
general reader's class aspirations. Who among us hasn't, at one time or another,
dreamed of leading an aristocratic lifestyle with all the trappings? Even in our
dress-down, post-WASP society, the pursuit of class is still
a powerful motivator.
Notice that I haven't included the word classy on the list. For one, it's too
vague. More important, it’s not an especially classy word. (Think of a 1930s
gangster looking around the room and muttering, “Geez, what a classy joint!")

fnouns are the backbone of yourwriting, verbs provide the muscle. You can't
|
get from here to there without them. We tend ro fall back on a handful of
mundane verbs like fs and get—and that’s fine up to a point. (Get is actually a
highly effective verb in advertising.) But if you really want your copy to crackle,
sparkle, and sing, use strong verbs like crackle, sparkle, and sing.
How do you develop a sense for sniffing out strong verbs? Here's my rule of
thumb: favor earthy Anglo-Saxon verbs over those of Latin origin. Think of eat
versus ingest, or drink versus imbibe. True, many Latin-based verbs are
indispensable (and I've honored them in this list), so don't take my advice to
extremes. But remember that most of our borrowed Latinisms tend to sound more
cerebral and pack less of an emotional punch than our native English words.
A comprehensive listing of verbs could fill an entire book. I've whittled down the
choices for you: just the most useful verbs and verb phrases, clustered into twenty
alphabetically arranged categories for easy selection. Simply scan the categories for
the concept you want, then pick your verb from that list. Happy hunting!

f you think about it, your website is an extended advertisement and branding
|
statement for your organization. It can be a catalog, a direct-response package,
and a corporate image ad all rolled into one. Above all, it’s an interactive ad.
Never before has any medium offered such amazing possibilities for helping your
customers connect with you. Aside from ordering your products, they can learn
about your history, get acquainted with your staff, offer valuable feedback, and
even check for employment opportunities.
This list won't provide you with actual site content. (After all, websites are as
diverse as the companies behind them.) Instead, it includes the phrases you need on
your home page to invite interaction from visitors. Most successful sites use a fairly
standard assortment of clickable hyperlinked phrases for this purpose.
I've visited a few dozen of the most successful sites and captured these phrases
for your use. You'll see some alternate wordings of the same feature; just choose
the one that sounds best to you, Even if your site is already up and running (and
running successfully), you can scan this list for features that might be worth
adding.

rying to reach a young audience? You want your words to crackle with

energy and a dash of irreverence. Today’s youth market is impatient with
low-energy, abstract verbiage and receptive to high-impact, sensory images.
Think of skateboards, video games, and caffeine as you create your message.
The words on this list have been mined from sports, pop music, Internet lingo,
and other sources of youthspeak. But the lexicon of youth is constantly reinventing
itself beyond our radar. Be careful not to use once-trendy expressions that kids
could dismiss with a sniffy “That's so six months ago!”
I've tried co compile words that stand a reasonable chance of survival—at least
for the next six months. (Actually, many of them are older terms that have
established a niche in our language.) You might want to customize this list by
adding cool new phrases as you hear them and crossing off the ones that seem
hopelessly dated,
Caution: Don't pander to the young by overloading your copy with words
from this
list. Instead, use them sparingly to give your message a more
contemporary and youth-friendly feel.

APPENDIX B
Twenty-Five Common Copywriting
Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)
riting copy is like crossing a minefield: so many opportunities for self-
(ees The experienced copywriter knows where most of the
mines are hidden and can usually step around them with grace and skill.
Bur all of us stumble from time to time.
Think of this section as your personal map of the “minefield”—so you can
pinpoint the most treacherous spots, sidestep them, and reach your destination in
one piece. [ begin with common advertising copy blunders, then move on to
general writing pitfalls.
1. Unsuitable tone, Don't assault a mass market audience with words like
egregious, and don’t resort to razzle-dazzle hucksterism with upscale
readers. Try to understand the needs and tastes of the people you're
addressing, and write as if you're one of them—onlya little more
persuasive,
2. Unbelievable claims. Credibility is like a necklace: break the strand at
any point and all the beads go scattering. When you introduce even one
dubious claim into your sales pitch, the thread of credibility snaps and
your readers may reject your entire argument. Always be prepared to
support your claims with irrefutable evidence.
3. Wrong information. Probably the most serious blunder, but also one of
the easiest to fix. Simply check your facts—including product features,
colors, styles, sizes, product numbers, and prices—before you submit
your copy.
145


--- Page 158 ---

APPENDIX
B
4. Conflicting information. You can’t tell your audience to “send no
money” in one paragraph, then promise a full refund in your guarantee.
(After all, you can’t refund money they haven't sent.) Make sure your
copy doesn’t give off mixed messages.
§. Buried information, Don’t lead your audience on a long treasure hunt for
benefits and key facts. Introduce these early and keep developing them, so
you create the motivation your readers need to follow you all the way to
the payoff,
6. Missing information.
7. Self-indulgent copy. One of the cardinal sins of copywriting—and one of
the most tempting. Most of us who write copy enjoy playing with words,
and that’s commendable, But always remember that your writing must
serve the sales pitch, and not vice versa. Use your talents to write clean,
clear prose that motivates the reader. If you still crave self-expression, you
can indulge your literary muse by lamplight when your work is done.
§. Company-indulgent copy. Here the company is the hero, strutting and
posturing like a peacock. Instead of trying to impress your readers, try to
convince them. It’s not “See how great we are,” but “See what we can do
for you.”
9, Excessive throat clearing.
A common malady, especially among letter
writers. Given the deluge of mail the average consumer receives today,
your message should take no more than five to ten seconds of the reader's
time to make its point—or it will surely get tossed. (Letter writers: A
powerful headline or overline message above the salutation takes some of
the pressure off the first paragraph and lets you ease into your sales pitch
with a beguiling anecdote.)
10. Inappropriate humor. While TV and radio advertising have always used
humor to advantage, direct-response advertising ts, for better or worse, a
fundamentally humorless mediuin. (There's little time for horseplay when
you have to close a sale.) You definitely want to avoid puns, jokes, and any
other rib-ticklers of the “Get it? Get it?” variety. On the other hand,
subtle humor can be an effective way to disarm your readers and create
rapport. But gauge your audience first, and tread with caution.
146

TWENTY-FIVE
COMMON
COPYWRITING
PITFALLS
11, No call to action. Direct-response advertising without a call to action is
like a mystery novel without a denouement, a 3—3 baseball game without
a tie-breaking hit, love without marriage. The call to action is what
converts browsing readers into buyers. Unless you remind them to
call/click/drop that card in the mail, they'll just move on to somebody
else’s pasture.
12. Unfocused language. Like a blurred photograph, unfocused copy lacks
detail and clarity. A statement like “We offer stylish clothes” transmits a
lazy, hazy image to the reader. Stylish in what sense? Glamorous? Funky
and outrageous? Classic preppie? Don't just hint at an image and make
your readers do the work. (They won't.) Go the extra step to enhance the
picture and bring it into sharp focus for your audience.
13. Word repetitions within close range. Try to avoid sentences like “These
colorful memos come in a multicolored assortment of six assorted
colors.” Our language has more than enough synonyms to go around,
(Note: When you change one of the words, check the sentences in the
immediate vicinity to make sure you haven't already used it there.)
Deliberate repetitions for emphasis (“The best materials, The best prices.
The best service.”) are perfectly acceptable.
14, Comma between subject and verb. You know the problem: “This solar-
powered calculator, is the greatest invention since the abacus.” It sounds
petty, but little mistakes like this can make your copy look amateurish.
Never use a comma to separate the subject and verb unless you're
marking off a subordinate clause that falls between them. (A fairly good
rule of thumb is to insert a comma only where you'd pause when you read
the sentence aloud.)
15. Subject/verb nonagreement. This one’s obvious, you might think. A man
shaves; men shave. What could be simpler? But watch out for tricky
sentences like the following: “Every one of these unforgettable books
celebrates [not celebrate] the written word.” The verb doesn't
automatically agree with the closest noun; it has to agree with the subject
of the sentence. If the subject is singular (in this case, one), so is the verb.
It’s “Every one... celebrates.”
16. Dangling participles. This all-too-common blunder can produce some
grotesquely comical effects, such as “Driving down the road, your heart
147


--- Page 160 ---

APPENDIX
B
leaps with excitement.” (Let's hope your heart has a driver's license!)
Remember that the participle (in this case, driving) must refer to the
subject of the sentence (/eart). Since hearts don’t drive, you might change
the sentence to read “As you drive down the road, your heart leaps with
excitement.” Or you could keep the participle and change the subject of
the sentence to you: “Driving down the road, you feel a rush of
excitement.”
17, Pile-on prepositional phrases. And now for a word of advice from the
author to writers of copy in the interest of clariry in advertising: please
avoid sentences like this one. Restructure your thoughts and find an
alternate route.
18. Interminably long sentences. Don't write ‘em.
19. Ambiguous modifiers. Beware of adjectives that can modify two words
at once, as in this hypothetical auto supply store's message to its preferred
customers: “Private Parts Sale.” Obviously, it’s the sale that’s private and
not the parts, but the sentence fails to clarify the matter.
20. Misuse of “quotation marks.” We've all seen those hand-painted signs
for “Farm-Fresh” Eggs (or worse yet, Farm-Fresh “Eggs”). Never use
quotation marks for emphasis. (You can use underlines or all caps or
italics, but not quotes.) In this context, quotation marks give the
impression that the enclosed words aren't to be taken literally. (If you
refer to eggs as “eggs,” what are they really?)
21. Confusion of it’s and its. Here’s the distinction: It’s (with an apostrophe)
is
a contraction of if fs. (It’s plain to see, It’s never too late. It’s in the bag.)
When you want it to be possessive, always use its—no apostrophe. (Note
its sleek profile. Feel its rich leather interior.)
| know it seems odd to form
a possessive without an apostrophe, burt that’s the way it is with its.
22, Confusion of you're and your, Same deal here. You're (with apostrophe)
is
a contraction of you are (You're the one for this job). By contrast, your
is always possessive (Your friend wants your job).
23. Passive voice. The voice of weariness and indifference. Sometimes if can't
be avoided, but with a little extra thought, you can avoid it, Use active
verbs and let them carry the sentence.
148

TWENTY-FIVE
COMMON
COPYWRITING
PITFALLS
24. Faulty punctuation of internal phrases and clauses. Some folks have no
respect for punctuation; they'll throw in a comma or leave it out as it suits
them. But keep in mind that punctuation is the reader’s key to sentence
structure and meaning. When you interrupt a sentence with a subordinate
clause or phrase, you mark it off with punctuation—cither a pair of
commas ora
pair of dashes—so the reader knows where the main part of
the sentence stops and where it resumes. Just like that.
25. Ete. Don't force your audience to read your mind, finish your sentences
for you, etc. There are more creative ways to present a partial list of
features. If you're promoting a musical anthology of great singers, for
example, you can write, “The collection spans a full century of recorded
sound, from Caruso to Eminem.” Or wrap upa partial list with “and
these are just a few.” Use etc. only in the tightest nuts-and-bolts catalog
copy. Even then, it creates the impression of sketchiness, laziness,
amateurism, etc.

APPENDIX C
How to Fine-Tune Your Style
et’s face it: advertising is not literature of the highest order. It’s not Moby
|
Dick or The Iliad. Two centuries from now, our work might be dusted off
by an occasional scholar of pop culture, but it’s too much to expect that
anyone will ever read it for pleasure.
But for those of us who write advertising copy, the challenge
is more
immediate: to use words in a manner that persuades a contemporary audience to
part with a portion of its discretionary income. In fact, you might say that
advertising confirms the power of words to move people's minds.
Those words—those raw materials of language—await the deft hand that, like
old Rumpelstiltskin, can spin them into gold. This book supplies you with the raw
materials. How you spin them, though, is just as essential to the success of your
work. And that’s what we mean by style.
Style demands both discipline and imagination, left-brain logic and right-brain
artistry. A successful writing style is like a garden that shifts colors and patterns
with the seasons, but requires a steady hand to guide and nurture it. You can't
create style overnight. Most of us don’t master it even in a lifetime. But witha little
talent, still more work, and a few guidelines like the ones that follow, you can
develop a writing style that serves your all-important message and beguiles your
audience.
* Learn the elements of sentence structure. | will always be indebted to my
sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Umholtz, for instructing us in the art of
diagramming sentences. To dissect what seemed like a random string of
words and discover the underlying structure—subject, predicate, direct
and indirect objects, conjunctions, subordinate clauses, prepositional
1S!

APPENDIX
C
phrases—was a wondrous and eye-opening experience. | heartily
recommend it. Buy yourself a good guide to English grammar and usage
so you can understand the inner workings of our language.
* Put the emphasis on clarity. In advertising, this is possibly even more
important than word magic. Your readers can't act on your offer until they
understand it. And they won't be able to understand it unless you explain
it to them clearly. Seasoned copywriters will always swallow their pride
and opt for clarity over creative expression.
* Use colorful words to energize your copy. Make a habit of combing your
copy and substituting colorful words for limp or fuzzy ones. (This book
should be able to help you in that department.) Short, lean, gritty native
English words (like short, lean, and gritty) still pack a wallop. Words
derived trom Latin and Greek (such as efficient, productive, and
harmonious} tend to sound more abstract and cerebral, Favor the native
English vocabulary when you want to create a dramatic impression. Turn
to our Greco-Latin heritage when you strive for erudition and precision.
* Be aware of rhythm. Vary your sentence structure to createa lively,
flowing movement that carries the reader effortlessly downstream. Use
dashes here and there to introduce exciting shifts and turns. For dramatic
impact, follow a long sentence with a short, taut one. Or inject an
occasional sentence fragment. For emphasis. Copy rhythm is an intuitive
matter, so it’s not easy to learn (or teach). Like jazz, it’s something you
have to feel.
* Watch for “stoppers.” Avoid words or phrases that make the reader
ponder, hesitate, backtrack, or otherwise retreat from the message, A
stopper temporarily breaks the writer’s bold on the reader, and that can be
fatal—especially in advertising. So, in the interest of clarity and
readability, be on the lookout for stoppers and banish them from your
copy.
« Favor the specific over the general. Most stand-up comics would agree
that New Jersey is funnier and more evocative than a Middle Atlantic
state, The more specific you can make your language, the more impact it
will have. I can't overemphasize the importance of creating sharp, well-
defined images in the reader's mind.
152

HOW
TO
FIWE-TUNE
YOUR
STYLE
* Govern the flow of your copy. Tight copy works best in tight places (like
catalogs), but it can make letters a chore to read. On the other hand, free-
flowing copy can work wonders in letters, but you'll want to cut the
verbiage where space is at a premium. Whether tight or flowing, all copy
should be economical: don’t use more words than you need to create your
effect.
* Adapt your style to the product and audience. Use a traditional upscale
voice to sell fine jewelry. Adopt a warm, earnest, and slightly outraged
tone when you promote a charity. If you're advertising video games,
turbocharge your copy to reach the mind of a teenage male. For women’s
beauty products, slip into something more sensuous. Language is
wonderfully supple, and you can bend it to appeal to the desires of your
audience.
* Maintain consistency of voice within a single piece. In other words,
don’t launch a sales letter with a folksy anecdote and then switch to a tone
of steely, gray-suited determination. Your audience is more aware of your
image than you think. Some experts will tell you that all the copy you
write for a given company should have the same tone. But you don't have
to be that rigid. A newsletter shouldn't sound like a sales letter, and a sales
letter shouldn't read like a brochure, Still, keep this in mind: when you do
adjust your voice, try to sound like the same person in a different mood.
* Read your mail. Here's an opportunity for a little free education. Go
through your unsolicited correspondence (we don’t dare call it junk mail}
and pick out the offers that catch your attention. First read them as a
consumer and see if you're tempted to buy. Then review the same pieces
critically and try to determine what evoked—or failed to evoke—a
positive response. It's worth noting that the most effective pieces aren't
always the most eloquently written.
* Read widely. Don't limit your critical reading to ads and professional
literature. Dip into the collected works of noted essayists and journalists.
Browse through highbrow and mass market magazines—and note the
differences in style. Read an occasional novel or short story with a critical
eye. Check out a variety of websites for writing styles that seem to hit the
mark. And don’t confine your explorations to writers of the moment. The
great authors of the past won't necessarily serve as models for crisp,
153

C€
contemporary advertising copy, but they'll fill you with awe and
enthusiasm for the rich possibilities of language.
* Know when to break the rules—and when not to. Sometimes you're
entitled to take a break from the discipline of nuts-and-bolts, benefits-
oriented advertising. When the image of a product is more important than
what the product can do (think of fragrances or teen fashions), the main
benefit is the aura of class or coolness or sexiness your product will confer
on the consumer. Then you can romance your image until it wafts from
the page (or screen) like some rare and costly perfume. But if your
customers lock to you for solutions to specific problems, your copy should
offer those solutions—not mere images.

APPENDIX D
Online Copy: A Brief but
Marginally Useful Primer
Banner Ads. Miniature electronic billboards that blink, flash, display cutting-
edge animation, and entice the Web surfer to click (with a convenient link to
your site, of course),
The infamous Internet bubble-burst deflated the banner ad market like a leaky tire.
Don't abandon hope, though; banner ads aren't dead just yet. They have plenty of
detractors, but you should consider using these highly visible miniature ads to
make your initial contact with potential customers. A good banner ad will create
instant awareness of your site, and you can select a targeted plan that shows your
ad only to prospects who click on related subjects.
When you write a banner ad, keep it brief and make it snappy. Include the
command “Click Here” at the bottom of the banner, even though it seems
obvious—that's your call to action. Display your Web address as well, just to
impress it into the visitor's consciousness with repeat viewings, That doesn't leave
you much room for copy. But animated banner ads can give you two or three shots
at saying something memorable.
Customers who respond to your ad will be receptive to your subsequent E-mail
offers and/or newsletters. There's no better way to gather names for opt-in
mailings (as opposed to unsolicited spam). That's the polite way to do business
online.
Compare the different payment plans for banner ads, estimate a 2 percent
click-through response, and measure the cost of driving a customer to your site
against the anticipated lifetime value of that customer. If you have any doubts,
remember that there are less expensive ways to find customers.
155


--- Page 168 ---

APPENDIX
D
E-Mail Newsletters. One of the most effective and inexpensive media ever
developed for nurturing a relationship with your customers.
I don’t think I’m overstating the case for E-mail newsletters. You're providing
informative content your customers look forward to reading, and you can relax
into a chatty, offbeat, low-pressure style of communication that you can’t afford
to try in your catalogs or direct-mail packages.
Your offers appear almost incidental to the newsletter content—but they're
still prominently displayed and linked to your site. Best of all, the customer who
has been engrossed in your newsletter will be far more receptive to your ad than
someone you've just dragged in from cyberspace.
You can easily personalize your newsletters, test different offers, and gain new
readers through customer referrals. Sounds almost too good to be true, doesn’t it?
The challenge is to keep coming up with interesting new content in each issue.
(Somebody has to find the time to sit down and do the actual writing.) At my
previous company, we used to invite readers to submit their own “true tales” about
their experiences with our products. These stories turned out to have tremendous
entertainment value, and they made my writing job @ Jot easier.
Invite your customers to contribute content to your newsletter. You might even
approach some of the rising stars in your field to write occasional articles at no
charge. If your circulation is impressive enough, they'll do it for the free career
publicity (and a link to their own site).
E-Mail Sales Letters. The last refuge of long copy in the electronic age.
Pay no attention to the experts who caution you against lengthy online messages.
A well-crafted sales letter is the exception to the rule. Everyone loves a good story
told with gusto—especially if it clearly leads to some tangible benefits.
Granted, today’s video-conditioned prospects tend to skim more than they
read, But if you can snag your readers with a compelling (and truthful) subject line,
an irresistible offer, and a magnetic message, they're yours for the duration, Try to
make the body of your letter as informative and involving as possible; an
unrelieved sales pitch won't work online any more than it does on paper.
E-mail sales letters offer a few improvements over the old-fashioned paper-
and-ink variety. They're cheap to create. You don’t have to pay for postage. They
can link directly to the offer page on your site, (What better response vehicle could
you imagine?) And think of all the innocent trees you'll be saving.

BUT
MARGINALLY
USEFUL
PRIMER
True, you have to overcome the spam resistance so prevalent among online
prospects and even “smart” E-mail programs like Microsoft Outlook (which
automatically classifies ad messages as spam), Your response rate probably won't
match what you could achieve with a mailed package. But if you weigh that lower
response rate against the vast extra quantities you can mail at virtually no cost, you
still come out ahead.
If you have qualms about sending unsolicited E-mail, gather your own list of
prospects who click on your banner ads or register at your site. You won't have to
worry about the spam police, and your response rate should skyrocket.
E-Mail Subject Lines. The verbal nudge that prompts the recipient to open
your E-mail message.
So many of these “grabbers” are blatant (and willfully deceptive) come-ons that
they've probably damaged the credibility of E-mail advertising for the next
generation. I wish I had saved a few dozen of the more preposterous subject lines
I've read over the years—greetings like “I tried to call you last night,” “I'm hot for
you, baby,” and, of course, “Here’s the information you requested.” {Yeah, right.)
These unsavory mountebanks have their reasons for trying to sneak in under
the radar. After all, most of us delete obvious advertising E-mails before we even
open them. (You know the problem: spam, spam, spam, spam!) These online
advertisers feel they have to disguise their E-mails as personal correspondence. To
me, that’s a sign of desperation.
I challenge you to create an E-mail subject line that sings to the reader but
doesn't conceal its purpose. Think carefully, use words frugally, make your
message original and irresistible—but keep it honest. (You can make it a benefit,
an offer, or a personal invitation—as long as it relates to the content of your E-
mail.)
After all, if your subject line is revealed as a sham after the reader opens the
E-mail and skims the first few lines, you can be sure your prospect will delete your
brainchild forthwith. You may have gained a name for your list, but you've lost a
customer,
Pop-Up Ads. Pesky messages that materialize from out of nowhere when you
click on a link.
Everybody hates ‘em, Nobody reads ‘em. Don’t create ‘em. “Nuff said.

Press Releases. Self-generated news articles that could generate free publicity
for your product, comparry, or site.
You can write your own electronic press releases and E-mail them to selected
media addresses that you've looked up and targeted. Or you can use the services of
an online promoter and pay to have it written and/or E-mailed to the right places.
Some of these companies claim to have more clout than you when it comes to
getting your story placed. I'd be a bit skeptical, but it couldn't hurt to look into
established services like Business Wire or PR Newswire.
If you write your own release, the first point to remember is that your story
must sound like news. The editor who reads it is looking for story material, and an
overzealous puff piece won't cut it.
Use the traditional “inverted pyramid” approach to writing your story:
important information at the top, less important information toward the bottom.
Online press releases tend to be shorter than the printed variety—two-thirds of a
page is typical. Make your points quickly and forcefully, and let the editor round
out your press release into a full-bodied story.
A press release that hits the mark can find its way into print magazines and
newspapers as well as online news media, The results can drive your traffic into the
stratosphere with virtually no expenditure on your part. If at first you don't
succeed, try again. And again. And again. You have nothing to lose.
Web Copy. Your booth at that great desktop bazaar known as the World Wide
Web.
What a gift the Web has turned out to be! Companies can set up shop and
broadcast their wares at minimal cost. Customers can zero in on just the products
and services that interest them—without having to sift through a hefty catalog and
without ever budging from their desks, And they can reach you twenty-four hours
a day, every day of the year (including weekends and holidays).
During the early heyday of the Web in the 1990s, site design seemed to focus
on bells and whistles as much as content. Everyone competed to see who could
create the coolest and most innovative site. Now that the dust has cleared, it’s
obvious that you need compelling content (as well as easy navigation) to keep your
visitors coming back for more.
Write for an impatient audience; reader boredom is fatal. Keep your sentences
relatively short and muscular, especially on the home page, Use enough subheads

to aid rapid scanning, but not so many that you clutter the screen with them. Make
your graphics serve the copy and not vice versa.
The Web is a visual medium, but it’s primarily a written one. Yet somewhere
along the way, the idea of a distinctive company “voice"—such a powerful factor
in print advertising and catalogs—seems to have been lost in the shuffle. 5o many
company sites come across as bland and institutional, almost interchangeable. The
writing seems to have been created by committee.
The Web phrases I’ve provided in this book will help you add useful features
to your site and call attention to them. But you have to breathe life into your site
through what you write. If you want your site to become a traffic magnet, make
sure you write it with heart, personality, and conviction. Know who you are, and
don't try to sound like everyone else. Think of your site not only as an electronic
store, but as the ultimate tool for creating a recognizable brand personality that
stands out from the competition.
