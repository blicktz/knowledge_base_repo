Today we will be going over a $100 and a $100,000 Facebook ad which means that these ads have spent $100 and one has spent $100,000 and as y'all know we do like the dynamic testing structure where you know the more ads spend the better and the lower the ad spend the worse the ad is so hopefully you'll get a good idea of what a bad ad looks like and what a really good ad looks like to get a you know reward of $100,000 in ad spend so with that being said let's dive right into the $100 ad so here we go we have the $100 ad right here um actually it's been about $200 but you know don't hate me um so we're gonna go over this one first and as you said a thousand ten thousand and hundred thousand dollar ad that we will go over in this video all within the same time range as well so that being said let's take a look at the $100 ad so let's go looks about how amazing being retired is but I found myself with so much free time I didn't know what to do with that I was feeling constantly bored and unproductive my friends suggested getting a new hobby so I did some googling and a site called Simple Painting caught my attention this is my favorite past time ever it's so addicting and I love watching my artwork come to life I'm really proud of these beautiful pieces I've created maybe even become conversation starters when I have guests over these paint by number kits have made my retirement so much more fulfilling and exciting if you're like me and you need something else to fill your time I highly recommend giving this a try okay so let's watch this video one more time so first thing we're going after in this ad right here is we're talking about uh retirement we're obviously talking about an older person here because you know just a person um we're going after someone is retired um one thing I would say from this is that you know it just did really have that like pop and you'll see in the hundred thousand dollar ad how much different it is we spent way too long here in the oh I have this problem da da da just kind of talking about it people don't care people do not give a fuck about how you're bored and unproductive and stuff like that like people just don't care about this now if I just said maybe everyone talks about how amazing being retired is again that's not really like a major problem but maybe if I start off with a hook that was a little bit more like hey ever since I retired I've been bored until I found this and then go straight into the product around like two three seconds in so like one scene hey ever since I've been retired I've been bored until I found this then three seconds in I can start shifting over into the product itself and what that product is so without further ado let's go to the thousand dollar ad and see how things start to change here so this one right here spent 1042 dollars um actually has the best cost per purchase out of all of these ads and the one we just reviewed had a 35 cost per purchase this one had a 16 cost per purchase so a little bit better um but not good enough to appeal to our mass market that's why I didn't get a lot of spin so let's watch this video okay cool so this was the thousand dollar ad um you'll notice a couple things number one we're also going after kind of like a younger audience in this one as you can see the girl just looks a bit younger uh two the visuals are substantially better just visually more appealing than the other one a lot more eye candy that's what you can say with the saturated colors this cool little area and stuff like that but I think one thing that we're going after is how to romanticize your life this summer we're going after the desire to romanticize your life um I don't really know what that means to be fair now like maybe if it's like how to become more romantic with your significant other how to increase your love life with the other person maybe something like that but I don't think anyone's really going around with how to romanticize your life this summer you know I really want to romanticize it like what does that mean to be fair um I don't know what the fuck that means so I think that's one of the reasons why this guy didn't really get that much spin and didn't win at scale but the couple things that did improve this is the visuals the visuals looked really good uh if I were to recreate this ad what I would do is I definitely would just simply just test the hooks on this um to make it a little bit better so but yeah now without further ado let's go to the $10,000 ad so this one actually spent $8,800 I didn't exactly have a 10,000 on the dots but pretty close um and it had a $21 cost per acquisition now you can see cost per acquisition is a little bit higher but it drove 419 purchases versus the other one again I don't control the spin at all on these I just put them in the same campaign and let Facebook spin on which one's going to work the best at scale so without further ado let's take a look at that $10,000 Facebook ad creative okay cool so a couple things here number one you'll notice create an intimate and memorable date night this weekend notice how the hook is a lot more clear on exactly what they're getting like this is something that's a little bit more of a desire across the marketplace versus everyone talks about how being retired is all fun blah blah like I don't really care then all the one which was a little bit better it was invoking some curiosity of you know like romanticize your life this summer but no one knows what the fuck romanticize is but this one create an intimate and memorable date night this weekend that's good right there especially people who've gone on a lot of dates and they're looking for new ideas so we're also introducing a new mechanism right we're going after the desire for a memorable and intimate date night and then we're introducing a new mechanism a new way to gain that desire which is our product and we're doing a really good job here at calling out the desire and introducing that new mechanism that people want visuals also look really good we're showcasing like two people using the product we're showcasing like wine and all the good things right there just a very good ad in general I really like this ad a lot now now that we've gone over the ten thousand dollar ad let's go over the one hundred thousand dollar ad and I'm really curious of which you guys are going to think about this one right here so without further ado let's go into it this is for my girlies who need a girls night soon I recently did this on my last girls night and we have become obsessed I ordered us some paint by numbers kits from simple painting and we loved it it comes with everything you need minus a bottle of wine it's perfect for sitting down relaxing and chatting I am obsessed with all of the options they have to choose from this has now become our new tradition thanks to simple painting.com and there we go and that is a hundred thousand dollar ad so let's go over this so hook starts off with this is my girlies who need a girls night soon I've already broken this ad down a couple dozen times on this channel but just to go over that again we're targeting one a lot more specific of an avatar here you know the other one was like created memorable date night this weekend but is this for guys is this for girls is this for guys to give to girls is this girls to give to guys like there's a lot of just kind of like lack of clarity there this one's very specific this is for girlies who need a girls night suit very specific type of thing and then same thing like the date night we're introducing a new mechanism for the desire of girls night we're introducing a new way to make it fun because there's no other a person that's positioning this as a girls night activity that's number one number two we're showing the product and use again that's pretty cool we're showcasing like girls you know unboxing it which also increases just that little trust factor right there even though that was not a long clip at all and then we're showing more visuals also key thing you'll notice is how all of these have different visuals even though they're different scripts they're in similar visuals they're all different visuals which keeps it new and entertaining for the account as well but yeah pretty solid right here so that was a $100,000 ad and as you can see right here spent $100,000 had a $19 cost for acquisition also had a very low CPM relative to the others which shows me this ad was really good at reaching and resonating with a large audience pool of people yeah it reached about 8 million people relative to these and again these all were in the same campaign all targeting exactly the same audience the only thing different was the creatives and yes this one had a higher cost per purchase $19 than this $16 one but this one the reason why it got substantially more spin and not this one is because this one resonated with more people and that's what a lot of people think if I put $100,000 on this ad right here this would probably be a $50 to $60 cost per purchase why because it doesn't resonate with a large group of people how do I know that Facebook's not spending a large portion of the budget on it and I trust Facebook at the end of the day so hope you all enjoyed this video let me know which one
