Oh Alrighty guys, it's been a few hours now actually since I recorded those clips this morning of eating breakfast About to finish the last hour of my four-hour work block right now. I Got a lot of stuff done got some calls booked for the agency got a few new messages opening our message conversations opened up with potential prospects overall good solid start to the day Currently spending a little time doing some thinking time and basically I'm just kind of going over a few things in terms of the agency and our ideal client I feel like when I first started off with this agency game I was going after every single type of business and over the last three four months I've really narrowed down my focus to helping one specific type of business and that's clothing brands just because we've generated some Massive results for one particular clothing brand. We've really been able to Study the consumer psychology of people why they buy clothes etc whole bunch of stuff around clothing brands And I feel like there's not a lot of people actually going after clothing brand clients or at least it's between that and also to we'd love working with those type of clients so right now, I'm just kind of going over and Really digging deep into the psychology Another standing of these clothing brand owners and trying to pinpoint some more pain points They're having some problems maybe unanswered questions They have some roadblocks and even some showing them like what type of results they want to get We do have like we talked to the clothing brand few weeks ago.

They want to double their business in a year Whereas we at we literally 10x the business in a year not even to next over 10x the business business was doing 50k a month and we I mean we took that business and did 850,000 in revenue in the last six months, so There's a lot we can do we can offer in terms of that and right now. I'm just kind of really fine tuning my I I guess you could say just all the data have on these owners because the more data you have on them the more data you can kind of use and handling objections as well as issuing and pitching them results, etc We're finally finished our work blog for the day. I'm gonna finally head out now.

We're actually gonna go to Kennedy's and Get out the house for a little bit and bring her some Chicken fettuccine I cooked last night.
