Yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel Nick Terrio here and today I got a brand new video for you guys on how to calculate break-even ROAS this is extremely important if you are running any type of paid advertising whether it's Facebook ads Google ads Twitter ads TikTok ads even using influencers with Instagram break-even ROAS is important because it's basically the point of which you are break even on adsmen and too many people I hop on consulting calls with have no clue what break-even ROAS is and it's starting to worry me so I wanted to create this video real quick to educate you guys on break-even ROAS because it's an important goal to hit with your paid advertising so that way anything you make above break-even ROAS is your profit so let's hop into this video and I'm gonna show you guys exactly how to calculate your break-even ROAS okay so now with that we're in the ads managers is pretty much what you're probably looking at inside your ads manager you have a few campaigns running and stuff you're probably using like some default column setup and stuff and that's actually probably one of the biggest mistakes you'll firstly make reason behind is because there's no way to look at ROAS and cool thing about Facebook is it has a calculator for ROAS so go right there and we're gonna edit these columns I'm gonna type in simply ROAS there we go the total and we're gonna scroll down I like to turn off I like to turn off website purchase ROAS where it's just ROAS and apply and there we go so we see for today for this ad account we had a 1.84 ROAS so now that we have this number we need to determine two things are we profitable yes but by how much you know are we barely break even we break even right there at 4.39 and we're making just a little bit of profit like super small or we break even like 1.6 and like 4.4 it's absolutely amazing and just a keynote most e-commerce brands are break even around 1.6 1.8 but we're gonna actually do the calculations so we make sure because I have one ad account that's break even at 2.5 so let me show you guys real quick how to calculate break even ROAS and this sheet right here will be available for download in the video in the description below so to calculate break even ROAS the first thing you want to do is take your sell price so how much you're selling an item for and then you want to figure out the cost of goods so let's say 40 bucks you're selling it for 100 bucks it costs 40 bucks for the goods we're not worried about like all the other stuff like oh we're gonna pay like 30 bucks a month for my Shopify fee or you know I'm hosting you know a fulfillment center and it's like ten thousand dollars a month where they were talking about just a cost of goods and then we want the profit margin so or the profit itself so let's do that you literally take a hundred dollars subtracted by cost of goods which is 40 bucks and that is your profit now that you know your profit we need to convert that over into your profit margin which is just simply a percentage so you literally take 60 divided by 100 which is again sell price and profit so profit minus or divided by sell price equals point six or 60 profit margin so your gross profit margin 60 percent now what you want to do is you want to divide your profit margin by one so simple way to do that literally just do one divided by and you're going to take this number it is point six and it's going to give you a break-even ROAS of 1.6 so let's just run some other numbers for you so let's say if you have a hundred dollars sale price and it's eighty dollars to fulfill that product so you have a twenty dollar profit so let's do one twenty divided by a hundred you make make twenty bucks every time you sell a hundred dollar item uh you would do one divided by a point two that's five it's a five x ROAS which is absolutely insane just to make a quick note I have had people reach out to me with a twenty percent gross profit margin uh for their products and it's just like no there's no way we can create something together but you know it just it's hard it's hard to hit that um so now we know our 1.6 breakeven ROAS we have two options do we are we profitable yes we're very profitable for this side account and the next thing is by how much so for this side account we're doing I mean double almost triple our break-even ROAS so we're definitely doing good because let's say if you have a 1.6 break-even ROAS and we're hitting 1.7 so yes we're profitable by a little bit uh but there's still some room for improvement now that you have your break-even ROAS you simply want to go back inside your ad account you want to kill the unprofitable ad campaigns uh sometimes what I like to do is I like to be break-even at top of funnel because we spending thousands of dollars a day and then I make all my money back in the back in the retargeting so my middle of funnel campaigns my abandoned cart campaigns and my bottom of funnel campaigns will see like a 10 to 12x ROAS but I hope this video helps you out guys make better judgments when running ad campaigns and using your break-even ROAS as simply kind of a guide to where you want to be again you never want to be unprofitable in ads at least you want to be as break-even so that way it's not costing you anything in the back end but you definitely want to be continuously improving your ROAS over time so that way you're doing 3-4x ROAS which is kind of like the industry average right now for e-commerce if you are an e-commerce store owner and you're doing at least ten thousand dollars per month in revenue and you would like to hop on a call with me um yes me not just someone else um we can discuss your ad account and give you kind of like a free consultation consultation of
