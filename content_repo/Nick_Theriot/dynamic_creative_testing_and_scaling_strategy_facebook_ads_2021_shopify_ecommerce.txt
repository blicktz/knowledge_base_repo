yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel nick terrio here and today i have a new video that's going to show you my scaling strategy for 2021 with facebook ads this is perfect for people who are just starting out with facebook ads or for brands existing brands that just need kind of like a revamp to their ad account so this is going to be a very important video especially if you want to scale facebook ads in 2021 and really generate some amazing results we've used this strategy recently on a new account and we generated a 3x return on ad spend in less than 14 days with using this strategy before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day around facebook ads and shopify e-commerce and soon to come some tick tock and snapchat ads as we've been kind of in the background lately creating this massive case study using these two platforms and i'm really excited to start sharing with you guys uh some more information around those so that being said let's get started so i want to i want to show you all first the ads manager really quick to show y'all what we did for this particular campaign so again this is the campaign right here this is the one we're going to focus on um just refresh the screen just to show y'all this is all real um so this particular campaign right here we took on this brand new ad account and we needed a way to quit to test a lot of new variables and new audiences and stuff like that now we took this account where is this the only campaign running and we launched it and was able to get you know some really good results within just a few days and then i'm gonna show you guys this campaign in a second but this is the one i want to focus on right here first and everything that goes into it so when we took on this ad account again problem new ad account for agency little to no proven variables of what works we only had we had a small spin only 100 to 200 per day so we needed to test a lot of new variables quickly and efficiently so our solution was to use an abo campaign which basically you control the budget at the ad set if you're not familiar with that so we can test a lot of different audiences and make sure we have equal spin amongst all of them to really see which one stands out from the crowd and then we wanted to use a dynamic creative so that way we can just load in a variety of ad angles creatives headlines to just let the algorithm take all of this in and figure out what works best for us so that was our solution so step number one is you want to do your ad planning so before we even get inside the ads manager the first thing we want to do is start doing our ad copy our headlines getting our images and videos we want to use for the particular account so what you want to do is you want to create five different headlines make sure these are completely different headlines and for all of these variables make sure they're completely different so that way you can maximize the testing efficiency so next one five images and videos you maybe split this in half do three images two videos and again focus on different ones you know first one may be a boxing video of the product another one could be an influencer holding the product endorsing it another one could just be a close-up video angle of it one can be a flat lay image another one can be an image lifestyle image where a person's being used outside you know whatever product you're promoting so focus on five completely different images and videos with different things in each one of those next one is five body copy variations and again completely different all five of them i even put down some different ad angles you can use right here so one focus specifically on the pain points another one focus specifically on the benefits another one's focused on social proof so social proof could be an influencer a testimonial influence influencer you know going ahead and endorsing the product ease of use just literally in plain words describe how this product is used how easy it is to use how you can quickly grab it now special offers risk removal and then lastly like a save time or money so if your product saves time or money create a whole adding around that so so use these to create body copy images and headlines so that way you have i think it's what like five times five times five so we have 125 different variations for giving facebook to choose what works best now what you want to do is you want to set up a conversion campaign so standard website conversion campaign with a purchase objective so we're going to optimize all these for purchases even though if it's even if it's a brand new ad account that like i said just brand new um with zero purchase data and then what you want to do is you want to identify you can either do five to ten different ad sets which will you know make this different and you want to start them each at twenty dollars per day at minimum and when you're creating those campaigns or creating those ad sets you want to make sure you turn on dynamic creative right here now what i would highly recommend is creating just one and then you're going to load in all of your images slash videos all of your texts and all of your headlines that's how you're going to set up a dynamic creative so i'd highly recommend setting up one audience setting up all those ads in it and then just simply duplicating that ad set so when you duplicate that ad set you could simply go ahead and just add in your interests your look likes and you want to do one interest or one look like per ad set and you want to do one ad set completely broad so just just location age and gender that's it so usa female 25 35 and interest beauty products look like purchase 30 days la one percent so you want to set all this up to where it's allow you to test a lot of variables at once with you know image creative and audiences as well now what you want to do is you want to run this campaign for about three to seven days depending on your budget so a lot of these variables or budget so i recommend seven days to get you the most data but some people just cannot afford that especially if you have to run it at a minimum of twenty dollars per day then you know that's starting off you know 100 not 100 100 a day for seven days that's 700 so some people can only afford 300 so seven days can get you the most data but i can understand if you can only do it like three days now what you want to do is you want to break down to identify best performing variables so if we go right here and you select one of these ad sets click on breakdown by dynamic creative element and you can actually select and view different particular variables you're testing so let's just say to image or video you know we loaded in those images and videos now we can see which ones generated the best roi for us and i recommend looking at all of the ad sets and really figuring out the common ones the ones that perform from time and time again across these audiences so we can make the best educated decision so again let's do headline and there you go you can literally go through the headlines right there so you want to identify the best performing variables create a google doc and you know list out two or three different body copies that worked two to three different headlines you know two three different images you know just the top performing one the best performing ones that clearly stand out from the crowd and also had enough spin to it you don't want to like click on one that one penny and it got a purchase by luck you know you want one that's been had some spin to it has had a few purchases you want to look at the ones that can really be scaled not just one that got one lucky sale now what you want to do is you want to increase the spin on the winning ad sets by 20 20 once per day and you want to cut off the losing ad sets after you know three to seven days days if you run it for three days and see nothing then look at your ads carts look at your initiate checkouts look at your landing page views and make sure all of those are populating and then you can try to you can cut it off by some of the soft stats so we can really focus on the major ones because sometimes the creatives the angles everything you put into it just weren't good and that's all you have to do is re-pivot redo it again now next thing is scaling so what you want to do is you want to take those winning performing those best performing creatives and stuff and you want to create a cbo campaign at a hundred dollars per day and you want to duplicate the winning ad sets or copy those winning audiences and put them put them into new ad sets inside the cbo campaigns say if you're purchased 30 today and your open broads targeting is the winners you want to create two ad sets each with one of those audiences inside your cbo campaign and then you want to create new ads with winning variables and then again you want to increase spend by 20 once per day kpis are being hit and usually this campaign will take up to a week before it really starts reforming so if you duplicate everything you see row ashtraw for that particular campaign then it's okay just give it a few days it's going to work just give it some time so we've been seeing cbo campaigns take a lot longer like up to seven days before it's fully optimized and then step number five is setting up the testing campaigns so once you start moving over to the cbo scaling campaign you're pretty much never going to set up a dynamic campaign again we use dynamic campaign just for an initial launch and then ongoing we're going to have a creative testing campaign to keep testing creatives in the background that's non-dynamic and then we have an audience campaign where we're going to keep testing audiences in the background as well and we're going to keep pushing those into the scaling campaign as we have proven winners so that way we can just keep pushing more budgets that scaling campaign and we're giving facebook enough variables that's proven and works already so that way we can scale efficiently and add a great return on ad spend so i hope you guys enjoyed this video this is a pretty cool video to make i think this is really really powerful for a lot of people to really go out there and test a lot because i know for us looking through accounts whether it's new clients we're taking on or just doing consulting calls the biggest thing we see is from time to time again not enough audiences not enough creatives and stuff like that are being tested so this kind of forces you to test a lot of new things you throw facebook a lot of different things and then you can go out there test a lot of stuff get some good variables back of what works and then you can keep building on what works and then you can also scale up what works which is exactly what you do with facebook ads so um hopefully this strategy brings some value to you guys it works really well inside of our agency it's our go-to for every new account we take on even if they have a strong prior history of advertising we like to launch this strategy so that way you can restructure your ad account we kind of rebuild things um and it works really well even if you have a brand new ad account you're just starting today you have zero spin you can launch this and you know again it works works really well so i hope you guys give this a try let me know how it works for you in the
