The U.S. economy was officially entered a recession at the beginning of Q3 of 2022 after following two consecutive quarters of an economy shrinking in terms of overall performance. And what does this mean for Facebook advertisers?

What does this mean for online e-commerce and everything like that? Today, I hopefully help you share my opinion and kind of my thoughts on this whole thing, as I am no economist or, you know, economics person. But at least, you know, share my kind of mental frame with you guys of what I'm thinking going into this.

So before we get started, if you don't know who I am, my name is Nick Terrio. I am a Facebook ads media buyer agency, all that fun stuff like that. I share all my knowledge with you guys on YouTube with one day getting the opportunity to work with my agency.

I'm not selling a course or anything like that. I've done over $25 million in online sales with Facebook ads just in the last two and a half years. So, yeah, so that's basically what I do come from my credible background.

And with that being said, let's dive into the video. So going into like what a recession is specifically. So all the recession is is basically means that, you know, as the U.S.

economy has been growing month over month over month or quarter over quarter. This just basically means that we went to two quarters of negative growth. So we shrunk and, you know, constraint, something like that.

We shrunk a little bit. OK, that's all that happened. All right.

And we announced it beginning of Q3 going into, you know, was it like June, June, July, July, going into July. Officially announced we're going to recession. Now, what does that mean for the market business owners and, you know, e-commerce agencies, things like that?

So just looking at it from what it is, it's basically means there's going to be less money in the market. Some people will lose their job. There's already been a few companies, not many, that's like dropped like their bottom 10 percent of people or bottom 20 percent of their employees.

But nothing crazy. And we still haven't seen the large chain reaction that really makes this whole bubble burst in that perspective right there. It actually has been quite chill in that sense right there as it hasn't been too hectic or too crazy yet.

Usually a chain reaction starts when a lot of large companies like huge like Ford, Chevrolet, Dell, Microsoft, like even bigger, like mass banks and things like that. Large, large, multibillion dollar companies that let off a ton of their employees all at once. That usually creates a large panic in the market, which takes people.

They really pull back their funds tremendously. OK, so usually what they do is they first cut off anything that's unnecessary. So when it comes down to unnecessary, this also comes down to.

All right. You guys are watching now that run e-commerce businesses, Legion business, info product businesses and, you know, anything else, apps, yada, yada, yada. OK, if people are cutting out unnecessary things, you I don't know where your business falls at.

And that's the first thing you have to determine is your business, you know, considered a necessary product. You know, for example, right here, we have I can give you four or, you know, yeah, three different brands. OK, three different brands that we currently run ads for.

One of them is a metal sign brand that is purely a feel good, look good type of product. OK, there's absolutely no benefit for having this specific product. OK, that type of product right there is going to take a really big hit.

OK, we have another brand that sells supplements and these supplements provide, you know, they're caffeine, caffeine free alternative. So people want to get off caffeine. They make you think better.

They make you think more clear, a lot more focused and getting that deep flow state of work. And that type of product right there, it'll take a small hit in sales, but not a large hit. And here's why, because it actually provides a really good solution to you.

And you can already see, you know, people who are practically broke are still forked over the last five dollars for Starbucks. OK, so supplement type products, depending on what you're selling, especially things that give you more energy and make you go through your day, you'll see a noticeable impact. But it won't be anything crazy like, say, a metal sign spray.

All right. And that's only if we really see this big chain reaction and people start pulling mass amounts of money out. It's like right now we're already in a recession, but we're not really seeing anything crazy yet.

OK, we're looking for a massive big panic fear across the market. OK, now the third business that give you guys an example on, we sell a type of insurance. I can't go specifically into what it is, but it's in the medical space.

And it's a no brainer. That's actually going to save people a lot of money. And that type of business right there, again, might see a very, very, very small impact.

But it has so much of an upside potential and solves such a massive problem for people that it's almost a no brainer even during a recession. All right. It might even be a might even grow during a recession because people are really trying to make sure to protect.

That's possible going into a recession. OK, like those type of business right there. That can give you three clear examples.

OK, now another thing is when a recession is, I was people going to cut down the unnecessary. So if you are an unnecessary business and you do have that fear, you do need to be looking at what are other products and services like that, that maybe you could deploy in your business that has solved more of a problem or, you know, we can get people addicted to it, kind of like a supplement increases productivity and cuts caffeine, things like that. Yada, yada, yada.

So you might be able to more look at how can I just have backup plans and have other products and offerings that I can bring to the table that even during a recession, when people are barely have, you know, are seeing less money in their bank accounts, they would still fork over money for my product or service. Now, going into cutting down advertising, there's a lot of business owners asking like, hey, should I cut down advertising, things like that? That right there is a big no.

So you should not be cutting down advertising because if you're cutting down your advertising budget right now, it's more important than ever to be a smart marketer and, you know, how to run ads effectively, because if there's less people in the total amount of in the total pool of, you know, ads we can run to because there's less buyers in the market, there's still buyers in the market. Don't get me wrong. It's just gonna be more competitive than ever.

So building a brand becomes more essential. Building a, you know, solid offering that people love and, you know, will literally fork over the last few dollars for and building amazing creatives and copy and like all that good stuff right there. All of that becomes more important than ever because there is less people in the market, less buyers in the market.

So it's more competitive. It's more competitive. You really need to be able to stand out across all these other brands.

Okay. So this is super, super important to be looking into. And with that being said, that also goes back to, you know, my philosophy of, Hey, you should only be really focusing on creative copy and offering.

You should be working on all those media buying tactics, like things like that, like, because quite frankly, they don't improve performance. We should be focusing on what improves performance. So you should already be focusing on these.

You just need to be doubling down on these and really making sure you're spending more time on it, more investment into it, things like that, because that's going to allow you to stand out from the competition to allow you to really position yourself in a way that, you know, it's a put you in front of the competition, basically, which allow you to get more market share during a recession, which, you know, will help you out with, with sales and stuff like that. Now you will probably see higher cost per acquisition. So, AKA less, you know, if you need a $25 CPA right now, you know, you might see a $30 CPA.

You might still see a $25 CPA. You might see a $40 CPA. I really couldn't tell you because I don't know what your business looks like, but I did give you a few examples.

So you might know where you fall at in that perspective right there. Now, the next thing. So obviously you have, you know, what a recession is.

You have, you know, what to do with like the spending, things like that. And then lastly, I kind of want to touch on like, you know, a, before I get into this, make sure you have three to six months of expenses saved up because that's really important right there. You know, that's just something that's a no brainer at all.

You should already have three months of expenses saved up, whether you're a marketer, whether you're a business owner, be able to at least cover three months. You may just want to double that. Go to six months.

Now, if you already have three months, go to six months. If you have nothing, go to three months at least. Okay.

Get that cash reserve because if shit does hit the fan, at least you have some funding to go through for a few months. That's enough perspective right there. Now, the next thing I want to touch on is kind of like my mental frame around this.

And guys, I'm really sorry. Like I am sick technically. I just don't know what it is.

So like, I'm sorry. I know this might be hard to listen to, but you know, I got to get the videos done. I got to stay on that YouTube grind.

And due to that, make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Okay. So what is my mental frame, my mental stance on going to recession?

You know, as a marketer, right? For me, I work with other brands and, you know, I compete against other marketers on the marketplace. So I have to make sure that I am staying on top of my game because in a recession, if there's two marketers to go to, you know, a company wants to work with, they're going to choose the one with the best results.

That brings the best systems and strategies to the table. And that does everything that, you know, not just a push buttons on a media ad account. You know, these particular people can really come in with some solid creative, creative strategy, copy strategy.

It really can help us out with our offer and really crushing the ad account. That's going to look significantly better. You know, I look at it like a, you know, a fan, like a football team, not, not football in Europe or you're in different countries, stuff like that.

I'm talking about USA specifically. Okay. USA football.

You know, you have your first string, your second string, your third string. You know, if a team needs to pull budget back on the whole team, they're not going to fire their first string quarterback. Okay.

They're going to start firing people on the third string. And then the second string, if they have to, if things really hit the fan. Okay.

Which, you know, they really wouldn't do that, but you know, if things start hitting the fan and they have to dress, we pull their money back. So if you know that second and third string people are going to get fired before a first string player, you need to be doubling down on yourself more than ever right now in terms of investing into yourself, you know, hiring mentors, coaches, and things like that. That's going to push you forward and increase your value in the marketplace versus, you know, shrinking back, being in fear mode and not doing any of this.

And then just getting, you know, destroyed in the competition. Cause that's honestly what's going to happen in that perspective right there. So, so my, my mental frame right now is, Hey, I can only focus on my control.

I'm a focus on stashing more cash in the bank and, you know, making sure I have a few months of expenses saved up. Second thing I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my control when it comes down to advertising and only focus on offer, copy, creative. Okay.

We already got that account structure down. We, you know, it takes us 10 minutes, literally 10 minutes to manage an ad account on a daily basis. Okay.

The other seven hours and 50 minutes we spend on a daily basis, specifically on building better creative, better copy, analyzing offers and things like that. Okay. So that's where we focus our time.

Okay. So I'm focusing on what I can control and the longer I spend in a negative spiral and a fear state and anxiety state like that, that's not going to allow me to focus on what I need to do to grow the business. And I'm just going to get shit on by my competition.

Okay. So that's why it's more important than ever to keep a very strong mental frame going into this, because that is the only way you can be able to push through it and focus on what's going to increase your value in the marketplace. What's going to allow you to beat your competition?

How can you spend more on advertising? How can you spend it more effectively? How can I make sure I have enough cash saved up on the side as well?

Like those are the things that you need to be worried about right now and really need to be putting more time and attention to not, you know, crouching a corner and, you know, fucking shaking with like fear and anxiety. That's not how you're going to be able to push through this in that perspective right there. So, but yeah, guys, I really hope you enjoyed this video.
