what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have a new video for you guys today i'm going to talk about hiring a digital agency in 2021 specifically a facebook ads agency i'm going to discuss everything in between of working with one hiring one pricing everything to expect the horror stories all that good stuff their question stacks and everything like that which i'll be unbiased as possible because i do run a facebook ads agency but i'm hopefully to help you out before you go ahead and hire one so that way you know what to look out for so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day similar to this one let's get started so the first question is ask yourself should i hire a facebook ads agency there's going to become a time where you're currently running facebook ads right now and a you're just not getting the results you want or b where simply you just do not have the time to run the ads anymore you're so focused on growing the business in other perspectives in other areas you know you're working on finance products shipping fulfillment all of this other stuff running new collections or creating new collections and stuff like that where running the facebook ads yourself is actually an issue because you're spending so much time on other areas of the business you can't keep up with it and you're running some issues with results and you know you need to hire and bring someone on board to run the ads for you so that's going to come down to the first question and really to describe that it just kind of depends on you know budget how much excess capital you have because on top of adsmen now you have to pay someone to run it for you and then also too you need to decide if you want to do the consulting or full-on service where consulting is more of an agency works with you you do everything still yourself but they consult with you in the proper things you need to do to get better performance or they're doing full hands-on where the agency takes over the ad account and all that good stuff now the next thing is a niche agency versus a broad agency so if you're looking to hire an agency you want to make sure you're running with an agency that has results in your niche so there's e-commerce there's lead generation and then there's coaches consultants personal brands people selling courses essentially like that you want to make sure you're working with an agency in your particular niche so if you're a e-commerce business and someone who has 90 success rate with realtors wants to run your ads i would pretty much say no because while that business yes they have success with facebook ads not in your niche and that's a huge issue and something that why we proudly identify self commerce niche because we only want to work with e-commerce brands we work with e-commerce brands day to day we specialize in that niche now granted we can charge more due to that so yes we do charge more and yes it's a little bit more cost you know associated to it but the benefit of it is you have someone that works with e-commerce day to day and it's completely different from legion so if you have someone from lead generation for realtors come and work your fashion brands ads it's not going to really work too well and then the cost that you're going to start having is you have to pay them longer to get the it's going to take longer for them to get results for you equals more money spent on advertising more money wasted that could have been put up to a higher tier contractor to do it for you and or higher tier e-commerce specialist to do it for you if you're a brand now you can also go into a sub niche so while we're primary e-commerce we're not completely identified and locked down into one specific niche but you can go even further from e-commerce now to say a beauty brand so we have beauty brand clients we have fashion clients we have a few of other spontaneous custom decor product we've also worked with gaming chairs and stuff and while we've had great results across all those niches there is some brands that work specifically with only women's clothing lines and these brands these agencies are even more valuable because not only do you have an e-commerce specialist on your team now but you also have someone that's generate results for clothing from time to time again so that's also the next thing now while i don't really completely condemn if you do work with someone that has e-commerce results because us personally we don't have results in some of the niches we go into we have generated some really good results and that could come down to just the personality of the person running the ads if they're willing to go out their way to really make sure they can be successful for you regardless what your product is because a lot of e-commerce products share some of the same principles but you know then having someone that already understands your product and has worked at your product for numerous other brands is very valuable and that is something that we're also further refining with our agency to really lock down to only one or two three different sub niches of e-commerce so we can really maximize our results for our clients and only focus and know those products because every time you enter in a new niche or a sub niche you have to relearn a product so that's why if you specialize with just women clothing you know the market you know the consumer really well so you can you know exponentially get better results for your clients so you the client you need to understand that and you also to verify this is okay you work with e-commerce clients have you and do you have any results with these particular clients and they can say yes or no and that's up to you whether you want to use them or not after that but having that niche agency and also having a sub niche agency in your particular niche is more valuable but again you will your costs will rise up but you're paying for that expertise of someone with your type of business now seeing results is the next thing before you hire any agency you want to make sure they have results just in general make sure like i said if they have results in your particular sub niche that's even better but if you're hiring a agency to run your e-commerce ads you want to at least see some case studies in terms of e-commerce results so again if someone that does amazing job with real estate clients i do really really well for you know legion and all that stuff and i was pitching an e-commerce business and like well let me see some e-commerce results and you don't have any then that's more likely not a good idea you want to make sure you're working with someone that hey i work with e-commerce brands i have all of these results and we can do this for your business we clearly see the problem here we might need a little bit more work on the consumer in terms of like understanding your product and your consumer but hey we can do that we can definitely help you out with that that's a lot better versus yeah i know i'll give it a try i got all these results for these little realtors but i never worked at e-commerce business i'm sure we can crush it for you and it doesn't really work well again you might be paying less for that type of deal but ultimately you're gonna spend the money on ad spend and you're gonna lose the money there versus the money you could have put into a higher tier contract that's going to necessarily give you a better result so you want to make sure you see your results and at least your niche sub niche maybe you can be just kind of relevant niches so niches very closer to the particular product you're selling and the results they got that works really well so you definitely want to see your results before you bring them on board now the next thing is understanding the difference between a media buyer and an agency and also understanding what that agency or media buyer is responsible for so a media buyer is someone who consumes who who you know you basically give them the copywriting you give them the creatives and all they're doing is executing on a facebook ad strategy they're going to ask you for more ad copy they're going to ask you for more creatives you're simply being a good person to run the ads for so i actually do have this for one of my particular clients but they don't have a large budget but they're really good at copying creatives they're just very bad at facebook ads management so we do the management and they just give us a copywriting and all that but i do have some higher tier clients where we do everything for them they literally just sit back and collect a check that we generate them with shopify so it definitely depends on again price range because lower price range you're only really going to get a media buyer higher price range you can get someone that covers everything so when you're interviewing these agencies you're interviewing these experts to run your facebook advertising you need to make sure you understand what they're responsible for what they're executing on you know there's copywriting there's creative content you know you'll send them pictures and videos your products but will they edit those videos or do you need to send that to your editing team first if they take photos of products will they edit those or will you know you need to get those edited first in terms of like adding like some 2d text and stuff on and stuff like that making it more ad friendly who's responsible for that who is going to update your website do like a little bit of website optimization not necessarily list products or add you know new events on your website but just a little bit of website optimization in terms of you know critiquing the page and stuff like that who is responsible for that so you need to make sure in detail whether this person be a good fit for you by understanding what they're responsible for again higher ticket agencies do more but also they do charge more lower ticket agencies literally just offer like some simple stuff so you need to understand how they can benefit you and what they're responsible for and you make sure you're clear with this before you proceed with them so that's assuming they're in your niche you got results in your niche now what like stuff are they going to do for you be very clear about this so now that we kind of touched on agency pricing let's actually dive further into it how much does it charge for a facebook ads agency to run ads for you now again is is it a media buyer or is it someone that's on a full service agency we have seen from time and time again just throughout the industry you know you can find you a good decent e-commerce media buyer for around 1500 usd per month that's someone that's literally just managing your ads for you you're going to submit a lot of the creatives and content for them and the copywriting and they're going to manage all your ads for you they're going to generate just pretty decent results again so if they're spending about 1500 you know you spend 1500 on their contract so you're probably going to want to have an ad spend of at least 1500 a month to barely break even you know probably around three to four thousand dollars a month and ad spend so we can really start to you know get enough return on ad spend so their contract is paid by the ad spend and that way the rest of profits for you you're not you know really taking profit out to pay them so you want to make sure that's in there and you know a higher ticket agency we've uh you know we have some contracts where it's like ten thousand dollars a month plus to do everything but we're also in facebook ads we're doing creative content for them we're doing copywriting for them we're managing influencers and stuff we're doing google ads for them tick tock snapchat so it's a lot more going into it but i would say for a higher ticket agency that's doing which really good at facebook ads you're gonna spend anywhere from six thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars per month and someone that handles everything you know from ten to thirty thousand dollars from i know that's a lot but we're talking about brands that are gonna be spending you know maybe three to four thousand dollars a day on ad spend you know brands that are doing anywhere from ten thousand dollars a month to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per month in revenue you'll be expecting to see about a fifteen hundred dollar fee to ten thousand dollar fee depending on that and that's also another thing a lot of pricing and agency pricing at least how we structure ours we have a core program of which is a 90-day program we charge a flat fee for that program that's divided amongst three months and then we switch to a revenue share model once we got everything you know properly set up and properly running then we switch to a revenue uh stream uh revenue share so we can keep scaling that business up again there's different like service agreements and like that amongst agencies but just typically your average pricing is fifteen hundred dollars to ten thousand dollars per month they'll handle your facebook ads they'll do your copywriting they'll do your creative content they'll do some good results for your facebook ads again it's assuming they're in your niche have previous results all that good stuff now what is the cycle like what's the process so of you know hiring agency so obviously you can do some prospecting you'll probably do a discovery call with one of them you'll hop on the call they'll show you the results they've got they might critique your ad account a little bit and then you know they'll send your contract over you sign it you sign up with them what happens next usually you do some type of onboarding where they're going to get access to your ad account they'll get access to your shopify they'll get access to your assets your creative assets so your all your photos and videos from the past you'll do probably a strategic session in terms of you know digging through your customer avatar identifying all types of content and stuff like that and understanding your audience really well potential questions and objections they might have all that stuff so they can really understand your product now that's a good agency some agencies just like sign a contract and they start running off their own but again just kind of depends on the agency so then what you'll do is you'll probably talk to them once or twice per week usually about an email or two nothing crazy some agencies do weekly calls we are strongly against weekly calls we do once a month calls or twice a month calls depending on the client we just find it's no you know real nothing really to talk about every week there's not enough moving forward whereas maybe a once a month call checkup with multiple emails throughout the week to update them on key actions it is a reasonable amount of communication we send weekly reports so we'll send a weekly report of past seven days you know like monday through sunday and we'll send them a report just kind of what things are going where things are moving forward we also like communication from the client in terms of you know if uh they're sending over like hey we're launching a sale in two weeks we want you to be prepared here's everything we're gonna be launching so you know we have key strategic you know kind of like emails in terms of like up things and stuff like that so um will be a lot of heavy communication but once you hire them that's kind of like how the communication go the onboarding will go and stuff and they'll start running ads for you you know they'll start creating the creators for you based off what you give them and start creating copywriting for them now look i'll be honest with you your first month you might actually still be kind of in it in terms of like hey can you approve this creative can you approve this copy and you're still gonna have to kind of like touch base with them and you know you know seeds the type of copy and creative they're doing just so they make sure that they have a good understanding of your product and they're doing it properly because you know we want to do a good job for you and in order for us to do that we want the first few ads we're gonna get you to approve them so we're just gonna send you a copy of them you'll say oh i love that creative cool that's it but then you know as the relationship moves on you know one of my clients um for a few months we talk maybe once or twice by email per month and they'll send an invoice that's it or i'll send them an invoice they'll pay it that's it and this is one of our higher ticket clients because we've developed such a good we came in sync together so i can kind of predict their next moves and you know they and just work really well so that's something similar to to as you start working with agency a longer time it's building relationship with them and it's just something that you know as you develop that strong relationship they work with your brain really well they can start getting you some really good results and there's less and less time that you need to be on it all you know our clients review results once or twice a week and that's it where um as the beginning you know they were in there reviewing results daily they were creating creative content all that stuff then they hired us on and we helped them out with all that issues right there so that's kind of what to expect with an agency i do hear some horror stories though you know there is some horror stories out there and i really wouldn't say horror stories you know it's rarely that an agency is gonna come on board and just completely screw you over so i guess the definition of a horror story is what is going to be kind of uh based off everyone's own unique opinion i guess for us for a horror story is you know someone coming on board spending a ton of money and not getting in results that would be a horror story for me if i was you know a business owner so that's something like what we do for all of our clients we start off with a small budget we start off with a reasonable budget we don't come and say hey we're gonna spend 25k this week you know or this month we just started on board no we're gonna come on board we're gonna start off with our small budget testing campaigns and stuff so that way we're we're properly you know starting to build up results and data and stuff we start with low budget so we don't blow anything crazy i think i've have heard a horror story before where someone had like a 50k a month budget they immediately started with this agency and this agency said hey we spent 25k in like a week just to get out the you know start testing and they start testing all kinds of crazy stuff and got literally no purchase it's just absolute horror story and they're like we just need to spend more and it's like okay if you spend 25k in a week you don't need to spend more to start getting results you know we start off at like 100 300 a day even for ad accounts that are planning on spending 22 to 25k a day and ad spend we start off about 100 200 a day low budget testing it takes a little longer to get results but we prioritize profit over revenue potential so we want to take less risk low budget testing some some business owners we've ran ads for they were you know too much in a rush to scale that they literally let us go because we were prioritizing them too much then tried running ads themselves and blew tons of money wasted their money down the drain way more than they would have paid us in the retainer and all that stuff and it was like hey can come run as far as again and then you know they finally understood why it takes a little time be a little patient so and that's also the next thing is you know you as the client you there's some client expectations us agency owners expect you to uphold and i'll get that to you in a second but um just to go back to the horror stories i mean yeah i haven't really heard too much if you do your due diligence and really dig through you know going for an agency that's in your niche going with an agency that has prior results and you know really making sure that they understand what you're trying to do you understand what they're responsible for and you you really take all those prior steps you're probably going to have a good experience of that agency unless they're just someone that's completely you know like uh you know saying they can do all this and they can't do it at all they they've jeoparded you know copied some other people's reviews and testimonials and stuff but it just i don't see that every day on a day-to-day basis so just be smart it's kind of like when you purchase something online you know do your due diligence look at some reviews look at some results and stuff like some social proof and stuff like that make sure you're going for an agency that um you know has a proven background so if you go through all that you should have a good time we should have really any issues now client expectations because you know you as the client you're going to control this whole relationship if you treat this agency like they're your slave you're not going to have a good time um i i've personally worked with a client before i knew i shouldn't have took them on board because i have my own special special criteria if i allow our client to come on board with us so we start running ass for them and this client did not fit those expectations at all but i was in more of a scarcity mindset at the time and i was like i'm willing to take on anyone and when you have those mindsets you tend to make bad mistakes and that's what this client was and you know just they treated me like a slave and it created this really unnecessary attention on it um they were you know expecting things outside of what we signed and agreed upon had no boundaries at all when it turned you know came to communication like literally blow my phone about three or four o'clock you know in the morning because an ad got disapproved like something simple like that so you know you the client you control everything you want to treat this agency like you treat your wife or your husband you want to treat them respectfully you want to you know respect the boundaries and stuff and part of before you join this partnership with them is laying out those expectations and it's your job as a client to have proper expectations be told to the agency and it's the agency's job at understanding your expectations and understanding you know communicating you know to you what they're going to be doing so if those expectations are met properly in the beginning then when you'll sign on it's gonna be a very smooth experience so you definitely gonna look at all that and you know as you're you're working with an agency so closing out hiring a facebook ads agency can be super beneficial to you because you know you the e-commerce business owner you need to be focusing on other things and you can't be spending all day in the ads manager you can't be spending all day worrying about they're creating new creatives and stuff like that you need to be focused on what you do best creating great products providing an amazing service to your customers you know building up your team you know figuring out how to cut down costs and stuff in like your shipping fulfillment how to create a better product and all that stuff you need to be focused on the bigger picture stuff you need to be focusing more on strategic maybe overall campaigns and stuff that y'all can be pushing so like on valentine's day sell and stuff and then having the right people in place to really go ahead and execute on this for you so having an agency to do this for you or maybe a media buyer that just knows facebook ads really well and you love doing the creative and you rather than the copy and they can just take what you give them and they can run with it so having this is a really great player on your team i know one of our clients we typically do about 60 to 100 grand a month for them and just for valentine's day we did um 880 or 847 000 in revenue in less than 21 days so you know having the right agency can be super super super profitable for you especially one that knows specifically your business your niche and all that you can see some amazing just absolutely amazing results and i know for me it's very very fulfilling to completely change a business's results around you know allow them to hire more people and stuff i'm putting more jobs into the market and just there's something i'm super grateful to do and absolutely love so you know hiring agency agency super beneficial to you and um you know if you specifically are an econ business owner and uh you know this is where i'm gonna give my pitch at uh if you spend at least a
