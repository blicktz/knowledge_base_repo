what is going on guys welcome back to the channel today i got a cool new video for you guys where we're actually going to give you a free tool that i've been using lately for my facebook advertising campaigns that's drastically helped me improve them and run my campaigns from a more strategic level with a different perspective in mind versus what you see in the side the ads manager so this google sheet basically brought down everything i've been doing over the past few years all my knowledge and stuff into a google sheet that makes it easy for the everyday i guess you could say advertiser to pick up and start using and start to change their facebook ad results so let me show you guys what's going on but this google sheet is going to help you get more sales with your e-com store it's going to help you run and create better and more cultivating advertising images your creatives and stuff it's going to allow you to spot problems in your sales process that way you can eliminate those and overall increase your roas and increase your sales in the long run so with that being said let's jump right into my computer and i show you this whole goal sheet and everything that goes into it what's going on guys welcome to the kpi book this is the newest tool i've put together to help me with my facebook ad results this is essentially what allows me to take what's in my mind every time i look at an ad account on a day-to-day basis put it on paper and then allows me to dig through the data in a different perspective from when you're looking at it in the ads manager just allow me to better predict you know like the data and how it's moving forward and stuff if we're seeing a higher cpc then i'm you know i need to know hey i need to upgrade my uh creatives maybe test some different ad copy or test some different audiences because i know roas is slowly going to drop if the cpc is rising so just different things like that that's uh allows me to visually see all that in this document right here uh first thing you want to do is you want to go right here file make a copy and you can download it right here you can save it to your google drive um and that's going to give you access to this full document right here so everything that's into it you got an overview dashboard to see the months on the year right here daily metrics a and r which is simply is your assessment review and bottlenecks so actually some things based off that data which you can improve on what you do to fix that data so um also quick update to essentially change it by the year uh you do have to change this year right here to your current year so if we're watching this in 2021 2022 maybe 2023 um you just change the year right here to the current year um because that will affect this data how it's displayed and stuff so going into this now how to use this what does it mean to me so what this allows you to do is identify different trends inside the ads account from a different perspective than inside the ads manager and overall to allow you to run better ads in the long run identify key problems in your sales funnel and then lastly make you more money so first things first uh to use this once you download and stuff you open it up then you need to start tracking your daily metrics it's gonna get the ball kind of rolling moving forward to simply track daily metrics you open up your ads manager and you're going to copy that data that you see uh from yesterday so you want to look at yesterday's data and you want to implement it in here so um you know today's tuesday morning i'm gonna look at monday's data uh boom and make sure you type in the date exactly like this uh let's just say we spent a thousand dollars and you can see stuff happening everything between these two lines is all algorithms doing things for me um so don't mess with any of these and then your cpc is let's just say it's two let's do a dollar 50. let's make some bad data we got a thousand page views uh we did 50 sales and let's do 2 500. um that's not even bad let's see 25 sales boom so uh uh that's why there we go so we got some pretty bad data right here essentially and uh just to break it down real quick before we start breaking this break this down before we start breaking that down uh cpc if you go under the columns performance and clicks you'll get the click through rank uh click through link crate that's yeah um that's what that is and then lpv is your landing page views so essentially your website visitors what it's also gonna be website content views i do total i don't do unique sales as the total purchases you had in that account for that day and then revenue obviously i'm pulling all this from the ads manager i'm not pulling this say like from the shopify website and then going into it so um let's break into this now let's get into this we just put this data down what are we seeing now what's uh some trends and stuff we're kind of noticing so we notice right here our robust is bad obviously um average order value is pretty damn low compared to prior days right here we can see we even like had a high one of 78 dollars uh so we see a pretty good consistent uh average order value on this account between 60 to 80 bucks and then now it's starting to lower 48 53 57 40 dollars so obviously something is going on we are seeing a very high cost per acquisition so that means that we have to spend 40 bucks just to acquire one customer uh so we definitely need to get that lower um site conversion rate is a lot lower uh so simply all the things right here pretty bad but we're seeing a cpc of dollar 50 so to me that means okay if all those are bad the first thing i'm gonna start with is the first thing the consumer sees and that's the ad so if the cpc is high and that's the cost per click uh for your ad so essentially people are scrolling past the ad so we need to update our creatives whether it's new creatives or new audiences so if it's an audience we've been prior using consistently it's been working really well then that means we need to go inside the creative itself maybe we launched a new creative that's just suffering it's not doing good at all we need to kill it test something different so i would go with add copy or a video photo carousel uh collection and test different things like that so that's essentially what this whole thing allows you to do is start digging into this and seeing what's working what's not so we're looking now change the cpc and stuff so let's look at this data right here we're seeing we're getting a really amazing cpc so we're testing you know we're getting some high quality traffic or high quality clicks to the ad itself but we're also still seeing some really bad results and typically what i would do if we're here is i would look okay so we're driving some really good traffic um we're getting some you know a good amount of landing page views i'm gonna assume the landing page views uh really good as well but now the problem we're having is no one's buying and then the next thing i would look to right here is actually look at the add to carts are we're getting at the carts no no one's added to cart uh but cpc is really good so there might be a problem with the add to cart process on the site it may be a problem with the site overall especially if we're testing an audience that has worked well in the past if not it's a brand new audience maybe it's just a misleading ad that's driving the wrong type of traffic to the site so um that's what's cool about this it just allows you to identify different performance trends in the ad account and stuff um i wouldn't just make a change every single day but i would use it for a few days so let's just say you know a few days go by uh particularly for this ad account let's actually delete today's data real quick and actually show y'all because this is a real ad account i'm working on right now so we can actually see row ass has been kind of dropping over the past few days uh we can see our average order value went from kind of close to 80 bucks 70 80 bucks last few days um to down just a couple days ago where it's dropping out 48 53 57 so it's definitely lowering down the average order value so it might be coming down to actual product itself you know could we maybe upsell people on something to increase the average order value maybe a widget we've been using that increases average order value already has stopped working and something as little as that is affecting over everything else so um and also too we're still seeing a decent cost per acquisition this could be a little bit lower um and our cpc has been rising a little bit so maybe just testing some new creatives first uh maybe working on the cost per acquisition and stuff kind of fine tuning that and for average order value still doesn't change then uh you know maybe testing some different products so you really need to ask yourself questions about these stats and stuff and figure out what you can do with the data that tells you and the cool thing about looking at it from this it's completely different perspective than the ads manager it allows you to compare like this especially the way of it highlighted and stuff um it kind of allows you to look at you know good days and stuff and figure out what you can replicate and stuff like that so uh now going into the a and r this is something super simple it just allows you to make notes about each week so this is week of june 22nd and uh you know what what are we seeing with it on the ad account super super simple uh it's we uh we just came off a father's day sale uh so so roas has dropped so it's just they put literally gonna put that just came off father's day sell roas dropped uh working on new creatives boom so there we go just little notes about that account each week and uh yeah and then lastly is bottlenecks bottlenecks is super super cool because essentially i just listed some stats and stuff for you guys uh to use for inside your store and but then also too i listed a few things like issues that you may be having and things you can do so just kind of help you problem solve so with ads and advertising and stuff the biggest thing that's helped me is problem solving analyzing the data and coming up with solutions based off those problems that we can implement test and either get better results or get worse results and then we simply just repeat the cycle so with this this allows you to bring awareness to those problems as they're evolving and then allows you to create solutions quicker implement new solutions quicker you know try to find fixes and stuff quicker which is going to overall increase your roas over time so you want this google
