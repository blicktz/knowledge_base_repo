all righty guys before i start today's video i want to kind of talk to you guys real quick because today's video is pretty weird basically yesterday because i'm actually editing it a day late but yesterday um i kind of vlogged like half of the day and i pretty much just stopped i just got really busy went hanging out with some friends and stuff um also wasn't really feeling too good so i kind of stopped halfway and i wanted to produce the video for you guys today so i'm actually going to show you all a little bit of footage from yesterday and then we're going to hop into an unboxing video of when i got the camera so um hope you guys enjoy today's video come on let's go party party time party time come on buddy buddy come on let's go potty come on come on come on there you go good boy good boy hey youtube how are you guys doing today i know i'm preferably a little sick so we'll see how it goes pause where do you want to go where do you want to go well how about a cold start for the morning there we go tropical smoothie today or this morning to pick up a few smoothies for the guys because i got to keep them healthy to get their vitamins in what's up dude so i normally like fast in the morning till 12 but i took a whole bunch of medication today this morning it's helping a lot bunch of vitamins and stuff and i just need a little bit of fruits and stuff like something to put my system to go with it or i'm so i feel like absolute shit on a fasted stomach and honestly i put my health first before fasting or any type of diet so got me a nice little strawberry banana smoothie and i'm about to start editing vlog for that y'all saw yesterday and get some work done new vlog went live and that this morning and i want to show you guys some cool follow-up uh use an active campaign follow-up this prospect for a few days now trying to balance editing my vlogs at night and not doing it in the morning because then it kind of throws my whole day off but i just finished working right now following up with a few key people in the agency and then we have pretty much like some free time to work on a few other things for the business kennedy just came over brought me some food and stuff it was amazing and i'm just going to crash it right now but check out what she did for me she painted me a painting and check out how cool that is i love it what i'm working on right now is some more stuff for the agency some linkedin content creation and kind of structuring some few funnels not gonna lie feeling a little lazy right now but pushing through it yo natasha's new course on linkedin is pretty sick but i am heading out the shop now and i'm going to grab drinks and chill with friends so see you guys soon now let me update you guys again on this video i feel like it was very irresponsible for me to be feeling a little bad and literally go hang out with friends and stuff from my perspective i get these sinus infections all the time in fact i went to the doctor this morning and i just got a sinus infection i get these all the time um i have bad allergies allergies starts from my nose goes to my throat then goes to my chest it's how it always happens i get these probably once to twice a year and yeah i knew what i was feeling boom um also too there has yet to be any corona cases in my city and at least a 50 mile radius around me so between those two things right there and me knowing my body personally that's the only reason why i kind of still went out and did my own daily things but guys be safe if you're feeling bad and you're in a city that has confirmed corona cases i would highly recommend staying home doing following instructions whatever the government is telling you to do and yeah now back to the vlog oh wait oh wait no now actually let's jump into this unboxing video okay guys so this is the canon 16 to 35 lens and um yeah this is probably the most expensive lens i've ever bought it's it was like right at a thousand dollars flat um you bought this and like a uv filter together and yeah i'm insane i'm really really freaking happy for this this is the canon eos 90d um there was a lots of cameras i was going back and forth with there was the sony as7i i know it's a little outdated then there was the sony a6500 um and i don't know i just i saw the 90d um i had a canon before i saw all of the quality tests and stuff and also too i wanted a full-size camera i know that's like a some people prefer a smaller camera for vlogging some people prefer a bigger camera i've always used these bigger dslr cameras then there was the canon eos um r which i almost purchased but the problem with that camera is i was going with a really shitty lens and i wanted like a really solid setup from the beginning that's also why i bought this and why i bought like everything else like this is all investing into this channel and i'm super happy so let's get started i mean this is saying an unboxing channel but battery charger uh battery camera strap and then canon us 90d oh my god so like guys y'all don't understand like i've used a iphone for a few videos my last previous videos on this channel my car video which probably a lot of guys know me from i use that as an iphone to record it and then i had a rebel t3i dslr before which if you do not know that camera's a camera came out 10 years ago um it does like 1080p 30 frames a second and that's like super high quality fart uh the camera has a lot of just little problems with it um or that particular camera so i needed to upgrade it's like has like a synth like one or two dead pixels in it it has just a bunch of little problems with that camera so i was like i want a camera i want to be able to shoot 4k i want a camera not an iphone i want something real to hold i mean obviously iphone but i want something that can really create some epic shit as well as like the 90d so let me get this thing set up here's the camera all right now this is a lens holy shit the smoothness the smoothness let's see we'll do this look at that that's so cool all right let's check out make sure there's no like cracks or anything camera but let's see wow oh you heard the click did y'all hear the click this is a camera oh my god this is a big setup but that's what i want that's also what i want i want a setup something so guys which i think is it is it this how we're gonna do it now oh wait wait wait hold up we're missing a few things all right here we go i am officially a youtuber now so it was a thousand dollars for the lens amazon has the 90d for like 1200 right now it's like 1199 so you're looking about 2200 right there rode video mic was 200 so that's 2400 memory card was 135 but again this was like purely overkill this is a sony tough 64 gig card it's claims 300 right 300 download um or 300 read 300 right and yeah so it's very expensive setup after taxes and everything came out close to three thousand dollars but again it's an investment and i want to put myself at that risk just for the simple fact of that i want something you know amazing i haven't had a really good camera setup like this in 10 years or i've been using the same camera for 10 years so i wanted to check out something new i wanted to try something new and i want to kind of make myself give me more give me more of a commitment to this series and by also you know spend a little bit of money and making me want to get everything i can out of this particular setup so and by also you know all righty guys hope you guys enjoyed this video i know like i said it was very weird and i didn't really film an outro so here is the outro hope you guys enjoyed the video hope you guys enjoyed the boxing i'll see you guys tomorrow also make sure to drop a like comment and subscribe
