I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's going on guys? Welcome back to the vlog. Today is the day.

Today is the big day. We are about to go ahead and pick up the keys for the apartment and actually start moving in a few smaller things today. So today is going to be fun.

I'll take you guys with me. We'll go over some of the stuff I already got. Moving in, apartment tour.

I mean you already kind of saw the apartment I chose but you'll actually see the one I chose. All that good stuff. So stay tuned guys.

It's going to be fun. And let's get the chariot warmed up for you guys. All righty guys we got the keys and we are in.

And for those who've been wondering we did get the third floor with the pond view. So now start moving stuff in. All right you guys got everything from the cars up here.

Got a nice little cardio workout going up through sites of flares like 10 times. But uh yeah I mean it's just a little preview of everything. Like I said it's going to be over the next week as we start to get more stuff in here.

Ordered Entertainment Center. Got a sofa coming in. A dining room table coming in.

And then I'm just going to move my bed in here. And then in here. Let's see.

Now in here it's going to be the office area. So I'm going to do my office. My desk against this wall.

Do my bookshelf against this wall. Now we've got a nice view. Out there.

Out there. Quick little update. I got the bar stools.

Pleat. We also found out they got an ice maker in there. So that's a huge help.

Because I'm going to put like ice in. She filled the water. Also did purchase yesterday a water filtration system.

Because they don't have like water for sprout. And yeah. I got the toaster, knives, pressure cooker.

I'm going to use that for a lot of rice. All that's set up. Girlfriend.

She's helping out. Helping out with getting everything set up. Yeah.

Everything's going along pretty well. All right. This is everything that's left.

Which is the trash. Got all that done. And now we're going to go back to Caron Crow.

To pick up some more furniture and stuff. I think we're going to do everything today but the bed. And then do the bed tomorrow.

Just because that's going to be like a really big piece. So. Probably just going to leave the camera here.

Then jump to my iPhone now. Just because I don't want to have to be trying to bring this around. While I'm trying to like move all that other furniture.

So. That's just pretty much how we're going to switch over now. Hey YouTube.

How's it going? Currently. Loading a bunch of stuff in my car.

We are at my. House. Again stuff loaded up.

Different like. You know. Shit.

Got the trucks out. Right there. Get everything loaded up.

All right. Got the bed set up. On top there.

Got the bed. Back of the truck. Loaded up with stuff.

And also too. Here's like all my. Kind of like office stuff.

I like a little stand I used for Phoenix's cage. We're all good to go. And my car.

Over there. Is packed up. Guys.

Quick little update. We got. A lot of stuff moved.

I know the last thing y'all saw was the vehicles and stuff. But check this out. We started to get something.

Going. Kennedy made the bed. Parents brought the bed in.

All that good stuff. We got some. Oh.

I know I said we were just moving slowly. But the weather is so perfect. Right now.

We decided to just move everything today. And currently right now I'm getting the cocksop set up. Got some sushi.

Oh. It looks good. Everything.

Now check out the office. Office came out nice. Check this out.

We got Phoenix's cage in here. We got a look over the pond now. And then we got the bookshelf.

Coming up good. I can't wait to do an official tour of this place. But we're going to dive into some food.

And I'll update y'all later. Alrighty guys. So we don't really have a sofa yet.

So we're just kind of chilling outside right now. We're eating some sushi. Sushi, sushi, sushi.

Just chilling out. Here's the view. Pretty good.

Boom, boom. Hello there. It's currently like 12 o'clock at night.

Just went to do a few things on the road. See some friends. Small.

Very small. And brought Kennedy back home. So we are officially night number one at the apartment complex.

I'm about to sip on some isosurge. Just because I barely ate today. Get some protein in.

Shaker cup. And then we got our little water thing. Look how empty that fridge is.

We're going to try to fix that tomorrow. So. Put some water.

Yeah. Let's go. By the way.

This thing works amazing. I. Not been doubted at first.

But was just like skeptical about it. How well it would work. But pretty damn cool.

Yeah. Let's sip on this. And edit this vlog.

So I want to thank everyone for watching. Tomorrow. I am going to move all my clothes and stuff.

And then. Then after that. We just got to get a few things.

So. We have nothing. I have nothing in the living room right now.

And I'm waiting for a sofa to come in. I'm waiting for an entertainment center to come in. And they will love to put my TV up and stuff.

So I pretty much just have my office. And my bed. In there.

And I'm going to do like a full video tour. Once everything is finished. It's like a nice.

Nice B roll and stuff. But for now. Hope you guys enjoyed everything so far.
