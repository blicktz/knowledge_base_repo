video so again today we'll be talking about hooks or headlines you know whatever you want to call it specifically the hook so that's gonna be the main part of the creative which reality this is what gets the attention of consumers on Facebook is this particular hook right here now no one really reads the copy no one really reads the headline but the main thing they see on the creative right here is what's gonna really stop them in their tracks now the visual they see around this should be articulated or visually articulated based upon the hook you use in the ad itself so now that we're on the same page let's take a look at here because again we're gonna be looking at desire market awareness and market sophistication so something interesting here all right so some pretty high level tactics if you've never heard of market awareness market sophistication true you've heard of desire it's pretty uh you know easy one right there so example number one the desire is make more money with my Shopify store now the product itself is Facebook ads done for you by agency so something like someone like me for example run your Facebook ads now market awareness remembers five stages of market awareness the particular market awareness stage we're going to target with this ad is problem aware now the next thing is the market sophistication stage one now a stage one market sophistication basically means that we're the first people to open up a market and say hey we're gonna run your Facebook ads simple as that so this is going back probably years ago back in you know 2013 2014 time before running Facebook ads now awareness problem aware so it means they're currently experiencing the problem of being stuck at a certain revenue level in their business they don't really know what they're gonna do to break past it but that's their problem so they're problem aware they're experiencing a problem they're stuck at a certain level they don't really know what to do to break past that now the ad objectives this is basically the key things that we need to do in this particular ad to basically sell them on our product we first need to acknowledge the problem they're experiencing which is stuck at a current revenue barrier so we need to start off with some type of visual and you know even a potentially like headline right here that's gonna resonate with someone who's stuck at a current revenue barrier this is how we're gonna capture their attention if you're stuck at 30 km off and I say hey are you stuck at 30 km off here's how to break past that you'll watch that type of video right there now the next thing is that we need to introduce Facebook ads as the solution to help them make more money so remember their stage one sophistication they don't know that Facebook ads are gonna make them more money money so that's why we need to first showcase the problem which is them being stuck at a current revenue barrier and now Facebook is going to allow them to make more money and break past that and then we're gonna go over how Facebook ads work because they're a level one sophistication they never ran Facebook ads before they're not they never used Facebook ads before they're level one there don't know anything about it so we could start off with a simple headline like this how a Shopify owner broke past revenue barriers in her business it speaks to the particular desire which is make more money and it speaks to a specific problem which is break past certain revenue levels in their business and then secondly it also kind of talks about to our market level sophistication stage one because we're just simply stating the claim now example number two we're gonna go up a level in the market sophistication so we're just gonna be focusing on market sophistication today in today's video if you guys want more like this we can do different levels of market awareness next on top of market sophistication we're gonna go to a stage two market sophistication so same thing desire make more money with their Shopify store now the product Facebook ads done for you by agency market awareness problem aware so same you know key fundamentals now market sophistication is a stage two that means they're already using a Facebook Ads agency so they already know a little bit about Facebook ads this is like their first agency they ever used first time ever running Facebook ads so they get to start to experience a little bit about Facebook now they're problem aware what is the problem now well Facebook Ads agency not performing not sure how many of you guys who potentially watch this channel has ranked has worked with Facebook Ads agency but maybe you had a lot of hopes and dreams that you bring a Facebook Ads agency on board and boom all your problems go away you scale and you're good to go unfortunately it just didn't work and that agency is not performing right now maybe it's costing you more money than making you more money to pay them so first thing we need to do is address that problem they're currently experiencing which is the agency not performing this is how we'll capture the market's attention skin the problem on their head is that the Facebook Ads agency not performing then we're gonna do is want to introduce the solution it's the same solution Facebook Ads done for you but we just have a better track record and we also offer a 30 day money back guarantee so this is a stage 2 market sophistication this is where you're gonna exaggerate that stage 1 you don't introduce a new mechanism you just simply exaggerate basically draw you know further dramatize what you know do it better in that sense than a stage 1 so we can do Facebook ads better have a better track record we offer 30 day money back guarantee now how are we going to call out a stage 2 market sophistication that's problem aware and has the same desire and same product Facebook Ads agency not performing question mark something simple because there's only going to be a very specific group of people that's going to experience this particular problem so it's going to stop them in their tracks and it's going to make them look at this ad now we're going to go up one more level of market sophistication once we stage 3 stage 3 things change a lot so stage 3 desire and make more money with my Shopify store stays the same product Facebook Ads done for you by agency stays the same market awareness problem aware stays the same market sophistication a stage 3 this is for people who are already using a Facebook Ads agency or so we're going after the same people who are already using Facebook Ads agency now they're problem aware all right now guess what tired of being burned by Facebook Ad agencies so they've they've used one or two agencies so far and they're just they're burned and keep getting burned and it's not fun I've dealt this objection a lot as someone who sells agency services I've dealt this objection a lot and I just it's very common I've been burned by agencies before so what is our objective here first we need to acknowledge the problem that they're experiencing because it's a problem where which is agency not performing then we need to introduce the solution but we need to introduce a new way to run Facebook Ads that gives people hope again so stage 1 market sophistication hey we're gonna run your Facebook Ads what's Facebook Ads this is what Facebook Ads is stage 2 sophistication is hey we're gonna run your Facebook Ads but we're gonna do it better we have better track record and we give you a 30 day money back guarantee now stage 3 hey I've been burned by these past 2 people you know I know you're not just gonna run my Facebook Ads like you need to say something else that's gonna give me hope and why you're gonna be different so guess what we're gonna introduce a new mechanism a mechanism is simply a system a new system a new way to run Facebook Ads that's going to give these people hope again that Facebook Ads can work for them so our new mechanism is focused on testing creatives which will help us find winning ads that will scale past revenue barriers inside their Shopify store so tying it again back to their desire so the headline Shopify store owners here's why 90% of Facebook agencies are terrible at delivering results and from there I'm gonna showcase how they don't focus on marketing fundamentals and how that they need you need to be testing creatives on a weekly basis to find new winning creatives that's gonna scale your business forward I could not talk to a stage 1 market sophistication like a stage 3 because they're two completely different problem they're experiencing and their mindset's in a completely different place they've worked with a few Facebook ad agencies before they have a higher level of understanding of Facebook Ads so now I do not need to show them how Facebook Ads work they already know how Facebook Ads work that's gonna bore them and basically make them scroll past the ad but because I know they're stage 3 market sophistication they've used a few Facebook Ad agencies already and they've been burned and now they're looking for another one well what do I do I introduce a new way to satisfy their desire a new mechanism a new way to give them hope again that's why every time you see a YouTube video that says you know new drop shipping tutorial or new Facebook Ads strategy gives you XY results you click on it because you gives that little sense of hope that maybe this video will be the video that gets you to that you know whatever you're trying to hit so I'm simply here introducing those new mechanisms example number four this is where we're gonna exaggerate that stage 3 mechanism so at a stage 4 market sophistication we need to solve more of the problem we need to have more features more benefits all that good good stuff and also at a stage 4 we can either go back to 3 or we can go to a 5 after this which I'm not going to cover a stage 5 in today's video because it's very complex to cover and 90% of people are going to use stage 3 and stage 4 for the 1% of people who know about market sophistication anyway so let's go through this desire make more money with my Shopify store product Facebook ads done for you by agency market awareness problem aware market sophistication stage 4 but we need to exaggerate the mechanism we introduce into the market on stage 3 so problem aware testing new Facebook ads is not working so in stage 3 we introduced a new mechanism if you need to test new Facebook ads to improve your Facebook ad performance I mean you know I can't tell you how many people are watching this video right now it's been following my channel that didn't know about testing Facebook ads now they know about Facebook ads testing Facebook ads and it's slowly helping them in a very good way but they're still not seeing the full effect of finding winning ads and some of these testing these new ads isn't quite working so because of the stage 4 market sophistication they have a different problem they're still problem aware but they just have a different problem than a stage 1 market sophistication someone who's in a stage 1 market sophistication testing new Facebook ads is not working for them is not something that would even be a problem for them because there's just completely different level of market sophistication so the first thing we need to do is acknowledge the problem they're experiencing which is testing Facebook ads that's not working the next thing we need to do is we need to introduce the solution introduce the solution it's the same solution it's just that we can do it better we can create higher more efficient creatives for Facebook that's going to convert 10 times better than any of the competition so say goodbye to creatives that do not convert simple as that so that's just showing you guys the different hooks with market sophistication you know and how we take that in effect when we're kind of targeting our audience now how do you figure out the market sophistication of your market honestly just takes a lot of market research you're really trying to figure out what products people have used prior so like you know for me for my sales calls with Facebook ads you know people who you know come and hop on a call with me and talk to me and I get to understand a lot about them so I can kind of figure out the market sophistication based off of that now for you at your e-comm product for example it's a lot of market research and looking at the problem that you're going to be problems of other products that are in the market like yours so go figure out those problems go read the one star reviews go look at the bad video reviews all right you're looking at probably a lot of positive video reviews your competitors go look at the bad ones and figure out those problems and then take those problems and go create content around those problems and now your product does it better or you have a new mechanism that will make it to where they don't have that anymore and that right there is how you do market sophistication I'm sure you guys hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday my name is Nick Terry and I'll talk to you guys later peace out
