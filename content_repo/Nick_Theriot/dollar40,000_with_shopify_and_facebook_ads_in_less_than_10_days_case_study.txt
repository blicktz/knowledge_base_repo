yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys where I'll be covering exactly how we generated over forty thousand dollars in sales with Shopify and Facebook ads in less than 10 days so today I'll be covering a few key topics of how exactly we positioned one of the offer exactly that we used to to leverage and really get this momentum going kind of the creative we use in the creative content we test it and a little bit of the ad account structure we use to really get the momentum going so before we get started make sure you hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday just like this one that being said let's get started okay so first thing let's hop into the Shopify really quick just to show you that this is all real and legit as there's a lot tends to be some fake people or people calling this fake results here's the refresh button etc exactly what we did over this you know few days and stuff so we did forty thousand dollars in sales between I think it was like April 23rd to I think like May 2nd and basically what it is is is we launched a new offer to our audience and then we also launched a new offer to our cold audiences so the offer was a mother's day sale now we didn't really put the products on a sale exactly we just kind of put them we always do a discount for this particular store because that's just what works best we've tried selling these products in different ways and selling them with a discount is the only real way to really get that momentum going now you know results are starting to die out and we need we knew we needed to position the offer in a new way so instead of just a hey 50% off today we wanted a new way to really capitalize on the specific offer so with the products and stuff we're like hey what's going on in the world we're like well hey mother's day is right around the corner so why haven't we did a mother's day sale so sometimes when you're running an offer maybe a discount one key of advice is you need to like tie it into something that's going on outside the world so if you're running a discount you're saying hey today only 10% off well maybe hey today only for mother's day we're giving 20% off discount on all of our products so people are more enticed to actually take advantage of that offer when you kind of tie it into something like that and actually have a theme around the offer we've seen this a lot of times countless times perform really well we're able to reuse that same offer of 20% off 15% off 50% off etc reuse it over and over and over with just a new theme a new angle of approach of how we're promoting that core offer so for this particular brand we promoted that core offer 50% off lots and then we transitioned and we hit a new angle we hit two different angles one the perfect gift for mother's day so people are buying that gift for mothers and then another angle of hey mothers we owe you one here's a huge thank you here's 50% off so there's two different angles of approach of the way we promoted this this offer and we did extremely well we averaged this account of around a 2.8 2.9 ROAS and then the break even is about 1.39 so we're always averaging really good for this particular brand basically double their profits since we've came on board what we did was is we did $11,000 in spend over the course of 10 days or less than 10 days and made them back $40,000 in revenue for a near 4x return on ad spend which is just absolutely crazy so now that you've seen some of the Shopify stuff you understand a little bit of the background about it let me take you into the ads manager so again we spent $11,000 right here we did quite a few things so we start off first with our creative testing campaign right here and inside of our campaign we launched a new batch of um you know creatives and stuff to test and right out of the gate this is batch 7 right here this is the batch that we used just right out of the gate we seen an amazing increase in performance these create this new way of positioning the offer a new angle of attack performed extremely well you know like so we're averaging around a 1.8 1.9 due to delayed attribute or not delayed attribution due to just some of the people taking a different route facebook now reporting a lot of purchases and stuff this is the only source of traffic for this store for this particular sale and you know we see about a 1.9 2x in this store on a day-to-day basis and we're doing about 3x on a day-to-day basis we compare spin to Shopify revenue thank you ios 14.5 as well as just you know you're kind of typical people taking different routes people sharing it friends and stuff like that so we see some really strong performance right out the gate you can see right here you know we're still seeing a pretty decent ctr compared to the other ones but we're also seeing some really good soft stats uh for unique outbound clicks 65 cents 81 cents 63 cents really good compared to some of the other ones around one one dollar 15 dollar 35 dollar 39 so we're seeing some really good stats in that area so we knew from initial creative launch that this particular creative and we did three different creatives i'm not gonna i can't show you those creatives just because as far as i can go with showing you exactly what we did for this client but we did three different creatives one particular was more just like a 2d like a graphic design than photoshop with the particular item that says happy mother's day another one was just a photo on the desk and another one was a video of the product on the desk just hovering over the phone guys i kid you not the one with the graphics saying happy mother's day looked very professional everything performed poorly i mean i'm talking to like barely a one extra turn on that spin and the one of the video of the product on the desk performed near like i said this is the results two to three extra turn on that spin at scale so just a quick little tip you need to go out there get your product put it on a desk or put it on the ground film some videos just hovering over it with your phone we've seen this countless times work really well for somatic accounts that we're working on right now so so we carried over that creative into our scaling campaign and as you can see right here it's our mother's day our scaling campaign and once we validated the audiences that work best in creative testing and then also in audience testing itself validating what audiences work best we took them to our scaling campaign and honestly what worked best for this particular campaign was literally just wide open we spent five thousand dollars on this one particular ad set made back ten thousand dollars and i scaled this ad set or i scaled this particular offer very aggressively so we took our creatives and stuff after we test them an abo campaign we moved them into a scaling campaign i started off at five hundred dollars today um just right off the back and we did really well if we go and look let's say maybe like the monday to 26 i think we did maybe i didn't launch it yet let's do 29th okay so yeah i immediately launched it um i think i started off at five hundred dollars daily when i launched it on april 29th and then what happened was i started off uh probably at 500 and i duplicated the budget of that cbo midday because we're probably doing like a three to four extra turn on ad spend and then i just i literally just ran it for a few days it wasn't even long that we ran it next day i think i've doubled the budget again from a thousand to two thousand dollars a day performed really well and then on the saturday the first we spent another close to 2k a day and then sunday the second was the last kind of day i really push it hard uh reason why is because it's sunday the second and today is saturday 8th the day i'm filming this mother's day is sunday the ninth tomorrow and the shipping cut off the time this product is made and shipped is before mother's day so we can't really push it past that date because people won't get it for for mother's day and i mean you're seeing some really good return on right here i mean we're seeing some three dollar and five dollar purchases at mofu and bofu which is super good 10x almost 10x return on ad spend on hot i keep this super super simple in terms of how exactly we structure our ad set we literally just put all of our retargeting audiences for view content and add to cart in one particular batch right there just let it run and then we'll have a multitude of different ad creatives in that particular one and then same thing for mofu we just kind of put everything in one batch and just let it run so but yeah and bofu mofu uh the type of um ad creatives we're targeting was literally just copying pasting our top of funnel ads and positioning them into our mofu and bofu campaigns but also too would work really well was a last minute call to action creating some urgency um and increasing the reason why they need this particular product so why you need to purchase a gift why this is gonna be a great mother's day gift hey mother's day is in a few days you need to purchase now before the cutoff time so all these key things right here makes a huge impact in your campaign especially when you're repositioning an offer like this so what can you do what can you take advice from this is think of new ways to position your current offer so your current offer might be a buy one get one free maybe it's a 50 off your first purchase and then a regular price the rest of your purchases think of new angles of attack and new name angles of approach to revive that core offer you know so for example for us the mother's day approach you know we're about to redo this again with like a summer approach summer's here get 50 off the store etc so new angles of approaches and if you tied that into events that's going on in the real world um it also kind of helps out with um you know keeping them up to date essentially so uh just a really cool tactic really cool thing you should leverage in your business and try out i'm curious if you do do this let me know drop some comments below the results and stuff you get this is a really fun little sell project we did again we ran the same offer we've been running we just did a new approach added a new way to promote it so let me know if you try this let me know how it works but this also really shows the key importance of new creatives new offer our new angle of approach and just reviving your current campaigns so guys i really hope you enjoyed this video if you're an e-commerce business
