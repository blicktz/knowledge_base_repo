yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today we want to talk about feedback loops as an advertiser and I know this is a very complex topic we're about to dive into but essentially with it revolves around mindset and as a Facebook ads media buyer advertiser marketing director like you have to understand where your feedback loops are at and common ones that where you're basically your mindset is limiting your success not the ads account not the ads manager your mindset so it's gonna be a very heavy mindset episode that I'm really excited to share with you guys as I feel like this is one of the greatest things that's allowed me to achieve some level of success with Facebook ads and it's something I want to share with you guys as I see a lot of people we consult with struggle with this as well so I wanted to do a video on it so if that being said make sure that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday let's dive into it okay so feedback loops just the idea of what a feedback loop is and it's if this happens then I do this an action effect go back to action fact action effect action in fact it just it keeps circling around so an example of this as a media buyer would be oh it ads performing bad or overall performance is bad then the action I'm gonna take is to restructure the ad account do a whole new structure and then basically just wait until see if results do good or bad results do bad again restructure it again I just go down this over looping like cycle essentially and it's critical to understand like where your feedback loops are at and every person will be different like I've realized that a lot of people are different like one particular person when this happens they'll do this but I've picked out about three of them I cover in this video so just hang in there because it's me again a complex video um I'm gonna do the best I can explain it so advertising is 80 mindset just as I believe success is 80 mindset and same thing I believe scaling is 80 mindset you need a rock solid mindset to be able to spend six or five six seven eight nine figures and ads been profitably and it's very important you have this and it's something that I've luckily realized early in my career that's the importance of it yes 20 of it is still work you're gonna need to do like if I just tell you everything's mindset you don't lift your finger ever like you're not gonna get any results like that's critical so a lot of it is mindset because mindset's the toughest thing you're gonna go through like figuring out what creative works that's easy figuring out how to structure ad account that's easy getting results of Facebook ads that's easy the mindset side though is very difficult and it goes really deep down to stuff that's rooted inside of your mind that is beyond Facebook ads so and that's another complex topic right there but let's go further into this so again luckily in my entrepreneurship career I've realized early on um when I was doing a stock trading stock course on day trading and stuff that all the strategies were very easy the way you find stocks very easy but which screws up 99 of traders is that they can't handle their emotions and they have a bad mindset around advertising I mean mark uh day trading which causes them to make a lot of sporadic un um like not right decisions uh very sporadic not predictable and very emotionally charged and I find that stock trading and advertising is very closely related so let's go further so you need a rock solid mindset you need to remain calm you need to make emotions or you need to make decisions based off logic and not emotions that's a huge one right there a lot of advertisers and I've even struggled with this at periods of time where I made decisions based off emotions emotions and not logic so I see an ad's performing great when I campaigned at like a hundred dollars a day I'd go in there and I'd hurry up and go in take the budget to a thousand dollars a day and then I burn a bunch of money um two things right there one I had the emotion of excitement that this campaign was doing great and then I took an action to push up the spin which then happened to have a negative outcome of burning a bunch of money um so I got kind of greedy for a second happy for a second push it all up and then now I'm back in a negative mindset around it and then I have a negative mindset around facebook that's not working so you need to make decisions based off logic you need to make decisions based off emotions or making decisions based off emotions the single biggest way to lose I just bought anything you'll find that some people in your life are just very emotionally reactive to everything and you'll find these people likelihood they have high ups and high downs and these are the people that you can sometimes like are the easiest to make mad like the little things will just make them mad and they'll be super upset um and they're always like reacting like everything you're doing is reacting reacting reacting they're not taking a step back to think about things and a little bit be a little bit more calculated in terms of how they live their life but also to how they run their business and how they run their advertising campaigns so a reactive state of mind is a pattern of brain activity has become ingrained through repetition so again more reactive people and operating in a reactive state of mind is typically through repetition so say for example ad performance is bad you restructure your ad account and performance does good for a few days and then it goes back down to being bad so then what you do you're like oh what got me that first action what got me that first result of good performance while restructuring my ad account let's go test a different ad account structure restructure your ad account launch it back up boom does great and then does bad again and then eventually gets to the point where you keep doing that and it doesn't get you the results anymore you want it but you keep doing it because it's worked at some point and you never test any new creative you never test any new copy you don't look at seasonality of your product you don't look at consumer behavior all that good stuff and you fail to look at the whole picture and you just burn a bunch of money and then you end up to the point where either you quit your business or you reach out to an agency that helps solve everything for you so that's a big thing right there and again just looking back further at that mindset and that feedback loop perspective is this little chart right here so you have a triggering event that happens performance is bad negative thoughts you start thinking bad about what happens about um bad performance losing money going broke yada yada yada you have all these bad things so then you do emotional response and this is just where you start having some bad emotions and you start living in anger start living in rage start living in you know pain about your advertising stuff um and then your body reacts these emotions and stuff like that like yada yada you don't really kind of you don't you subconsciously have this happen to you but you don't really realize it in the moment um this is where you be a little bit more tense have your breathing like stuff like that like again this is more for something bigger but it still happens with facebook ads all the time so then you'll have a behavioral response so this is where you do something so bad performance a bunch of negative thoughts about losing money emotional response you just start feeling mad you feel starting upset you feel starts feeling down about yourself um your body reacts to that you know you start breathing differently a little heavier stuff like that and then your behavioral response oh i need a restructure my account boom you do it and then something either good or bad happens so now that you kind of understand the feed back loop perspective how can we dive further into this and actually break those apart how can we redesign your paradigm you have on facebook advertising so let's look at common feedback loops in advertising so number one and this is something i personally have also struggled with so like all of these are ones that i've personally struggled with and i've overcame to get to this point in my life this is not things that i'm just pulling off the wall these are actually things i can speak up from experience so just a very big note on that and the first one is the day trader day trader approach back when we basically took one of our first e-com brands one of our first bigger clients um we took them on as an e-com client and stuff and yeah there was a few different feedback loops but one of them was the day trader and the day trader you can spot this type of advertiser is when they're in the ad account every single day they're they have shopify next to them they have the ad account and they're constantly just looking at ads running they're turning things off turning things off on literally just in a few hours notice they're looking at total shopify revenue for today they're like why sales aren't coming up on shopify today i need to turn off some campaigns and you turn on some campaigns i need to um go find a new ad account structure i need to um i need to create a new ad as well i need i need to do all that and just it's it's information overload it's um just this big mess it's big big mess right there and i call the day trader approach because the just the way they're diversifying spin across things they're looking at a day maybe a day to two days a most of how they're making those decisions on performance and they're also looking like the day to two days on shopify in terms of where revenue's at so they're very like this inside of looking at various things going on they're not looking at the bigger picture not stepping back and trading um that's called swing trading where they're taking trades over a few weeks versus a day trading where it's literally every day they're in and out of positions and stuff and they're taking that approach with facebook ads which is very bad because just of how the algorithm works and just how things work with paid advertising so let's dive further into this so um they'll tell you the data trader approach and stuff and where does this stem from where does this approach stem from so first off it's high emotional attachment to the desired outcome so they're taking this approach because likelihood they are either working a very painful job and they're starting this e-com business to get out of it maybe they're an agency and you're an agency you're running ads for a client and the client's not doing good and you really are like emotionally attached to this client pay-in so that way you can pay your bills or you can you can have your own you know your agency grow and stuff like that you don't want to lose that client so there's different emotional attachments to that of that desired outcome of that you know like again you you want this e-com business to grow so you want to make sure these ads work you're an agency working with this client you want to make sure they stay on because again it helps your business and stuff like that and make you make money from it so you have a high emotional attachment to that desired outcome of things going well for you so you feel like you have to take all these actions to get them those results or to get your e-com business results and that's why you're looking at what's getting you those results and that's the ads manager you see one purchase two purchase three purchases robust so you're looking directly at lag indicators that's a whole nother topic right there but lag indicators basically in short or let's say for example if you're dieting you want to lose 20 pounds you're not looking at hey i'm losing 20 pounds i want to lose 200 pounds today you're looking at okay what do i need to do to get there to lose those 20 pounds and you're gonna look at the lead indicators of every day hitting your calories you know eating the meals and eating a training and you're focusing more on the training the calories and stuff or is that lag indicator of losing those 20 pounds but over time you still lose those 20 pounds because you're focused on what drives results so circling back to this um also another high emotional attachment is to the risk of money on the line so again even from an agency perspective the money thing and then uh from the client's perspective of the money they're burning every day on bad you know performance and stuff like that or or maybe just having to be in that ads manager every day to make sure you manage that money then you also this stems from the lack of understanding of how the algorithm works and the best practices for an ad account so i have a few videos on my channel now that literally show you step by step of what you need to do to get results with facebook ads so you can go train up on my channel with those videos right there um recently released one called like best ad account strategy or or best ad account management strategy something like that and actually show you exactly what you need to do to manage an ad account and how things work hitting those 50 conversions a week for your main campaigns um creative testing and how to create more creative and the importance of creative testing so you need to look at that you need to look at that um and then also to just the best practices for an ad account so let things run for a certain amount of spend before you turn it off you know um people spend like five dollars and add not see profits from and turn it off when their cost per acquisition 60 bucks and haven't even spent enough to cover their first cost per acquisition so gotta look at that so there's a lot of stuff that goes on and this can sometimes take a week or two weeks before you test a full batch of creative and a lot of it is just taking a step back like letting the algorithm do the work and the day trader approach is very very harmful to an account because what's going to happen is that constant need to take action you're taking action on the wrong stuff you're taking action on things that are again lag indicators where the lead indicator of performance for an account is creating new creative compelling creative creative that actually works really well um creating new copy creating new headlines um looking at ways to improve your product etc so like those things right there you're leading indicators and when you're taking a day trader approach on focusing on the lag indicators you're not looking at what got what gets you those results and it's very very very harmful and it's a very common loop i see all advertisers in now bad performance it's another common loop people do not understand how to react to bad performance in the account um typically it's the hey i need to go test new ad account structure maybe i need to test new creative or two they just they don't understand so they take a random action not calculated or anything like that they take a random action to make them feel better hey performance is bad so let's take a let's take an action let's just want you to create a let's you know set up a new structure that action may or may not be the best route to go the most logical action but they still take it because it's like a pat on the back to make them feel better that they took an action so the new loop is okay overall performance is is it overall performance or is it a singular ad that just didn't perform well and then also to what window frame am i looking at am i looking like this at a day frame or am i looking at this for a week or i'm looking like this for a 30 days if performance for the last 30 days overall has been down then obviously there's something here we're doing that's just not working um you know have we done a creative refresh lately no okay great we've identified our problem yes we have identified our creative refresh okay um what are other brands in our space are currently doing have they have we are they pulling back on spend maybe it's seasonality maybe like it's just a problem in the market right there you know is there like try to identify the key things is there a new website update we did is there um like looking through that sales process from click to landing page to fulfilled order and try to identify is there certain things that may have affected that overall performance over the last 30 days um assuming you've tested more creative and the things like that seven days same thing you can look at it from that perspective um but then also to looking at like a seven day window if everything is down in the last seven days again let's look at overall performance let's look at overall macro seasonality macro economics and stuff um for example right now today it is eight days from black friday no seven days from black friday today um and overall performance is very bad this week why people are saving their money for black friday you can test all the crate if you want everything like that you're not going to see performance due to everyone pull their money back so it's just not a great time to test new creative and test new products and stuff like that so when you run into that issue right there you have to understand there's something bigger at play and there's nothing in your control you can fix that so that's something to look at how many new ads have a test in the last seven days do i have new ads ready to launch that i can begin testing so hey i haven't tested any new ads in the last seven days okay cool do i have new ads ready i can launch no okay cool can i start creating a batch of new ads yes so i have all this time now because i don't have anything testing i don't have anything in the queue i don't have anything being worked on so like i need to sit down now for the next few days and plan out new creatives we can launch so there you go that's new loop i'm not taking the action of oh i'm gonna go restructure that account and go launch a new offer like all this i'm just focusing back on what's driving performance in the account now next loop creative testing it's a big one right here i see it all the time i tried creative testing but it doesn't work for me this is the biggest thing that i just want to hit on in this video and one of the biggest things this one and just the day trader approach because this happens all the time and i see it all the time so typically typically people will see this problem and they've only tested one or two new creatives so it's like oh you need to do creative testing okay so like the the current picture that's working is like a picture of a girl on working out and then they'll like okay let me go try new creatives so let's take that picture of that girl working out and then maybe she's doing like a bench press and then they'll go launch two new creatives of her doing like a squat and a bicep curl and like cool it didn't work i'm like yeah look what she tested you barely tested any variation and stuff so i highly recommend in your creative testing testing more variation um and there's so many different components so like you have the scene you have the colors you have the text on the screen you have if you're doing video the intro the thumbnail um the other 80 of the video like all of those are different components and you can really split those magnify them and split those up into different variations iterations um and then also to going and look out there for what's performing well for other people and mimicking those types of ads is really big too as well that's going to help you get a lot new creative ideas and to launch something similar to see how that helps out performance and everything and a lot of this i tried creative testing but it doesn't work for me it's because people fell have failed to understand the logic behind creative testing they believe that creative testing is like doing abo or cbo like hey i just launched a cbo campaign it's crushing it for me so like they think they need to go do a cbo campaign so they'll go set up a creative testing campaign launch junior creative boom doesn't work and they never do it again why oh it didn't work i tried it for me it doesn't work mike no you fail to understand that it's not the creative testing is not a strategy it's essentially like something you need to do repetitively every day it's like going to the gym you don't just go to the gym once and then be able to bench press 300 pounds you go to the gym consistently every day you work chest out every week to eventually hit to that point of bench pressing 300 pounds your lag indicator is the day you can bench 300 pounds but if you go to the gym every day with the expectations to bench 300 pounds but you can only bench 185 then you can't you're just gonna fail oh i tried benching 300 pounds it doesn't work for me you know i've tried working out i've tried going to work out bench press once this week at 185 and then next week i went to try 300 pounds i couldn't do it it doesn't work for me working chest every day no you felt to understand that these are simply lead indicator actions that you need to repetitively do over and over time before you can hit that final goal and that with every creative test it's you need to have logic behind it so for example we're going to launch two new videos um or we're going to take one video of our best performing video right now and we're going to put two new intros on it so i'll have like main video and then we'll have uh that same main video with a different intro and that same main video of another different intro so then these different intros is what we're testing in the creative testing so like we have logic behind we're not just going to put random different stuff up there we're like we're going to actually have some logic behind what we're testing and why we're testing it and this new loop will make you start to understand things a little bit better you'll test new creative weekly every week new creative you're working on in the background you're launching a new creative every monday and then tuesday through friday you're working on new ones okay and your sole purpose is to identify what works and what doesn't work and then we want to figure out what works and what doesn't work we want to do this for two things because now we understand what works we want to create more like that create more iterations of it um you know create some animations variations some gift variations um get some different actors but still to do the same thing different scenes like there's a lot more stuff we can dive further into and then we also understand what doesn't work and throughout our process of testing new stuff we can also further refine what doesn't work so maybe it's a specific type of scene it just doesn't work for this product then we'll understand that further as we create more iterations we may test that theory in further creative testing just to make sure that's true so this allows us to further refine our creative strategy and allows us to test and find winners a lot faster because we repetitively be doing it every week versus some people that do it only when they need to get results so they'll see results do good results go down figure out i need to do creative testing they'll start now find a new winner go up and stop creative testing as soon as performance goes up it's something that needs to be done weekly and that's also another loop i just even put in this video but it's something that needs to be done all right guys so i know this was a pretty um heart-eating video um definitely something different than kind of simply do but it's something i'm more wanting to get into as i as i made a promise you guys that i want to release more content i was going to put in the course and this is a big one right here um i could probably create 10 more videos around this and i will over time but this is just one of those videos that i really wanted to hit on and actually have another mindset video coming up so be on the lookout for that i want to thank you guys so much for watching this video make sure you hit that like button and hit
