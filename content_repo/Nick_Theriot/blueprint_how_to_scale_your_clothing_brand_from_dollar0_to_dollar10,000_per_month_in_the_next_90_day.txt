yo what's going on guys Nick Theriault here welcome back to my channel today I wanted to make a quick video to discuss the best way for a new clothing brand to start out with Facebook ads I'm actually going to give you some quite controversial advice for this video so let's jump right into it now going into it you're a brand new clothing brand you want to scale you want to start off with Facebook ads but you don't have a big budget to start off with so you try to run a few $5 $10 day campaigns you see no results what do you do you go look up YouTube bunch of videos and stuff and you'll land here best way to do it without spending a lot of money is to use Instagram influencers so what you do is you go ahead you go to Shopify you get your Facebook pixel set up you get your Facebook ad account set up you get all that stuff set up but you don't run Facebook ads you get all that set up so that way the pixel can start learning the audience that's purchasing and adding to cart and viewing your website and then you start spending money on influencers and I'm not talking about going and trying to find million plus follower influencers on Instagram and stuff and Facebook you want to try to stick with influencers between 10 to 50,000 followers you can go to 50 to 100 if you want to so you know 10 to 10 to 100,000 is pretty good but you want to start focusing on influencers and you want to make sure these influencers have a good following there all their followers like to comment on their ads I mean comment on their post get a good a bunch of get a bunch of likes they fit the culture of your brand and then what you do is you want to reach out to them and try to work out a deal nine times out of 10 influencers will wear your clothing if it looks cool and if they get it for free don't be that brand that's like hey would you purchase some of our clothing so you can be featured on our page don't be that person reach out to them get a good you know like I said make sure you do your due diligence make sure they're a good account to work with reach out to them get them some clothing get them to create some content for you to upload it to their Instagram which will get a bunch of traffic to your Instagram so you're getting a shout out some people you have to pay on top of sending them clothes for free some people you can send them for clothes for free and they'll be good but now what you're doing is you're driving a much targeted traffic to your website which the Facebook pixel is in the back right here picking all that data up and the reason why it's much more targeted is because if an influencer is wearing it they're like hey guys check out this awesome merch I got they're more inclined to go and actually purchase it because they have a very they have a higher degree of awareness for your brand and a much higher a much higher intent to go purchase it versus a cold audience ad where they don't even know who this brand is and they're seeing on their timeline pop up and it's like click and scroll past it an influencer is going to drive much better traffic to your website getting you a much better audience which will get you some more purchases and stuff so like I said I could spend a thousand dollars sometimes what a brand new clothing brand and they'll pick up a few sales if you go spend a thousand dollars right now Instagram influencers you're most likely going to make a good bit of money even with just about any clothing as long as it looks good so you start to get these purchases from Instagram influencers and you can start building out a system now you know once you start finding you kind of like way of doing it that gets results and you can keep doing this over and over and buying shout outs sending traffic to a website converting some building up that Facebook pixel data and then once you start getting a good amount of traffic good amount of sales I'm talking about you're probably about two to three thousand dollars in total revenue since you launched your brand now and probably two three thousand dollars revenue since in like the last 60 days that's a good like range to start with what you want to do is you want to start retargeting that traffic and you can watch this video right here point to it where I talk about how to do retargeting and stuff with Facebook ads and you can start retargeting that traffic so you're gonna run one I mean four out of the five campaigns I recommend the fifth one is the cold audience ads those four campaigns you start running those now and use the influencer traffic as cold audience traffic you're gonna have a very solid approach because that pixels be seasoned with full of people that's visit your website from that influencer who came with a high intent and now the retargeting is gonna help pick up those people who just didn't purchase yet for whatever reason so now you're gonna start making sales with the Facebook ads but it's mostly just picking up people from who didn't purchase from that influencer which is totally cool so now you're getting sales from two different channels you're starting to build some branding now because now you have ads going you have influencers you're working with now you're probably pushing three four thousand dollars a month maybe five thousand dollars a month in revenue and now you should have some a decent amount of profit set aside do not start cold audience ads with Facebook until you can spend at least fifteen hundred dollars a month with ads for just a cold audience side so now you have your retargeting ads you're already spending a few dollars a day on retargeting now you want to also set aside a good budget for the cold audience ads with Facebook and because you easily have over probably a hundred a hundred sales now hundred orders that's processed through on your website and processed through to Facebook pixel you can start running some lookalike audience campaigns and you can start testing some interest demographics now when you're starting these cold audience ads they're gonna be a lot more effective because the pixel has data on your ideal audience and you're also gonna have a lot more content from these influencers to use in ads you may even have some reviews now you can use for ads so starting off with influencers and then working your way up to Facebook ads as a clothing brand is one of the best things you can do because like I said I've worked a clothing for a four where he spent literally a thousand to two thousand dollars USD in ad spend and made a seller to whereas influencers we probably purchased twenty to fifty influencer shout outs with that amount of money it made four to five times that right there in revenue so hope this video helps you out guys if you're
