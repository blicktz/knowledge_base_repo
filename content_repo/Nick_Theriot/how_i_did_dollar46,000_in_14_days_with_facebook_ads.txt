yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terry and today i'm an exciting new video for you guys today we'll be talking about a recent case study that we've achieved where we did 46 000 in 14 days for a higher ticket men's fashion brand and we did all this with like a 5.9 or 6.9x row ass it's absolutely insane so that being said let's jump straight into it because i really want to show you guys this particular case study so it's actually a 6.51 row ass this is our little triple well screenshot if you're not using triple well you're sleeping on their rock you own a shopify store you have facebook ads and you want to make more money get triple well it's absolutely amazing for attribution and all that stuff like that and this is our screenshot from the first through the 14th did 46 000 in sales 6.51x row ass um just a little note for the net profit all this is is um total sales minus adsmen uh we don't actually have the uh the cogs and the shipping correctly set up so this net profit as much as we want it to be it's not completely correct it's actually probably close to around 15 to 20k um when you when you subtract shipping and cogs uh from that as well so here's the screenshot from the facebook ad account as well i can see right there we have our testing campaign our prospecting campaign um it's actually funny enough because this is a partner that came to us who is already watching our youtube videos and everything like that has done an amazing work from following the channel scaled up the brand very well so he was already using our creative testing campaign our scaling campaign concept we um we originally you know taught on this channel and we basically just came in and amplified it um a little bit better so i'm gonna show you guys exactly in 10 specific steps exactly what we did to achieve this performance so step one we went in the account and we created a prospecting campaign with one broad ad set again cbo uh we originally launched this campaign like a hundred dollars or three hundred dollars a day in that perspective right there uh we launched that campaign we created one ad set um this particular partner already had proven success in usa australia and hong kong um so we grouped up all of those specific countries why because we're not running different languages those countries we're using the same language for all three countries if we were using a different language per country we create a separate campaign per country but because we're not doing that and we have stable results and and um scalability in all those particular countries we're grouping them together so it just depends on the scenario we have another case of becoming soon where it's gonna talk about how we did this and it actually was a huge mistake so but that's again it's a relative you know relative situation in that center right there so once campaign optimized for purchases conversions all that good stuff like that step two is we looked through the account and we found the top three to six evergreen ads lifetime for products in stock so we looked at the account we looked at lifetime we looked we literally clicked on the ads tab to see all ads by lifetime spent and we pulled the top three to six ads that had the most ad spend and also best row ass so we could really see what's the winners and we tossed them all into this prospecting campaign and just let it run this is our initial stage of just entering in and you know getting some stuff live into the account step three is we built um once we got our prospecting campaign started we started to build new assets because yes we have our prospecting campaign going on we're you know it's starting to do good but we know for a fact that if you just launch campaign let it run without building any new ads that's going to slowly deteriorate your business you need to continuously build new ads and find new winning ads to scale the business to new levels so step three started building our new assets and the way we did this was we started on our market research first we wanted to look at our market and we wanted to see what is the main desire that is driving people to purchase this product okay so different desires um one product can have multiple different desires okay so think of a 25 year old male okay and he's going to the store to purchase some chicken breasts okay and he purchases chicken breasts and his desire at the time might be to um you know just more protein in that chicken breast and that's right there uh because he you know he likes to lift weights and stuff like that so his desire is that he's eating that chicken breast because of the protein content inside of it okay another 25 male male might be purchasing that chicken breast just to cook a good dinner night and he really he wants to purchase that chicken for that specifically so what is the main reason why people are purchasing was that main desire and for this is a men's fashion brand hired higher ticket and they want to look good and they want to feel feel confident in what they're wearing that they look good feel amazing just all that good stuff like that you can also there's some other desires too like they want to impress girls they want to increase their perceived social status in that sense right there you know they want to look high value there's some other desires that are also too um quite acceptable as well but we want to pick the main ones that are main of our market um you know uses next thing is the market awareness so this is where we pick up the conversation at in the market and for us it's solution aware okay um if they need new clothing they know they just need new clothing they don't know it's like oh i don't know what solution is you know they don't know like oh i have a problem any clothing i don't know what to do about it they already know what to do about they know they just need to go out there and buy new clothing they know the solution but they don't know our solution yet and that's the key thing i want to hit on they don't know about our solution yet and that's what we have to position this product is that they're already solution aware we don't need to say do you need new clothing no fuck that what we need to do is we need to hit on why our product stands out as the best solution compared to all of the others okay so we pick up the conversation at solution aware now market sophistication again this is um you know basically how we need to position the offer and that's it right there and we know that hey we can't just say state the claim like level one market sophistication is just stating the claim you know men's jeans that's it literally it's all you have to write and boom or you know men's jeans with new bell buck or something like that um we're level five uh this particular pair of clothing has been done repeatedly already so we really just need to hit on the identity they're selling and we're selling that through the creative as well um and then really talk about the unique mechanism well why are these better so why are these better plus the identity that people want to achieve okay so let's say for example if someone wants to you know has a really good desire to level up their social status and that's in right there we want to show off a bunch of people really high quality creative that have a very high perceived social status wearing this particular product and that's going to make people want to purchase it due to the perceived social status and identity they they think they will achieve by purchasing this particular product and then the unique mechanism is just why it's better cool yes it gives me an amazing perceived social status but also too is the product worth it as well okay what makes it unique about it that is better than all the competition now step four we start building out the copy um we basically take this brief right here and then we start writing a few different copies that go around it so that's step four then step five we build out the creatives um we really want to make sure that these creatives speak to our audience and resemble these specific things right here um you know we also want to resemble our persona um you know who they are or who do they want to become so since we're selling them an identity it might be more around the lines of who do they want to become in that sense right there and then lastly we want to focus on what makes our product unique and perfect solution for them so here's your identity here's the product here's why it's better and here's also um you know what makes it unique that's right there and then what we do is go back to the ad account and we create our testing campaign so now that we have copy and create if we can start testing we can go to our testing campaign now and we can launch that particular campaign again just a simple testing campaign optimized for purchase conversions abo going through all of this i recently just uploaded a video how to build a campaign facebook ads campaign from scratch and i also have a seven part series um that goes over how to run facebook ads and that series right there you can look at video five six and seven which is um the three parts that are specifically for the ads manager in that sense right there then we have step number seven so create your campaign and stuff um basically we're going to do is in step seven is we're going to launch new batches of ads we're going to keep three to four ads per ad set and we're also going to keep these relative together so for example um batch one we'll have three ads all the same copy batch two we'll have three ads all the same copy um or batch and batch three might have um three different copies against one type of ad we want to keep the variables as closely um or keep the variables as it's a minimal in terms of only testing one variable at a time so either copy or creative and then you have a few different variations around that and then basically what we're going to do is we're going to launch this we have just one ad set with three to four ads in each one uh we're running the ad sets it look you can run these at ten dollars a day for oh two weeks to get enough data or you can run them at a hundred dollars a day for two three days um you definitely want to give it a few days but also you want to be spending enough to get a you know result at least one x two extra target cpa um for these ad sets again you want to do an ad set budget optimization campaign because we want to four spend to them um so that way facebook can test them out and everything like that and then again we're going to launch these every single week every single week we're launching new ads um again it's going to depend on how much you're spending with with depending on like you know how many ads you need to test a week i'm going to count spending 15k a day we need to test anywhere from 20 to 30 new ads a week i have an account spending 100 200 bucks a day we can test you know three to six new ads a week it just depends on that and also too depends on your ability to create good ads if you're terrible at creating ads and account 100 to 200 a day my first test 100 a week just because you purely lack the skill set to create a good ad and you have a lower hit rate if you have a very very high hit rate you can create fewer ads um on a weekly basis to match your spin level now step number eight we're going to let this run and we're actually going to verify the ads using tripwell to make sure on their winners so here you go you can see right here cmcmc8 we spent 333 on this ad facebook's reporting a 0.45x roas triple is reporting a 4.13 roas so we're gonna be running this ad in our main campaign because triple has shown that it works and i trust tripwell over facebook ads step number nine we're gonna move that winning ad into our prospecting campaign to continue to build up our ads our ads inventory of proven winners and things that we can continue to push money in and then step number 10 is on a daily basis we want to track our revenue and our spin daily in a google sheet so you can literally just this is literally google sheet anyone can go create there's nothing special about it just date revenue which revenue is your shopify reported revenue spin is your facebook reported spin and you know if you have google or if you have other platforms you can also put that all added up and then these are just um itemized things so shopify facebook google so you can see right here getting 19 extra hours on this day um you can see how little spin is and you can see as we increase spin cells go up as well so that's why we have this mer sheet because facebook again facebook was only showing what like a 1.57x row as and if we were purely just making decisions off facebook we would be doing very badly we would not have been able to scale like this but because we track our revenue on a daily basis we know where we at we know how much we're spending we know how much revenue is and we keep increasing that spin based off this performance right here okay we look at overall robust you shouldn't be looking at facebook specific for us or google specific for us should be looking at overall revenue um divided by spin okay and last three days at or above target arrest increased spin by 20 percent last three days below target arrest decreased spin by 20 percent okay very simple um and your target rush should be more like you're you're just above like your break even arrest and that's it right there so we can just keep pushing pushing it's pushing which will allow you to scale up um your business revenue so yeah that's pretty much it that's exactly how we did 46 000 in 14 days um like a 6.2 5x row as and this is literally how we do it for all of our accounts and it's a very step-by-step process so hope you guys enjoyed this
