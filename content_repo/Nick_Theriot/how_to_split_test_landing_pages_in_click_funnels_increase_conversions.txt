Hey, what is going on guys Nick here and today I want to bring a video regarding click funnels and a few steps You can take to split testing your first funnel So we're gonna build a quick landing page real quick live on the page and then we're gonna split test it And I'm gonna show you some tips and tricks as you build your page So too many people when they build a funnel they immediately put all kinds of crap on their page and They launch it and they get no conversions and it's so hard to tell why you're not getting any conversions so What I recommend when you build a funnel you build it as simple as possible and then you split test it all the way up with higher Bigger landing pages so you work your way up So you do like you know a page with just a simple headline and that box insert information to a page with a headline box information And then also as video testimonial and you slowly add this information to the page So that way you can work your way up and figure out what is optimizing what is working for your page Versus you know just building a huge page with tons of different variables, so We're gonna go right here into click funnels and we're gonna build the funnel real quick do something very simple I'm gonna add new And we're just gonna create a funnel ourselves. We want to collect emails give a funnel name Facebook Secrets By the way, if you haven't downloaded my free guide Facebook ad secrets you can click the link in the description Take you to my personal site and then other free tools and training boom or I just have the direct link to it below and And group tag this is how you can organize your your funnels menu next area This will be all the funnels related to my personal brand Give it a load All right, and we're gonna do like I said always start off with something simple so many people try to go for these really high-end Landing pages honestly, I like just a super clean opt-in or personally I'll just create my own landing page from scratch, but I am going to Do the super clean opt-in And then we'll edit page All right, and then now here is it's like I mean literally the whole funnels almost finished as another thing I love about click funnels how easy it is structure everything what I want to do is So for instance, whatever your Facebook calls action is so like right now I'm running a free The guide secrets guide and it's like download And then it's three Facebook ad secrets To getting 100 customer upper Tunisies in the next 60 days So that's like my thing and it's a hold up free PDF Guide So that's like my quality action on my specific Facebook ad So you really want to just come there and you want to copy it You know the exact quality action and repaste it on your landing page because it's a psychological thing When people are clicking through advertisements that it stays congruent with all your advertisements So if you have a hot headline that says download now and this one just says get your free PDF guide Just that small thing is going to tweak it to our mind when they get to this page and it says get your free PDF guide put your email below For three three Facebook ad secrets, etc. And then for on your landing page It says or your Facebook guy says download now, you know download your free PDF guide now You want to try to keep your headlines and stuff congruent as possible So I'm gonna so not copy that and then I'm gonna do is I'm going to Bold this And I think I have customer opportunities and then I'm gonna put down here Put Enter your email below to receive your free copy All right, you know what I'm gonna do PDF guide Boom and then you know it's your email address to get it and then I hear I'm gonna put It's Uh See download your guide now Boom I got a landing page built I can integrate it right here.

I'm just gonna do this SEO metadata real quick Boom boom and then let's preview it real quick So there we go we pretty much got it set up so what a lot of people would do is they come there and they build this whole landing page They'll come there and add some pictures to it the lots of testimonials that everything to the landing page at first and then run some fresh Ads to it when they run those fresh ads to it. They have no clue what is not working Is it the page not loading properly? You know when you put a bunch of information on the page it takes longer to load So if you have too much stuff going on the page, you don't know what specific element is not working.

So with the landing page super basic like this and Literally just having it like that and especially unless you are selling a product that's two thousand dollars more fifteen hundred dollars more some really high-end product It's gonna cost you're gonna have to add testimonials and stuff like that So if you get a lot of people in on page and not buying in that's a problem. So um, just putting a Sicit a simple page like this people are clicking on it and you're getting no conversions then there's obviously you know another error But this is for basically Keeping it super simple and then now you can save Let's exit out and what we're gonna do is we're gonna run a split test of this page So say for instance after you got some conversions already and now you can come there and split test it with a slightly Variation right here and we're gonna duplicate the page from opt-in because that's this page right here And we're gonna edit the page and then I have a video testimonial I Can grab Just have to let it let all this load Get a new macbook guys very soon so be the new 2018 pretty much max out as possible and It's me so much nicer to making videos on And then let me come here and just grab a random video Boom Boom So I come right here. It's my page and then now what I can do is I can also add in a you know split test so You want when a split test you only want to change one element It's just like running a science lab test back in middle school high school days where you know You do these tests and stuff now like oh you only control one thing You got to keep your thing control and you only want to change one variable This is throughout all marketing if you can lay that one principle into anything you do marketing related It's gonna blow up your results and I can jump out to make a full Facebook guide to that and you know, it's probably gonna be a digital product you can buy But if you can do that one thing that is huge and it's gonna change your results So we only want to change one variable in this landing page because we change more Then we don't know what's going on if this page gets less conversions.

So we only want to do one thing. So What else would be what else would incite people entice people to basically get this page? It's probably a testimonial so cuz You know three Facebook ads secrets to getting hundred custom opportunities next 60 day 60 days So obviously I know it's a free PDF guide covering that but what are people saying about it?

You know, why should I get this other people getting results? Well, let's add a video testimonial. So now the new column right there Click on this add new element I'm gonna type video Go to settings YouTube paste the video save and preview And there we go now we have a video 2 on the page So now what I would do is I would run these two side by side I Can't give you an exact number of how many conversions I would recommend I know Personally this funnel right here for me is Converting at three dollars per lead.

So every about a hundred dollars are spending about 30 leads. I Personally would test this page for good, you know 50 ish, you know 30 to 50 leads That would go through if you're if you're you know spending way more and you know getting less leads You know, I definitely recommend at least You know 10 15 leads or you know Where it makes sense because if you just basically if just one page gets one more lead than the other and you say oh, you know This is it You know, that's not enough. You need to definitely look at a split test To see how many leads are getting based off, you know by like a percent difference over maybe five seven days Run it like that over a specific timeframe But I mean if you're getting hundreds of leads a day Then you can definitely You know run it for a short period of time So but um, so now you have your two variations right here and what I'm gonna do is I'm just brought the traffic in the middle because we're gonna do a 50 50 split Some people you know, they like to do like oh, it's still 80% of traffic here and 20% of traffic here But basically all this does is click funnels automatically Flip the page by each view so let me apply changes.

So there we go. Our funnel is ready to go And I'll actually show you a second so Let's see if we can get it to split tests visit the funnel URL And there we go as our first page and unless if we visit again if I'll show the other one Maybe not Maybe not but either way, it's pretty accurate with I think it's goes by the IP address Splitting it by separate people, but if we go right here to stats And we go right here to opt-in We can see our control and our variation and we'll be able to see the percentage conversion rate of each one You can also change the time frame to if you already had a funnel that was optimizing Or going so and basically like I said when you get the results that you can kind of clearly see a picture, you know Maybe run if like five to seven days Especially if you're converting every day if you're converting a lead every week, you know If you're selling a super high-end product, you have to run it long time So, you know, it's just you need to at least get some results in there to where you can see a percentage different because just one to two Opt-ins more than the other one Unless you have a page that's not optimizing and it's not converting at all And then you do a split test and start getting one to two options a day or a week or a month depending on your you know You know what you're running then You know you about make that decision at a sooner rate So you'll kind of know when you're running these two pages, but what happens when you basically find your winner what do you do? Blake funnels makes it super easy to pick a winner so they'll even say they'll even give you a confidence score right here of how much I like they think it is but say for instance if this is the winner which You know whatever one you think all you got to do is literally click declare this winner Are you sure and then basically delete this page and just put this one as a primary hit?

okay and Then now you can create your next variation so you never wanted to stop just because you're running one split test of one little element That's good But there is so much you can split tests and it's unreal and sometimes you know You got to keep yourself from going too crazy over it But you know there's literally a study of the colors of like the buttons That's another one to split test the title, you know this free PDF guy should do red or green or blue or you know different ones like that three Facebook ad secrets to getting hundred customer opportunities the next day Should I do this in capital letters or lowercase letters? She's video testimony then you put a headline right here saying what other people are saying or just leave the video testimony like that Do I need to put a picture of the guide right here? What a picture like a like a book cover looking thing would do that better or not?

Do I need to test this text make it white and this is a back black ground or leave it as a black back arrow This grayish background and maybe do red text or there's so much little things you can split test With adding a picture to me on this and me saying something like you know about Nick Terry or something like that like about the author You know just building that so trust with the customer You know people need to know like and trust you before they buy anything from you So if you can kind of build a little bit of that put that on the page with the video testimonials and you know You got to work your way up, but like I said You want to focus on one specific variable at a time because if you do too many variables, you're going to be lost You're not going to know what you changed So if I knew this page was converting a lot less than the other one that we just delete it The only thing I changed was the video testimonial so I just simply know that hey a video testimonial doesn't work for me And I'm gonna go make another change or maybe I need a different video testimonial Maybe people aren't relating to that specific bit video testimonial all those things or psychology and little stuff that goes into marketing digital marketing And if you can get a good grasp on that, it's gonna help you out your marketing a lot So guys, I hope y'all enjoyed this video if you need click funnels Get the link below it's an affiliate link it costs you nothing to use my affiliate link to get it and it helps me To keep making these videos and stuff So and if you want the free Facebook ads guide that I was talking about I also put the link in the description where you can check that out Make sure you like comment and subscribe and you have a great day.
