what is going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriault here and today I'm coming at you with 10 lessons I've learned after spending over a million dollars on Facebook ads in 2020 before we get started on this video make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe but for videos new videos every other day helping you out with Facebook ads marketing helping the e-com business owners to succeed in 2021 let's get started guys okay guys so my 2020 recap I'm gonna do another video because we've done over three million dollars in sales in 2020 I'm gonna do another video going over some more more strategic stuff of things I've learned but for this particular video it's just gonna be in general things I've learned lessons I've learned more importantly through trial and error and like big key things it's really made an impact on my advertising game so I apologize for the lighting as well because the lighting is probably horrible right now on this camera but let's get started so 2020 recap we spent over 1.1 million dollars on Facebook ads this is divided between 13 different clients we've serviced in 2020 all of them are e-commerce clients and 12 out of 13 you Shopify we've generated over 3.1 million dollars in revenue that's literally just ad revenue we've probably done more than that if we actually tie everything in because Facebook under reports this is literally just inside the Facebook ads manager showing you revenue regenerated average ROAS the 2.8 typical Facebook average industry average is about 3 to 4x so it's a little below average but like every great below average joke yeah there's just let's just keep going forward um we serviced 13 clients again uh we had two clients hit their first ever six figure months and two clients made their first seven figures and I know that sounds crazy 13 clients you divide that by you know 3.1 million um we had two clients that pretty much made up majority of that 3.1 million and then we had like a few other clients um that they probably only spent a few thousand dollars and I'm gonna go I'm gonna dive deeper into as that's one of the lessons I've learned in my thing so lesson number one keep things simple and organized uh when it comes down to your strategy when it comes down to your ad creation your naming conventions in terms of the campaign the ad set and the ad you need to have things organized having things organized allows you to be more efficient with inside the Facebook ads manager um you need to have a simple system to create new ads to create new ad copy and then two is you need to have a strategy you understand I turn off you know x ad set after x spin after x days if ROAS is this uh same thing for ads same thing for campaigns you need to have a simple strategy you can follow in terms of top funnel middle funnel bottom bottom of funnel what campaigns you create and you can't just be going inside the ad account and looking like a little puppy shitting all over itself you need to be accurate you need to be keep things simple keep things organized have it all written down on paper this is what I'm following follow if you're testing strategies follow that exact strategy you're going to test for 30 days see how it works if it doesn't work then write down a new one and follow that for 30 days to see if it works and if it doesn't do a new one but once we kept our strategy simple you know we limited ourselves only a few campaigns we stuck within those campaigns we had a very simple like straightforward process on how we test ad set test add our results blew through the roof and it wasn't until we did that that we really saw the big change inside the agency in terms of how efficient we were we're maximizing our time um so we that's a huge thing keep things simple focus on things that gets results only and stay organized now lesson number two is track our key metrics um there's a lot of times where like we're just receiving we're getting a lot of input every day in terms of yesterday's data last seven days last lifetime and stuff but the problem is when you're just looking at that data you have nothing relative to compare it to so what we're working on right now or what i'm trying to work on right now is is a google sheet um like a dashboard it shows like yesterday's data then we have a week over week a month over month and um you know year over year metrics so that way we're understanding what our cpm right now is relative to yesterday our last seven day average stuff like that so um understand your metrics your soft stats your your click-through rate keep that on keep that over one percent your cpc your cost per click keep that under a dollar um cpms are different for every niche so i can't really tell you about cpms but if it's you know your yours are currently um really really really high compared to previous then maybe there's something going on with your ad um maybe they're really low scale that puppy up you've been blessed uh funnel metrics you're at the cart rate your bandit cart rate your um abandoned checkout rate your conversion on the website because something as simple as a little website change could destroy off ad funnel and you're wondering why and you could have picked it up quickly if you just looked at your funnel metrics on a day-to-day basis so that's all stuff you need to look at uh so you need to understand all these key metrics and not just look at purchases and ROAS because purchasing ROAS or lag indicators those are things that you see at the end whereas your lead indicators or your day-to-day things that um you know you can perform repeatedly to get your lag indicator which is your ROAS your revenue lesson number three is manage emotions manage your expectations your mindset how how well balanced you are as a marketer is really going to determine your uh success with facebook ads if you're someone that's just emotionally charged and just keep jumping in the ads manager and emotionally making decisions not following your strategy you're going to have a hard time so do not rush to scale um we've had this with one of my consulting clients the other day where i told them hey just leave all that sets 20 to 20 a day or 40 per day and they went ahead and decided to raise one up as soon as i got one sale because the ROAS was good after just one sell of course the ROAS was good because it barely got to spend any and they quickly took it from 20 a day all the way up to 100 today like i didn't tell you scale it tells you just leave it do not rush to scale if you get a few sales follow your strategy only do what your strategy says now for us it's hey RAS is good we let this run for three days without touching it let's scale up by 20 per day then we'll also try bigger campaigns with heavier budgets now again don't make emotionally charged decisions if you go in the ads manager because you need to pay rent next month and you know you're doing this econ business by yourself with you know you know you're keeping it low budget and you're trying to pay rent next month don't go ahead and jump in the ads manager all right let's scale everything try to push as much profit out and then you crush the whole thing or maybe you're a business owner trying to hit a revenue goal so you try to push as much uncalculated actions you perform a bunch of uncalculated actions that completely destroy the ads manager and always make sure you have money prepared before you spend it so for bigger econ businesses are spending you know hundreds of thousands per month we we both understand you don't have that um you know it's kind of reliant but you know once you scale up to that point you you are essentially you you have everything nailed down but for newer businesses don't go spend fifteen hundred dollars on facebook ads if you don't have fifteen hundred dollars to spend so only spend marketing when you're starting out have the money prepared before you spend it and again if i didn't say it already stay disciplined to your strategy and your systems now lesson number four do not install the facebook ads app your girlfriend will hate you your husband will hate you your boyfriend your your significant other is going to hate you if you install this app you are going to be way too emotionally tied to it and be checking it throughout the day for no reason because there's no key actions you can take by seeing that app every hour all it's going to do is going to fluctuate your mood cells are good this hour oh my mood's good cells are bad next hour oh my mood's bad again so do not install that app there is no reason you need this app on your phone just take it from me i've spent way too much time over in 2020 looking at this app and i've never needed it once the only time i've ever really needed it was on christmas day when i didn't have my laptop near me and i needed to hurry up and check the ads manager because an ad that was it could literally get this company sued was running because one of their interns turned it on that's it so do not install this app um only check the facebook ads manager like i literally only check the facebook ads manager one and two times per day usually once in the morning to look at yesterday's data and then like you know maybe midday towards the end of the day i check it again just to see how campaign performance is doing because again i i have very disciplined strategy and my strategy does not require me to sit in front of the ads manager you know looking like some stock trader that's like every second oh raise it by five dollars right here and no that's unrealistic expectations that's unrealistic things you have um envisions you have about facebook guys you don't need any of that so a lot of in which we're gonna get to next or well a second um a lot of my time is spent on bigger picture things in terms of creatives ad copy offers angles the more important stuff the ads manager i'm simply just raising lower in budget i'm checking ads every few days turning things off and that's it that is it now smart start off with small budget testing again it's another reason why i stay so calm is because i start off with small budget testing i don't create a new ad and just go spend a hundred dollars a day testing it um so i'll spend like ten dollars a day to test new creatives and like forty dollars a day to test new audiences keep in mind this is on accounts that spend anywhere from a thousand to five thousand dollars per day and i'm spending you know maybe 40 bucks to test new audience and ten bucks to test new creative very low budget and the stuff that works we really start to push so that's a big key right there now lesson number six and this is something that i really really really learned in 2020 um especially when the agency started because we we really started working with e-commerce clients in september of 2019 um then january of 2020 i was like let's take on as many e-com clients as we can and then that way what we can do is we can just get them all results and really crush it for them and we just take revenue like a percentage of their revenue and that's how we make all of our money so this is gonna be more agency advice right here um but sometimes it's really not the um it's the product not the client so we've worked with all amazing clients in 2020 it was not a single client that's just a bad person all of them are amazing people very loyal to their vision but sometimes it's just the the product market fit is just not there and as an agency owner you know we we drew everything we can to you know get a client to be successful and sometimes we tried everything with some of these clients um we signed on 13 clients in 2020 four of them were all like perfect amazing clients amazing products the other nine clients were absolutely amazing but their products just were not product market fit and also to the only four clients that really succeeded in 2020 had all of these factors right here high average order value at least a 60 profit margin doing at least 30k per month in revenue when we signed them on has products we can upsell slash cross scale and also realistic goals we talked to this a client before where they were trying to like do you know they're spending like a thousand dollars a day and they're trying to spend like ten thousand dollars a day the next week and they weren't even profitable like whoa we got to back up there's a lot of new things we have to do first before we can even do that so um if you're an e-com agency this has worked extremely well for us this criteria before we sign on our clients and we learned it the hard way so out of 13 clients who signed on 2020 only four out of those nine had this criteria um we picked we pulled this out after the first two are super successful then we use this criteria to filter out the next two those were super successful so obviously there's something with this formula right here that's working really well for us whereas the other nine they didn't have a proven product very very low budget um and then also to maybe some unrealistic goals and stuff like that so really bad now lesson number seven is understand the consumer buying behavior now this again is going to be different for every single business owner that's looking at this or different niche every niche would be different because like for example january is a slow for most industries but if you own a gym wear brand right now or if you own anything in the gym space you're probably seeing some really good results right now because january everyone's doing the new year new you but uh this for us was like the biggest things we've noticed so you know we're like hey why ain't facebook ads working right now maybe it's my funnel maybe something like that and sometimes you need to pull back and look at the bigger perspective you have to understand that people are buying and you also have to understand what is the general circumstance the general kind of behavior people are are expressing right now um you know what what are people thinking right now what's what are people you know how they're saving their money and stuff like that so like january super slow for most industries because people have a buyer hangover from black friday and december so january it's very slow for paid advertising august and pretty much from january to august it's pretty clean like from february to september or from september to july we crush it like you know besides like holidays and there's certain weeks in the summer that might be a little bit down because people are starting to take vacations and stuff but otherwise it's pretty good so august is like our next big is like a big vacation month we noticed um also back to school people are pulling back money to spend on other stuff and focus it on school money and stuff for their kids again different markets will be different uh november people stop spending money up until black friday december it's usually only one or two good weeks because people just spend all their money on black friday they don't want to order something after christmas the week before christmas they barely want to order because they want to make sure it comes in for christmas so you only left one or two good weeks most holidays are a 50 50 coin flip whether it's a really good um like holiday or not outside events so like this year we had covet we had protests um that's getting like political things or anything like that uh we had a lot of big events and we noticed when some of these events were really really really really trending hard we seen either we seen a big fluctuation in sales um and then obviously big news just anything really really really really big news when the uh the stuff that happened in dc uh this this is like the third or second week of january for me right now but first week of january when they had that big stuff that happened in the dc capital uh we noticed a big drop in results and since it's been staying in the news we've also been seeing a big drop we've like seen a pretty hard drop in results since then and nothing really picked up since then so i'm not sure if it's completely correlated to it but you just have to understand how these outside factors do have an effect on your facebook advertising now lesson number eight is ride the waves so when now that we discussed how like there's some good waters and bad waters you need to understand when there's time to scale and when you need to pull back and that's a big thing for lesson number eight ride the waves so when you ride the waves you're essentially is when the water's smooth and it's going great scale as hard as you can push out every drop squeeze out every penny as you can and when the waters are rough pull back don't try to hold ten thousand dollars a day in ad spend if you just can't because waters are rough right now pull back to a comfortable level i know a lot of people back in october and november of 2020 when the election was going on and crazy results high cpms and all that i know a lot of people that scale back from ten thousand dollars a day to a thousand dollars two thousand dollars a day in ad spend um you know a few of my clients we pulled them back from like five thousand dollars a day to thousand dollars a day so we got to do a lot of pulling back to find a new normal for their business for a little while so and again some people have different goals some people care less about roass and just trying to get as much spin much choir as much customers as they can so it might differentiate for different people now lesson number nine is three ways to increase revenue um you need to understand this and apply this as often as you can so there's three ways to increase revenue for a business you can increase the average order value which is the easiest you can literally probably just go increase the product price on all of your products by 10 percent and then there you go you just increase the average order value um you know maybe a bundle deal different little things like that free shipping over x amount these are little things you can go and take action on right now now increase order frequency might be a little harder because you may have to actually go ahead and create a new product maybe create some new marketing material and stuff like that so it might be just a little bit more work to increase order frequency something we recently did was just start to do a quick upsell after seven to ten day on a seven to ten day purchase audience inside facebook ads record a chart ceo video tell them thank you for the order here's a 10 off some type of offer that they can go take action on now and it gets a quick upsell and obviously increases our frequency now the hardest is to acquire new customers this is spending more atop a funnel you know exerting more energy more money into converting cold audiences into new customers so you have to understand the three ways to increase revenue you have to be working on these at all times understand the easiest ones all the way to harder ones start taking action on the easier ones and slowly work your way up all the way to acquiring new customers and it's going to make a huge difference in your business now lesson number 10 finally um this is the last big lesson and uh you know to really show you guys and that is focus on the bigger picture so 80 of your time is going to be outside of the ads manager regardless of what platform you're advertising on 20 of your time will be inside the facebook ads manager or one of these platforms the other 80 of of your time whether you're an agency you need to understand the product better or you're a business owner you're trying to figure out new ways you know new customer avatars to go after with your product then after you figure out those customer avatars different advertising angles in which we can promote that product to that avatar then different offers we can squeeze into those angles that our avatar would love and then the creative content the copywriting and the videos and the photo content all that type of stuff that helps capture that customer avatar's attention to sell that product so 80 of your time you should be constantly creating new new one of new things like this to achieve new results um and yeah 20 of your time is being inside the facebook ads manager snapchat tick tock youtube google focus on the bigger picture stop staying playing close stop playing small minded when you master all of this you can care less if facebook ads go off the grid the next day because you can apply what you apply with all this to just snapshot ads and boom apply it to tick tock ads and boom apply to youtube ads and boom you're good applied at google ads you focus on all of this and these are just tools just tools in which you dish um you target your ideal avatar to disrupt or not disrupt um give them or acquire them try sorry have a little hard time to speak in here so yeah spend 80 of your time on this 20 of your time with this now come on if you just opened up the facebook ads manager and you need to spend some time to learn how to use it the best strategy i completely understand but if you just focus all your time on the new strategy the next audience to target the next ad copy to create like the next like you know structure and stuff like that you're gonna miss out on all of this and you can get results take it from someone who's done it so yeah guys i really hope y'all enjoyed this video um i'm not even gonna switch back my camera because the lighting is absolute dog right now that's why i hate filming in later in afternoon
