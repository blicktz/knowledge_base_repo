hey everyone Nick terrier here and in today's video I want to share with you how to build a good routine for 2019 without waking up before 5 a.m. now this is a very common controversy that it's pushed a lot on these Instagram pages motivational pages that hey if you don't wake up before 5 a.m. you're not going to be successful that you know in order to be successful you know wake up at your 5 a.m.

you need to start you know early as hell in the day and that's not completely true there's some slight false this to that and I want to share with you guys basically how to build a good routine for 2019 morning routine work routine and just an overall balance in your life for 2019 but between work and life and I'm gonna show that to you in this video and I'm gonna show you my routine and the progress progress I made of how I developed a good routine some of the thoughts and stuff to act yourself as you're creating a good routine as I'm not making this video to be like here's my routine and here's what you need to do I'm creating this video to show you how I've developed my routine and how you too can create a good routine for your life because I honestly believe that no one should have the same routine and it that's not like you know I'm not saying that you can't go copy someone else's routine I'm saying is that no one's routine is going to be the same because everyone thinks differently everyone acts differently their body responds to different stimulus differently they do different work they have different sleep patterns and with all that combination not every single person is going to like this routine I have and that's okay with me I'm okay with 50% of people in the comment section below saying my routine might suck because it works for me and that's what matters and that's what should be for you too you shouldn't be being hard on yourself because you can't you know fulfill the same routine as say Tai Lopez Gary V you know Warren Buffett you shouldn't feel bad if they put their routine up online and they could you couldn't replicate that routine you know most people believe that a good routine needs to be strict you know you have to be which is true in a sense but what defines strict you know they believe that they need to wake up at 5 a.m. that you know they shouldn't do anything else but work they shouldn't spend their money they shouldn't go out they shouldn't enjoy life that they need to work 12 hours straight with no breaks at all they need to sacrifice their friends their hobbies what they love to do and they basically just need to live under a rock for years before they can become successful which is far from the truth they become infatuated with one area of their life and they degrade the other values there are the areas in their life and you know they get thrown off balance and that's not a good routine that's a very bad work-life balance and you know if you love if you love that that's okay but for someone who's trying to strive for a good balance across their life then that's not something you're gonna want to do if you want to be able to enjoy life enjoy the fruits of your labor enjoy with your friends enjoy your work you need to have a balance too much of one thing it's not good for you but a good balance of everything in your life creates life empowerment and that's what i'm striving for and that's what i want to show you today how my routine and how it empowers me i'm happy i'm you know i get a lot of work done provide the results that my business and you know i can build my businesses i make a decent income you know between all of this you know it's a i live you know a fairly good life overall and what if i told you all that was nonsense you know this very strict routine um you know what defines a good routine something that you can stick to something you can do daily it doesn't throw you off balance and that's what i want to show you today guys just you know how you can develop a routine that's something you can do daily something you can stick to it doesn't throw your life off balance and that's what most of you don't have you know you think you you lack say work every day you you started a business and say you're gonna try to work you know at the end of the day you just work that day you don't really focus on anything you just work that end of the day you're like oh my god i didn't get anything done i need to increase the amount of time that i'm working so i i set myself up to work 12 hours that day just straight you know that you believe that shit in the movies where like you see like um the social network where uh zuck is creating facebook he's sitting there coding away coding away and then he just goes straight for straight straight you know for 10 12 hours straight or uh 20 hours straight and then sit on some red balls and stuff very unhealthy lack of sleep he crashes down puts his head on the keyboard just crashes he wakes up a few hours later and starts going back up again that's not a good routine that's not something you can stick to that's not something you can do daily so i want to show you my routine and how i built it and some of the things that i took into account when creating this routine and this is something that i've been working on for the past three years i've started entrepreneurship past three years i got into some personal development books i also one of the first things i picked up on was a good routine something that um that it's not something that i'm gonna do today and get a result tomorrow but something i'm gonna do today and see the result at the end of 2019 i want to show that to you guys and again this is meant to just show you my thought process behind creating a routine to follow this is not meant to show you here's my routine and here's what you need to do that my routine is the best and that no other entrepreneur can do this like that mine reigns all of them no i'm just showing you my routine and how i developed it and giving you thoughts to think about when creating your routine um before you actually know my routine is not perfect again taking about three years to you know get this set up um you know it allows me to live a good balanced life i'm focused on the years not the days the weeks the months like i said i'm focused with this routine that if i follow it all of 2019 that which in fact i'm i've been following my routine for about 20 20 days now the one i've set up for 2019 i'm gonna show you now a little bit um and i know that if i follow this routine for 2019 that at the end of the year i look back i will see how much progress i made and how this routine has allowed me to create that progress and not just running around with you know trying to figure out things and when to work when to eat when to take break time and stuff like that i have it all laid out to where just follow it so i'm gonna go over my morning routine and this is something this is one of the first routines i've actually started this is one of the first things i got into was my morning routine don't know why it was just one of the first things and i think it just came from the you know motivational post you see on like instagram that hey you need to wake up before 5 a.m to be successful you know the earlier you get up the greater amount of success you have and uh so i was like oh yeah you know what i'm gonna hurt my semi-alarm i'm gonna set it for 4 30 a.m and look it got me to take action so i i'm thankful for that but at the same time that i don't think that's completely true so um you know one thing i always was kind of proud of was the the amount of sleep i got i'd only get about five six hours of sleep sometimes four hours of sleep a night and i was proud of that i promoted that i put that on my instagram stories i told my family members and i don't know why because if i look back at the work ethic i had that whole day it sucked it sucked i would work for two to three hours after waking up and then my work ethic just shot down to nothing the rest of the day i just started finding myself looking at youtube videos getting distracted i found myself falling asleep a few times um while sitting at my desk working and my work ethic sucked and then i read a book and i mean obviously all my family said i need eight hours of sleep you know i just kept saying you know that's nonsense nonsense you know i'm good i'm good um and then i really started digging deep into sleep and stuff and the reason i'm focusing much on sleep because this is how i base my whole routine on my morning routine is how much sleep i get so i really started digging into sleep um i'm big on health i like to work out a lot you know i like to eat healthy and stuff um and i really started focusing on sleep and figuring out the benefits the drawbacks of it and uh there's a lot more benefits than drawbacks for sleep uh particularly you know if if you don't get enough sleep you know increases your chances of getting alzheimer's later in life uh the metria dementia look i just butchered that i'm sure but you know those type of things you're more stressed you're more prone to holding on to weight you slow your metabolism down you uh your sexual health is decreased uh your menin your testosterone is decreased um there's a lot of negatives with lack of sleep and the positives is pretty much all the opposites of the negatives you're gonna you're gonna lose weight easier you're gonna decrease the amount of stress you have in your life you're gonna feel better overall you're gonna ache less well do be more efficient during your work sessions which i'm gonna cover in a second and you know i read a book it's called um the brain it's a book about the brain and it was talking about um which i'll put in the description below it was talking about how you know without your sleep um you know it's it's more about brain function and stuff like that and pretty much covers all the same things right there so when i'm building my morning routine i want to set a time that i'm gonna wake up that i know i can base it off the time i go to bed because i know if i go to bed at 12 o'clock there's no way i can wake up at five or six i have to wake up around seven or eight so i can buy eight hours seven eight hours of sleep so i started looking at the time i go to bed and what's some time i can fall asleep at and i knew that i could fall asleep around 10 or 11. you know i don't really do much nightlife and if i do it's rare and you know my family goes to bed around that time so between that put in place i knew it was a routine i could follow it was something i was already doing so i just looked you know average time i fall asleep about 10 to 11 so let's say about 10 30.

it's really the normal amount of time i fall asleep and seven to eight hours um you know 10 i try to go to sleep for 10 but most of the time it's about 10 30 11 o'clock pushing it so i look forward seven to eight hours ahead and that's six o'clock if i fall asleep for 10 o'clock wake up at six got my eight hours of sleep and um you know somewhere in between about 10 30. so i look at six o'clock that's my time i'm gonna wake up it's seven eight hours ahead if i fall asleep between 10 and 11. so i wake up at six o'clock so this is how i found the time to wake up for you guys it'll be different you may get off of work at 12 o'clock at night and you know you need to go to sleep you know you can't go to sleep till one o'clock so you're going to set your alarm for maybe eight o'clock for seven hours of sleep or maybe eight to eight thirty for someone who works night shift you go to bed at five you're going to set your alarm seven eight hours ahead what like one two o'clock so to build your morning routine you you want to first figure to find the time you're going to go to sleep you want to figure out what time um you got to go to bed first what time you go to bed every day and stick to that and i'll be honest with you saturday nights friday nights it's hard for me to go to bed about 10 11 but i still wake up at six because i know if i wake up every single day at six including saturdays and sundays it's easier to wake up in the long run even on nights when i get less than seven eight hours of sleep i still find myself waking up at six or before six before my alarm just because my body's used to it and then right after i wake up the first thing i start working on is planning my day i've experimented with a bunch of different morning routines with waking up getting out of bed immediately going to the gym waking up getting out of bed going straight to my laptop working for four to five hours waking up eating sitting down reading for two hours like i've experimented a bunch of different routines and for me the one that's always worked or the one that has been the easiest to stick to and still consistently make progress is just waking up i get out of bed i take a caffeine pill instead of drinking coffee i take a caffeine pill because it's cheaper in the long run and i fill up a 20 ounce shaker cup of water cold water i use the restroom like any normal person i splash some cold water on my face then i come sit down on my desk turn the light on lamp on and i sit down i start at the wall close my eyes and i do seven rounds of seven breathing which is basically just breathing in for seven seconds holding it for seven seconds breathing out for seven seconds then holding it for seven seconds then that's one round and you do seven rounds of that basically just helps you more oxygen oxygen into your body your brain um and it just i feel more energized after i do it or after i get everything clear clean and cleared like that um and also it compounds my meditating because i just focus my breath i even tried doing meditating at 1.2 where i literally just close my eyes for 30 minutes and we're after waking up in the morning early at like 4 35 in the morning and i felt as if i was about to fall asleep i couldn't really focus in the quality of meditating was poor so i started doing my day planning and stuff right after that just pulled out a um i have a little uh i don't you call it a little notebook and i simply just write down things i'm grateful for or five things i'm grateful for six things i want to achieve um also when i'm writing down those things i want to achieve i quickly look over my calendar for that day because that's things i want to achieve today um that period of time then i write down my why how and what what's my why how i'm going to achieve that why or yeah how am i going to achieve that why and what what am i going to create to to achieve it so um for me it's serve the people it's my why how deliver profitable facebook ads exceed customer expectations with detailing services and creating life empowerment products and content just like this and my what is terrio solutions my digital agency cajun suds auto detailing which is another local business i own and then my personal brand which is the youtube my instagram uh basically anything around the nick terrio.org online then after i get all that done takes me it positions me about 6 30 a.m i then read a book for about 30 minutes i used to do reading you know there's a lot of entrepreneurs i put out you need to read a book a week and i think that's very unrealistic and really hard to stick to because i can go get a book about 200 pages read that you know i just finished 12 traits of the great it took me two weeks to read um or 12 days to read i was able to to to do one chapter every 30 minutes and there's 12 chapters 12 traits are great you get it so me doing one that um book a week would be hard because i'd have to read more than 30 minutes each day if i go get a small book i read the caballion a few months ago and i really i literally read it in like three hours or two hours to make three four days to read so it becomes really inefficient because i can't stick to a routine a book a week because then it throws off all my other routines if i need to increase the time spent each session reading so i just try to stick to 30 minutes a day keep it simple i do it in the morning that way nothing gets in the way everyone's still sleeping i have the room closed it's quiet i can focus i don't have my phone going off because it's still in the morning it's early and i can get it done i do that monday through sunday um after i get all that finished then i you know have breakfast i do something really quick like a bagel some cream cheese and a kiwi because i'm about to go work out and that's kind of like my pre-workout breakfast that's something that's been perfect for me again i've tested different breakfasts to see which breakfast gives me the best performance in the gym i get ready real quick brush my teeth do my hair um you know clean my face um and then i go to the gym also and like i said during this time period i'm trying to down that 20 ounces of water to my body my organs woken up it got some water in them you can you know get my bodily functions moving uh next thing is the gym sessions because i really believe you know everyone needs to have some type of fitness in their life get their body moving so we've covered if we go back over into the morning routine so far we've we've gotten up we've did some form of meditation we've planned out our day so we know what's going to happen that day and in fact we should have done that already not before um but i just kind of find tell that during the morning so looked over the day um then we read our book got some education in us and now you know we've got ready for the day now we got to do our gym session because again gym is another thing that for me and i know for a lot of you guys it's hard to stay consistent with if you put it to our all towards in a day you might throughout the day get really tired not want to go you might you know you might have if you're a parent you might have a kids soccer game basketball game football game some type of sport or attend something of theirs at school randomly pop up you may have um you know a friend or something reach out to you or something like that trying to meet up with you you may have a big test tomorrow and you need to also now study and you can't do anything rest of the day so getting the gym done in the morning is very efficient to staying consistent with it and i do this every day i go 7 45 8 45 every day monday through saturday in fact notice i think that's my one-off day and i only work out during that time period so that way if you if you give yourself a long period of time at the gym you'll start talking to people you'll start taking longer breaks between sets and i understand some days may take a little longer like like day but i still focus on trying to keep it during that time period so that way like i said i don't throw everything off this is six hours a week i'm spending at the gym right here with this schedule that's a lot of time um i used to spend you know hours at night you know when i used to go in the gym i would go to the gym at night you know five six o'clock spend hours with my friends and stuff and um i i wouldn't get shit done like i would go to the gym spend hours with them talking and stuff and i'd spend three hours stay over there and only about one hour actually do work or work out so don't confuse going to the gym with talking stuff and all that actually condense that whole hour it's actually getting in there quickly as possible starting your workout workout for that time and leave don't start chilling having fun and doing all that because it's losing time away from your goals that you use to go after your goals so so far we've woken up at 6 a.m seven rounds of breathing planned our day read 30 minutes ate breakfast uh got ready and now went to the gym so now we're pretty much ready for the day we're ready to either go to nine to five we're you know we're ready to go to school if you own a business now it's time to start crunching on your business and that's where we're going to lead into work sessions so just like i said this will be the time for our most business owners students people um also i need to put right here uh this will be for people four nine to five but also for people escaping nine to five uh focusing on creating their financial independence so what i want to do is just to show y'all my work sessions but basically a work session is is just going to be a period of time you block out during the day to work on your business to go to class to study to if you work nine to five this will be literally nine o'clock to five o'clock blocked out because you gotta work then you will also have time at night where if you're trying to escape or trying to build a business on the side where you might block out a few a little bit of time or randomly drop the day that you have time to work on your business so i'm gonna show you guys my work sessions and i want to remind y'all i'm a full-time entrepreneur this is all i do i don't do school i don't go to nine to five i don't um you know i don't do any of that so i can literally create my own schedule and some people believe that entrepreneurs don't have a schedule that they just do they want every day and that's far from the truth at least for ones that want to be very efficient and ones who still need to work and build their business up if you make it your build your business up quick and have no more want to work long days then hey that's you so this is my work sessions i have work sessions every single day and i have it sectioned kind of like how my schedule goes so i have a morning session this is 9 00 a.m to 12 p.m i do this monday through saturday and during this time i'm focusing on building my business i'm focusing on delivering services for clients and consumers and creating content like this in fact today right now i'm actually over this work session if you look at bottom right screen but i'm perfectly fine with that um because what i can do is i can just alter it a little bit i have morning sessions um or yeah i hope i meant to say morning session but i have morning sessions also on sunday from 8 a.m to 10 p.m afternoon sessions um this is gonna be monday through friday from 1 p.m to 5 p.m afternoon session on sunday from 1 30 p.m to 3 30 p.m i honestly saturday is the only day that i'd barely work and that's just because i can fit in my schedule better night sessions i do this monday through thursday 6 to 8 p.m um sunday i also do like a kind of like a night session but it's more of a like review session and it's not really a work session but i've created this because this works for me it comes out to 50 hours a week that i'm putting towards my businesses my personal brand my local business my digital agency 50 hours a week i'm keeping track of all this and if i stay consistent with this this is 50 hours a week times 52 weeks a year it comes out to a lot of hours and each work session i'm focused on them and i'm you know i'm making the most of each session i don't do 12 hour sessions and only be productive three hours of it say i'll work the 12 hour session and i want to warn you warn you guys don't don't let my sessions discourage you again i'm a full-time entrepreneur and stuff and you might be in school right now you may only have two hours a day to work on your business maybe even an hour a day to work on your business that's seven hours a week don't let that discourage you make the most of those hours start today creating something in those hours that you can provide a service or product to the public so again you know talk a little bit more about my work sessions and stuff um what's the work session so like what was there's rules for them that you gotta stick to and during these work sessions you know you don't want you want to stick to them every day um today you know this is like one of the first times that i'm breaking my work session just goes hey look i'm you know filming a video on work sessions and i'm actually running past my time here uh but i'm not going to stop the video and stuff just because it's been doing pretty good so far but do your best to stick to these work sessions don't let anything don't do anything else during these work sessions and focus only on stuff that's going to get you closer to your goals so if i'm running a digital agency the only thing i need to focus on um is facebook ads because that's my service i provide facebook ads i need to focus on the copywriting that i do for the ads i need to focus on uh the sales side where i'm creating video pitches sending it to people and following up with those people where i have meetings through those period but that's it i don't do anything else i don't you know i condense my services to only one service or one product and i do really good at that product or service so that way i'm working less but at the same time being very effective with those that work and i can have some really good products and services and remind you one good hour of focus can be more productive than three hours of work when i was doing like 5 a.m you know 4 30 a.m wake up sessions by nine o'clock i was really productive from those three hours four hours i was really productive but i i set my time from 5 a.m to 5 p.m and everything from 9 p.m to 5 p.m those eight hours they weren't productive at all i'll be honest with you they weren't productive at all so i just kept making it harder on myself i'm like okay i need to do more work and obviously 5 a.m to 5 p.m ain't doing good so i need to do 5 a.m to 5 p.m then after i eat at 6 or 5 then i need to get back to and do three four more hours work i need more time in a day and you just keep running around and thinking i need more time in a day but the real problem is you're not being efficient with your time and you need to be very efficient with your time because we all have the same 24 hours in a day and that's what allows people to do more or seem like they do more uh than other people because they're very efficient with their time so instead of increasing the amount of time you get for your work session increase the efficiency increase the effectiveness of each hour outsource stuff if you have to you know don't focus on the little focus on the stuff that creates impact and results in your business for you and your clients and don't let your your ego take over and don't create these unrealistic work sessions you can't stick to start off by just creating a simple work session each day my first work session set up a set of work sessions was from like 9 a.m to 12 p.m then like 1 to 3 30 p.m and that's it monday through friday nothing saturday no nothing sunday that was it and as i was able to stick to those i started to increase it by little bit 30 minutes a piece and so don't create all these unrealistic expectations for your work sessions you know for someone who's still in school someone's still working a nine-to-five just create a one-hour work session each day and you know devote all your time energy into those work sessions don't play on instagram don't look at facebook don't respond to texts and calls from your friends and stuff focus just on the work for that period of time and you're gonna get all you know you're gonna get a lot done make the most of each hour and then over time you know start increasing your work sessions you know start setting these sessions up um you know start to focus you know once you notice that you're working seven hours a week you're getting your some money pulled in from your side business try to decrease the amount of time you spend at work cut your hours in half cut it take a cut and pay cut and stuff and focus more time on your business increase the amount of work sessions and hours of each work session once you become efficient with those little hours and start um you know changing your life quit your job focus more time more time create create the time for your work sessions stick to them and you should always know what you'll be doing for each session you should never just have like at least some you should always have likely some general idea you shouldn't just be like hey i got a work session at 6 8 tonight i have no clue what i'm gonna be doing it should be very clear for me hey i have a work session today starting at one o'clock to 5 p.m where i will be managing uh fixing a few ad problems for my clients i need to work on some new top funnel ad copy for one of my client i need to uh set up a landing not set up a integration from infusionsoft to click funnels for one of my clients i need to uh send out three video pitches and i need to follow up with nine people that's that's realistic right that's exactly what i'll be doing today from one to five p.m so what what about the free hours what's so you're gonna have some free hours in your day once you get your work sessions lined up and everything you'll have what's called free hours these are gonna be hours you'll be driving back and forth from work back and forth from the gym this will be times of nothing gets done these are dead hours these will be the time that you're either gonna break and enjoy yourself or like i said you'll be driving back and forth school work this is going to be time periods where you enjoy time with your family where you really just do nothing like these are the hours you can do whatever you want when i was first becoming an entrepreneur when i had these hours i felt guilty because i felt like i didn't get enough done during the during the time period my work session so if i set up a work session say from 5 a.m to 5 p.m i'd worked that whole day and when i had my dead session from like 5 p.m to 10 o'clock at night 12 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night when i would you know go to sleep before working again at 5 a.m i would feel guilty having these sessions because i knew deep inside that i didn't deserve it because i didn't get enough done during those work sessions so now i i love these free hours because i don't feel guilty and if you have a sense of feel sense of feeling guilty then that means you're not working hard enough and efficient during your set time don't increase the amount of time like i said focus on maximizing the productivity and then slowly increment it by 30 to say 30 minutes a day or over time so i want to show you guys how to put this routine in action you've got a good morning routine you have these good morning sessions now are these good work sessions now how do you actually put this routine into action we all have calendar apps and i'm about to show you in a second my exact routine on a calendar because what i do is i come there and book my routine into my calendar just like a book a dentist appointment or for donna's appointment a doctor appointment uh maybe a call or meeting i book my routine on my calendar so that way when someone asks me what i'm doing i'm gonna show my calendar right there i can tell them oh look look i'm busy you know i'm busy this saturday because i got a work session from 9 to 12 i'm free one one o'clock in the afternoon because i'm gonna eat lunch at 12 o'clock so you've got to be stay religious to these routines or stay very consistent with these routines so let's actually go into my calendar um as you can see it's a very cluster um and what's cool about this is google calendar right here um i have all my businesses or other like sub calendars but this is my main one my nictario one this is just like my personal calendar of my personal stuff so let's go over i went far out to february earlier just for something specific and you can see my exact routine right here you can see everything i followed everything i did um six o'clock i have a little thing booked for you know wake up breathe eat breakfast read 30 minutes get dressed then gym 7 45 so 8 45 and i actually need to change this i can edit it and i need to change this to about 7 35 because i'm actually leaving the house that can just hit save this and following events okay boom so now i have the driving time set up between um the gym and in my morning sessions and stuff so gym's fairly close for me some people might be different might be 30 minute drive time that's okay so i can actually go ahead right here into my calendar and book my sessions which is really cool so you know like i said i might wake up and um wake up right here and then i go to the gym then i'm a morning session 9 a.m to 12 p.m then i got this dead hour between 12 and 1 where i watch some netflix i eat and do what i want for an hour then at one o'clock it's my afternoon session this is where again another four hours where i'm focused just on my work and on fridays i don't do a night session that's really it at five o'clock you know i do what i want friday night you know um go eat out with my girlfriend i spend time with my family i watch netflix i do what i want um i find it very hard to fit in a night session on friday so i don't put one there but i make sure and i don't feel guilty about it because i know i worked hard all week on my other sessions you can see right here my six to eight p.m night session monday through thursday we go right here on saturday right here and you can see again same i have the same thing every single day for waking up my gym session my morning session 9 a.m to 12 p.m um and then you can see right here you know there's nothing the rest of the day because i don't do any more work i do what i want the rest of the day on saturday uh sunday again wake up same time i have a morning session eight to ten then i go to church 10 30 to 12 30.

it's about you know how long it takes for months leave the house so i get back then i eat lunch and stuff do what i want then about 1 30s when i start my afternoon session about 3 30 and from 3 30 to really i do what i want the rest of the day and then 7 8 8 o'clock at night i do a weekly review where i review the full week um of everything i did so i want to show you guys real quick how you can set this up uh so we go right here let's see if we go to that new calendar and this is google um you might have to look up a video if you are an apple person let me just do tests click calendar and i recommend you put your your personal kind of schedule like this and maybe a separate calendar or you know you can put on your main calendar too so let me go to my test calendar return off my regular one today's friday let's just go over to next week let's go to monday so next week we want wake up let's say whatever time you want to wake up at so we want to wake up at you know say six o'clock wake up now what all do we want to do during that morning routine we'll also add it in too so we'll do wake up we want to read or we want to breathe plan read 30 minutes breakfast get ready or i get ready before i eat breakfast so i'm awake about six you may have to come there and alternate like test a routine a few times first so when i started this routine i had this set up for like you know seven or eight o'clock and then i realized i can get it done in an hour and a half instead of two hours so i was able to be efficient i made the most of my time i was able to decrease the amount of time it took me to this routine so i know i can do this routine between six and thirty six and seven thirty and now what you want to do is go right here to of when you want this routine to reap uh to repeat so right now if we just booked it like this we don't have to go every day and book this stuff so we want to make sure it sets it up to where it automatically goes every day so if i want to do this every day that i could just hit daily but if i wanted to do it say just on weekly on monday i can do weekly on monday maybe monthly on the fourth monday annually just a bunch of different ones but i can also go to custom right here and actually select it by you know month you know on the daily and stuff like that like you can really go pretty customized with all this so but i just want to go to daily because we want to wake up every day at the same time so boom there we go we've just locked ourselves in we made a commitment so now what i want to do is go and create our gym session so i know i get to gym i have a leave house at 7 30 i can say gym at 7 45 and it'll be 8 45 let's add title let's just call it gym and you know what maybe some of you guys who are watching still working nine to five so maybe we'll have we'll have to be a little bit more specific we're going to gym and shower at gym because we want to get ready for the day we don't want to go to work and stuff and um you know we can do this right here go back to repeat go to custom and we want to repeat monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday that's you know assuming you want you want like to say a six day split let me hit done hit save boom so now we got that set up now we got to set up our nine to five we work nine to five you know monday through friday so let's go nine o'clock or actually uh most people go get off at lunch at 12 so let's do nine to twelve this will be morning session save let's go to edit because we work nine to five monday through friday boom and then we go right here one o'clock so we get an hour lunch so we'll go back to one o'clock and then we put this to five then we go right here every weekday monday through friday and that's our afternoon session so let's say you got the gym done you got your work done let's say you know you leave work at five you get home at 5 30 6 o'clock um if you get home at 5 30 uh this is where you know you start cooking you know cook supper assuming you have a family and stuff okay or cook dinner boom every weekday monday through friday boom and then now six o'clock or we can actually do we can edit this one let's make it a little bit more specific cook dinner and eat dinner with family save this we're going to edit this and then we actually forgot to do one thing with that and that's actually make it a little bit longer boom so now that you know you're gonna work come home you drive now you eat dinner cook dinner family you know about 6 30 now is when you can have your say your first uh night session so night session say say 6 30 to 8 30 boom actually most people even working on nine to five can do a little bit longer so let's say eats you eat dinner with your family and stuff um you know that's about 6 30 you're finished you can jump on your night session now 6 30 you know you can easily work till nine o'clock so that's two and a half hours you can put towards your your goals your business your side hustle and then at night you can have your chill time which be say nine and ten o'clock and then like 10 o'clock you can shower then 10 30 crash and then wake up you know wake up at let's say six o'clock and then boom you got your schedule and you can literally do this for saturday if saturday you know your gym shower nine o'clock you can literally do your nine to five again saturday but on your business and that's another what seven hours plus the um uh two no it's two hours you know you another 10 15 15 hours or 12 hours you get a week right here so you can almost put 20 hours in on the side between saturday something in your night sessions on your business so that's how you can pretty much book everything um and then you can also go ahead and book some longer term routines uh some stuff i do is you know every first week of a new quarter i have a scheduled like weekend downtime so the first week weekend of every new quarter so that's you know four quarters a year so four weekends of the year uh friday afternoon to sunday i take everything off i don't do anything i i try to take a trip i just relax do nothing and it's just to give my brain a second to relax and really it's just a lot of thinking and you know questioning of where i'm at you know how i'm gonna move forward it's just to gain some clarity and stuff and kind of take a break and pull myself back from everything that's going on the hustle and the bustle um every first day of a new month i review my financial independence calculator to see how close i'm getting to financial independence what stage i'm on stage one two or three and my wealth map to assess my financials of how much i'm making per month you know what um my assets my debts and you know where all that's looking at right now uh every friday i have a thing set up my calendar to where i pay off my credit card and update my golden income manager i have a video on that it's basically where my income is split up between a few different categories and i update that so every sunday i have one set up for church and every sunday i have one set up for weekly review so you can set up and log all that into your calendar so that way you don't lose sight of the focus and all your dead hours all your free hours you have fun with those hours do what you want that's when you go hang with your friends that's what you hop on that phone call with a relative or something or you know do stuff outside of your goals but this is how you can really focus for 2019 and gain clarity and everyone's routines will be different like i said you don't need to affect you know if you saturday you only work want to work three or four hours from side hustle and the rest of the day have fun go for it you deserve it but start with some type of routine start building it and over the years if you stick to it you're gonna compound to a bunch of small actions will compound something really big and life-changing so guys if you made it this far in the video thank you for watching i know it's a long one but it really can break down a few things and help you when creating your own routine thank you for watching have a good one
