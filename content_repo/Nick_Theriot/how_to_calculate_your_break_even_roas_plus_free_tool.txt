yo what's going on guys welcome back to my channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys you guys have been requesting a lot about how to calculate break even roas and also to how to calculate break even roas if you have a multi-product store so today guys i have an exciting video where i'm actually going to give you a free tool today a free roas calculator tool that you can plug and play into your own business and this tool right here is going to help you out make key decisions of where your bro ass should be where it needs to be where's your profit margins and stuff and then also too if you have multi-products how to kind of look at it with when you have a multitude of different products across your store so that being said let's dive into it but before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday just like this one so let's go ahead and dive into my computer okay guys so this is the roas calculator tool i created for you guys and as you can see right here um it's very simplistic and anything in the white right here is what you can edit anything in this dark gray do not touch to all a bunch of formulas and stuff just to make this all automated for you guys so i have two different kind of like main category sets customer pays shipping so what's your roas looks like if the customer pays shipping and what's your roas look like if you pay shipping you know if you offer in free shipping and what is your shipping expenses and stuff like that and what does that look like at scale i'm gonna show you a few examples in a second literally if you pay shipping it can be like a 2.2 roas and if the customer pays shipping it could be like a 1.9 roas for break even if you multiple that at scale from 100 hours a day to a thousand hours today to 10 000 orders a day you're bleeding so you need to make sure that you're looking at all these numbers right here so first things first we're just gonna go in right here and we're gonna type in our product so let's say our product is a custom metal sign or this could be gucci boots boom gucci boots let's say we sell a black phone case um let's say we sell a blue light blockers and let's see and you could also do categories of content so a product so it's completely up to you so if we say for example i was working with one brand where they had 20 different products but they all had the exact same cogs and exact same shipping so that collection right there because it's like say for example it's like a phone case and that phone case had 20 different colors and they had an individual product listing for each one of those phone cases but they all went for the exact same price they all went for the exact same cogs and they all went with the exact same shipping so we just put phone cases but if you have five different pairs of blue light blockers on your store for example and each one is a different cost for shipping sell price and cogs then you're gonna need to list each one of those so this could be you know green blue light blockers this can be the advanced 2.0 blue light blockers so and if you have no clue blue light blockers this that's glasses so and i'm just gonna kind of fix that up a little bit so say for example now we got all of our stuff now let's actually start listing our cogs our shipping our sale price if you still have no clue what i'm talking about when cogs cogs is your cost of goods to you so how much do you pay to be able to purchase these products at wholesale so say cogs our gucci boots cost us 100 bucks black phone case cost us two bucks our blue light blockers cost us 10. our green blue light blockers since they're green we have to pay an extra you know five dollars a little bit more in our advanced ones they're new top of the line blue light blockers nothing like you've ever seen and they're a little bit more expensive on our end so now that you have these specific things how much it costs you how much shipping what does shipping look like for each one of these particular products now if you do just like a one flat rate of shipping so like say purchase someone purchased five black phone cases and it's still five dollars to get all five of them shipped out just don't worry about that just how much if someone purchased one of these products how much does it cost you to ship that product out and it's also too might be the shipping that you're charging at checkout so whatever if you're already charging at checkout and you know you're charging enough covering all your expenses cool just put that number right here so for gucci boots let's say it costs us 10 bucks to ship those black phone bit case two dollars blue light blockers five dollars and they're all the same so cool so now we got our shipping price now how much are we selling these products for sorry gucci boots we're selling them for a thousand dollars our black phone case we're selling for let's just do 10 bucks our blue lot blockers we're selling for 50 bucks our green one it's 60 bucks as it's green our advances 100 bucks now look what just happened what was just put together for us we got our profit now how much we're profiting for each order now we also got a profit margin what's our percentage of profits for each product we sell one of these products we make x amount and profit and break even roas right there so now we know what roas we need to hit to break even with our cpa and everything so this is as simple as it gets in the simplest way i can put it for you guys to just make this easy easy as possible so now that we got our break even rs for the customer pay shipping now let's see what it looks like if we pay shipping you know if we have to absorb these charges right here so let me just ctrl c i'm gonna copy that and that's literally what you're gonna do select your first product boom ctrl c and literally just ctrl v and paste that in and then voila what does that look like now a completely different number and these products low you know low shipping costs and stuff you may have to pay more shipping and this could really affect your break even roas so that's why we offer a lot of free plus shipping not free plus shipping we offer a lot of um shipping free over a certain aov so if you have an average order i mean you have an average cart value of 100 plus then we offer free shipping because we incentivize people to spend more and that more they spend is going to outdo the cost of shipping for us but like look at this black phone case we're selling for 10 bucks and shipping's only two bucks but our break even restaurant from 1.25 to 1.67 something super simple and even right here these advanced blue light blockers went from 1.43 to 1.54 now this is a huge number right here let's say if we were selling this for 200 bucks it's gucci boots look at that robust and let's see if we do it right here 200 so 2.0 to 2.22 so you gotta look at those different things like that so once you actually do this then you can really understand where you're profitable at what do you actually need to hit inside the ads manager what's your profit margins and stuff and this and also look at it like this is all right i have a 90 profit margin so i can spend up to 900 bucks to acquire one customer so let's say if i spend 300 of that on paid advertising and the other 600 left let's say i offer like a 300 discount it also affects your profit and profit margin as well and it just allows you to look at this and a whole new perspective of how much can you spend to acquire one customer with these products now the next question you have is okay i have a multi-product store how do i calculate a break even rise for a multi-product store and the real thing is it's not as simple as you as you think it's it is simple as you think but you're not going to get just one number so what you need to look at is when we're scaling a multi-product store we focus all of our spin on two to three products so let's say for example for this store right here the advance or the blue light blockers is responsible for 80 of our sales we we leverage this at tofu at our cold audiences we scale up using these blue light blockers and then we upsell people with gucci boots we upsell people with black phone cases and that could be through email marketing post-purchase that can be you know upsell in in a cart it's somewhere on the mix right there and what we need to do is is we need to focus on the break even or as for the two to three products you're leading with for a multi-product store so if you're leading with these blue light blockers right here and that break even rest is a 1.25 then we need to make sure in our scaling campaign that we're spending all of our money inside of we need to make sure that we're hitting a 1.25 or greater in order to be profitable then you know i'm not worried about the ROAS on this one because i'm not leading with this i'm leading with this one right here not worried about the ROAS on this one because i'm not leading with that one i'm leading with this one right here now if these products are in campaigns inside your mofu or bofu then you just need to focus on the break even ROAS for those and also too a quick way you could do it is you can literally select them all right here go right here on google sheets average 1.27 so this is more of a lazier way but it's not perfect because again if it's 1.27 is the average but we're getting 90 of ourselves from right here this advanced 2.0 blue light blockers or 1.43 ROAS then then we're losing money if we're hitting a 1.3 we're profitable on the average side or unprofitable when we look at it from a different perspective so it's two different ways you can look at it but just focus on the ROAS the individual break-in ROAS for your two to three products your evergreen products you're scaling with because again when i'm scaling a multi-product store i'm focused only on two three products at tofu and i'm using email marketing sms marketing upsells and downsells and all that to sell the other products so you just need to focus on your main products you're scaling with and focus on those ROAS numbers and then what you can do is as long as you're hitting those you're good to go and keep checking this as
