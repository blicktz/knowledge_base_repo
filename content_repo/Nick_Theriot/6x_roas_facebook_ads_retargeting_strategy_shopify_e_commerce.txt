yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel Nick Terrio here and today I want to bring you guys a new video where we discuss how we can achieve some insane ROAS numbers on our retargeting campaigns and the type of content you should be filling in your retargeting campaigns because this is a huge key if you want to get some great ROAS in terms of like three plus five six seven of seen 10 20x return on ads in your retargeting campaigns before we hop into this video make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button we've been posting daily videos and you do not want to miss some of this hot content we've been dropping lately around Facebook ads and scaling your score in 2021 all righty guys so jumping right into it first off I want to show an ad account kind of show you guys what I mean by this of some crazy high ROAS and your retargeting campaigns so this is two campaigns I've set up in a recent case study I uploaded I've been getting a lot of questions regarding this across multiple videos of how we set up like retargeting campaigns and stuff so the key thing with retargeting and a lot of people miss out on is the content that's put in it there's a few tactical things you need to follow but the primary thing primary reason why you get great ROAS in terms of retargeting is due to psychology and content you're actually putting inside of these two campaigns so this last 14 days for this particular account this is where we've seen the greatest and when we kind of finally nailed down the type of content this brand needs as because this is still a newer brand so it takes a little time of testing and stuff like that but if you look at the lot you know the lifetime it's still fairly good you know $1,300 made back $7,800 so this is really good break-even return on ads and on this particular product is like 1.8 so very good in terms of profit for those two campaigns so now how do you create better retargeting content what do you follow to achieve some really high ROAS how can you do it and what do you need to do so first off let's look at the tactical side so we have two campaigns we set up one's called mofu one's called bofu your mofu campaign is all of your social engagement so this is your 30-day engagement on instagram your 30-day engagement on facebook then we set up two ad sets inside of mofu so inside of mofu and again if you're not catching what i'm talking about mofu is middle of funnel so the two ad sets inside of inside of mofu is a 30-day engagement audience with instagram and facebook inside excluding website visitors purchases all that and then your other ad set is a 30-day to 180-day so you're gonna do 180-day audience include it and you're gonna exclude a 30-day to where you have a 30 to 180 days a little further out we like to separate those two because there are two different frames of people the type of content is going to each one so what we like to do from there is we do are going into our bofu campaign is what we like to do for that one is we like to do a view content 14 day and a add to cart 28 day include it together and just one ad set and both these campaigns are going to have a bo and you want to spend about 25 of your total daily split uh total daily spin divided between these two campaigns you want to do about 15 to your mofu campaigns and 10 to your bofu campaigns so if you spend a hundred dollars a day 15 a day you'll go to your mofu and 10 a day you'll go to your bofu that makes sense um and you want to keep track of that frequency you want to make sure at the ad set level that you have um a less than a 2.0 in a 24 hour window so look at yesterday's data um once you have a full day 24 hours of um advertising look at the previous day and see where that frequency is at you want to keep it below two even if ROAS is good say let's say you have like a 10x ROAS and your frequency is 2.1 um let it go for another day but still if it's still above a 2.0 lower your daily budget by 20 because what's going to happen is um you're going to start irritating your customers or irritating your prospects by keep showing them more and with retargeting it's quick to irritate people because you can scale up the budget really quick and it caused some major issues and if you find that frequency going above a 2 even when you start to lower down your your retargeting daily budget uh the problem is you're probably have a top of funnel problem because you're not funneling in more and more people to your website so what you do is just start increasing the spin at your top of funnel or start and create or fix the issues in your top of funnel um you know figure out what you can do to drop the cost down so that way you can either get more out of what you're spending or just spend more and that gets more people to your website uh more people engaging with your social media and then you get more people in your mofu and bofu um which will lower that frequency down because it's more people for the algorithm to go after so that's a big thing right there um i've seen a lot of people before where they're getting in probably like a five six extra turn on ads on their bofu um spending like 20 30 bucks a day and they like duplicate at 60 bucks a day it's way too much the system does not need that much um and understanding that right there that's a very big part of the tactical side now that we discussed now that we discussed the tactical side the next biggest thing is the creative because the tactical side it's not going to do much but the creative side is what's going to really get you guys results this is going to keep you from it's going to keep that robust high but this is going to get you that high robust right here if that makes sense and the creative is key so you got to understand with mofu and bofu when you're retargeting someone that means they came to your website or they engaged in social media and they did not purchase so now what we need to do is we need to get them to that next stage so if they engage in social media all we need to do is get them to your website if they went to your website all we need to do is get them to purchase so what we like to do for mofu is we like to put in our 30 day ad set it's just a bunch of ugc user generated content influencers endorsing the product again showing off the product and then our 180 day we like to maybe drop in a discount code new product release but don't limit your options to just those so you basically want to re-engage people with a new creative they haven't seen before on their top of funnel drop something new dangle a carrot in front of them get them curious and get them to your website now bofu is a little bit more straightforward mofu is actually the hardest one to go after bofu is actually pretty easy and when it goes down to bofu because mofu i'm like some stuff that works on some accounts hasn't worked for another but i think the most clear today winner that's worked really well for us mofu is just ugc someone taking a picture of the product endorsing the product you know um i think i look like to look at like snow teeth whitening they have a lot of people like having the snow uh teeth whitening kit in their mouth and they're like oh my god it's the best thing ever or holding it up and like this is the best thing ever it's got me some amazing white teeth so just some type of like little stuff review testimonials and stuff like that um they catch people's attention brings them back to your website now bofu is pretty clear and straightforward because you just need to ask yourself this one question if a person hasn't purchased from you yet what may be the cause of it what's the objections that they may have in their head what is the you know is it a price objection is it a social proof objection they don't believe in this product yet is it more of uh oh you know that's cool and all but i don't really see how it's going to be more like the success of the product to them what is it going to mean to them so you don't have a clear road to success for them you know there's something they don't understand of how to use this product or they don't understand what this product is going to bring to their life so there's some type of unanswered question and that's the best thing to do with bofu and that's what we clearly did right here with this product right here um for bofu because let me just give you guys a backstory this is a hair care system so a shampoo a conditioner and another little like serum and it's 142 for this package who in their right mind is going to spend that much on hair care you know your typical consumer consumer won't so for us it was more educating the consumer of why this is so valuable why this is going to make such a big difference in their life what can they expect some reviews some more reviews um some more just educational videos of popular questions that this market would research about this product so if you think about it um you know i love watching unboxing videos before i get something in the mail and it kind of helps dangle and create some more desire for me to get that product and unbox it because how cool the unboxing experience is or something like that um i like to go on youtube you know x amount reviews blah blah research something before i purchase it you need to start asking yourself those questions that you would research before you purchase this product so and it's going to different per brand some brands all you need to do is load up your bofu and your mofu with testimonials and that's it whereas your bofu you just especially if you have a higher um tier product you know i sell a sold a 400 gaming chair we have like a 20 extra turn on adsmen at the bofu level um and all we do is provide a few more specs about the chair because we knew our our ideal audience was gamers and they're all about specs so what we did was is we included a lot of specs on the chair different like key parts and key components about the chair really just repurposing information from the website into our bofu um and it really got them and that's what it did so um also sometimes some products just need more urgency so we'll run like a coupon code and we'll say hey expires tomorrow if you don't purchase today and then a whole bunch of people who just visit a website get hit with that ad they help you use that discount code and boom it creates urgency and it gets a reason to act now so this is some stuff you need to go through and like i said some brands be different um but a good start just loading both uh your mofu and bofu up with some um you know testimonials and stuff some reviews um and then bofu just asking yourself questions what type of objections these people might have what will they be using this product like how will they be using this product can we show videos of this product in use in the way that we intend it to be used can we show like videos and stuff you know i have a metal signs client and it's like oh you know cool metal sign but then we start showing this product in use in different ways we intend it to be used and different reasons they could buy and then all of a sudden raw shop because people are starting to buy it and now actually have a reason to use this product so some products are super you know but uh like bland i guess you could say like that broad and people just don't know what to do with it so we do is we start creating content of what to do with that product so that's all some really good ways to increase your your bofu your retargeting and stuff um and then one more thing i want to show you guys is understanding your funnel so this is a traditional funnel top funnel middle funnel bottom funnel uh so you'll be spending about 70 of your money on top of funnel 15 on middle funnel and then 10 on bottom of funnel so oh and the last five percent just by the way because it's 100 and that was 95 will be pps which is past purchases so what we do right here is this is your top of funnel it's cold audience people have no clue who you want so our message is we run facebook ads for you and get you great results okay um let's just say someone engages with our ad or engages with a social media post and just never like does anything else then let's just send them a little testimonial maybe some ugc of a client success maybe even a case study just something to prove we get results just to kind of like hey look remember me here's how awesome we do and then bottom of funnel it's like okay now they're more interested in our services and stuff what's some objections and questions they have so um obviously for us we can just do more case studies because work with an ad agency that's probably the biggest thing is people want to know all right what case studies you have what results you have all that stuff like that so um for us just more testimonials more case studies but maybe also some key questions they might have in the process the sales process so um a big thing is hey we don't want long-term contract because if we get locked in with you you know we don't want to be paying for you if you're not doing good results so um no long-term contracts um you know that's a big one right there so we can even do some bottom of funnel content about all those like more details about our services so we provide you creatives we do copywriting for you we create the content for you we run the ads for you so it starts off with just like we run facebook ads get you great results to all right here's more specifics about our service because we understand that as you the intelligent business owner is going to want to understand all of these statistics and these specs about our service before you invest with this and understand how we get your results with these things so that's a great you know some more key pieces of bottom of funnel content of someone who's came to our website visit our website warm and more stuff we can display in front of them so highly recommend you guys really dig into the consumer uh dig into your ideal consumer i dig into the um you know mindset they might have and some of the thoughts they might have and stuff like that uh you can read reviews you can go research other people other brands that's just like your brand and figure out the objections people have the questions people five do like google searches of you know um problems with x product and stuff like that and just just really see and understand what people are saying about your product but maybe the products in your niche um and and really doing some really good consumer research uh and and sometimes too you can do like question tiers and stuff like that and send it off to your purchases list and um just get a really good idea of what's stopping people from purchasing from your brand and then create content that solves that issue and educate your consumers and handhold them to the checkout to increase your ROAS increase your profits um and pick up more purchase along the way so guys i really hope you enjoyed this video uh this was pretty like consumer and
