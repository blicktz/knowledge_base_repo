yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys we're going to take you through a case study where we generated 2.3 million dollars for a women's clothing brand I'm so excited to share this with you guys you're going to learn a ton of information that about everything we did and it's going to be super super awesome so happy to have you guys on this video before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel post new videos just like this one every other day let's get started okay so a little bit about their brand this is a women's fashion label like I said and the owner her name is Sophia that's not that's not the actual owner and I can't really reveal you know their name just due to NDA and some stuff like that but we're just going to make up her name as Sophia but Sophia owns a women's fashion label and you know they just started out when we came on board with their brand and since we started with them we generated them 2.3 million dollars in revenue with an average ROAS of 3.11 now I did put it on the slide but their break even ROAS is somewhere around 1.6 1.7 to be break even on their cost of goods and some of the other smaller expenses out of every single order now their average order value is around 78 dollars that's what it's kind of been throughout the time of us working together so before we started with them this is what their ad account looked like they were just testing everything under their sun ABO CBO feed only random different products just they just didn't know exactly how to scale their business they were just doing a whole bunch of stuff all over to place and we look at it between August 18th to 7th September 18th 2019 before we started together 30 days before we started together they had spent $16,000 made back $13,000 for a 0.85 ROAS so they were definitely losing money and they were trying to scale without we know with a broken foundation they were not making any profit on their ads up front and it was really hard to scale their business this way so we came in and we we shifted and changed up some things inside their business you know specifically their ad accounts and from September 18th of 2019 all the way up to January 8th 2021 that's just the time I took the screenshot it's been a few months I need to film this video uh we generated them 2.3 million dollars in revenue we spent $751,000 and we made them back a 3.11 return on ad spend so if you look at it like this it went from spending $16,000 in a 30-day period to making $13,000 back in a 30-day period to working with us for over a year spending $751,000 back and making 2.3 million dollars in revenue so just absolutely insane and I'm super excited to share with you guys everything we did because we did some really cool stuff with our ad accounts and I'm just super excited so let's go a little bit more into it uh Sophia did an absolutely amazing job she was a gem of a client in terms of you know the stuff that they already had established their brand and she knew her customer perfectly she knew her ideal customer she really really really really really knew her ideal customer in terms of their thinking their their stuff they like their desires the stuff they don't like what turns them off about a brand what turns them on about a brand just everything from and that that allowed her to create an amazing product and continuously to make amazing products because again she's a women's clothing brand so she continuously made some amazing products because she knew her ideal customers so well and she also knew creatives because she knew her customers so well she knew it grabbed their attention so she actually did her all her own creative in terms of like the photos and the videos you know she didn't use another agency to take product photos and stuff she did her own product photos and her own product videos did an amazing job at it because she knew her ideal audience very well and another thing she knew is because she knew her audience so well she was able to build a cult like following and in the way she ran her promos and stuff and you know in the way she kind of strategized everything with her business so she's just she's building up this absolutely amazing foundation this is all stuff that she just knows she she this is her foundation she's building up and she was also did a very good job at utilizing her email list you know constantly sending like emails out to existing customers follow-ups and all that good stuff and she had a very big vision of where she wants to go with this brand and she is determined to get these things working so you know when you fuel all that together it makes for a really strong foundation of scaling a brand and making a huge brand because you need to have that big vision you need to be determined to take action on these things because i've worked with some owners i've worked with some business owners that did consultations for and everything like that and i would give them this information i'd give them everything they need to succeed and they just they didn't have that energy that motivation they weren't determined and you can really tell the difference between a determined business owner i'm working with them how they're determined to get this working versus one that's still having some issues with you know maybe some lower level things so but she she couldn't do it all alone you know sofia couldn't do all this alone she she needed help and that was one of her biggest traits for success was delegation you know she knew that she couldn't do this alone so she hired out everything she either didn't like to do or was time consuming for her so she could only focus on things that she loved and you know she hired an email market she hired us she hired a person to write ad copy she hired a person to help out you know to do all the fulfillment she had a whole team to do fulfillment and stuff because of how crazily we scaled and she only focused what she loved to do and that was shooting creatives she loved being the model she loved modeling she loved putting together the scene and everything she loved that and she loved creating products so she focused what she she loved to do and she hired out everything and that's one of her biggest traits for success with her brand is because she knew how to delegate properly so that's where we came on because you know we run ads we run your facebook ads and stuff and she knew that in order to succeed she needed to get that advertising done correctly so we came on board we performed a deep dive analysis of her brand that's one of our packages where we come on and you know we purely just do a deep dive and figured out all the bottlenecks in your business and then we analyzed those we present the solutions and stuff and we deployed an ad strategy now our overall strategy synced very well she already kind of had one of how she was doing certain things so we just kind of worked around it um instead of big collection drops you're like some clothing brands that go in and they do a huge collection drop of you know whole bunch of items she would actually drop one to two new products per week so it gave her a lot of new products which we could continuously keep pushing out and it kept things fresh it kept things like it started kind of creating a little bit of scarcity too and like fear of missing out because you know she would launch one she never restock it so it's like if i want this i have to purchase it so it really allowed her to start building up some customer retention because you know her customer frequency rate was probably like 20 35 40 percent uh returning customer rate so and then you know we did lots of promos and emails or she did lots of promos and emails and stuff for existing customers we were in sales once every four to five weeks new product drops so all that good stuff was just again seasoning ready to go ready to to just do the one thing that we need to do and that was the ad strategy they had lots of good things at the lower level that was done correctly now we just need to scale this to the moon we just needed that ad strategy that can take this business to the next level and that's what we came in so you know obviously after we did everything you know our initial stuff our initial findings and everything you know we realized hey aov is under 150 bucks it's a sharp buying cycle we can run your typical direct response top funnel middle funnel bottom funnel and past purchases so that was our ad account structure we split it up between four core campaigns we focused on budget allocation across the funnel plus the brand message so you know we wanted to make sure we had a proper budget allocation between top funnel middle funnel bottom funnel and past purchase because if you just start throwing right in the budgets middle funnel bottom funnel past purchases throws everything out of whack so we have to make sure we had a good you know budget allocation for each stage press the brand message you know we wanted to make sure that each stage of the funnel we're educating our consumers and giving them the proper information they need to move forward to the next stage of the funnel now we also utilized audience exclusions you know excluding people so we could probably hold this account structure it's also going to decrease audience overlap so that way you don't you know have a lot of audience overlap and you know increase auction competitions and stuff and then as new products were dropped we would drip them across campaigns and then just goal was just scale as hard as we can we have everything in front of us we need we can scale that's all we need to focus on is scaling so our top of funnel strategy strategy looks something like this this is not one of our ads at all it's just example ad but our top of funnel strategy we would do carousels of best sellers so we take all the new products or best sellers mostly the best sellers we put them in a carousel ad and we just run a whole bunch of carousel ads top of funnel and some of the ads we would have a small discount for first-time buyers so it's like you know hey here's your ad copy in the end it'll be like first-time buyers get tempered soft using code first-time for example and what we do is this would run these small discounts and stuff and a lot of the creatives did all of the selling essentially you know she was able to do some really good creatives that our ideal audience resonated with a lot you know the whole and without going too deep into it you know her audience wanted to look rich essentially and they embrace that that luxurious and classy lifestyle but they're trying to do it on a budget so yet her clothing is affordable so we would leverage a lot of you know fancy and elegance and the creatives with some really good photos and videos of the products so the creatives did a lot of the selling we drove some really good we had some we get some insane click-through rates with this account like we have some insane click-through rates like three four five percent at top of funnel like just crazy so again that comes down to having a really good product really understanding your ideal customer and being able to craft some ad copy that really resonates with your ideal customer now our top of funnel looked something like this you know we had a scaling campaign we had audience campaign and a creative testing campaign so we test our creatives we test our audiences and we throw them all together in our scaling campaign and we followed the 20 rule for scaling so out over the last three days if performance is good we're increasing the budget by 20 percent if over the last three days performance is bad on that campaign we're gonna drop and scale down by 20 unless it's like something crazy terrible so we followed that so we're kind of up and down a little bit and you know it worked really well we didn't do anything crazy with bid caps manual bidding and stuff or duplicating budgets at crazy levels now our middle funnel was all about educating the consumer increasing social proof of brand re-engaging with warm traffic that has gone cold so our objective was to get more traffic to the website for cheap so this is all warm traffic this is warm people with the brand so they're more likely to click on an ad versus a cold audience so we were trying to get those people that were warm to come to the website and view we'd exclude all website visitors and just get the warm traffic to the website it hasn't been there yet now audience number one we're targeting video views and social engagement over the last 30 days and we're just trying to increase social proof of the brand we're trying to promote a lot of testimonials a lot of customers submitted photos so photos that the customer has submitted to us so you know when they post a picture on instagram and they they tag the brand hey rocking my new outfit from this brand then would go ahead and would repost it obviously get their permission first now audience number two is same thing but we want to do a 30 day 280 day window so we're targeting a window that's a little further out because we believe that anything outside of a 30 day window you're basically going cold against the brand so these people were trying to re-engage them with new offers new products we're trying to grab their attention with new stuff you know re re grab their attention try to pull that back into the brand so you can see some of our middle funnel campaigns right here it's just a few variety of ones we've run we've ran now bottom of funnel bottom of funnel is really key right here because this is all over hot traffic people that came to the website from your cold campaigns or your warm campaign and just hasn't purchased yet so what we do is we want to give them the information they need to create that purchase and usually a bomb of funnel they haven't made a purchase yet some people might be priced some people just there's no urgency yet so if there's no urgency to make the sale right now people are just gonna push it off if it's a price issue a discount code works really well but a lot of times the discounts don't even need it would work extremely well for us in this particular ad set right here is and you know i don't have the creative story you can't see the creative sort of stuff but these are all educational pieces this is testimonials showing off all the brands all the people that love that brand this is a ceo video or like about the ceo so the ceo is just talking a little bit about the brand and stuff a little story and a behind the scenes video just little things to increase the trust and awareness with the brand and further educate the consumer on the brand that you know and how awesome they are and you know just building that trust factor really leveraging that so you know that's what we're doing right we're educating or trust building and we're creating a sense of urgency at this stage your bottom of funnel target audience view constant add to cart two campaigns catalog sales and purchase conversion so you have your catalog sales campaign that's where we leveraged our urgency with discounts and stuff so a catalog sales is where it'll actually take the stuff they looked at on the website and put it onto the you know their facebook timeline so that then you can add something like hey don't forget to you know put these hot styles in your cart because they're going out of sale quick so you know where we're putting in those products onto the feed and going ahead and um that's that's why catalog sales was really good uh purchase conversion also too is what we're using standard for all campaigns i mean it's no question at all now our past purchases this is a huge campaign that we actually pushed off for a while not gonna lie the past purchase campaign is super super valuable because a fashion label your existing customers will be your most valuable people i know for me for example i'm alpha elite i've spent hundreds probably almost close to a thousand dollars in their clothing and i mean i found them from youtube so customer wise once they make that first purchase for a clothing brand they're gonna spend a lot more over time so you want to consistently be back in front of them promote new products in front of them promote new offers new loyalty programs new promos those good stuff so objective right here is to get existing customers to purchase more and we also leverage a lot of email marketing right here that's that was a big one uh this client also did extremely well with sms all that good stuff but we targeted two audiences with our past purchase campaign first one is your seven days so people who purchased the last seven days we we sent them a thank you video so like hey thank you so much for purchasing from us you know we mean so much here's what to expect when your order gets there here's what to expect if you need any returns or anything like that we addressed it any future questions they may have so the cut the client and the customer has that information already in their knowledge book now we upsell them also in that video so we also said hey if you want to purchase more go ahead here's a 20 off discount code make sure you go purchase this and you know short amount of time now audience number two is from 14 days to 180 days so we give about seven day break from advertising and we start promoting new products that were launched in the store promos sells anything that's going on right now to get these people to come back and purchase more now ads for running for a sale this is our black friday right here by the way so um just absolutely crazy numbers but when you're running a sale essentially what we do is we just literally duplicate that top funnel middle funnel bomb a funnel past purchase campaign so you have four campaigns we would create and just duplicate those types of ad sets and ads or those type of ad sets and audiences we're going after inside those campaigns and we just have one or two sales like pictures or ads and creatives to put through all those campaigns and that's what we do simply for a sale we'd run it for like starting on like a thursday afternoon or friday morning all the way up to a sunday afternoon so just a few days and like i said we do it once every few weeks because if you do it too often people are going to start expecting to sell all the time and then they're more likely not going to purchase from you because they're just going to wait for that sale now we also did have to monitor the discount price and how it'll affect break even roas so for example if you have a hundred dollar aov and you're acquiring customers at thirty dollars a pop you know you have a three x a little over a three x return on ad spend but now all of a sudden you have a eighty dollar aov because you're getting a twenty percent off sale now you're acquiring customers at thirty dollars a pop and you have a aov of eighty bucks your roas just drop down to like a 2.8 2.7 but also you're you're discounting the profit percentage so you have to understand what's your new breakeven roas to be able to run these type of discounts and stuff these sales so that way you're not screwing up your numbers i've seen a lot of people that run these big sales see some really good roas but the problem is it's the roas is taken away from the profit the discounts taken away from the profit so then what happens is they actually needed a much higher roas in return so they even broke even running sales so and then if roas is new you know if hitting new roas keep pushing budget so when we had a sale that worked extremely well and ross was on really really really good we just kept pushing that budget squeezing that budget exactly how we did from the beginning now scaling issues so we went over everything that worked really well i literally gave you everything you need to go do this yourself now a little bit of thinking time putting this on paper you can replicate this but there were a few scaling issues we ran into it wasn't just smooth selling the whole way through so being this was september of 2019 it's now march of 2021 this is actually the first clothing label i worked with and starting out one thing that i just didn't understand was why we would start scaling really really good and we'd drop really hard in roas and we'd be stuck for a little while until we added a new product in and at first it just didn't hit me like i was just blind to it what has happened is is when you have a best seller product people are coming a lot of people come to the websites purchase one particular product and that inventory would go low let's say you have all medium buyers and your medium runs low you're like well i still have inventory but then you look at it like wait i'm a ton of small ton of large but no medium and the medium inventory ran out the same time as the rise dropped so now you're like oh my whole ad account was relying on that one particular product to really scale and there's nothing wrong with that at first i was it was a constant battle and secondly i thought i was a horrible marketer i couldn't get some of these other products to take off that the best sellers and all that good stuff so you're gonna run into issues when running clothing and any multi-product store where if your best sellers run low you're gonna have to pull back on ad spend unless you have another product that can take its place right away and sometimes you can't and sometimes you just don't have that right there and every time the best seller would run low run out run out of a size that was popular we'd see a big dip in roas so the understanding the inventory fluctuations was a huge thing with this client and it's it's it's something i'm super thankful for because now i can apply this to every single account i'm working for but starting out from the beginning it was something that was a very hard challenge for me to learn just because i just i didn't know what i didn't know now another issue we ran into was stock issues due to covet so you know for like a month or two during the time of 2020 every product we released was on pre-order and we just kept having a pre-order pre-order pre-order to where eventually we had so much on pre-order that it was like having a huge amount of credit card debt so it was starting to stall us we had to kind of like slow down a little bit pick back up all those pre-orders before we can keep moving forward then the next issue was the customer feedback due to covet so for again while we were running through these issues where we had a lot of pre-order a problem we were running into is a lot of people like getting their package in and leaving bad feedback on the page and we we also got a harsh very hard strike on our ad accounts where we literally couldn't run ads for like a week because of our customer feedback score being too low so lucky we got that solved all good now and then yeah like some of the other products i'm performing as well as other products and it was definitely a lot of a learning experience but now we realized hey you need to focus on your evergreen products you need to focus on those best sellers and focus on customer acquisition because with a clothing brand it's all about customer retention it's over any e-commerce brand by the way but clothing brands especially need to focus on their customer retention because they're going to be the people that's me consistently coming back and buying more so focus on strong customer retention programs and also too a little tip of advice is create a facebook group and get all your customers into it and test beta products in that group post screenshots of the renderings the cad drawings and all that stuff and see if that group would buy it before you actually launch it to your market it's completely free to do because there's a free facebook group to run you can drop discounts and offers and stuff in that particular group to get people to come back and purchase more and stay active in that group and it just be really really good to keep up with so recap this women's fashion label we've been able to take them from literally negative on ad spend to doing over 2.3 million dollars within 15 months of us working together we generated them 3.11 return on ad spend break even around somewhere around 1.7 so you know literally crushing it for them in terms of profits and stuff they've been able to scale aggressively they've employed a ton of new people in their business they've been dropping a whole bunch of new products they're growing they're achieving their vision and everything and it's just absolutely amazing brand and super stoked to generate this forum but this also doesn't even you know cover all of the revenue they've generated from you know email marketing customer retention programs and all that which is way more than this number right here and is one of the reasons why we've started to shift our agency to focus on facebook ads harshly but also focus on the other stuff around it because you can generate some massive profits in the process so i hope you guys enjoyed this case study i feel like i went pretty in depth of everything you need to do to achieve these types of results and i hope you're able to learn a few things on your own if you're an econ business owner and spending at least a thousand dollars on paid advertising and
