honestly so before we get started make sure you hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos just like this one every monday wednesday and friday but being said let's get started so jumping into my computer real quick uh you'll see right here i brought this up multiple different times the diagram i've used a few videos ago literally the main focus for scaling an e-commerce business and you as a shopify store owner you're going to put people in place to fulfill these positions but you need to understand where you need to focus on every single day now customer acquisition this is something like facebook ads tiktok ads uh your uh paid advertising maybe even your influencer marketing maybe even be some of your outbound prospecting and organic marketing this is customer acquisition you know how much does it cost to acquire a customer and then there's average order value that's the second way to increase revenue basically to increase revenue with average order value how can we get them to purchase more products per order how can we increase the amount they spend every time they visit our store so that's average order value now that's a super easy way to increase revenue for business and little to little changes can make massive impacts for a business we took an e-commerce brand we literally flipped around their offer inside their business took a day not even a day took 10 minutes to do they did they had an average order value of 38 and now they have an average order value of 45 and they did 7 000 in extra profit last month because we tweaked that around that covered that literally covered our for our fee for the month and we made them a ton of extra money on top of that with facebook ads by improving their facebook ads and stuff now lifetime value this is the king of everything because you work really hard to acquire this customer you give them a purchase some awesome products and stuff and you know high ticket you know etc now how can we keep them coming back how can we keep them being the walk-in salesman for the brands keep bringing you customers so that's super key to understand right there now all of these increase revenue and you want to make sure that you're doing all of them profitably so you're clearing cash and if as long as you're clearing cash that's the only thing that matters in bank you're a number one now how exactly do you work on these you know what's what some of the strategies and tips and stuff and that's what i kind of go over in this video so you as a business owner a shopify owner you need to be looking at these three every single day and working on ideas for these you can literally hire a person to manage your customer acquisition hire a person to manage your average order value hire a person for your lifetime value make those three key people uh the golden eggs of your business that's really going to increase your revenue your business this is how multi-million dollar brands are grown so if you still have a if you're if your goal is to make it to 10k a month and that's it you're set then it's not video for you this is for people that's trying to make multi-million dollar brands right here so these three things let's go over each one so customer acquisition let's say for example you're acquiring customers through facebook ads the easiest way to fix your customer acquisition is you know refine your offer at tofu refine you know how you're working in the ad accounts refine that improve uh your cost per acquisition so let's say if you have a cost per acquisition of 50 bucks then you hire an agency like us we come into your business and we improve your ad account now you're acquiring customers at 25 a pop you just became twice as much power profitable inside your business because we we tighten up the screws on your customer acquisition next thing is how can we increase customer acquisition so we believe there's two periods uh there's different times for customer acquisition or growth modes we like to call it that's q2 and q3 so right now q2 and q3 you need this to be an all-time high we want to be nailing down this customer acquisition as hard as we can if we do so we can have a big customer base that we're gonna be able to do at lifetime value with and average order value with increase that those areas right there so customer acquisition is extremely important because you know this is like the stream you know the flow of the water and we want to really push down hard on this now customer acquisition isn't everything though because once you acquire a ton of customers and stuff you can actually utilize those customers continue to grow your business but so once you hit it a certain amount you can still keep pushing your paid advertising efforts or you can literally even stop it brands like fashion nova is literally like a lot of their cold advertising is turned off because their customers have built up so much and they have such a long lifetime value and good average order value that they can build up a lot of things like that based off the customers already acquired so customer acquisition is super important but it's not the in-all be-all and a lot of e-commerce brands are completely focused on right here that's all their focus they're like wow you know i'm only getting a 2x roas and i'm not profitable anymore in my business you know what can i do what can i do and they sit there and and they struggle with those type of things but it's not it that's not the answer right there it's not how can we get your customer acquisition lower it's how can we increase your average order value because if you're acquiring customers at 25 a pop and your average order value is 50 a pop you have 2x roas your break even at 1.5 yes you're just above break even but how can we keep that the same because that's that's gonna be harder getting your customer acquisition costs are hard down that's hard it's without a doubt but it's a lot easier to buy more so say for example right here average order value you know you can increase prices for your business or increase prices for your product that's a good play right there you could do random little odd oddball items that go with your main items so for example we work with a custom watch brand and we can do is we can upgrade them or upsell them on other products that's relevant around watches and that's an easy way to increase the average order value because they're already purchasing this why as well get this it's like when you go to a clothing website and you find a shirt to go pick out and then you see the shoes that matches that shirt like oh i gotta get those shoes and they're like oh got the shoes got the shirt i might as well get the pants and now their average order value from 25 to 100 so this could also be uh using like an app like uf ufe cross sell and upsell bundle which literally allows you to kind of bundle products together and offer it as a discount together so you're purchasing more per order um in a very easy way right there so that's a really great way to increase average order value but get creative a lot of it's upselling a lot of it's like free shipping over orders 100 plus things like that that's inclining people to spend more with a reward if they spend more let's let's make sure i think about it like that how can a reward people spend more reward them by offering a product 50 off if they spend you know maybe 150 200 bucks at checkout so different things like that and right there you can take a say customer acquisition if you're doing a 2x right now average order value you go from 50 to 75 all of a sudden you are doing a 3x return on ads and you're profitable you have some extra products in return now lifetime value this is something that i think a lot of brands that went from drop shipping to now trying to build a brand is struggling with it's the lifetime value reason behind that is they're so used to just one-off sales quick sales real quick that they forget you're building a brand and let's say for example you know you keep trying to make your business off the first time customers and then you know like a clothing brand people might purchase from five to seven times a year and then think about multiple years after so imagine three years five to seven purchase per year that could be 15 to 21 purchases so an average order value of 100 bucks anywhere from 1500 to 2100 per customer but because you have bad customer retention programs you have bad customer service you have bad shipping those things that leave a sour taste in a customer's mouth before you really even receive their product or have received their product they're not going to be inclined to purchase from you again you have a lower customer lifetime value really great customer lifetime value you're gonna spend a lot more with you over a period of time now with that being said you can do retention programs as like just creating products and upselling one other products in your store when they purchase a product once from you they're more inclined to purchase from you again so that's a great way to increase lifetime value upsell them from your other products in your store do launches limited time launches for your existing customers just also just keep pushing more products to them upsell them through email emails the best way to do this or an email and sms because it's free and or at least free compared to facebook ads and stuff so you spend a lot less and you keep pushing stuff to them and what happens is that increases that lifetime value also creating loyalty programs for them for referring friends um or you know say for example uh doing discounts for purchasing again that type of stuff that inclines them to keep purchasing so when you focus on these three so now let's say you have a customer acquisition of 25 average order value of 50 bucks and a lifetime value of i don't know let's say 25 or 50 bucks because they don't purchase again so yeah you don't have two extra turn on ads been you're consistently doing it every month and you're burning through customers essentially now all of a sudden let's do the new way the 2.0 way customer acquisition 25 bucks still average order value now 75 bucks we're doing three extra turn on ads been lifetime value we put some upsells in there and customers are purchasing now two to three times a year with an average order value of 75 bucks now all of a sudden we have a customer acquisition of 25 bucks average order value of 75 dollars and the typical customer purchases two to three times a year now we're spending let's see let's see 150 150 to three uh yeah i can't do math right now but somewhere above 200 bucks our lifetime value with a customer acquisition of 25 dollars now you're literally doing almost a 10x return on your ad spend that's how you increase revenue increase profit and grow a brand so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you were an e-commerce shopify
