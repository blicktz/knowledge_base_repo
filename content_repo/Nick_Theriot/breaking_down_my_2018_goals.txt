hey what's going on guys I want to make a quick video today just to run you over my 2018 goals right plans are accomplished in 2018 and what I plan to do and stuff so for a sit back relax basically go over everything I want to do in 2018 between business personal financial wise and just be really transparent with you guys I want to give a huge thank you to Tanner J Fox he's the one that kind of inspired me to make this video at first I wasn't going to you know but I've been having that YouTube bug I want to make a video I felt the urge and I saw this video I said look at January 1st might as well go for our 2018 goals and look I've been wanting to start that whole like transparency and bring people more into my business and see everything that's going on to kind of inspire them that it's possible to do what you want to do in life and make that business and you know that's a whole nother talk and everything but let's just go ahead and get started but like I said again check out Tanner J Fox awesome guy huge shout out to him so I just put everything in an Excel an Excel an Evernote document if you don't have Evernote highly recommended it's awesome so this is my 2018 goals now these are some pretty big and ambitious goals I never judge someone based off their goals I judge someone based off their end result you know type of work they're putting in to do these goals none of these goals are easy I mean and it's kind of hard sometimes when you're sitting down and making goals it's easy to say hey I want to make $100,000 in a year but also it's really hard to make $100,000 in a year easy to say hard to do all of these are easy to say but hard to do it will take a lot of work for me to do and that's one thing I love about 2018 already I'm going in with a plan I'm going in with the platform I just have to work everything now 2017 started with a lot of I don't know what I want to do yet and just testing and testing and testing to where it was maybe November before I finally figured out what I wanted to do and within just two short months I've exploded in growth so let's go over my 2018 goals first thing first I want to be consistently at $15,000 per month in personal income so this is everything I take home after you know dealing with business expenses paying off people between my two businesses Cajun Suds Ontario Solutions this is pre-taxes yeah before taxes so actually it's like $11,000 it's $15,000 so between $10,000 and $11,000 so this is pre-taxes next thing is I want to have $30,000 in the bank between checking and savings account and the reason why is because I'm me posting a lot more money from the bank and I want to put it into various income investments or portfolio investments well I'll get to a little bit after I mean towards the end of this document so I have $30,000 in the bank which is also like three months of living expenses I want to try to get that up to 12 and pump that up but that's what I have for right now I'm finished paying off my truck loan I have like 17 or 18 between 18 to $2,000 left on my truck not much you know that's pretty easy to pay off I'm finished paying off my Amazon credit card I got really stupid when I first got it I put you know about 75% worth of business you know just business stuff on it and I also put a little about 25% of pleasure stuff on it and I just failed to keep you know I just started paying the minimum and failed to pay off the whole thing so I have around $1,800 left to pay on this and that's my goal is to get that knocked out again $1,800 not too bad especially you know business been booming lately so you can put that aside so let's get into my first business well so this is my Facebook Ads business we focus specifically on lead generation generation for face for clients with Facebook Ads I want to make $30,000 per month well get the business up to making $30,000 per month to do that I'm gonna need 20 clients at $1,500 per month that's easily doable I mean doable wasn't easy it's doable there's lots of agencies right now you know $1,500 is starting to become the minimum or kind of like the industry average of how much you're gonna pay for that but I'm focusing I finally figured out how to do it now I've basically I've I'm already working with a business right now and I'm generating you know 100 200 leads per month for that business and now basically I'm just taking that niche that that business is in and going and showcase those results to other other businesses in that niche good thing is I'm working with a local business so let's just say if I work with one of these businesses in each 52 states then I'll be set so I'll be good but I just need 20 so how do I plan on doing that well again like I said showcasing results I want to launch Facebook ad campaigns and everything and I literally just have to get two clients a month for the next 12 months and I'll be set you know that actually put me a little bit over now put me around $36,000 per month in reoccurring fees this is all retainer clients so basically each month they get charged 1500 for my services running Facebook ads to generate them leads for their business so part of that I want to hire a copywriter just someone to do all the copywriting for ads hire an ad specialist I want to get all the ads you know done by an in-house team to sales associates to basically go out there to and cold called cold emails you know try to increase those pump those numbers up a web designer basically to create all of our landing pages email marketers set up all of our email sequences and simple as that so that's basically all I want to do for this business right here it's basically a good passive income as it's not much work to do for the business it's fairly easy it's just running Facebook ad campaigns and I want to get to the point where I just have to manage this team and they're going to basically all pop everything for me so next thing is Cajun suds this is a detailing business I own right now with a business you know I own with another owner to business partner and the goal is to make $24,000 per month we just hit we just broke our first five-figure month we hit a little over 10 grand this month we just opened up a new shop and everything so now we can pretty much stay stay thriving even when it's raining and pouring outside we don't have to worry about that anymore so we're averaging two to three vehicles a week right now our goal is to average well two three vehicles a week at about 1250 per job our goal is to average $2,000 per job and do three times a week easily doable there is other shops you know making anywhere from seventeen hundred twenty three hundred per vehicle so it's doable and then also I want to out you know not outsource but I want to hire two people to train them and get me and my business partner out of the garage that way we can focus focus more on business expansion and increasing sales then constantly working on the work itself so that's basically the goal for that and we'll hit you know 24,000 next 12 months I think it's doable next thing is I want to start like I said I'm starting fresh with a new YouTube channel if you don't know I used to run a channel called it's our the dgfx I started to try to take it over with these personal videos like this business and stuff but the channel is built off of business or gaming and stuff and I want to start a new YouTube channel fresh show I want to start a YouTube channel and grow to 10,000 subscribers in the next 12 months with just completely business personal lifestyle videos I think it's doable I'm a little scared because I'm not a person that's been consistent with YouTube I've quit YouTube multiple times I've getting a little consistent spree see no growth and die my goal this time is just to stay smart and post with people want to see and just try to grow the channel it's not gonna be vlogs it's all gonna be about business tutorials more videos like this where it's just me recording a video and screen capture and it teaching you how to do something next thing is I want to grow my Instagram to 10,000 followers right now I'm at 1,700 so really all I'm gonna do is I can post the high quality photos and stuff post you know that awesome content people enjoy I just need more help with reaching more people and to do this I'm just gonna basically pay for some shout outs you know maybe a hundred you know $75 to 100 a month and just shout outs getting people to you know post my stuff real simple like that Forex I want to average six percent per month really that's taking two to three trades a month and that's like four six hours of work a month honestly it's not too bad this is something that I'm gonna see as more of as a long term investment it's not gonna be something that so like the stock market and stuff or you know it's like it's not like I'm investing in pump and dump stuff this is just investing for like long-term you know trades that gonna last me weeks at a time and that's just a few days unlike my like investment portfolio I want to have a combined forty five thousand dollars tied not not tied up into stuff but just I want to combine basically savings account forty five thousand dollars with some with some of that being split between Forex you know cryptos bonds stocks I just wanted kind of displaced evenly around different investments maybe a little bit of real estate if I can figure out how to get into the real estate you know market without having to invest a bunch of money up front so I haven't really did much research on that and I definitely notice like a few like different stocks you can invest in like the real estate market whole so we'll see how that goes I want to build a circle I've got like millionaire mentors and basically it's not for me or it's not like it's a like a mastermind or anything it's literally just more for me I want to start making a more priority to to build connections with these people that are making a million dollars plus a year because I know it's really important if I want to make that I need to start hanging around with those type not really hanging around those people like ditch all my friends right now and hanging out with just them but I definitely make it a priority to start talking to those people more start getting to know you know their secrets and stuff so basically just trying to find a mentor that can help me you know get to that mark right there um I heard a quote it was like if you want to become a billionaire you if you want to if you want to become a billionaire you mean a millionaire you need to hang around with billionaires well I'm trying if I make $15,000 per month I'm in the month in the year of 180,000 around 180 a little over six figures um and so I need to hang around with millionaires I guess you know and then go up to next step so I just need to build a circle more millionaire mentors people can help me out get to that next level in life um I want to read slash listen to one book a week I'm a huge fan of audible um but at the same time you know I do understand there's some books I want to read um and they're not on audible and there's also there's just some good satisfaction just picking up a regular book and looking at everything and reading it uh it feels pretty good too so um most of these books I'll be looking at is going to be sales books and business books um I've been really a big fan of Grant Cardone lately of a few of his sales books I have like three or four of them I kind of like on repeat that I'm constantly listening to so I'm actually um I'm actually probably gonna be purchasing a new one tonight let's see where I go from there next one this is kind of like a personal you know kind of like health wise um last year I went from about 25 body fat all the way down to around 10 10 to 11 body fat and um after I got off my diet I jumped back up to probably around 17 um maybe a little less more 15 18 percent basically I dropped all the way down from 180 to 145 now I'm back around 158 160 so um and I want to maintain that healthy lifestyle uh when I'm eating healthy food all day um you know I feel good I look good I work better um but when I'm eating just a bunch of junk food and crap food all day I'm just like oh I'm not as you know up awake and everything so um and really it's just personal goal thing I've I've always been you know a little heavier side my whole life and once I got down to that that lower percentage of body fat I felt really good um I know it's it's kind of one of those self just self personal goals really um of this one so um I want to increase my knowledge on online sales um just basically learning more about Facebook ads more about selling online um I think it was Alex Becker I saw a video today he literally said you know he would just invest more knowledge in sales too because he could he can literally create like a webinar in five minutes drive traffic to it and generate money from it so that's basically only this is learn more about the psychology and everything of a cell and increasing my overall knowledge of all that so um now this is kind of just pleasure goals right here I really want to buy a 2017 Camaro ss um with my detail shop and everything we just finished working on one we did the full five-year coding pay correction everything like that looked amazing um I've always been a Mustang GT fan and after just moving this around driving you know not really driving it but just moving around the parking lot and stuff back into our garage I fell in love with it and I want it so bad um so I'm not gonna need a Mustang it's obviously I'm gonna go with the Camaro now and um I his you know he does some mods and stuff to his but uh he's actually selling his and he's running it for around forty thousand dollars so um I figure let's just say if I get this next November December um you know I could probably get for one more around thirty thousand at forty thousand dollars um you're looking at six hundred sixty six dollars a month on a 60 month loan and that's not counting insurance or a down payment interest or a down payment obviously gonna pay a lot more um than 666 so but I'm looking to spend my goal is put a good bit down and spend around 500 a month on the note um and whatnot so that's one of the goals and then also moving to Micah apartment at Greystone basically it's just a luxury apartment around here that I've been dreaming about for years I don't know what about what's it about but just for years I've been ever since they were built like I want to move there I want to move there I want to move there and there's like other apartments too that's around it that's equally as nice maybe nicer and I'm still just I'm dead set on this and that actually might be happening um you know I'm not gonna say soon because it still hasn't really been planned out but there's a possibility it'll happen within the next you know two month to two months um um if I decide to go with a roommate if I do decide to just do you know I'm not too sure what I want to do yet for that um but that's my goals for 2018 I know it's some big goals I know you know people have their different opinions on it and stuff um but I think it's all doable and it's definitely gonna take some work you know it's easy right now to type them all out oh yeah let me do this and do this but it's gonna take some work it's gonna take a lot of work work and work but again I've already you know I've already gotten a client I've already you know did ten thousand dollars in a month you know I I know how to get more of these jobs um uh you know just between these two businesses right here um this is easily gonna I already plan to make around 7500 from each one of these businesses that will cover my 15 000 per month um and in fact the 15 000 per month I am going to um make another video kind of breaking that down because it's already like almost 20 minutes so I'll be the next video is kind of breaking it down you know would I use that 15 000 per month because I'll have a really good look at how income should be split up and um you'll kind of enjoy it so thank you for watching and look for more videos coming soon
