yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terry and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i wanted to discuss uh five stages of market awareness i've talked about this a few times on the channel but i've also wanted to go ahead and actually show you guys some examples so put together a few examples for you guys um video be quick because i literally have like 14 minutes left on my camera and uh so yeah let's dive into this before we get started hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday that being said let's dive into it so five stages of market awareness again it's covered this a bunch of times there's not gonna be much about the actual exact each one but more about examples for each one so long story short five stages of market awareness is basically the stages people go through when buying a product these are different markets of people right now around your product so unaware people these are people that are just currently overweight right now or you know maybe a little overweight just they're overweight but it's not a problem to them at all like that they don't have any desire yada yada so we got to create the desire for them so how do we create the desire new study found 60 of people who are 30 pounds over have a five times more likely chance to have a heart second die okay so now it's just like oh shoot that's bad that's it my 30 pounds over like damn that's it's crazy and then problem where it just basically okay i need to lose weight how solution aware or problem where is i need to lose weight how do i lose weight solution where is here's all the different solutions you've been looking at but this is the one you need product aware is more retargeting and aware is more retargeting as well so that being said let's start looking at some of these examples so unaware this is why i stopped eating eggs for four weeks there is no problem that's being solved here there's no solution that's being projected here and ultimately you have no clue and this is a reason why i did not include the full lab because i want to let you guys just wander and ponder what could be be sold here okay what's possibly being sold here you don't know you know it could be weird study about how eggs have high and high in some chemical and you know that's why you stopped eating them it could be some new study about you know are you giving me a study it's just like here here's my bad experience of eggs okay so you open up an unaware market every eight percent of golfers fell at this one course i like using a lot of statistics statistics and more curiosity we're leveraging here okay we're just kind of getting people in with these curious things and then just to give you guys more of what the product is the product is more of an at home and um at home like stomach test i think it is to where it basically um you know test your stomach for certain like hey you do better with these foods that's what the product is so how do we open up an unaware market who has no clue who's not currently looking for one doesn't have a problem with one yada yada yada this is why i stopped eating eggs for four weeks okay now problem where these are people that have a problem but have no clue about a solution for it okay they're aware of the problem i'm aware that i have this particular problem and this is the same exact uh company as well it's the one both of these ads you know i'm aware that this problem indigestion but how do i solve it okay so now this particular creative right here my mom is getting indigestion after eating so now i have a problem with indigestion now i'm like oh okay wait hey look this is this might be one of the ways i can solve it okay you don't know how you're going to solve it you're currently actively on the market with this problem in your head and you just don't know yet okay this is like where 80 of the market lies at in this particular case okay creative basically goes my mom is getting indigestion after eating kind of shows off food people i honestly haven't watched the creative in a long time but it just slowly sells people the fact of why they need this food sensitivity test okay now solution aware fortunately i didn't screenshot the solution aware and all the other ones but just go further down the line i'm gonna show you guys solution aware solution aware you're not actively going out there and saying hey i heard you have this problem or here's your unaware these are people that are currently on the market looking at all of the solutions and you're just trying to pinpoint as why your solution is the best okay you know for someone who i love going out there and lifting weights more like body body building style uh weightlifting everything like that then there's other people out there that are crossfit okay or maybe runners just run don't believe in lifting weights okay then you basically ask me hey sell me on why i should lift weights and the runner sell me on why i should run i'm selling you on the solution here because you want to lose weight so you have two options you can lift weights with me you can go run what's your options you want so i'm selling you on the solution at hand not selling you on fixing your problem i'm selling you on the solution why it's the best one out of all the others okay this is where you can also do kind of just like you know just lay everything out on the table like here's what we're offering here's how we're going to crush it for you yada yada yada okay we're basically just presenting our solution to people meet athletic greens our only one daily drink is packed 75 vitamins here's my solution for people who are looking to for a green powder yada yada yada and it's just basically the guy talking about it okay solution aware people now product aware okay product where is very important so these are all top of funnel ads and you know if you read the book breakthrough advertising by eugene schwartz this is where i've learned all this from and how i developed into my advertising they don't do top of funnel middle funnel bottom of funnel retargeting strategies back in the 60s when they're running ads for large brands it was just these people are currently in the market right now right now there's people in the market actively looking for solutions for green drinks okay there's people in the market right now that are facing indigestion but i have no clue how to solve it they're figuring it out right now so they're watching all these ads that state something like that there's people out there that are they can care less about a food sensitivity test sensitivity tests so we got to present to them a reason why they should care about it we're selling them on the fact why they should have this problem or should care about solving this particular problem right here so we're leveraging curiosity this is also a curiosity as well um just in a different perspective this is like leveraging curiosity with a problem solving technique this is just loving leveraging purely curiosity of getting them a click and watch okay now product aware is when we start getting more into that retargeting stage okay so this is where we're going to sell them on the fact of why should they choose athletic greens over all the other green supplement drinks they're they're looking at right now okay so imagine this imagine i'm looking at your brand and five of your competitors why should i buy from you when these brands all sell the same exact thing okay this is where you're gonna actually you really need to dig deep okay so for athletic greens social proof testimonials things like that work really well at this stage that's a very basic one and then the next stage is digging deeper into um hardcore like limiting beliefs and objections and things like that okay that comes from a lot of customer research so same kind of copy nothing nothing really different here but showing the product and it's showing a testimonial highly recommend tastes great and i feel the difference this also replaces all of my daily vitamins so athletic greens the biggest thing about is on top of just being a green thing it also replaces all your daily vitamins and then six reasons why you should add daily athletic greens to your daily routine okay so we're also on top of a testimonial we're also giving them reasons why they need to add this to their their placement essentially so another really good thing now this is actually just aware aware people so this is people that's currently in the market right now for green supplements they're looking at five different powders including yours and you guys tell them why they should choose yours aware aware people are sold on your brand they trust you all that stuff like that it's just now it's i'm price sensitive okay all this person is is price sensitive okay so they trust you all that good stuff so now we just need to offer them a really good offer in that sense that's going to get them to purchase and that's essentially what athletic greens does right here limits i'm only immune support bundle shows off everything and then yeah so hopefully this kind of illustrates the whole five stages of market awareness more from a perspective of that creative side in that sense right there so actually showing you guys give you guys some examples of headlines and kind of how each one is opened up and don't limit yourself like i've talked to people before where it's like oh so unaware and then problem aware is retargeting and all the way down it's it's no it's not the this is on more higher level of macro level that you need to be thinking about this is people that are currently in the market right now who have the problem of being overweight this is the people currently in the market right now who have looked at five different solutions for losing weight they're just not sure which one this is the people that are currently in the market right now they're overweight they've figured out macro counting is their best way and now there's five brands choosing macro counting and you're essentially trying to go ahead and sell them on why they need you your brand okay it's for the people out there that sold on your brain and everything like that but just waiting for that right offer okay it's from a higher bigger macro level than just looking at your brand and each customer journey that they go through so hopefully this helps you guys out i recommend running different creative tests leveraging these and it's mostly just the messaging that that first headline is the most important thing right there of grabbing those specific audiences test right there and you may even see a lower robust for some of these um bigger ones but provide you a little bit more scalability because you're reaching a more broader market that just needs a little bit more time to being sold on but you have longer term scalability in that that sense right there so it's also something else to look at too so yeah guys thank you all so much for watching this video if you're doing
