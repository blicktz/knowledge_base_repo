Hey guys, Nick here. Welcome back to the channel. Today we'll be talking about Facebook ads, probably one of the easiest strategies you can implement in your Facebook ad structure.

If you're still not running Facebook ads or Instagram ads, your business is losing, whether it's your personality brand, entrepreneur, no matter what industry you're in, Facebook ads and Instagram ads are the cheapest forms of advertising right now. And where is everybody's attention? On their phone.

If you're still running billboard ads, TV ads, radio ads, you're wasting your money. Facebook ads and Instagram ads are huge. And basically people have two reasons they don't run them.

One, they either suck at it or two, they hire the wrong people and get no results. Today I want to show you all a quick video on just a very simple strategy you can use, whether it's Facebook or Instagram ads, to deliver some basic results and to allow you to kind of run some little bit more experienced ads than everyone else in the industry. Let's jump into my computer.

Alrighty guys, in my computer. And I want to just quickly, real quick before we begin. And that's one thing I am tired of seeing is two, people are constantly complaining because one, Facebook ads did not work for their business or two, they tried outsourcing or something like that.

They hired the wrong person and didn't work for their business either. So they pretty much complained and say, Hey, Facebook ads never work. And they continue dumping money into radio ads, news ads, et cetera.

Facebook ads is still very much relevant. They still work and they're still extremely underpriced compared to, you know, radio ads and TV ads. I mean, come on.

When was a commercial, a TV commercial, custom tailored to retarget you because you went on someone's website? That's not possible with TV ads. And it's very much possible with Facebook ads.

And one of the biggest reasons why so many people are failing with Facebook ads is because they're, they're not running them properly. They're going ahead and just boosting a post and they're getting a little bit of brand awareness and that's it. They're completely focused on this fricking brand awareness and just trying to get as many likes as they can on their page, their posts and stuff.

And they're, they're not directly going out there and generating stuff for their business. They have no specific campaign goal. This ain't, you know, TV commercials and radio shows and all that, uh, radio commercials.

That's pretty much all just brand awareness. Whereas like Facebook, Instagram, you can target directly target people. You can build, um, you can come there and build campaigns to warm people up and then put an offer for them custom tailored to the people who's been following your stuff.

You can't do that with a radio show. How can you retarget someone for radio show and not actively target every single other person that's not warmed up yet? So I just want to quickly kind of go over a very, very simple campaign that if you don't have the money to hire someone, if you don't, um, if you're tired of Googling and YouTube and you can't find anything, I'm going to show you guys a proven strategy right now that works in these ad space.

And it's still very, very relevant. So let's jump into it. So, um, right at TW, whatever, uh, you know, people are coming there and they're launching ads.

So this be your ad Facebook ad, they launch an ad and they come there and they put a big O arrow basically and push everyone's attention to buy now. That's just going to be that. And you see the problem with that is no one heard you before.

No one heard of you before. And so that doesn't work because no one, I mean, no one has heard of you. I'm trying to, I'm trying to get this.

So no one has heard of you. No one knows you. Um, yeah, how, but you get the point.

So no one knows you, no one heard of you, no one trusts you. And you're basically just launching ads into their face to buy now. And that doesn't do anything that doesn't get results.

That doesn't, you know, that's a basically a stranger walking up to you on the street and say, Hey, can I $5 sir? Hey, buy this from me now, buy this watch from me. You have no clue what brand watches.

You have nothing. You just know it's watch. Here's, you know, 20 bucks right in front of you.

It could be a fake watch. It could be a watch that dies the next 20 minutes. It's, you know, you don't really see any trust or anything like that.

So what's the easiest way to basically get people to trust you is building up a simple, very simple retargeting sequence on Facebook. So basically what you do is you come there and, you know, here's your, this is our campaign right here. Um, our campaign.

So basically the very, the simplest thing you can do is launch a kind of, it's like a four, three to four, uh, stage sequence, uh, of videos and stuff. So basically what you do is you launch, you know, one, two, and then three, four. So you're going to need about four pieces of content.

Okay. Um, the first one right here, the very first one is just going to be a simple brain awareness. So let's say if you're, you're a, you know, let's say a plumber, let's say if you're a plumber, just do a simple, maybe video of either, you know, saying that you're a plumber.

So, you know, how do you do that? How do you say you're a plumber? Maybe do a quick video of going through a few jobs completed.

So, you know, a little bit of music, just showing some finished jobs. Um, simple, just get some awareness of that. And then you can come there and retarget those people.

So you upload that, create an ad for that video of just simple brain awareness, then you can retarget. Let me do it like that. You can retarget people who watched that video by 50%.

So people who already aware you're a fricking plumber, you're a fricking plumber. And, um, then you come in and retarget those people with another video, maybe a happy customer, or maybe, uh, um, another job completed. Maybe you talking about, uh, a specific service you're looking for, maybe you're a plumber and you want to specifically focus on selling a hot water tank and you create another video a little bit more in-depth.

Um, so more in-depth and then you can come there and retarget those people again by either 50%, 75%, et cetera. And you want to give them an offer, something that they can literally take an action with. So maybe it's 25% off a first service, 25% off for first customers, maybe, um, $200 off a specific hot water tank.

Maybe it's just a free consultation, you know, some type of offer. And you see what you're doing is you're simply, you created that brand awareness. So people are aware of what you're doing that way.

They might watch your in-depth video on, you know, learning a little bit more about you and then you can retarget those people again. So you're kind of building a camp of like a series of videos, a value ladder, and you create your first video and then you're retargeting just the people who watched that first video. And then you're retargeting that second video with an offer that just those people watched.

So it's consistently pushing people down a value ladder. You're building trust with them. You're building, you're gaining their attention and you're putting stuff right into their face of what they need to see.

So that's kind of like one of the easiest strategies you can do. Now, what's this forefront right here? This would be just simply another form of retargeting.

Um, this is where you want to retarget the people who, who, uh, did not opt into the offer. And you can do some type of like customer testimonial right here where you can talk about how much just helped them, et cetera, how much amazing this company is and gives people another chance to opt into the offer. So it puts a little bit more, um, kind of trust and it gives them a little bit more incentive.

Oh, wow. You know, maybe I shouldn't have passed it all for up because this person says this company is amazing. So, um, that's kind of like the most simplest strategy and right here.

And what's going to happen is you're going to spend, you know, maybe a lot of money on up front right here and less money in these backend offers. Whereas some people, they just blow a whole bunch of money running traffic to buy now ads. And that doesn't work.

And, you know, the reason why it doesn't work again, there's no trust. No trust. There's no relationship that was built and there's no basically kind of like reason to buy.

Now you got to create the reason, et cetera, the offer. You got to build a relationship, um, which be like, kind of like the brand awareness. You got to get their trust or maybe like going through like an install or something.

Uh, and then you got to kind of like be able to handle any objections or give them anything else they need, which is called action. I mean, with a customer testimonial, you know, kind of reinstating that trust, rebuilding the trust. So here's like the reason why these work.

Try to circle that. These work. And this is shit because no one wants just a big, like literally, I can tell y'all the exact ad format they use.

They come there. Here's their, here's their texts. Uh, you know, we do affordable plumbing, et cetera, a phone number and then a website and then a picture with some texts on it.

Um, which is another horrible way to do ads and a little hot water tank. Ooh, there you go. And then literally on the website and then somewhere right here, I'll say buy now and it'll come there and they'll start at $5 a day, get no results.

Oh, we need to be spending more. So let's do $10 a day. Oh, we need to be spending more.

And then they're up to $20 a day. They come there and they blow through maybe a thousand dollar budget, um, within the first month. Now this is also a little bit more of experience budget, uh, a little bit more experience thing.

And then they get no results with it. And they come there and literally just, Oh, it doesn't work. It doesn't work.

So they go back to radio, TV and, uh, commercials, et cetera. So they go back to that and then they end up spending way much more. They have no real way to track it and stuff.

And they just wasted a huge opportunity. Plus, you know, building a huge brand on Instagram and Facebook is the future. Whereas this stuff is dying.

I mean, come on, there's less and less people watching TV every day. There's less and less people watching, um, listening to the radio every day. I mean, more and more people listening to Spotify, more and more people watching Netflix.

There's really no commercials or TV ads or anything on that. That's a decline over time. Facebook and Instagram is still very underpriced on ad space.

And the only reason why you're not getting the results is because one, you're not using a correct strategy. You're not testing, you're not split testing your ads. You're not testing your audiences.

You're not going to seek professional advice. You're hitting boost a post and you're not doing anything else. That is why you're not getting results with your Facebook ads.

And therefore you complain about it and you, you basically pull your money out of it and you're missing out on a huge opportunity to, to have a, basically a future investment for your business. And that is what you're doing wrong. And as why is the biggest mistake right now with Facebook ads and so many business owners.

Guys, I hope this strategy helps you out. Uh, like I said, super simple, create a brand awareness video, retarget people with some type of like, um, you know, kind of like middle stage, a little bit more in depth video, maybe on a specific product or service you want to promote, retarget them with an offer, then retarget people who don't go into that offer with some of the customer, customer testimonial and like really focus on why your brand is the best and why you need to get that offer. And guys, trust me, that's going to do a hell lot better than just saying buy now and boosting it everywhere.

Thank y'all for watching. Have a good day.
