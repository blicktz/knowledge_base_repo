yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys actually pretty pretty sharp video I just kind of go over a few things today we're gonna discuss of how to find content for your retargeting campaigns and I kind of hit a gold mine for this specific topic and I really really really really want to encourage you guys so you're probably wondering right now it's like okay you're running some campaigns and stuff and you don't really know what to do for retargeting you're kind of clueless on what to do with it and you need a more structured way of exactly what to put in your retargeting campaigns so it will make sense for your customers so before we get started make sure you hit that like button and if you're new to channel hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday that being said let's get started so I've been in a situation before where I'm running retargeting campaigns and stuff and I feel like I'm just tossing in random content that I think my consumer will enjoy now that's the number one mistake you can make because if you assume something about your customer and of what they want it's like a red flag and that's the same thing with product development product validation stuff if you assume this product if this this customer wants this product without actually doing your research and our pain points and stuff like that and seeing it'll actually work then that's like huge red flag so I can apply that same psychology to how can I find retargeting content and I have a few few few examples for you guys that I'm really excited to share with you guys today that's gonna make a massive help so number one go through your ad account look at your let's say top five ads the best performing ones the ones that get the most spin and you can even look at the ones with the most engagement likes comments and specifically comments and what we want to do is we literally just want to take some time out of our day to open up a few of these ads you know preview them view them as a Facebook post with comments and literally just go through the comments and yeah recently just did this for a client of mine where I need to do a skincare brand and having a little issue with me fully grasping myself around this particular product and we look at all the comments and we had a few complaints that we can better improve on we had a few questions and we had a few reviews in it so that's typically what you'll see views people saying how great of a product it is some complaints some questions and we want to really just write down all of them and specifically you don't have to write down every single one but you know kind of have like a a list of the most asked questions the most complaints and the most reviews or common reviews so say for example uh we're running a skincare brand can't really say their brand stuff due to NDA and stuff and what our product is but it's a skincare brand helps with some some stuff around the eyes and stuff and they had a lot of pros about how it helped people in as little as few hours and a lot of consistent people talking about that and would it help them with uh so we roll that down and then we saw a lot of questions is it cruelty free is it vegan free does it do this is it safe for this type of skin condition and stuff so those questions right there we can do two things when we can take them we can put them on the product page which we will we can also too we put and make retargeting content with this so we can retarget these people in our mofu and our bofu with these exact questions and answers so you can you can even do this in ad copy so 100 cruelty free if that's a common question let's put that the common questions for sensitive skin we put safe for all sensitive skin we can put the questions and we can put them together in ads and now we know what type of ad copy what type of questions and answers we need to put in these particular retargeting campaigns and then the complaints we can actually use this to better improve the product you know people see complaints as like this nasty thing we need to hide it and push it off and stuff but in fact it's it's people voicing their opinion about your product and you need to use this to effectively grow your business you know um one of the biggest complaints about this was the skincare brand was that the models were too young to even have this particular issue so the people are targeting there was a big mismatch between the product market fit so we flip that around our ads gonna be doing a hell lot better we put a model of the exact age that we're marketing with the skin conditioning using this product and getting the results we're gonna see significantly better results because we're more effectively advertising to our general consumer so use the comments questions and stuff like that as a resource to improve your content throughout your ads and you can take some of this and lead it with it in the front end ad copy all that good stuff so use that next place or just to recap look back pick your five to ten best performing ads and look at all the comments easy write down questions write down some of the answers to those questions that you have and then write down the complaints much as they hurt if you hit them on the ad you know view them then you can hide them again or whatever but view them except that these are real complaint or valid complaint and how you can build off of this to make sure that this complaint never happens again next thing is all the reviews write those sounds and you can utilize them in your ads and stuff so now you can actually apply the same concept to all of your social media posts on your page your instagram page your facebook page just assuming you're getting a lot of likes and comments and stuff you get a comment or two here and now and then still accept it still use it but consistently review your comments and stuff on your social media posts as well because you're going to see these same things questions compliments and complaints so the qcc let's just say that so we want to make sure we get all that so much data as we can and we can you can better create content that effectively answer these because we can the better we can answer these before it even comes to our mind it's like pulling out a red carpet experience for our customer because oh i have this complaint well wait wait it's answered right there oh okay well what about that oh it's already answered and wow this is just perfect there's reviews there's all my questions answers like literally someone's sitting in my mind and like literally answering for me on the page that's how we want to make our customers feel so we can have a more effective experience for them when they're buying our product now you can also apply the same strategy to competitors ads competitor social media posts looking up this products and looking at it on youtube uh so if you sell a i don't know let's just say you sell an energy drink here's my monster energy drink right now i'm drinking right now let's say you you sipping on that right now or let's say you're selling that particular product you can look at competitors energy drinks and see what's the reviews about those products you can find your monster your so you sell a monster you find your rain your celsius and all that find their complaints and stuff on their amazon product on their amazon listings and stuff and really figure out what people have complaints about they love and some of the terminology and stuff and that's going to better increase your effectiveness your advertising ad copy retargeting content and overall it's going to generate you a ton more sales in the process so if you like these top kind of topics and stuff i'll be releasing this in my first ever course i'll be releasing nfq2 um it's going to be about 20 on the actual ad account structure side but 80 more on the strategy and effectiveness of running ads and stuff more of the strategy the the uh copywriting all that good stuff so it's going to be a more strategic course than hands-on but it's still be very hands-on and pretty much anyone from zero to 30k a month in terms of their shopify revenue will will benefit massively from it but if you're making over 30k a month it's time for you to step back pull yourself back and it's time to start working with an agency our calendar just opened up for two new clients at terrio solutions my digital
