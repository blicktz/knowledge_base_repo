I'm finally facing it all Fearless Yo, what's up guys? Happy money Monday I know it's actually Tuesday right now and I do apologize. It has been more like two days since I've released the video I've been super busy with the apartment everything and just like Just crazy overwhelmed with everything going on and I just haven't really had the energy or like the focus also Carly if the camera on stuff, but you haven't really missed much.

I've just been doing more smaller loads from old house Setting things up over here Do have a few things to take care of this morning. I just got a new Vacuum in it's like a Dyson was handheld Dyson ones, but it's like the off-brand one So it's a lot cheaper and had amazing reviews on Amazon so about to unbox that got a playstation and I just finished Unboxing some other stuff just like some more supplements and stuff I need to restock on now finally got this cabinet set up how I want and I'm sure I'll change it again But get the food scale the protein and then once I start working on the gym again I'm gonna take my pre-workout and crazy and put that my gym bag I got the greens and I just finished loading up My pills and stuff like that. I mean I think I'll take a lot of different things to just help out with like overall mental performance and stuff during a day so I'm about to take care of all that and Let me show you guys the What I recently just did I hung up the TV Got the TV hung up so and actually I put it a little too wide so if you look at the wall You know you probably think about like right there's where I should have had that it's like middle of the TV It's just a little bit higher, but overall it's still easy to see if you're standing up You have no issue at all looking at it and then we got the few pictures set in here We got the first so we have the mindset picture and then also too I Measured and hung those up so I got a black wrap-around couch that's gonna go between this whole little L right here and Then I got some red pillows for that couch a white and gray rug coming in a black table with a white marble top for the coffee table and then a black entertainment center So we're gonna try to keep that black white gray vibe with a little bit of red accents and then if you like blue accents here throughout the apartment, so That's not like update on the actual Apartment itself right now.

I do have a lot of work. I need to catch up on today a lot because You know over the last three days. I haven't really got to do much with the online business Besides a little bit like you check-ins here and there So if I try to crush out at least a three to four hour work block today And then we got to go to like Target super one whatever load up on groceries and stuff because I still have yet to have any groceries in the apartment and also to I do need to I So have like little other things around the apartment I need to clean up like fix up like I still have yet to really unbox a lot of my like clothing and stuff in my room So it's always kind of scattered everywhere so I need to work on that, too So there's a lot of little things I'm still working on but it's a work in progress I just cannot wait to get that couch in So I can actually sit my living room right now the living room is kind of boom I just have like my office or my bed can really sit on and then we do need to get some outside furniture, but that's all Work in progress.

I'm trying to get everything in the next two three months Settled in I got that stimulus check that finally came through so I may I'm trying to be smart with it I'm putting it down for extra rent, but I'm really tipped it's like good get the rest of my stuff I Yeah, this is pretty cool. It's a vacuum so I don't have much to say about it But perfect a little thing exactly what I need for over here My parents had a Dyson one that looked exactly like this except this was a hundred bucks there's just like four or five hundred dollars and It was for like dog hair all that, you know tough stuff. Whereas this apartment.

I mean I literally won't have much like nearly the same So I had a bunch of dust back there from drilling into the sheetrock for the TV mount, but that was Perfect for this right here. All right I'm about to sit down and start doing some work, but I want to show you the office area really quick Kind of like what I got put together still not finalized, but it's a work in progress. Let's check it out so walk right in and You got your desk computer just straight out looking outside.

Let me just show you all that view real quick full view It's a little pond they got set up Got Phoenix and stuff set up on this wall I'll probably end up maybe putting some type of white wall art this wall Something like have my living room with three pieces put together and I got my bookshelf right here Some books and stuff. I'm about to order another one of these stacked on top Just because that box is full of books and shelves pretty much almost packed and so we have two levels So so deciding on that, but it's very simple in here And this is exactly what I want it so like I said, so you got a lot of organizing and stuff to do But overall the concept and stuff is all how I want it. And honestly, I just love the desk right now because Just nice overview look Eventually, I will upgrade to a bigger desk Maybe one that's about another foot wider than this one and maybe like a stand-up with an ultra wide kind of setup going on but so far I love this desk and Yeah, that's what we got right now So I'm about to hop into a consulting call some more work and then Like one o'clock another consulting calls.

I got two consulting calls today to do and Catch up on a lot of work updating clients and stuff Doing some Monday activities and stuff then later on today We'll go do shopping and all kinds of other stuff like that coming to an end with this work block Two consulting calls also. It's like update my clients and stuff. It's a lot of work to catch up on today But probably something like kind of faded out over the next few days because now I do need to also do some stuff for the apartment So as we have a balance act today, but I'm really excited because I starting with an ad account Testing out automated rules for the first time So basically that does is if I'm not by the ad account, they'll kind of do things for me and I know one particular ad account It's it's super up and down with it.

So I'm trying to spend less but capitalize on the days. It's good. So With this ad account, it's like we have like a day where like sales are going amazing The next day boom then maybe two days go by where it's bad and then it like shoots back up again So I'm trying to maximize the ROAS for that ad spin So I'm using some automated rules to where I'm only spending maybe 20 $30 a day on an ad set and If it's super profitable that day to keep scaling it up, so I did that exact thing Saturday where I logged in I saw the ad set was doing good So I'm like, you know what?

Let's just see what happens so I like tripled the budget for like $30 today all the way up to $200 or 100 to 150 dollars a day and We'd have like an 8x ROAS for that particular day So I'm like okay if it worked for that one day can I do it for multiple other campaigns other ad sets and stuff So that way we're spending less on the days It's not good as soon as we have an ad set doing really well It'll keep pumping budget into it until it kind of hits that ceiling so So we'll kind of see how that works if it works really good. It's definitely a tutorial we're gonna make And show you guys the results on that. We're gonna head out.

We do need to get some food Gonna grab some food and stuff for me grab something for Kennedy goes here at work And then after that I need to go to Target to pick up a few things right do honestly all my shopping at Target I do want to come stop at Whole Foods though because they have some amazing chicken and I just want the chicken because everything else over there is super overpriced So definitely don't want to do all my shopping there, but just the chicken because it's they do some bomb ass chicken over there and It's like pre-marinated chicken. That's already very like finally like cut up and looked over so it comes out really good like you literally just throw it in the oven and Pop it without having to do all kinds of seasoning and stuff to it. Good morning guys It's currently the next day I'm actually in this video today with cleaning Phoenix's cage Phoenix needs his cage is absolutely disgusting right now It's been about a month since I put this match in so it needs to come out You can do it every month to two months.
