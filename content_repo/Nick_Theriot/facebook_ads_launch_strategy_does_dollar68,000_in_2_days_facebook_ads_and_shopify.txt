yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel in today's video i want to share with you guys exactly how we did 68 000 within two days yes this is a launch formula i'm gonna go over in fact this is actually our black friday recap of what we did for black friday in 2020 but it's the exact formula we use over and over and over for product launches events things were a big thing is happening and we need to build a lot of attention and awareness so we actually replicate this exact formula for product launches and all that fun stuff so today we're going to discuss everything exactly what we did to achieve these results and before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one that being said let's get started guys okay so doing 68 000 in two days for a launch event is not something you can just do within two days the two days was just the pinnacle of everything we've worked for that was literally the lag indicator of everything we did all the lead indicators we did over the two weeks before this launch so i'm actually going to take you right into everything we did so first off here's just the screenshots from shopify that this is actually a everything is real so 68 000 in two days usually utilizing our launch formula again we use this for products new product launches new events brand new brands um this is a really really powerful formula and it's super easy to replicate so i'm gonna share with you guys exactly how we did that so project brief um again it's like black friday sell so just maximize sales for black friday and strategy we used we opted in for was our launch formula to do this now first off to do a launch i want you to imagine a party in your head imagine the biggest party you did you went to maybe a music festival maybe a big event and just up to that event you you know you just kept getting so excited because you would see stuff you'd hear people talking about it you know i remember like back in high school when you go to parties and everything uh and just hearing about all the the build up essentially the tension and everything you know who's going who's that you know there's a cool stuff happening maybe going to a music festival and seeing trailers of it previous years and stuff a lot of people talking about it and essentially it's just building up that hype and imagining that party that big party finally getting there and just all of that tension being released and just having an amazing fun time and you know everything led up to it but you see what got you to that party what got you to that music festival is all that tension all that build up all that hype that was created before the actual event and if you want to throw a huge huge event you just can't do that overnight i can't today say hey i want to throw ultra music festival tomorrow you know there's just no way i could reach that many people to create a huge music festival but what happens is it's it's all about the preparation the time it takes to get it going so taking the time to you know go for a few weeks before the actual launch and actually start planning everything out and start figuring out exactly okay you know we want to have a party here this is the party so all the event details this is the people that be coming this type of music we want all that good stuff and all that is kind of thrown in people's faces before the actual event so it takes time to build up create the tension build awareness for the event you know there's no way you're just going to get invited to you know you can't just throw an event today for tomorrow you know throw events a day without zero awareness you need the awareness you need to build up the hype and the tension all that before you can actually have a very successful event so in fact months of building attention and awareness was going to some of these music festivals but what about big sales about big product launches and stuff people miss out on this they you know like hey let's do a huge sale for our brand they do it tomorrow and it was like it was just throwing people's faces huge sale today and you know that probably going to work well three four extra rise but if you hyped it up for a few weeks you could have something huge like this right here so what we did for this black friday event is the same thing we did exactly for all of our product launches events we push ads for all that stuff it's the exact same you know just repeated process so what we did was is we start off by just creating a few list building ads we started going out there and we just did the um it's it's using a lead ad with facebook we didn't even build a landing page just used a lead ad and we had our client create a few ads just talking about the events you know hey this one uh we leveraged a few you know curiosity factors exclusiveness factors some fear of missing out things with like other goods and stuff like hey you don't want to miss this or you're going to miss this and it's a one-time thing so we leveraged also a few on top of just hey this event's happening on this day make sure you register to go to it we leveraged a few things also to build up that hype and that tension and increase that desire to go to that event so we uh between november 13th to november 25th we spent 7 300 on building up awareness for our black friday deal and november 25th is the wednesday and i'm sure exactly we did on the thursday and exactly we did on the friday so this literally almost two weeks before the event we launched our first ads right here and you can see right here we spent a thousand uh five thousand dollars on this one particular campaign right here we generated five thousand leads yes five thousand leads on this particular campaign that's five thousand email addresses we added to this client's email list so just absolutely crazy um added a ton of leads we're averaging about a dollar per lead and we had a bunch of ads we were going after warm this is our warm audience right here um we also did a little bit of cold as well but just a lot of warm engagement 180 days website visitors 180 days purchases 180 days at the card 180 days just creating ad sets of these easy events and just pushing these lead ads to it so we spent five thousand dollars give back five thousand leads and this is something that you know it's not going to be an instant roi because these people on this list are just sitting there you know you spend a dollar to gain a lead but you're not going to know if you're successful until after the black friday so this is a very something i recommend starting small first because if you do it you know let's just say you go invest a five thousand dollars into your product launch and you know that was all of your budget and stuff like that and you do some stuff incorrectly then this could go very wrong for you because we've done this formula from time and time and time again so we know exactly what we need to do to increase the effectiveness of it whereas someone starting this for the first time and blow a bunch of money not get the instant roi feel discouraged do a poor black friday and lose some money so you have to be very careful and have to know exactly what you want to do this built up five thousand people on an email list we just put this email list on specifically set up for black friday so black friday and what we did was we did an early access black friday so people are signing up on this list we're also getting a ton of video views and engagement because we're pushing this ad really really hard so we reached let's see we reached 96 000 people and all those 96 000 people 5 000 people actually signed up for the vip list so we had 5 000 people on a vip list but we also made 96 000 people aware that's in her warm um in this particular client's warm bucket of audiences so we reached 96 000 people in that warm bucket of audiences and we got 5 000 of those people signed up on a vip early access so we made people aware of the black friday event and also 5 000 of those people that we made aware also signed up on a list to get early access to black friday so let me show you that now again just imagine hearing about a party once and never anything else so imagine you know 30 days from today a friend of you told you hey i'm having this party on today and you never heard anything since then would you go what are the odds of you going i would say are slim to net because what's gonna happen is you heard about 30 days ago you forgot about it you've had no tension build up like there was no hype building or anything like that you didn't hear anything about this party and that person texts you hey party's today you coming you're likely not gonna go because you haven't been hearing stuff about it it's not there's it's not top of mind anymore it's not you know stuff came up it doesn't seem important to you anymore so you're just not going to go and that's what happens a lot when some people are running these ads is they they go off with the lead ad they acquire an email address 14 days before an event and people don't hear a thing again from it so what we did was is we start to spend money on retargeting that list of 5 000 people we started spending money on building up hype you know pushing like say for example some music festival we were pushing ads showing off the djs all the bands gonna be there all the events and like little mini things that's happening during that time and we're illustrating that in ads we're creating video ads we're creating you know just regular photocopy ads and on top of that we're also replicating these exact same ads in email marketing to reach these people in two different ways one with facebook ads and one with email marketing you can see right here we did one where it's like get your carts ready go to you know the website add stuff to your cart and um you know get your cart ready vip l vip starts tomorrow so another just top of mind hype builder so different things and we could have actually done a little bit more with this particular client but we started late with them for the black friday so if we would probably had another month of planning we could have actually did way better than results i'm gonna show you in a little bit so that's an important thing is having all that content having all this planned month or two in advance so you know exactly what content you need you can have all that content because things move very very quickly and you're gonna need a lot of creative to move forward with this now a big key thing right here is imagine going to a club everyone wants that exclusive vip area and that was another thing we really leveraged with this black friday special now and even some of our product launches and stuff is having a vip area so the first 100 people i signed up to list is in vip is having that roped off area that only a limited amount of people can get to because it increases the desire of getting on this list it increases the desire of being there on day zero now we launched our early access on thanksgiving day so literally a day before black friday we did early access we shut down the website we leaked out a code to get to the website so in order to access the website and shop on the website you had to have this code and we leaked it out specifically to the the email list and we leaked it out through ads so we we tailored as you can see right here black friday early access we spent twenty five hundred dollars today on that one particular campaign made back ten thousand dollars with you know 4.16 robots and the the key things understand when you don't need big launches right here roas is going to be crazy we've had like huge successful black fridays for some brands where they had a 2x roas in their ads manager but if you compare the total daily spin of facebook that day compared to the the revenue in shopify it's like a 10x roas and that's because the attribution is all over the place because it's such a crazy and volatile period but that's why we keep track of totals and i'm going to show you that towards the end of the total spin and total revenue we generated uh during that period of time so this was our black friday early access so this is again this was on thursday and this was literally shutting the website down putting a code like you have to enter a code to get in leaking that code out to our list and people got early access to everything on the store a day before so they can get early access to all the stuff before it gets sold out when the rush and the crowd comes in and just to recap we spent we made 24 000 that day that's the biggest day this brand has ever seen is they this brand particularly had one launch one time within that year of 2020 and the biggest day they ever had was 20 000 and just on our early access day we spent or we made back 24 000 and just to recap we spent 2600 that day so we made near 10x roas on that one specific day and i was literally just through emails and that's it because we were running um the warm ads specifically to that email list so we had ads going towards that email list and we also had emails going throughout that list so we were double teaming that one particular email list right there of early people vip access now after the early access and stuff went away now it was time to the next day the friday actual black friday day actual black friday day of when we needed to really push this so what we did was is we targeted everything essentially for black friday we target everything under the sun i'm not going to get into the actual ad sets that we used but we had literally an ad set for everything you could think of 25 website visitors add to cart purchases initiate checkouts reach campaign we've had uh video view campaigns we had customer lists literally everything under the sun that's targetable on facebook we targeted because we wanted to spend a lot that day and you know we spent up 5400 that day and you can see right here just inside the ads manager we had around a 3x return on adsmen for that particular day uh over 3x actually almost 4x return on adsmen that particular day and i'm gonna show you guys exactly what it looks like in the shopify manager in a second so but you can see right there on our top of funnel we crushed it keep in mind i know i didn't say this yet this brand has a break even of 1.8 so this all looks really good really healthy top of funnel right here looks extremely well i guess this is a cold audience excluding everything so we were going to have to completely just people in the market right now ready to buy our purchases as previous purchases and lists customer lists email lists all that stuff site traffic so everything website visitors ads cart all that stuff and then page engagement now i didn't want to share this with you guys but you see right here our page engagement 900 bucks spent 3.09 $2,800 this is the one of the most profitable audiences and for some reason we just sucked with this particular audience for black friday and we could not find figure out why why it wasn't working all that good stuff well guys this is just letting you guys know that not everyone's perfect and my assistant created the audiences for the page engagement and literally they went ahead and targeted the wrong instagram facebook profile when you select instagram engagement facebook engagement so i'm literally just being as transparent with you guys i've made mistakes in the past and this is one of probably my 10 to 20 000 mistakes right here and something why we double check and i'll have his systems in place to make sure that never happens again and has not ever happened again just for future clients watching this video so that was a huge mistake for rn and we probably could have had around a six to seven thousand dollar day right there on that particular campaign but it fell short because there was some engagement audiences we were using that was properly set up but then there's a few that wasn't so that's my 10 to 20 000 mistake for you guys but still we even crushed it that day spending uh making 44 000 back out literally just a hundred dollars away not even hundred dollars away from hitting that 45 000 mark which would have been insane but we you know did probably around an eight to nine x return on ad spend that day and a big key of this was was just having those videos those hype builders and everything like that prior to make sure that we you know we built up enough hype and everything like that during that time period so that way even though a lot of people were on the early access it was still aware we were doing a big event for black friday they just wasn't sure yet they were weighing their options out and i felt like in 2020 with covid and everything we had a very limited black friday people had limited money supplies and stuff so they weren't planning on spending a ton of money so you know a lot of people were just skeptical staying back but when they saw our deal and everything they came in so now the total spit though because that's the big key right there is the total spent between starting these hype builders and starting the actual black friday thing so we spent fifteen thousand dollars on black friday this year so that's fifteen thousand dollars a facebook ad spend specifically for the black friday campaigns and black friday promote promos and we did back sixty eight thousand dollars in shopify revenue so just over a forex return on ad spends like a 4.5 um x return on ad spend again we did two days so we did early access on thursday and friday we did the official day we've never seen these type of numbers with this ad accounts and we knew it was gonna be a big one because last year or the year before in 2019 we had a really really crazy black friday forum where they were averaging out two to three thousand dollars a day in revenue and their black friday did a ten thousand dollars so we knew we were gonna do something crazy this brand was probably averaging around ten thousand dollars a day in revenue and they ended up going to four to five x that with black friday so just absolutely crazy to some insane numbers again it's just another debrief fifteen thousand dollars spend sixty eight thousand dollars in revenue 1.8 break even a row as for this particular brand with a 450 return on investment and yeah just absolutely insane so this is the exact formula we use though and exact steps it comes down to a lot of strategy a lot of creatives you'd probably spend around make do around 100 creatives per brand when you're spending about a thousand or two thousand dollars a day for black friday any big events but it all leverages the same concept is is throwing a party throwing a big event and what type of hype do we need to build to make sure we get everyone there you're not just going to get people on email list you need to be able to send emails and consistently build the hype build the tension and make sure that you stay on top of mind this is for any event too this is not just black friday we use this exact same structure to any product launches brands that are just starting with ads and stuff we leverage in a bunch of influencers build a ton of hype around it we launch it and then we also do a ton of facebook ads with it to really do a big launch so we might tailor the tactical side of facebook ads influencers google ads all that stuff but the overall concept of how we go about it is exactly the same as seen in this video so hope you guys enjoyed this hope this kind of made some sense of exactly how to build some hype build some tension build some awareness for your big sale and our event and how to how to effectively pull it off so if you're a e-com business owner and you're looking to do
