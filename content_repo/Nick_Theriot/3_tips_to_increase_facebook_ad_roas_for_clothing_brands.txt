two out of the many clients I work with on a day-to-day basis but just to show you guys that everything I show you in this video is actually coming from a place of authenticity actually running these type of strategies and stuff here's one brand right here start with them in December okay currently July 8th and we've generated them almost $500,000 in sales here's the refresh on the page just to show the proof right here here's another brand right here we've been working on since September 18 2019 again today's July 8th we've generated them 1.6 million 500,000 and again here's the refresh of the page just to show you guys that I everything I showed you in this video will be actions you can take that are highly profitable and things that actually work till to this day this is not some outdated strategy this is not just me coming up with different ideas to make a video about this is actual proven actions we've taken to get some amazing results for the clients we work with tip number one is running single product campaigns what I'm seeing a lot of people doing right now is they're creating ads and stuff they're going after cold audiences they're warm audiences and stuff and they're just doing a few generic ads to get people to click on it and bring them to the store front of your website and the problem with that is let's say people are on social media they're browsing through they get hit with one year ads for a blue pair of shorts and they're like oh my god I love those they click on your ad and it takes you to your store front like okay wow now I'm going to spend all this time trying to find this specific product and it interrupts the sales process because it's causing more time for the customer for the prospect and they eventually just get fed up with it and they exit off so the cooling law single product campaign is you're driving traffic so you're promoting a pair of blue shorts you're driving people to that page so people can buy they literally click on the ad they go straight to your website and they're on that page where that product is and they have two options they can buy now or add to cart or just leave single product campaigns work extremely well when you're running ads and stuff and what we'll do is we'll target a few of their top products if it's a new brand we're just starting to work with and then if it's a brand that we've been working with we'll do is we'll start in we'll just create a campaign every time they launch a new product and then eventually we'll have a whole bunch of campaigns running all within individual products and stuff and we've seen some really good returns on this just don't forget to run your warm audiences so these are people who's engaged with your social media and then people who like view different time periods on your website now going to the step number two we're going to talk about audience exclusions there's from time to time again i am auditing ad accounts and stuff and one of the problems i see is people are not excluding audiences from different areas their funnel so they're either be targeting a cold audience and they're not excluding past purchases or maybe they're targeting a middle of funnel audience you know people who visit the website and not even excluding purchases there's different levels of it but here's a few that i recommend so first off you start off at your top of funnel campaign this is going after your cold audience people who've never heard of your brand before you want to exclude website visitors social engagement and purchases so that way you're consistently targeting people who's never been exposed to your brand before then we go into middle of funnel this is your social engagement this is people who may be engaged with an ad who visit your instagram page and visit your facebook page but has never viewed your website or has never made a purchase with you guys this is your social engagement and this is your middle of funnel campaign and essentially what you want to do is you want to push out content and ads right here that conveys your brand to them helps them learn about your brand tells your story show off some customer testimonials some user generated content and as well as just going over a few unique selling points on that product that you're trying to push and then the third is the bottom of funnel campaign this is where you want to target people who viewed your website but did not make a purchase so this is people that actively went on your website and now essentially you just need to present them some other material to get them to purchase so this is where you want to answer any objections people might have to purchasing from you and what you want to do is you want to exclude purchases from here because obviously you don't want to target people who have purchased from you already excluding people from different campaigns and actually creating a campaign structure like this allows people to actually follow a customer journey through ads and actually helps you increase your return big time because you're answering questions you're giving people at each stage of awareness the proper information they need to make a purchase with your business so lastly is user generated content this is critical with clothing because clothing is strictly social proof when it comes down to making the decision if they want to buy or not so people will want to see the clothing on other people before they make the purchase because a they want to see if it looks good two they want to see also if other people are wearing it and other people are enjoying it no one wants to buy clothing that no one enjoys no one wants to buy clothing that no one's wearing clothing is a big thing about leveling up your affinity status which is your social status essentially they figure if you purchase this nice clothing they're going to elevate in status and be a higher up person so what you do is to establish that is show off a bunch of people wearing the items and also saying good things about it so you can run this type of content to your middle of funnel audiences and your bottom of funnel audiences see where it converts better i've seen mixture of returns on both levels so you definitely have to do this testing inside of your ad strategy if you enjoyed this video make sure you hit the
