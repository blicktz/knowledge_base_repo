Too many marketers literally go out there and try to, or business owners, try to go out there and recreate the wheel. It does not have to be that hard. Russell Brunson taught in dotcom secrets that literally the best way to start making money today is going online, mapping out your competitors right now.

Go out and find your competitors. Who is already in your industry right now who is absolutely killing it? Go out there, find those competitors, write them down.

Write down a list, their websites. Try to find any landing pages. Try to map everything up.

Piece together their whole sales process. Put all that together. Go figure out the demographics they're targeting, their offers, their landing pages, some of their ad copy.

What type of words they use on their website. What type of words they use in their Instagram posts, their Facebook posts. The words they use on their paid advertisements.

Screenshot all that. Put it all together in a nice little PowerPoint slideshow. Go do that for five or six different competitors.

You basically have a whole portfolio of what's already working in your industry. Then just model off of that. I'm not saying go copy word for word.

But model. Copy how the tone they use in their advertisements. Copy how they design their website.

Obviously, again, use your own words. But reflect all that. Stop trying to spend all kinds of time and waste all kinds of money to reinvent the wheel.

When you have everything out there, you can go out and execute on and start making money faster online. Versus sitting there and trying to think of something new. Too many people focus on trying to think of something new and they never take action.

And end up just never doing anything.
