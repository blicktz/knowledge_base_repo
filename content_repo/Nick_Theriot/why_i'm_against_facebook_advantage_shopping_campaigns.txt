advantage plus shopping campaigns should you use them what's all the buzz around it been seeing a lot of people talking about it and i've actually had a very interesting experience with them okay now just full transparency this is going to be more of a hot take and more of an opinion styled video i'm not doing a tutorial on how to use them so if you came for a tutorial for using just click off now i'm simply going to be showing my actual opinion against them and my very interesting experience with a facebook rep that's been uh yeah so before we get started if you're questionable why i can't even talk about these type of things well i run a facebook ad agency done over 50 million dollars in online revenue for my clients i also coach a few students around facebook ads so click links below hey have nick terry run your ads or hey have nick terry mentor you and before we get started hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and let's dive into the video so facebook advantage plus shopping campaign um again what this is not this is not a tutorial or anything like that it's simply my very interesting experience with a facebook rep and how i'm totally not against them but i have a lot of bad blood with advantage shopping plus right now all right and i'm gonna show you some examples of why okay so backstory first of all this all started about like two three weeks ago where a meta rep yeah facebook rep uh told my client that hey we were not really producing the best results we could for the specific client because we're not using advantage plus okay now as a client from a client perspective when you know someone else tells you hey your agency's not going good it's leaving all this money on the table you get a little a little kind of upset in that particular case right there and you get the urge to fix it okay so obviously me as an agency owner i want the best for my clients i'm also on profit share with all of my clients so that way i at the end of the day want the best for my clients but i'm also doing the best i can for all my clients because we're both getting a profit share okay so went ahead and we did a test on advantage plus just to you know articulate that it's no different at all than we're currently doing now which is broad single campaign or one campaign per business objective broad targeting and then all of our main ads in one ad set okay now i'll show you that in a second later okay so we did that with advantage plus we tested the results for a week we then hopped on a call um also gave my like you know inner circle students literally the full call for a whole hour they got to see the whole thing um but just saying it's freaking hilarious it is hilarious because you know again went into the call with hey i respect you meta i really do but when you tell my clients that hey us as an agency are doing bad for the client because we're not leveraging advantage plus that's where i got upset yeah they use a specific uh angle of of you know hey nick and his team are doing bad okay and i don't like that all right so i had to go in there and kind of you know flex a little bit not gonna lie all right but i did it in the most ethical honest and least ego driven way as possible to where hey we're on the same team here we're ultimately you know trying to get our client the best results and the client is ours but also yours meta it's not just me okay because they're also giving you a lot of money on a daily basis i'm just helping them make the best decisions okay so i went in there with hey we're all on the same team and i just pretty much questioned them on everything that's all i did all i did hey well what about this what about this i never said anything about hey i'm i'm this and this you should listen to me yada yada yada i just went in there with the pure intentions of hey i'm just curious i'm curious and i want you to entertain me all right or educate me so that's how that's how i approached it okay so it wasn't just like i went in there and started drilling these people and made them want to cry at the end of the day i just simply went in there and questioned their knowledge in the most ethical honest and polite way that's all okay so we ran a test on advantage plus for a week and you can see right here our euro prospecting campaign that's our standard single ad set testing dcts in there as well main ads boom boom boom okay we spent seven thousand dollars over a week but a 2.91 roas then we and our advantage plus prospecting campaign which is same thing same ads inside of it we spent two thousand dollars with a 2.14x roas okay here's red flag number one 99 of the cases when i have the same ads in two campaigns the campaign that spends less always has a better roas why because it's less work the more you spend it requires more work for facebook to find potential customers for your business okay whereas when you spend less it's less work for facebook to find potential customers for your business and you get a better roas okay that's it simple as that so meta reps they responded with saying hey we want you nick to go turn off both these campaigns okay they said hey this test ain't a valid test like why because you didn't launch them both at the same time this one's been running for a while and you launch this new one obviously the one that's been running around for a better and look to be honest that is a fair valid response i'm not gonna lie that is a fair valid response but we could also run this advantage plus for a little bit longer so that's also another thing the problem i have with is turning a campaign that's been around for like six months seven months now i've been running this campaign we want to turn that off so that way we can go relaunch it and relaunch the advantage plus at the same time and see what to work over a period of time okay from an optimistical standpoint hey that sounds really good okay if you were going to guarantee me that that was going to increase performance and guarantee me that we're going to get the same performance okay but the client is crushing it right now doing above you know above kpis we're scaling we're crushing it right now okay why do i want to turn off one of the main campaigns and potentially destroy overall results just to see if advantage plus works better which is built on the same fundamentals of what we're currently doing right now and is the client okay with potentially losing out on a week week to two weeks of money because we want to go test advantage plus because you need guinea pigs basically to test a particular concept and the clients were not far at all okay so that's also let me have to look at right there facebook is basically trying to get us to be their guinea pigs with no ad credits to test their specific thing that's what you have to look at all right now the next thing is what is different about a plus campaigns advantage plus campaigns okay so i had basically conversation all right meta rep said that advantage plus campaigns work better because it can reach more people all right and my first objective to that is is it because of broad targeting and they said yes it is i'm like okay so i'm doing broad targeting and they said oh well what type of broad targeting are you doing and they kind of said it like you're not really doing broad targeting like aged in their location i even showed them the setup and like oh okay yeah you're doing broad targeting all right cool so then i basically said is broad curve a broad conversions campaign basically the same and they said basically so they can't tell me a fundamental difference between you know from a perspective of this statement if it can reach more people it's false if you're running broad targeting already so then we asked you know right now a cbo campaign is called advantage campaign budget and you turn that on it's a cbo campaign now that's the new name for cbo it used to be campaign budget optimization now it's advantage campaign budget okay and we asked and said hey well why is our cbo campaigns that you're trying to get us to turn off to test your advantage plus campaign why is that called advantage cut budget okay and basically what they said is because it's part of the same advantage solutions which is the most efficient right now so you're telling me that advantage plus campaign and anything related to advantage plus is the most efficient way to run facebook ads right now yes that is okay cool great thank you so in my head i'm saying oh wait so are we technically you know we're running advantage plus in a specific campaign so are we technically running advantage plus campaigns in that way that's something you have to think about right there so let's move forward one of my biggest objections to advantage plus shopping campaigns is that it's it's one campaign and then all your ads okay there's no ad sets you know um the ad set you just kind of set and to be quite fair i love the way the ad setup is is set up because it just has no audiences which i'm again i'm a big fan of no audiences i'm a big fan of leveraging facebook algorithm the problem with this is that the way we test new ads with creating a new ad set as a dct dynamic creative test put our creatives in there and test to see if it'll beat our main ad set we cannot do that with advantage plus okay all right so i asked meta i said hey meta like what can we do to use this in the most efficient way so again like positioning like i'm on their side hey you know i see the value here i want to do it the most efficient way how can we test ads what is the recommended procedure to basically test new ads and they gave me two options they said one launch a secondary campaign dedicated for testing so basically launching a testing campaign okay two launch a bunch of new ads within the existing campaign so you have your main advantage campaign and you know with all your ads just start adding new ads to it and delete them if they don't work that was their response okay now i would never do number one because i used to do it and it's terribly inefficient because you're going to find winning ads at 10 to 20 bucks a day but then when you put them in your campaign spending a thousand dollars a day those winning ads don't become winners at a thousand dollars a day because 10 to 20 test a day just shows their winners at ten dollars a day that does not show their winners at a thousand dollars a day what wins at ten dollars a day is different than a hundred dollars a day and it's gonna be different at five hundred dollars a day and to be up a different than a thousand dollars a day the only the way we scale facebook budget is by essentially coming in their account realizing hey you're stuck at a thousand dollars a day you want to go to ten thousand dollars a day it's nothing related to the ad account structure at all it has everything to do with the ads you're running in the account and that these ads are not ten thousand dollar a day ads and we need to create new ads that reflect a ten thousand dollar a day ad spend okay that's it all right so that's why it's important for us to find ads at scale not ads on a dedicated testing budget and when i told them all this they basically just said well you can create new ad sets inside of advantage plus and really we went in there i opened up the campaign i said show me how we had the create button it said you cannot do it then they said just do like try duplicating it and then they thought it was duplicate the ad set it couldn't do it and basically they're like oh shit okay so they even realized that they don't even know their own product okay these specific reps so i know i've been bashing advantage plus but there is some good side to it there is some very good things about advantage plus okay so first thing is what is good about advantage plus it's going to force people to go broad because you cannot use any targeting options all right it's finally starting to leverage facebook's algorithm to the fullest okay next thing is it's going to force people to focus on ads because if you just have one campaign no ad sets and just a bunch of ads in it what is the variable of control for your performance and that is back down to the ads which i'm a huge believer in okay so that's what i love about advantage plus it's it's forcing people to apply best practices now what nick what are you going to do now that you know this information i'm going to do the same damn thing i've already been doing because i'm technically already leveraging all the fundamentals advantage plus i'm doing single campaign per business objective i'm doing broad targeting all main ads in one ad set and then test new ads in a new dynamic ad set within the campaign to find winners at scale i'm already doing everything of what advantage plus stands for okay i'm just not falling for the marketing gimmicks and the marketing things that they're leveraging to imply this new structure okay so all i want you to look at advantage plus is if you already doing broad targeting agent location no interest no look likes okay and you're already focusing just on the ads you're doing cbo one ad set for all your winners and in the testing dynamic creative test that set which i will have a video at the end of this video that you can go to that shows you how to do that if you're not if not already um i do have a very detailed video on that okay but if you're already doing all of that then you're already following the fundamentals of advantage plus and there's no urgency so you need to switch to advantage plus so for this particular ad account that i'll show you guys to be getting when i say one a campaign per business objective we have one campaign per language so like we have our european countries our uk countries our usa um our dutch countries our german countries okay one campaign per country our countries some instances right there cbo one main asset full of our winning ads which i'll show you in a second real quick so we have our testing ads our main asset which is dutch nlb02 we have some testing ads right now we're testing for v-day all right and this is all of our old tests right here and then we have all of our winning ads and our main ad set all right this is literally what advantage shopping plus looks like okay except without the um ad sets now if you want to learn more how to actually run that particular strategy right there simply go to my youtube channel broad targeting and dynamic creatives 2023 facebook ads tutorial i literally go step by step of how to set up this whole thing and lastly moral of the story of this particular thing is be careful all right you never know about other people's agendas okay so you should always be careful in this case right here stop jumping to the grass is greener on the other side a new way to run the ads is not going to be valuable to you if you keep creating shit ads okay you're not going to do anything when it comes down from like from a performance perspective because the new way to run ads does not affect your ability to create ads your ability to create ads is going to have the highest level uh leverage action you can take to increase your performance for your business now focus on what moves performance aka marketing fundamentals on the ad side that's why we have such a simple ad account structure we spend 10 to 15 minutes a day inside the actual ad account the other seven hours we're focusing on the ads and building better ads okay um that's the type of things that's going to move the needle so that's why we focus the whole team's efforts on it so really hope you guys enjoyed this video here's my interesting experience with some meta reps um handling some client objections and stuff like that client even reached out to me post after this and said hey nick uh it's clear to me that you know we know significantly more than them on the facebook ad side let's continue doing what you do best i'm like thank you but the reason why the client kind of had some some some doubts in that case right there is because you have to look at it the the easiest way to outrank someone is just have a higher level authority um so if you have a higher level authority aka facebook telling us that you're working facebook wrong that's where the you know reason those doubts in that case right there so nothing bad about the client at all client you know fully ethical in the way he approached it too as well or she he or she approached it so you know love the client like i'm not upset with the client at all even for coming to me with this specific information because most clients do ignore it but i think we did a very valid test and we handled the situation very well by saying hey cool yeah we'll go ahead and test it we tested it we proved it wrong we hopped on a call with meta reps preferred to learn more about it and they could not give us any information at all about it and and how to use it efficiently basically and just kept kind of their statements kept kind of overlapping with each other that just didn't make sense so that was basically it um hope you enjoyed this video make sure the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday
