if you're not sure what facebook ad to turn off inside of your account we're gonna dive into an account today and actually go over exactly what ads i would turn off during my kind of process of going through the account today so i just got back home from boxing and immediately jumped into the ads manager start going through some client accounts this is one of the accounts that i'm pulling up you're only running um our one cbo campaign right now in this account and last seven days we spent about three thousand dollars with a 33 cost per purchase our target cost per purchase for this account is 30 so we're pretty close we're three dollars away from our target and we'll kind of see if we can actually kind of optimize that and fix that today based off the ad sets that me turning off so let's just dive into this first thing i always like to do when i hop into an account i always like to click on the amount spent right here if you just click on it it'll sort it by highest spending to lowest spending that allows me to just kind of see like what's being spent on in this account and then from a high level to low level because again i always care about highest spending down next thing i'm gonna do is just type in active inside of here we do ad sets of delivery is active and then that way i can see all of the ads that are currently active right now in this account now to be fair we launched all of these tests 149 150 147b 140 you know basically all of these tests we launched last i want to say like last thursday and today's wednesday so long story short these tests had full seven days to spin and none of them took overall spin it improved performance here so all i'm going to do first things first is just turn off these ads i'm just going to click down here boom boom boom and then turn off these had a full week to spin they didn't spend this shows to me that these are just bad ads that's how i view that so boom that's the first thing now next thing we did actually turn off an ad the other day that's what i kind of show you all that ad right there this particular ad was to do 137 now let's take a look into 137 here for a second so 137 fit 993 over the last seven days almost a thousand dollars and this particular ad um had a 39 cost per purchase so that's again nine dollars over our target that we're trying to hit so for me it was like okay cool so we have a nine higher cost per purchase but it's getting good spin so my next question here always comes down to do we have other ads in the account that are doing better with a lower spin or do we or do we have other ads that are doing better with a higher spin yes we do we have 103 it's spent almost double with a much lower cost per acquisition then the next one is do we have ads that a low spin to be fair i don't really care much about the ads at the low spin but do we have any ads for slightly lower spin that have significant results and in this particular example right here this ad right here only spent 138 what a 19 cost per purchase so technically yes it's doing much better but why isn't facebook spending more on this ad that's usually always my question again our target cost per purchase is 30 we're getting a current 19 calls for purchase here so this particular ad set has a 1.68 frequency over the last seven days that means to me that 68 of people saw this ad twice over the last seven days whereas our highest spending ad spent at a 1.23 frequency over the last seven days that means 23 of people saw this ad twice now for me frequency what is an ideal frequency for me an ideal frequency is 1.0 that's ideal now i don't turn off an ad purely based off frequency if an ad's crushing it and has a good frequent like a higher frequency i don't care but it gives me context of what next ads i need to run inside of the account do i need to go ahead and create ads that appeal to larger audiences do i need to go improve my current creative just to make it more appealing right so like give you a great example if i made this video like a 30 minute video and i was like stuttering the whole video and like maybe just talking to the camera not even showing any visuals and stuff like that like i'm the same exact creative or same exact video but just worstly done from a creative standpoint and that would have a very lower view count because people really wouldn't be watching the video they'd be leaving and i'd signal to youtube that hey not many people are watching this video it's not that great lower views and youtube wouldn't recommend it same thing with facebook if the video is not really good in terms of people watching it creatively and stuff like that then what will happen here is you'll get a higher frequency because facebook struggles to find people to show this video to and same thing you know or vice versa if your desire you're going after or the level of marketing awareness you're going after is also not largely resonated like if i make a youtube video for example like market sophistication and i literally say how to use market sophistication it'll get very little views because not many people know what that is so if i call out a desire not many people know of or if i just do a barely poor creatively formatted video both of those things can impact frequency so this particular video here we spent like i said about 993 dollars 1.8 frequency so this shows to me that this ad really will not scale because it's appealing to a small group of people and it's getting a high cost for purchase and we have ads with a much better cpa with a lower frequency which shows to me i can really squeeze more out this video so turning off this ad set is actually going to improve things because now it can shift some of that budget into this and also can shift a little bit more budget into this one right here now we'll have a 30 and a 19 cpa and just to kind of show you all how that would impact things hypothetically i bring things down to about a 29 cost per purchase versus the much higher one that we had originally so yeah that's pretty much it that's how i'll adjust things in this particular account and then just for those who need to know that i do one flexible app per ad set and you can find more content on my channel related to flexblast if you just go watch ultimate flexible ads video and i'll give you the guide of how i do
