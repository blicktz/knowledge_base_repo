So you want to take your Facebook ad results to the next level in 2023, but you're just not sure how. You've been watching my content, you've been watching all these strategies and these techniques around ad account structure and how to create creatives that convert, but you're just not sure yet how to implement those or you're struggling to implement that and it's almost as if you wish I could be right there with you to actively help you implement these things. And if you're watching this video, you're probably likely a brand owner, you run Facebook ads, or you're an agency owner and run Facebook ads for multiple different ad accounts.

And you've been watching my content and you get at the same level, just need that extra help. And today I want to welcome you guys to my inner circle. Okay.

Now just to warn you guys, I'm not going to be showcasing any tactics in this video. So if you clicked on this video, I think you're going to learn some new tactics or strategies. I'm going to be completely honest with you.

I am not sharing that at all. I'm actually here to extend my invite to you guys to welcome you to the inner circle. Okay.

The inner circle is something I deployed in 2022 in Q4, uh, for a few select students as just a test to see how well it would work. And it's been phenomenal for my students. The students have been crushing it.

Uh, it's long story short. It's a place to where you get kind of that mentoring style, um, one-on-one with me, as well as communication with other students. And it's been working amazing for just a place to where you can share your ads, share your problems and allow us to help you in real time in that case right there.

So I do want to go over the inner circle. I think, you know, if you're looking for different ways in terms of different mentors, if you're looking for different ways to expand your education outside of YouTube, then this is the great place to be. I find that my YouTube channel shows you all the tactics, all the strategies are ready.

You know, that's the main thing with the YouTube channel, but this inner circle is more of a way, Hey, I'm implementing this, Nick, can you coach me through on how to implement this? And that's what this inner circle does really well at. So let's just show you really quick.

The inner circle is I'm going to be very straightforward with you guys. It's $600 per month USD. You can cancel anytime and you can join for as little as one month.

You could join today, cancel tomorrow, and then you basically get to stay until your first month is over and that's it. You never get billed again and you get kicked out. Okay.

So just fully transparent with that. I want to tell you guys now what the price is just so I can simply provide value. Now the rest is video to showcase why it's worth that $600 per month.

So again, if you don't really know me, if you don't really know my story, then over $50 million on online revenue with Facebook ads, just in the first half of 2022 alone, we spent $4.5 million. It's been a combined total of $10 million last year, 2022 on Facebook. And we grow businesses.

We come in as a growth partner and we grow businesses, brands through effective paid advertising. So a few of our, you know, basically accounts, say Mids clothing product, where we did $5 million in revenue with $1.2 million in spend in 2022. Say mushroom supplement that we did $1.9 million in revenue with $703k in ad spend in 2022.

Say metal wall art product that we did $900k in revenue with $300k in ad spend. Okay. So what we do does work.

You know, proof is in the pudding right here. We predictably create amazing results for our clients and, you know, likelihood for watching this, you don't necessarily want us to run your ads. So you want them more of that coaching offer in that case.

So a few things here you get once you join this inner circle and I'll show you the, everything you got to do in a second, but let's just show you everything you get first. So you get a 24 seven telegram chat. So imagine if you're in your Facebook ad accounts, you can't choose between two ads to scale.

You literally grab the ad, you send over the group chat, and then, you know, we'll give you real time feedback right then and there to break that problem and help you move forward. Okay. So in order for this to make this work, you do have to be asking questions.

And also I'll ask and make some thought provoking comments as well to get you guys kind of on the right track as well. But this is a great place to meet others. We have some students in here crushing six figures a month.

Um, so really great group to be in that case right there. And again, free to use like however you want in this particular group chat, you also get a weekly Q and a call where all the students come on the call. They share their screens, they share case ads and stuff like that.

And we review those ads and I give guidance and more coaching on how you can improve your business, your funnel, all that good stuff. Now, another thing you get is when you get access to the telegram group chat, you also get all of the history in it, which gives you all the call recordings from previous weeks of calls inside of there. Now, another thing that we just added, actually, that's been a super big value add is because some students can't get to the weekly Q and a calls and that's totally okay.

So what we do is I did just extend a one time 30 minute call a month with me. Um, honestly, 30 minutes is a lot. And I know you probably thinking that's not a lot, but like when you come directly to the call with questions that you actively, you already tried getting the answer on telegram.

And for whatever reason you couldn't, you come into a call straight with a question, we dive straight into it. And a lot of the advice I give you, it takes about 14 to 30 days before you, you can, you know, you fully apply and start to really see and navigate through things. Um, so honestly, like one 30 minute call a month is plenty enough to keep you on the right track as well.

Now you also immediately get access to over 20 plus SOPs as soon as you get into the telegram group chat. Um, again, like these are all the SOPs that we use inside of our agency. Um, I've also have a few case studies in here where I break down ads that we've ran and actually showcase the ads and stuff like that we've ran for a particular brand and stuff like that.

So I'm also consistently updating this and adding more as you guys request. So also feel free to reach out to me in the group chat about anything specifically around an SOP. And I'm more than happy to be able to, uh, you know, add that in there as well.

Also in the group chat, you also get any new strategies and tools, SOPs, things like that, anything new. You're the first person as an inner circle student to get this. There's also a few SOPs in here that I've made YouTube videos as well, but just again, with the inner circle group, I don't dilute anything.

I don't cover anything up, you know, whereas my YouTube channel, like if I showcase an ad for a client, I cover a lot up. Whereas for the inner circle group, everything's fully transparent. You'd see everything.

Um, I don't cover or blur anything out inside of the, uh, the inner circle group. Now, who is this far? You may be wondering, is this right for me?

You know, would I be a good student in that case? Essentially, here's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for advertisers and brand owners who are currently spending on Facebook ads.

Okay. If you're not spending a dollar on Facebook ads at all, or like you've never spent a dollar on Facebook ads all, you wouldn't really be a great fit. Okay.

And why it's because a, if you're a complete beginner and you don't even know how to run a campaign, just keep watching YouTube videos. I have plenty of YouTube videos on that. Now, if you're not actively spending money on Facebook ads and you don't plan for plan to, at least in the first week within getting in the inner circle, it's pointless as well, because this is a lot around, you know, more getting your Facebook ads right in that case right there.

Okay. Now advertisers and brand owners who want specific SOPs to plug and play into their businesses and help them make more money. You know, if you need SOPs and things like that, great place to be advertisers and brand owners want to learn how to better create ads that convert and flood their business with new customers.

Obviously we know the secret is in the creative. And if you're not building good creatives, then that's not really the best action there. You need to be able to build consistently, keep building predictably successful ads.

And that's, what's a super big help in this group, advertisers and brand owners who wants to connect with other like-minded individuals and build a stronger network. So if you want to build a stronger network with other advertisers and brand owners and things like that, then again, another great place to be from a network standpoint. Yes.

Agency owners can join. It's a great place for you to learn how to better run your client ad accounts and help them make more money. Okay.

The only thing I don't talk about for agencies is like, I'm not going to teach you how to hire salesmen to, to find you prospects for your agency. So if you want to learn how to build and scale a marketing agency, this is not the great place to be. But if you want to learn how to better run your client ad accounts and improve your client ad performance, this is the perfect place to be.

So I just, I'll hope you can understand the difference between those two. Now imagine what would it do for your business? If every time you had an ad problem, you could reach out to a group of advertisers plus Nick Terrio and get immediate feedback on what to do.

Okay. So imagine you're stuck on your ad account right now today with a particular problem. Instead of spending the next 30 days trying to trial and error it and trying to fix it yourself, you could reach out to me and a group of other advertisers who've already overcame those particular problems right there.

And you could help get it solved in one day. Think about the time you would save and how much faster you could overcome barriers you've been stuck at for months. I'm going to guidance someone that's been there before many times and have overcame.

So I've been at many different levels. You know, I remember in 2017 total, I spent $10,000 on Facebook ads. In 2023, I spent $10 million on Facebook ads.

I personally invested over $50,000 into mentors, masterminds, and things like that. And I consistently keep investing into my education to ensure that I have the best knowledge on the market. You literally get access to all of that for literally $600 per month because you get access to me and you can ask those questions to me and I can help you break through those things in that case right there.

Now, what ad ideas do you think you would get from ads for ads from someone who has done for over $50 million online revenue with Facebook ads and a group effort of over 20 others? So again, if you need help with ad ideas, if you need help with improving a particular ad, another great place to be because we can actively help you with those specific problems of like, hey, here's a few ad ideas or here's different ways that we would run this product, give you new ad ideas and creative ideas that you can leverage in your account that help you find new winners. So again, recap of everything you get.

You get a 24-7 Telegram group support, weekly Q&A calls, one-on-one with Nick Terrio for 30 minutes once per month, SOPs Nick uses on his ad account plus creating ads, call recordings, be the first to get to new tools, strategies, SOPs, network with others on the same journey as you.
