what's going on guys welcome back to the channel today I want to talk about my top productivity hacks tips and tricks specifically going into work block schedules as that's how I like to do my day-to-day tasks running my agency and stuff as well as maybe give you guys some ideas this is gonna be applied to college students business owners agency owners people who work from home this all these things can different things can be applied as well as you can maybe take away a few tips and stuff it's applied to your current schedule whether you even do the work block schedule like I like to do very first thing to understand is how I set up my schedule and I use the work block schedule so essentially what I do is I block out one to two periods of time throughout the day where I'm spending three to four hours purely just doing work it's on my YouTube channel my Facebook Ads agency my business you know overall just doing work and it's a big help because instead of me just waking up and saying all right you know I'm gonna do a little bit of work now go do this come back to a little bit more work do this I'm simply saying hey between the time of 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. I'm doing nothing but work from 12 p.m.

to 3 p.m. I'm doing nothing but work that's what my work blocks are and what my kind of like my schedule is right now and going into that what I do is throughout those work blocks I set three alarms if I'm doing a three-hour work block where the first one's 50 minutes then I take a 10-minute rest and if I'm on my computer throughout that 10-minute rest I'm gonna get up go walk around drink a glass of water be on my feet for 10 minutes because it's just sitting down for a while it's you know it's not necessarily draining but it just gets the body moving and stuff gets the blood circulating get some deep breaths in I'm spending a lot of a lot of time on my computer I might close my eyes for a few minutes as well still standing up maybe even read a page or two of my book throughout that 10-minute time so 10 minutes complete rest I'll also check my phone check social media etc throughout that period of time but throughout that 50-minute time period my phone is on do not disturb I have an alarm set for 15 minutes just using the normal Apple alarm clock and then I put my phone away still you know visible enough so I can hear an alarm and everything put my phone away I don't want to hear anything from it not be distracted at all and then what I do is before my work block I have all the different tasks I can work on different things my to-do list my intentions for the day of what I plan on getting done throughout these work blocks set in my journal and then that way I can have a list so look I finished one thing I jump to the next throughout that 50-minute time period if I'm working on something and time period comes in in my you know first session of my work block what I do is I just kind of write down a note or two to where that way I can jump right back into it out of that 10-minute rest if there's like a thought or something in my head I'm trying to do so that way I can be reminded and just jump straight back into it so a few things with the work block is number one obviously you need to have the right right intentions going into it right to do list and stuff but two you need to have a quiet place to do your work you know you're in a very loud space get you a really good pair of noise canceling headphones if you can't control the space but if you can't control the place find you a very quiet spot because that's going to help you focus and stuff and not be interrupted for example at the shop doing a lot of work at the shop trying to do both between both businesses it was really really really aggravating because the office space that I had was right at the entry of the shop so every single person I would walk in would knock on the door and that's cool but you know I mean deep focus on work concentrating stuff getting stuff flowing you know in that flow state and all of a sudden boom interrupt it go talk for the walk come sit back down and it just totally throws me off so I know that's something I'm very thankful for to be at the house now my own little office area doing everything now so the next thing that goes into everything you know kind of like around the work block is the right sleep you need to make sure you have the proper sleep going into your work block I think that's probably one of the biggest ones is you know giving about seven to eight hour periods of sleep you know that gives you the right mental clarity and stuff you need going into it because if you're just tired and you can't stop yawning you can't focus I know there's a lot of these entrepreneurs out there and tell you hey you're looking to wake up before 5 a.m. to be successful and I believe that for a while you know I did do that I did the 4 a.m.

routine and stuff but honestly I went from trying to be drained and trying to work seven eight hours a day to doing about two to three three hour work blocks a day and I'm getting way more done and having the right sleep having the right systems and structures now implement it to actually doing the work will do you way better than like hey if wake up before 5 a.m. boom be super tired all day have no energy and can't focus and you can do way less uh in more time and this is going to show you how to do way more in less time you can also do some stuff with like supplementation and stuff I know for me a big one is you can take my cold shower in the morning to you know spike me up wake me up uh give me a little adrenaline rush really helps uh meditation and stuff to really kind of help with mental clarity and then as well as I do have a few supplements I take um I think just diving into myself in a routine first thing I do down some water cold water because you're dehydrated when you wake up uh next thing is downing some greens and stuff uh that's really good for your body uh and then I have like two or one memory or like one focus supplement uh one's an nad supplement that helps with cellular regeneration and stuff another one's vitamin d3 vitamin d3 is really good to take in the morning to stop your body from producing melatonin uh so you want to wake up and stuff uh and last one vitamin c it helps with a little bit of energy and stuff so that's kind of what all I take in the morning uh then the next thing too to jump into you know with work blocks and stuff if you're a business owner maybe an agency owner and you're crushing maybe one or two three to four hour work blocks a day and you start to notice you're really getting your time built up you know you're starting to overlap that four hour block you know maybe you're going into five and six hours now uh is to start outsourcing the repetitive task uh this is going to be a huge help for you because it's allowing you to be able to focus on more higher priority actions versus some of these little actions and stuff I know for me a big one was hiring a salesperson because you know it's been an hour a day two hours a day you know doing sales for the agency and a lot of these things are you know small little tasks I'm doing day to day but at the same time it's taking my focus away from client results I know a big one for me was hiring a Facebook ads manager for my team so um she basically helps me out with managing the ads uh this helps me out a lot to focus on the bigger picture stuff for clients and stuff and allows me to make them more money in the long run my tip for you guys is to start off with one four hour work block uh put your phone on do not disturb you know put your alarm clock for 50 minutes and work for the 50 minutes do not do anything else do not reply to any text messages don't reply to any Instagram DMs don't reply to any Facebook messages you know don't touch social media at all but give yourself full range to social media during a 10 minute break so you still get to use it but now you have a planned period of time and it's going to allow you to focus better because you're like okay look I really want to check that Instagram post I really want to post something on Instagram well wait till your 10 minutes and you're going to be more disciplined with it but nail down one four hour work block a day and then once you purely got it nailed down to where you're maximizing that four hours completely then add another one um this way you're not taking on too much at once because a lot of people they can still improve in their four work block they're still doing a lot of meaningless stuff and stuff that's not focused and if you're doing that then it's kind of you know pointless the whole point of this is to nail down some super hyper focus throughout that four hour period of time then once you get that done all right look I still need to get some more stuff done can I outsource it yeah okay outsource a thing or two if you can't outsource it then boom create you a second work block throughout that day maybe it's only an hour maybe you just need to add an extra hour uh just one hour work block add it middle of the day boom take care of a few extra things and that's it since I've implemented work boxes over the last year it's really allowed me to focus at a deeper level um and really get more work done in less time so super thankful for them and if you guys enjoyed this video make sure you hit that like button and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit that subscribe button I post business videos facebook ad videos and vlogs and I'll see you guys tomorrow peace
