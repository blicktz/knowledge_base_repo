working on different ads and stuff i get like writer's block and i don't know what type of words to use you know really descriptive words and stuff like that where these two books actually give you a list of words that sell so if you're trying to look at other words to say this beautifully designed desk i'm sitting on right here you could look at other words that describe beautiful that's used into you know advertising campaigns and stuff and how to communicate certain subjects so if our subject is you know industrial grade aluminum it'd be like five other different variations to describe how something's very strong so it's really amazing books especially when you're doing copywriting and advertising and stuff because it's like a just a dictionary to turn to when you need to season up your ad copy so the way i like to do is i like to write my like rough draft of ad copy and stuff like that and then i like to look at i'm like how can it be more descriptive because a lot of really well good you know performing ad copy and e-commerce is being very descriptive using the right words and stuff to describe things that grab people's attention and really you know makes it seem more valuable than it is by using those big words to really describe the product in a very good way so highly recommend picking up these two let's be very big game changers for your ad copy so now the next book is actually not even a marketing book and in fact this book and the next book will not be marketing books my next book is atomic habits and the reason why atomic habits is a great book is especially for marketers in the e-commerce space is that with atomic habits it teaches you less is more so removing the bad habits and focusing on a few good habits that's going to make a massive impact in your life and also simplifying your thing to make it really you know straightforward of what you do marketing is not a one you know one done you're gonna be making new ads every day you're

this marketing a lot of everything i do is i'm redoing actions over and over and over uh to get these results that i generate from my clients and stuff so you need to understand that and that's why atomic habits is a great book for marketers pay to advertisers all that stuff shopify owners to understand the principle of repetitive actions equals more really really really amazing books and teach you some a lot of really great tricks to remove bad habits double down on the good habits being very clear about the habits you want to create really really awesome book and highly recommend it for all of you guys now the last book i was actually very very oh i was i was very uh i was thinking about not sharing with you guys but you know about this channel it's all about value so make sure you hit the like button hit the subscribe button before i share this book because this is actually one of my secret books this book has made some of the biggest impacts in my business and without this book i would not be here where i'm at right now i would not be sitting here and i highly recommend it every single person needs to pick this book up if they want to have some big changes in their game so the book is by a guy named keith cunningham and before i tell you the title this book like i said it's it's one of the most amazing books i've ever read and i wish i would have picked this book up day one of entrepreneurship i wish this was the first book i picked up when i started my business the book is the road less stupid and show it to you right here the road less stupid this is one of the most amazing books and i highly recommend every single person on here pick up this book again it'd be one of your books you know read these few firsts but the road less stupid is an absolutely monster of a book and the guy named cunningham he's he's a guy that sits on the board you know he's built up multiple multiple multiple million dollar businesses and stuff like that so he's a very very very smart guy but he has some of the biggest breakthroughs in his business by just asking the right questions and all of you guys just need to have the right question you're not limited right now by your knowledge you're limited right now by the questions you're asking yourself on a day-to-day basis and the road less stupid he's offered some amazing insight in my business not because he came and did it himself he gave me the right questions to ask okay you know how can we increase revenue how can we also increase the average order value how can we increase you know if we had zero dollars to solve this problem in our business right now how could we do it so he teaches you this thing called thinking time and with thinking time is a day-to-day thing you do or week to week however you want however many sessions you want to do and however many you need where you ask yourself these really challenging questions and you sit down for 20 30 minutes and think about it write down as many solutions as possible and it allows for some really break big breakthroughs in your business and the questions he gives you he gives you a ton of questions in here and teaches you the the reasons behind these questions and the life lessons he's learned from these questions that again are literally the same as if you had a multiple million dollar mentor actually these questions and how you know brainies breakthroughs in your business so he does it through a book easily one of the most valuable books i would not let anyone buy this all for me i would charge him at least five thousand dollars before i give away this book because the things in this book it's just absolutely amazing so again it's a little bit more of an experience book you have to have a little something run in there but i highly recommend it i highly recommend y'all picking up these three books and stuff or highly recommend you guys pick up these five books reading them all your average the average person only retains around 20 to 30 percent of a book the first time they read it so i recommend rereading these books three times each turning back to them from time to time again writing down some notes and stuff it's gonna be some game changers in your business he's easily one of the best books in my business right now now i'll probably will have some people saying well why didn't you put say like breakthrough advertising and stuff which is easily one of my favorite books but the reason why is i wanted to keep this from an intermediate to immediate uh inter intermediate to kind of like a day-to-day person
