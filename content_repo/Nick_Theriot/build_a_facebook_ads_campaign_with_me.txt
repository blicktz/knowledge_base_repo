host, resource Masterimal what's going on guys welcome back to the channel today i'm a pretty cool and unique video that i'm very excited to share with you guys essentially what i did was i documented the process of me building and creating a campaign for facebook ads and i want to actually show you guys everything i went through to get to the results i'm going to show you guys today so yes we're actually going to dive into that as manager i'm going to show you all the results uh actually show you a few things of why i've like turned off it scaled up and stuff uh give you guys a better heads up or kind of like a view inside my head of how i do things inside the facebook ads so uh quick background of this particular client it's an e-commerce client they do custom metal signs and we launched a new product specifically for father's day that's coming up in about a little less than 30 days now it's 30 days at a time of starting this campaign and we want to capitalize on on that i guess people like wanting to purchase stuff that buyer rush for father's day so that's what essentially what we did and this particular client uh we started with them back in december uh we've made them over 280 000 in revenue uh scaling them up from seven thousand dollars a month with facebook ads all the up to a hundred thousand dollars a month uh they actually hit their first hundred came off this month last month they did like thirty thousand dollars with facebook ads uh just a quick little background the client and everything so now let's go ahead and start phase one so phase one we want to look at the website we want to make sure before we start running these ads we want to make sure it looks good obviously i'm not going to show you guys the website just to protect the client and everything um but we wanted to add a few things to the product page that just screen father's day so we added a timer to the page it counts down to father's day uh we added a coupon code hey use code x for 10% off for father's day as a thank you uh that's it and we pretty much just made sure there was plenty of testimonials and stuff uh we also grabbed a few testimonials from other people who purchased last year that said like hey it was a great product my dad loved it you know so just to essentially fortify in their brains that hey this is a great present for father's day now once we get all that done um i looked at the you know look at the product make sure i understood it properly it's super super simple it's a metal sign that's custom so it's not like you're trying to diagnose how you're going to sell an iphone you know but i do want i did want to create a few different selling points around it um and now let's dive into phase one where we're actually going to start digging into some of the copywriting so we're actually going to jump back a few days uh this was last friday when i started recording this video and it's currently thursday so let's dive back last friday where we actually start the preparation phase uh for running this campaign uh so i'm simply just going to start off with this uh and probably grab like one or two copywriting books just for a few ideas and essentially what i need to do is just start writing down headlines uh different types of like ad copy and stuff i want to use uh for the ads and really just thinking time with pen and paper writing down a whole bunch of stuff uh picking out a few things that i really enjoy or really like and uh yeah so the first thing when i start writing copy is i want to write down just a whole bunch of different headlines different sentences different things relating to the product and what it does is it helps getting the brain moving so that way you start with just a few words and then you start thinking about more stuff it's the whole creative process and the best way to start is just about writing down a few simple things on a piece of paper and just keep tweaking tweak tweak tweak and then you'll start getting more and more and more stuff uh creating more selling points and really kind of just getting the creative process going in your brain so essentially what i'm doing right now is i got my phone and i have a lot of screenshots of ads and stuff that i see on you know just online and stuff i highly recommend keeping a folder full of screenshots on your phone of ads you see while you're on your phone and then come in there and when you're going to create some copywriting or when you're going to create a campaign looking at those screenshots for inspiration uh for different like examples and stuff you can elaborate on uh definitely don't copy people's ads but use it to craft and build your own essentially to get the right format and idea and stuff uh to go ahead and repeat something that might have already been successful i got that um and then i got pen and paper and also too i got breakthrough advertising because i'm currently reading it right now and there was two or maybe three different types of like ad examples in it with some super good creative language that i want to replicate so i'm gonna pull a few ideas from this um also have like words that sell and phrases that sell that work super good for copywriting uh for filling in so if you get your structure set up uh simply use words that sell and phrases that sell to add in filler words that help you be a little bit more descriptive and works really well so uh it's good to understand the motives and the desires of your ideal audience as well so don't be like politically correct about the desires and the motives be as raw as you can get about the desires and the motives of why people buy your product because some people like they try to hide the desires and the motives like oh we shouldn't market towards that but if you can go directly to where people feel like you're speaking to them then you could really dig deep into make some really good stuff so uh first off like for example right now we're running a father's day campaign and like i said i'm writing a copy right now i just got my first piece done i'm gonna write a few more alterations of it or alter iterations of it um it's really good so are getting better but for example uh father's day you know mom usually buys the gift for sons or daughters to give to dad or even mom gives dad a gift as well uh i think a big one is you know everyone buys these gifts and stuff yeah they want to treat their special someone right but some people buy gifts purely just for the fact of they want to be praised about so um something i added to my copy and what i mean by that is like you know oh yeah you know i can't believe what you know my wife bought me it's the best thing ever and the wife feels great about being praised about that because they bought this amazing gift so that right there is a hidden desire uh by the spouse to purchase so i directly call that out in my ad copy um so this is the first piece like i said got some more iterations to go but uh this is a grill sign so um it's a like a bar and grill uh this is a sign that hung up by the grill uh that's completely custom uh engraved so i put hey ladies do you want a gift for your father's day that your husband will rave about to all of his friends be the spouse of the year with this unique and custom grill sign cool strong and sharp just like dad and then um let's see what else i had uh put the biggest smile on dad this father's day with a custom grill sign so i need to change where it says cool strong and sharp just like dad i need to change that because i want to be cool strong cool strong and i need to replace sharp because i don't want people purchasing a sign and it says sharpen it because you're going to think that the edges are sharp and they won't purchase it so i'm trying to find a different word for that and i'm probably going to write like 10 more of these and just keep refining refining uh this one again is going more towards the fact of i want the wife to feel praised when they give dad this gift that was the most unique custom gift and oh my god i can't believe what mary bought for me she's the best wife ever posting it on facebook look what mary bought it for me tell all his friends look what mary bought for me amazing like that's that's the hidden scenario i'm trying to go for um and i feel like people purchase gifts like these for these days you know just for that they want the attention and stuff uh so i want to go after both i'm going after that and then just oh another piece of copy going straight towards hey put the biggest smallest face you know give them a gift to remember uh because it's a metal sign and it's last long uh different things like that so that's kind of an update on the copywriting process right now my copy and stuff going to jump back into it start working on some ads start crushing out some of this ad copy i wrote uh tweaking it altering it and um actually getting some ads submitted for approval so now we're actually going to jump inside of the ads manager it's been about a week since we launched this campaign and we had some very interesting results so let's dive into the ads manager i'm gonna screen share it with you guys so that way we can actually show you all some of the decisions i've made some of the how like some of these ads and copywriting and everything i put together performed uh and why i made some decisions so let's jump in now so now we're inside the ads manager i want to show you guys how i set up this campaign and stuff real quick uh so i'm testing three different cold audiences and one big thing of warm audiences essentially what i've been noticing for scaling higher when you have a season the pixel is you want to go after three different types of audiences you want to go after one that's completely open uh just the pixel with very broad targeting either men or women and an age group and then the next thing is you want to do your lookalike audiences i'm running the lookalike value-based audiences for this campaign and then also too you want to do a interest-based campaign so you have three different types of people three different ways facebook is targeting people uh and i find this helps actually like smoothen out as you're scaling up into those couple thousand dollars a day in adsmen uh in terms of like you know some days i know look likes crush it then the next day they'll suck but then you have another audience crushing it so when you have multiple different audiences they all kind of level out and you get a more consistent return over time so that's why i'm testing three different audiences and like to scale with three different types of cold audiences as i go so i got three of those things set up right there and then i have my warm audiences these are all people who are likely to purchase from my brand who's already engaged with it visited my website or actually purchased in the past so diving into the interest space real quick a few of these single interest ad sets i created barbecue and grill relationship status because relationship status they're married they're more likely to purchase something for father's day father's day itself literally just typed in father's day boom uh engaged shoppers this is just like a constant rotating group of people that's classified as engaged shoppers because they've purchased something recently that facebook marks them as then you have your value based and like i said these are your lookalike audiences uh one percent purchase you know etc uh just different types of people that's relevant to this pixel uh again this pixel itself has already had thousands of orders so it's very seasoned it's processed over 280 000 in revenue uh so it's definitely got a good touch of who our ideal audience is now our warm audiences right here uh again these are all people who are likely to purchase from us because they've actually dived into our brand before they they know who we are they know we do etc um and then lastly our pixel wide open now i want to run multiple ad sets and if i would just do women 21 to 54 it'd be very hard to to create multiple different ad sets so i end up breaking it up by age group uh all of these campaigns are running women from 21 to 54 or 18 to 54 i think for some of these and i think a few of them are automatic placements and a few of them are just instagram feed and facebook news feed so there will be some more optimizations and testings they'll be doing in the future for this but diving into the creatives you know i ran four different ads or four ads creatives for all ad sets and all campaigns you're looking at so these are all running these same four ads right here all have the exact same creative running four different variations of ad copy because that's the first thing i want to test is ad copy then i'm going to test the different creatives so i've used a proven creative structure that's worked well for multiple other campaigns for this particular ad account and then what i'm going to do is is test other variations but i want to start off with one that's most likely to get some sales most likely to do well in front of our ideal audience and what do you say our winning copywriting audience or the winning piece of ad copy was the one mentioned in this video about how i leveraged the desires to feel praised about and guys let me just show you guys how this performed so let's go may 22nd this is where our first day running and i was literally like oh gross that's nasty um boom 3.34 our first full day i launched it friday midday then saturday is our first full day uh then sunday sunday i think that okay um let's do monday boom 2.41 so it's going okay monday was memorial day so that's also another thing too i launched this going into memorial day weekend where a lot of people were traveling and doing stuff especially for our ideal audience our ideal audience has money they're married women they go do stuff with their family it was memorial day no one's sitting at home shopping but then tuesday happened and tuesday was our first day of normalness i guess you could say um because everyone's back work back at home whatever's going on uh wednesday crushed it and then today uh thursday the 28th crushing it as well so if we look uh this week actually has been doing super well uh if we look from the date of we launched it uh overall a 3x row s is amazing for this particular thing because there was a break even as a 2.0 so we're right above break even and what do you say the interest based audience absolutely crushed it in terms of the other ones uh if we dig into these interest based you can see right here a mixture between the relationship status uh we get more of a qu our father's they got more of a quantity uh people just looking up father's day stuff now more days over so ads can pushed in front of people who are searching and actively in the market for father's day items relationship status barbecue and grill against their grill sign engaged shoppers i mean all of these are very profitable right here um and then we can kind of see you know we had a few purchases from like the three and four different other you know other ad copy variations but i ended up leveraging number one because it was the most consistent one that was profitable across all ad campaigns so you'll see here and there you have like a number three right here where it's like 8.4 row s why the hell didn't you scale that well because i want consistency and everything was consistent with number one being the most profitable now what i will do is as this ad starts to decay and we start getting a little bit lower or start getting you know more reach but lower purchases our frequency starts going up and less purchases that means people are tired of seeing the same ad overall i'll throw in some other ad variations and i'll also use that ad copy for the retargeting ads that i didn't leverage in my top of funnel so that way it's still going to use because i'm not running i'm barely running any retargeting ads right now for this i mean i have this warm audiences but that's okay i mean i want to go ahead and create a retargeting ad straight up with that url people who visited this website boom retarget them with an ad so got to do that still um value base actually surprising look this is a lookalike audiences and they actually performed worse which is insane so this is another reason why i like to test multiple different audiences when i'm launching a product different types of cold audiences uh we see a 2.72 row ass um crushing it warm audiences we see you know website visit like you know i turned off a few already because obviously don't poorly um but you can see right here in page engagement 30 days as people just engage with any ad post page etc purchases so people who's already purchased from us in the past can hit another ad hey come look you know you know kind of like a seasonal ad essentially and then website visitors who haven't visited our website in a while um those are actually crushing right now which is really surprising um and then lastly with the pixel wide open this is going after again just different segmented age groups of women because that's our primary demographic for this campaign and you can see right here we have 45 to 54 absolutely crushing it uh and i honestly i could do the breakdown for all these and we could actually see you know a little bit more um just go into age group uh and we can see right here you know we're getting some pretty different results so the pixel wide open obviously we're seeing the 45 to 54 uh doing good but then we see father state warm audiences the 34 to 44 is doing good 35 to 44 is doing pretty good uh father state value base obviously nothing great on that but then 25 to 34 in the interest base so um i'm seeing three different age groups crushing it differently on three different campaigns so um that's why i'm not going to optimize yet for a specific age size uh placement we can see the top placement right now is facebook newsfeed mobile which always i mean always crushes it uh mobile app uh got some desktop crushing it right here on the pixel wide open we could actually run you know maybe another campaign specifically for desktop um i would like to like you know to continue to build up on this campaign i would like to launch another one for stories with all three of these audiences so that's another 300 a day we're investing right into stories instagram stories um and then also to create some more retargeting ads specific to this particular product i do have retargeting ads set up on this ad account this ad account is spending about two thousand dollars a day and this 400 a day right here we're spending we're actually 500 now it's just for this one product we have multiple other products that's getting spent about fifteen hundred dollars a day on so uh but let's jump into some stats for this account because uh you need to understand a few things about this particular product so we launched on may 22nd and spent to date is twenty four hundred and seventy nine dollars revenue to date is seventy six hundred and thirty four dollars uh roa's to date as return on ad spend to date is 3.07 so uh three to four is what i tell all my clients i like to be at um that's kind of my first initial goal and if we could we then would try to really push them further if we can i mean uh a three extra roa's is you know one to three every dollar spent on facebook ads and three dollars to get back is pretty average across facebook right now um but break even roa's this is basically means is if we spend a dollar on ads uh we need to make sure we get two dollars back to break even because after you subtract the cost per sign and fulfillment of everything um we need to make sure that we're getting at the minimum of 2.0 on the roa's to break even so to actually generate you guys an idea of how much money we made for this client we came there and we spent twenty four hundred dollars two two thousand four hundred seventy nine dollars um we know we need to do a minimum of two extra roa's so if we do a two times that we get four thousand nine hundred fifty eight dollars so we know we need everything we make after four thousand nine hundred fifty eight dollars um in terms of roa's is profit for the client so if we take that four thousand nine hundred fifty eight um we subtracted by the seventy six hundred dollars that we generated for the client uh we get two thousand five hundred dollars profit for the client in one week for one particular product and we're in the testing phases we're still going to scale up this campaign optimize a little better uh getting getting it a little bit probably honestly i can see a three to five um a three two maybe like four four point five roa's because again this is a hype product for father's day and i'm gonna scale the hell out of it um you know maybe spending two three thousand dollars a day just almost one particular product until father's day uh so if you guys i may do another video as we get closer it's a follow-up but i hope you guys enjoyed this all righty guys i really hope you enjoyed this video this was definitely a different approach i wanted to take
