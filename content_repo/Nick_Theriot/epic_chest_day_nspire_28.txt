I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. I just finished working on a huge video That was a video I actually saw the other day Super cool video.

I really wanted to take a different dynamic to the stand alone tutorials On how to create Facebook ads and actually go into the overall I guess you say like documentation and like planning phase, etc So that was really cool to create, but now it is time to hurry up and go get a workout Because Kenny gets off at 3 and we got some plans we want to go do So I need to hurry up and get a workout in before she gets here So we can go take care of that Now that I'm used to the gym, I'm definitely going to do some more recording And plus I need a new tripod because Tripod I have now is way too big So I went and ordered one of those like I'm just going to say it, anal bead looking tripods That every single vlogger has Literally at my parents house today So I'm going to pick that up later today But I do not have time to go pick that up before I work out So we're just going to jump in and I'm going to see what I can record for you guys So let's go ahead and get a little bit of pre-workout food in It's 1 o'clock right now, so I need something quick So I'm going to jump to a bagel and some cream cheese Just gets a little bit of carbs in me I am completely fasted right now So I definitely need some food to fuel this workout Because it ain't not going to get a pump Second, I've been on my diet all week since Monday Last week I cleaned up my diet This week I've been actually more counting calories And being very strict with myself Of how many calories I consume in and stuff Doing really good this week I'm still holding it, it's like I cannot get my body to budge Below 160 So I don't know what I'm going to do I may have to cut down my carbs further I did drop them by 50 grams this week And if I drop them by another 50 grams Because right now I'm at a 250 calorie deficit Plus cardio every day So maybe next week I'll drop them again And we'll see where we're at from that I have my pre-workout It is salted And then also too I'm bringing BCAs today Because I am pretty damn Even with that bagel I'm still pretty empty So I'm hoping with a little extra electrolytes From the salt And also some BCAs From my workout Keeps me up And we can hit a good chest day I do have to say Ever since I moved to Lafayette It's been like More like the city area It has been so tempting With like Food places and stuff Being within just a few minutes From my house now Like when I lived More in the outer skirts You know you get to drive 20 minutes to get to like Chipotle Or you know Any of the good sushi places And stuff And now literally just driving Through at traffic Through lunch traffic And smelling all the food It is super tempting And especially right now Being on this diet It's even more like I want it I can't control myself I don't profit out I don't do so I don't got no self control I'm out my mind And all I'm home My eyes are like Two back holes Alright starting this workout Off with a bench press Not sure how it's going to go Due to how sore My shoulders still are But hopefully try to get $195 for 5 Is the goal for today To have to say Everything has taken an impact During quarantine For like lifts and stuff But I feel like My bench Absolutely sucks I was on 225 Before quarantine For like 3-4 reps And I couldn't even imagine Going 200 right now Now Work back down 10-15 reps A little bit more Higher reps To burn out And I'm back I can't control myself I don't profit out I don't do so I don't got no self control This decline press Is something I'm super thankful To have At this gym We didn't have one At the last gym And let's just say I hate Doing Decline bench Regular press Get Float so much better On one of these I feel like I'm at my mind And all I know My eyes are like Two black holes Self-destruct is all I know I've got no self control I've got no self control I've been off for so long I ain't looking out I ain't looking too strong I ain't what I was I could find my way home But that ain't sound like fun I keep on an all night Just because I can't control myself Guys just got back from the gym Kennedy just got here Is there a camera on your TikTok?
