YouTube what is going on I uh one just picked up a nice coffee over here right now and you know it's cooling off a little bit outside it's getting towards uh the beginning of September right now and we are getting closer I can feel it in the air we are getting closer to Q4 we're actually technically 30 days out at the time of this video um as Q4 starts in October October 1st and it just made me think I got a few questions over the last week uh you know basically how to let's like prepare for Q4 and like what are some things y'all should start thinking about for Q4 and everything like that uh so I basically just set up the camera and uh we're gonna basically just kind of go ramble as I drive home right now um you know various things about Q4 what you should be thinking about right now what you should be doing right now um this will be my I think six or seventh Q4 I had my first Q4 in 2019 um so 19 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 so I think it's actually my sixth Q4 uh that we'll be having this year and um yeah so I've had a lot of experience I've done I think my biggest month ever for one client was over three and a half million dollars just for Black Friday and stuff uh so I would say I have some pretty good experience for this and you know I've done multiple millions for clients during this period of time so just starting off and kind of taking a step back uh what you should be thinking about right now what you should be keeping in mind right now as we are pretty early um to Q4 is starting to think about just like how much money you want to do for Q4 and when I say Q4 October 1st all the way up until I think it's like December 30th or 29th right there uh the ending of Q4 is how much money do you want to do and the next thing from there is do we have enough inventory to hit that goal um I've had clients before that come to me that have this extremely aggressive goal they're doing like 50k a month and they're like hey for Q4 I want to do two million dollars I'm like all right great and then I look at their inventory and it's like they're not drop shipping or anything they have 3PL and stuff like that I'm like do you have two million dollars worth of inventory and they're like no I'm like well how the fuck do you want to even hit you know two million dollars they're like I don't know so first thing is first is do we have inventory for it some of you guys have like the um you know like using drop shippers manufacturers and like suppliers and stuff and you know technically like you don't necessarily need to worry about that um but even then like still message your supplier and your manufacturer uh back when we were scaling bright um up to three and a half million dollars a month back in 2022 uh November you know we had to the client had to message the supplier a couple times just to make sure that like there's going to be enough inventory to keep scaling and holding these 100 200k days that we were doing um and then you also have to worry about shipping and stuff can your supplier your manufacturer you know depending on if you're drop shipping and things like that can they maintain shipping that product out and there's actually quite a few people that just essentially can't do that so even if you're drop shipping you still need to contact your supplier your manufacturer whoever you're going through with to you know do the drop shipping and stuff and make sure they can maintain that volume of what you want to do right there now second thing if you're actually going ahead and you're doing this in-house and you know maybe even you have like a 3pl right you need to make sure that this 3pl or your in-house team can also sustain the numbers that you're looking for so if you want to do 2 million dollars for q4 do we have enough inventory and then at what rate of which can we scale to while maintaining our shipping team um you know like will we need to bring in an additional people how easy it is for us to bring those additional people in uh some people it may be very difficult to bring in those additional people like it won't be a quick easy hire uh so like you'll actually have to go and like start putting applications now and bringing in seasonal hires during that time right there beginning stages right now it's more just looking at inventory uh what products do we want for q4 you know some of y'all have one product and that's it some of y'all also have a ton of different skews uh for q4 so it's not like just one hey order more of this product it's hey you know do we want to prioritize more of one skew versus others what's our best sellers and things like that if you're a clothing brand you have best selling items and you also about best selling sizes and that also creates a whole nother like complexity and things right there another huge just learning lesson i've had over the years is that you know we had this one client who decided to launch all new products for q4 and they like scaled down from 300k a month to like 100k a month because they launched all new products that were just totally new designs and like new things that's just not consistent with their brand and no one wanted these new products like these products converted horribly and because of that they actually lost a fuckload of money um and you know it wasn't a creative issue it wasn't a landing page issue they converted really well on everything throughout the whole year but they just thought it'd be this cool idea to like q4 launch all new products and they just went too extreme with the new products that no one wanted they were untested and just did not convert well at all so you also want to like make sure that when you're launching new products or like the items you have for q4 like you want to make sure that it's items you know work for q4 or they're best selling items that you know work all year long and there's just a really good possibility that hey this is also going to work for q4 as well um last thing you also want to be kind of keeping in mind right now is you should start having an idea of what type of like discount or offer you want to launch for q4 um what i say by that is like you know right now um you don't want to go into q4 and just launch like a whole new discount right like let's say for example um we know every year 30 off works amazing for black friday we can scale it crushes we have good a good mixture between profit margin we also have a good mixture between um you know scalability like it just works really well i wouldn't want to go launch something completely new like all right this year we're not going to do 30 off we're going to do buy five get one free and like i wouldn't want to go change that drastically because it just it's there's no proof that it's going to work so right now whatever offer you launch uh for black friday that you have in mind you need to have something that you know for a fact works so for our clients like right now it's a great opportunity to start doing micro tests where like randomly throughout the week we'll just pick a random day and for 24 hours we'll launch an offer and we'll see how that offer converts now and we'll pick the best offer that works now for black friday because to be fair people are just not going to remember what offer you launched between september 1st all the way to november 1st that you're doing these little micro tests on and from there pick the one that works the best from that has a good mixture between hey it scaled really well it increased conversion rate we did really good in revenue but we also too had a really good profit margin as well because we obviously don't want to like you know launch something that has like a bad profit margin as well because that's actually ruined a couple clients that we've done before where you know we um we didn't choose it but the client did and they just launched a way too aggressive offer that just struggled um with the scalability on that side right there so these are all things we want to think about um you know start placing those orders for inventory and everything um and then from here you know september it's the next part like so that's basically stuff we did in august if you didn't do that yet that's something you can do now the minute you see this video um the rest of september we're just kind of start planning out the different ad angles we want to launch um so this is like writing the hooks writing the scripts like all of those things right there and we want to focus now on basically planning out all the different ads we want to create um so like a very easy level of ads is just gifting um gifting gifting gifting that crushes and it's like literally you don't even really need to think about it at all hey here's the perfect gift for dad here's the perfect gift uh for mom here's the perfect gift for your kid and you show the product and use and then you're done uh so that's a very simple ad right there but then you can also get a little bit more creative with it right which is like you know getting reactions filmed of people like opening the product uh paint your life does an absolutely amazing job at this uh where they have a lot of videos of people just basically opening up the product and reacting to it crying uh you know they do these portraits with like you and a dead loved one you never got to take a picture with in your life so like it's a very emotional project uh product uh you can do the same thing here if you're a product but like just kind of depends on the emotion you want to invoke whether it's more around the lines of um you know like crying or happiness or playful uh same thing it's a very easy creative to do so right now we want to focus on hiring content creators getting these things filmed i love all new visuals for q4 so like we'll take our same best winning ads we know work and we'll put like uh banners on them for like a discount um or like the perfect gift for dad and then we'll also go and film all new visuals specifically for these adding was that we want to launch for q4 this just allows us for a really good creative refresh right here um other things we want to look at you know we want to look at like the black friday creatives that we're going to be launching that day sells live we want to look at like um cyber monday i actually don't ever launch any creatives for cyber monday um i've just every time i've made them and launched them i've never found they work um so i just focus for cyber monday as instead of cyber monday it's just last call for black friday creatives and we'll launch those on sunday as like a last 24 hour type of thing right there so you have bfcm creatives and everything then you know you have gifting creatives all november then you have bfcm creatives and then you have christmas creatives which is more just the shipping cutoff now for christmas for shipping cutoff all we want to do here is just simply look at all right if people order by december 15th they're guaranteed to get their package for christmas so like if you're someone who's drop shipping and has a 30 day shipping time like don't be unethical about this because if you do be unethical and you scale you're gonna fuck load of chargebacks and it's going to financially ruin you i've seen people do this before it financially ruined them so you want to look at like all right what's your shipping cutoff date that people can guarantee get it in before christmas and then you just simply want to create creatives based around that hey if you order by december 15th you're guaranteed delivered this some people that might be december 5th some people that might be december 20th it just depends um you know what it is for you so that's the next thing that i'm looking at here um inside of basically those creatives right there for beginning of christmas from there like december 15th december 20th performance nosedives and that's when we kind of just like coast the last two weeks of december and then we move into january which is going to be like your january launch on the first for like new products of the year um if you're in the health and wellness space that'll be a lot of like new year new me and like all of those things right there so that's also a big thing that we have to look at for uh going into january now last couple things just kind of on top of my mind right now and i know this is like no real specific order i'm just kind of more rambling about all the different learning lessons i've had over the years with like black friday and q4 and stuff um other things real quick um is for black friday there's going to be two types of businesses there's going to be businesses who literally launch their black friday offer on november 1st and just scale throughout the month and then there's me other businesses that launch their black friday offer on black friday day now for me i have clients that are going to do both i have some clients that are going to do all month and some clients that's only going to do specifically for black friday day what separates these two clients is returning customers versus new customers and if they have other products on their site so like for example we have this um had this one particular clothing brand that we're working with for quite a long period of time and a lot of you guys know them um you know million two million dollars a month in revenue and everything like that and you know we had a 40 to 60 percent uh 40 of our revenue was from returning customers and 60 was from new customers and throughout the year we're we're dropping new products almost every other week so we had a long history of people buying new products we were dropping from us and like increasing that returning customer rate and like we knew for a fact if we dropped new products and stuff it would essentially work better for this scenario we know that if we do a big black friday day and we hype people up and do this like big launch on black friday day it's going to work substantially better getting all those people to buy on day one or buy on black friday day now i also have other clients where they're like drop shipping and they're only dominantly new new customers or they even have a brand and still all new customers they don't really have any other products and like 99 to 100 of their revenue is just new customers these people it really doesn't matter if you launch on the first of the month november 1st and scale all month or if you launch on black friday day it really doesn't make any difference for us we're just going to launch on black friday or november 1st um you have to understand for november that there will be the beginning of the month from like november 1st to about november 10th november 15th performance is going to be really good and then from november 10th 15th all the way up until black friday day it's going to be horrible performance because people are holding back on their money because they know they're going to get a better deal on black friday day so in this case right here just be prepared for that there will be a significant notice or a significant difference in performance on the november 10th around november 10th through the 15th it kind of varies um and it'll be a very hard like dip in performance all the way up until about the day of black friday itself other key things just to think about for black friday if you plan on doing a ton of scaling and stuff like that um just be prepared to like reach out to like your meta um you can just like open up a meta chat like support chat reach out to them and make sure that like you know you have a high enough daily spend limit um you know if our daily spend limits like ten thousand dollars right now and we plan on spending twenty thousand dollars on black friday day then like i want to make sure that like hey we have at least a 25 30k daily budget and again that's just the maximum we can spend it doesn't mean that we're actually going to spend that because it's a spin limit meta sets um other things to think about credit cards your bank account and stuff make sure you have enough money to actually spend all that that you want to spend during that period of time you want backup credit cards backup bank accounts i've seen issues before where people only have one credit card in the account the credit card gets flagged um because all sudden american express is seeing hey you're spending 50 60k when you're on facebook ads a day when you're normally spending 10k they see that anomaly and they block the charge and they block the and the ad account gets banned so make sure you have backup credit cards or backup bank accounts or even a paypal or something like that and you can pay for that facebook ad spend in case your main credit card goes down um so those are all other key things that you want to start looking at right now i'm trying to think uh lastly like for budget adjustments and stuff uh november we're pretty much doing 20 increases um every day throughout november up until black friday day black friday day itself like the actual day of black friday i'll do a hundred percent increases a couple times throughout the day um so like if i'm spending 2k a day or let's just say i'm spending 10k a day um the day before black friday i'll bump that 10k to 20k a day i'll start the day at 20k a day and adspin uh for that black friday day and if that day is working really well and converting really well at 20k i'll jump in and bump it up at 8 a.m and i'll bump it again at 4 p.m um so if i open up the account at 8 a.m it's crushing it's doing really well we're like way over our target at 20k a day i'll bump up to 40k a day and spend and then if that's crushing all the way up at 4 p.m and we're still way above our target i'll bump it up to 80k now we're not going to spend that full 80k we'll probably only spend about 50 to 60k um but it's that's why we have to double because like just doing a 20 increase a couple times throughout the day it just it doesn't give us enough of a difference to really get facebook to spend so we have to do a large increase to get it to spend some so like we have to do a hundred percent increase just to get it to spend like 30 over the original increase that we did um so those are all like other last little key things right there but yeah i would say that's the main things right now just start thinking about with q4 coming up just kind of giving you all expectations and things like that for q4 uh if you have any other questions around this just drop them below i'm gonna make a few more videos on q4 the creatives and like things like that you need uh
