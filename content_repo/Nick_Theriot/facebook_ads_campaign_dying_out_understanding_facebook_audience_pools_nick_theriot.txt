yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today I'm going to be talking about audience pools with Facebook ads we've seen it from time to time again where we might struggle with scaling an offer we've also might struggle with like one ad set not working and then we duplicate it and starts working and like what's going on so today I want to kind of show you guys a few concepts uh with like how the kind of algorithm works and stuff and what you're seeing that the or what you're not seeing that the algorithm kind of goes through so before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday just like this one so let's get started okay guys so I created this little diagram for you guys hopefully it kind of showcases everything as uh best I could so right here this is our proven audience so this is our audience right here of say 2.1 million people this might be a lookalike of one percent and this might be a interest people in a relationship etc so here's all the people inside that we can target now what happens is when you have say multiple different offers you might start off an offer start to scale it and then you know it doesn't really work well then you might create another one and that one can work pretty okay and then create another one like it does exceptionally well really good sometimes an offer might do good up until a certain spin sometimes an offer might do good regardless of how much spin you do so how can you determine like when an offer dies out what's some of the behind the scenes that we're not seeing so hopefully this kind of better shows it here's our proven audience and here's three offers we create this might be a 20% off plus free shipping this one might be nothing just perfect gift for valentine's day this one might be free shipping for $50 plus orders so these are three offers right here and this is our proven audience we're targeting right here now we can see right here how these different offers work differently so here's our audience pool right here these are the smaller audience pools that each offer creates so this is the big one the proven audience of everyone but these are the audience pools the sub audience pools that our offer creates so the offer creates the audience the same offer won't work for everyone some people love it some people won't and you have to understand that that's just part of advertising not everyone is going to love your campaign some people work really well with it some people don't and you want to try to go for the broadest offer that works the best to really scale so offer one offer two offer three so offer one right here we can see we have a pretty good size offer pool and then you can see right here we are only maybe this little like dash one that represents the amount of ad spend we're spending per day how wide our net is casted how much we're spending per day now the green represents as profitable ROAS because we're not outside of our audience pool yet still within side of it we're doing good probably doing three four five x return on ad spend right here looking good because this is how big of the audience we have this is how big our is our offers is where our um nets cast it and we haven't reached our limit yet we still have a lot of people left in this particular pool but now we're probably only spending a hundred to maybe five hundred dollars a day now offer number two right here you can see right here we're unprofitable because we've exceeded our audience pool it's our big the audience pool that our robot our offer would create and what happened is now we're overspending and our ROAS is down or probably about a you know break even probably 2x we're probably like a 2.1 2.2 maybe even like a 1.8 because we're outside of our audience pool and it's not profitably spending anymore so all we need to do is pivot to a new offer that's going to realign with people and this might involve some testing some scaling back down which is totally okay scale back down and stuff and retest new offers to where you get offer number three here's where looks good you know we're probably spending ten thousand dollars a day right here ROAS is good and our audience pool which is getting kind of close there but you know we'll keep testing the background and this is what it looks like when you start running offers testing new angles and stuff you can represent this with add angles as well so offers or add angles you can look exactly like this sometimes you can even replace this as well with here's our proven audience purchased 30 lda when we duplicate that over and over it creates these sub you know pools and targets so there's a few different representations you can take this as but this is key right here to understand so that's why some offers burn out quicker than the others and why some that you know you start off you start scaling and then you hit a certain limit and then it's just like hey it's not pushing anymore it's all because you just need to change up your offer maybe something a little bit more broader maybe again it's the ad angle maybe you need to change up that ad angle it's not reaching other people and this is what happens with advertising you start to reach those low hanging fruit in the beginning and you start to scale up a little bit you're like hey this is working really well working really well and then once you start spending more reaching a broader audience a bigger demographic and force an algorithm find new people on a day-to-day basis it's running out of new people and you're sure you feel limited that's why you're stuck at say a thousand dollars a day and every time you keep pushing above your stuff so that's why all you need to do is re-pivot things and if you're looking to re-pivot things it involves proper testing campaigns proper structural of like ad angles ad creatives and then also to like testing new offers so hopefully this better explains everything how this works and actually putting it into paper this is kind of what the algorithm looks like and like your different ad angles and offers and stuff look like on paper when you kind of break it out and stuff so i hope you enjoyed this video i know this
