Here's why 90% of your Facebook ad creative tests fail and exactly what you can do to break past that 100k a month ceiling when you're doing that creative testing. So the first thing I like to look at when a client is testing a lot of new creatives and they're getting a lot of failures on those particular creatives is just start to understand their thought process around the whole how they're researching and coming up with these creatives these angles these hooks the personas all of those things and then the other half is I actually like to look at the actual execution side of it. So there'll be oftentimes where we find people that have really good research they're writing really good creative like headlines and stuff to go on to the creative itself but then when we look at the execution side of the creative the creative doesn't look good you know it wasn't quite correctly executed one and then that it wasn't necessarily a strategic problem in that mix it was more of just a fulfillment problem that creative that had an issue with a disconnect between the person that wrote the creative and who's intended for and then for the video editor itself that's actually doing the video editing or the graphic design right there.

So the first thing I like to look at is just simply that right there both the process and then also to the actual fulfillment side and see if those things match up. Now when I'm auditing the account just a very easy sign for this right here is just looking at the hook on those creatives the first three to five seconds of that video or just what's being displayed in that image and basically I just want to see here is does that text hook match up with that visual hook if we're calling out people who want to make more money and we're showing someone who's broke in their bedroom and like a trailer park that right there is not going to call out someone who wants to make more money but if someone you know wants to make more money and we're calling that out in our text hook and then we're also showing a visual hook of like someone driving a lamborghini even as cliche and overly done it is at the end of the day it does work so we also want to make sure those two things are aligned is what we're calling out match the visual right there and that's going to be a big part of just some like early signs right there of what may or may not be working inside of the account now taking a step further let's look at the research process this is where I still see a lot of people making mistakes at where they're just going and creating creatives based off like zero research it's just coming up with random ideas that are head they throw it at the ad account and they try it out or they try something out that twitter tells them to do or youtube tells them to do with again zero research on how to apply it to themselves and then often what happens they're still just throwing things at the wall and hoping something sticks everything that we test in my agency we like to go ahead and first do a very in-depth research session so we can understand the market and then what we have is we have like a operating system of how we think about marketing and what we use is we look at that research right there and based off our marketing os basically our marketing operating system we can strategically figure out how we want to position this product in the marketplace because again we want to always create blue oceans with our creative blue ocean just simply means no one's talking about that same thing so we can actually create a blue ocean and those are things right there and trigger new dopamine when we're creating new creatives and ads and putting them in that account and that's what's going to scale really fast so first we like to understand the market then we want to understand how we want to position this product that's going to come down to the desire or the problem or the symptom we want to call out then we want to go into the awareness level we want to hit on and the sophistication level we want to hit on then we want to go to the persona who exactly you know basically if two people are taking protein to grow their muscles one may be doing it to grow their glutes to attract men aka women the other guy or the other person a guy may be taking this protein to grow his chest to attract women you know just two different perspectives right there so we kind of nail down those different personas and specific groups of people right there once we do all that then we go and actually execute on those creatives right there so sometimes you know when we look at someone's process of testing ads and how they're coming up with creatives and everything like that that's the big problem right there they just have a thought process that's incorrect of how they're actually going about testing and creating these creatives and everything then once we actually start looking at the actual script itself or headline itself that uh they you know execute on and they create based off all that research and stuff usually for the hooks and the actual script itself are usually pretty decent i don't really see too many like fatal errors in the hooks and like the scripts but just common little things it's like the hook never intrigues curiosity it's like take protein to grow your chest it's like okay whatever boom instead this little known secret increased my chest size by 30 percent or this little known secret allowed me to bench 225 for the first time and that actually intrigues people to come in and watch that particular creative right there or look at that image and actually go a little bit deeper into the landing page or something like that now the other key thing is that the actual script itself what i'll typically see people do is they'll get too logical in the script where it's like hey this will increase your chest size by 25 and then it's just like literally talking about all these chemical formulas in here but it's not highlighting the person these people are going to become when they drink this and all the different benefits of drinking this and how it's going to help that particular person right there so that's another thing i'll typically see in scripts right there and we want to keep holding those benefits and keep it like painting that picture that people will become when they actually use our product right there so that'll be the next thing i'll typically see inside of the account that's just like little errors right there but again i don't see it too too often but you know i usually see it for people that are like still stuck between like zero 30k a month that's really where they make that mistake at now the next thing for you know what's holding people back and why a lot of tests are failing is because they're not focusing on new things we had this one particular account where you know we basically got in the account we upscale it to 100 200k a month and you know basically four months after we had that 200k a month they start falling like face flat and actually losing performance and i had to talk to my team and kind of dove into everything of what was going on in this account turned out that once the team found that winning ad they just kept iterating over and over and over and over over on that winning ad and what happened they never found anything new that became a winner why because they just kept doing the same thing over and over and it got exhausting it's like if i uploaded the exact same youtube video every day with just a different title on it like yeah some of y'all would watch it because just like the different title would capture your attention for the first time but then after you came back for day two and three you're like oh wait he's just uploading the same video every day like you wouldn't retain on the channel so that's a big thing right there when we're looking at these new tests like once we find a new winning creative like literally all i'll do is try to go ahead and maybe swap in new people swap in new locations that the ad's being filmed at and then maybe i'll test a few different angles which is just new ways to stay the hook and then that's also going to completely change the rest of the script as well and then after that that's it i'm moving on to the next thing i don't want to spend too long just iterating on that i'm going to milk it for the first maybe two three weeks that it works and then i'm moving on i'm not going to be the person that six months later i'm still iterating on the same winning creative because the likelihood of that continuing to yield you new creatives is extremely low like extremely low like maybe 0.1 so for me and i had to learn this lesson not just once but twice you know my early facebook ads career i made that mistake in literally six months straight of testing the same thing never found a new winning ad went found a new desire in the marketplace positioned it around that product went filmed some new content with it launched it and almost immediately became a new winning ad that took us to 10k a day right there so again that's a big thing that i'll often see too of why a lot of people's tests would just simply fail inside of facebook and everything now this went around a lot of tests just kind of not really spending and then you know not really yielding the performance they want but let's look at some tests that maybe will start to spin a lot and they campaign but fail from a cpa perspective a cost per acquisition perspective right there so if we have an ad that's getting a lot of spin but it's not really giving us the best cost per purchase that's what i want to look at other metrics right here this is when i will look at some of the soft metrics from a perspective of what is the soft metrics telling us now soft metrics are going to be like your cost per click your ctr you can do scroll stop and hold rate but i rarely ever look at those i'll almost look at cost per click and ctr and that's going to give me a relative of like hey are people actually clicking on this ad or not i don't care if someone just stops a scroll on it i don't it really doesn't give like doesn't do anything for me but if someone's clicking on this ad then i know there's some intent behind that versus just say stop the scroll so for me when i go and look at the clicks hey this ad's getting a lot of spin and we're getting a really good amount of clicks but we're just not converting like this particular ad just doesn't convert traffic the same way as some of the other ads in our account you know maybe we have an average of a 97 cent cost per click and this ad's getting an 80 cent cost per click but it has a way higher cost per purchase then guess what i'm going to do right there i'm gonna go look at and see maybe the particular like angle we're using is just like needs a little bit more convincing and a little bit more like you know maybe we're going for more of like an unaware or problem where market awareness and we need to like kind of give people a little bit more time and lead them with some more info and data for them to make a decision actually purchasing so what i would look at doing here is actually creating uh relaunching this ad which is simply a new landing page i would test something like an avatorial or a listicle maybe even a vsl just kind of depending on the particular you know scenario of what we're seeing in that creative right there and actually giving them a little bit more information by going add listicle product page or add avatorial product page or add vsl product page just giving them that a little bit more information before actually send them to the product page actually can has been proven to give us a higher conversion rate in some scenarios right there just because all it does is give people a little bit more information about buying before they actually go ahead and make that purchase right there so instead of just saying hey you know here's this huge new belief you need to believe now boom buy now product page now it's huge new belief here's a long form vsl going into that thing and fully selling you what you want it now here's the product and then go buy so yes it's a little bit longer and adds a little bit more friction but it actually actually helps improve in certain scenarios depending on what we're selling right there especially if it needs a little bit more belief behind it before people are fully convinced in that scenario right there now the last thing that i'll typically see is that we're getting a high cost per purchase and like we're spending more on facebook ads and like we're we just can't beat a particular ad and we just keep getting a higher and higher cost per purchase i would actually shift my attention away from facebook and actually look at aov aov is actually something that a lot of people just simply don't look at and it's actually a very easy play to help make more money at the end of the day you know you might be testing hundreds of new creatives every week and you just can't beat a certain cost per purchase then it's like well hey can we actually remove the pressure off facebook and actually apply that to another part of the business and that's when we look at something like aov for example and it's actually shockingly alarming to me the number of people that still don't put any attention to the aov which is just simply the average order value right there and like they might be stressing over trying to get like a 30 cost per purchase down to a 25 cost per purchase and i'm like hey look yeah let's keep putting pressure there but like aov right there what have you done in the last six months on aov and it's like oh nothing so then what i'll do is just simply put pressure on them but start testing aov the same way they test new creatives every week can we test different bundles can we test different products in the cart as upsells can we test different post-purchase upsells and rotating new things in every other week or every week depending on how much data they're getting to see if we can actually improve that aov you know if you're stressing right now because you're getting a 30 cost per purchase and you have a 60 aov and you're stressing because you're only getting a 2x roas it's like well hey can we go improve aov and get up to 90 dollars if we get up to 90 that's literally go 30 cost per purchase with a 90 aov now all of a sudden you're getting a 3x roas and that may or may not be much better for you from a profitability standpoint to scale up further so that's the last thing that i would be looking at right there just from kind of you know going through that funnel right there of different approaches we can take to further improve some of those ad tests to actually turn them into winning creatives and everything so thank you all for watching y'all enjoyed this video hit that like button
