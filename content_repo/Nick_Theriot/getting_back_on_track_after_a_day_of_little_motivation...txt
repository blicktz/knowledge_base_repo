Good morning YouTube about to hop into a work block right now going straight into a sales call with a prospect first time actually more of a discovery call because I don't really sales call because I don't know anything about this prospect I don't know if they're qualified or not so we're gonna jump in a prospecting call I think today we're just gonna talk about the digital agency go over a few key operations and stuff that I've been working on lately and that's kind of what the vlog will be about today alright so it's been a whole hour and a half since I recorded that last clip sales call went awesome discovery call went amazing and this particular client right here is pretty much already has like a solid understanding of Facebook ads they're already running Facebook ads themselves and doing amazing and pretty much right now they're just looking for kind of a little consulting and then possibly from there us going full like hands-on or running ads forum so but amazing brand so let me show you guys what I'm doing right now is I'm actually I'm actually recorded the whole zoom call and I'm actually sending him a copy of it a link to it so we can actually go back and understand of everything we talked about so if you missed something or it's like oh you know he said something on that call and you know it really got to me or maybe he wants to review everything he has a link now it's our whole conversation to where he can make decisions based off of that so if he's like hey you know that the one strategy was talking on the call and I don't remember it boom boom or maybe hey I talked to this Facebook ads guy and he sounds really good well that doesn't have the same passion and selling ability like as hey this is our sales call once you listen to it if he wants to talk to like his business partner or maybe another decision maker in the business so highly recommend that super helpful and kind of like duplicate yourself in the sales process all right guys let me show you what I got right here we got some ramen noodles for some carbs and then we got to cancel it out some good grilled salmon yeah to be honest my whole diet is completely screwed right now I ate a pop-tart for breakfast yo guys so I'm not gonna lie today has been pretty much of a drag I didn't really get my full sleep last night and I've just been pretty lazy today but I did get majority of the actions and items and stuff I wanted to get done today not really a really efficient productive day but now we're getting some food cooking browning onions and stuff and check this out attempting to cook my first rice and gravy kind of like beef gravy so we'll see how that goes then I'll talk to you guys about a few other things later tonight we thought alliance pick on a letter against the strongest I'm alive and remain a victor my battle scars and show that I am far from a quitter went through it all and I'm still striving that makes me a winner when it's me versus the glow something I love about cooking on the porch is kind of just do cooking everything and then also to my macbook and really I'm just taking care of a bunch of random operations inside my agency team updates etc scouting people prospecting etc and it's pretty cool I really love to kind of chill outside and you know taking care of work whatever it might be and also cooking I did not work out today where I did my running and everything this morning but I did not actually do weight training and I kind of want to talk to you guys tonight about like what happens if you hit a roadblock what if you have in a day where there's zero motivation maybe just tired maybe just out of it and I kind of talk about that to you guys later but let's just keep cooking I'm enjoying the vibe fill it out here all righty guys I know today's vlog wasn't much if you pretty much hit kind of like a roadblock let's say you know doing your schedule and everything you have a day of very low motivation you know have a list of say five or six items you have to get done these are day-to-day things these are things you must get done get those things done and if you still have some free time don't feel too bad to be honest if you just take the day off you know take the day kind of relax mentally recharge and next day start fresh that's something that I've always done and if you're finding where it's like doing it once every four to five days that's cool that's cool or maybe every once every three to four days that's cool but if it's like every day then obviously you have some stuff in your life you need to change up maybe you're not inspired of the work you're doing maybe it's not I don't know maybe you just don't feel happy right now you need to change some stuff up but if it's just mentally exhausted then every few days get your to-do list thing done and then just take the day to relax I got like six or seven items that takes me about two hours to do I get those done every single day and then the rest of the day if I'm not productive if I'm not feeling creative and stuff I just kind of enjoy the day that's kind of what this vlog was yesterday cooked some good food and stuff had a few beers pretty much relaxed and today I'm right back at it feeling recharged and getting shit done hope you guys enjoyed today's video and I'll see you guys tomorrow hopefully you guys will see you guys out there because
