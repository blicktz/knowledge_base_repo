yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio and today we have a new video for you guys we diving into a retargeting campaign that I'm currently running has delivered a 5x return on adspin forest without a discount many advertisers simply believe that in order to get someone to come back and purchase from you you need to run a discount code in your retargeting campaigns which is simply not true the retargeting campaigns is simply a place for us to build more trust and confidence with our consumer before they make a purchase and I'm gonna cover that exactly in this video before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys so when running retargeting campaigns on Facebook ads whether it's mofu or bofu your warm audiences or your hot audiences retargeting campaigns is simply a place for us to further build trust and confidence with our consumer and also a place for us to further educate our consumer on our products so a lot of advertisers believe that in order to get people to come back and purchase you need to run a discount code and we proved that exactly with this retargeting campaign right here where we delivered a 5x return on adspin by simply stating where the consumer is that hey we see you've been checking out some of our Facebook ads and stuff what they have done hey you've seen our Facebook ads and stuff you've clicked on our ad you've gone to our website you've added to cart and now you're here and the reason why we can say that type of stuff in the ad is because the person we're targeting is exactly that person they viewed our content which is you know they viewed our website they've added to cart already so they've added something to the cart and then we simply just tell them to come back and complete their checkout and ask them what may be stopping them from checking out and it works extremely well we're simply just stating where they're at it catches them off guard because it's like you know you're just scrolling through Facebook and they see an ad from us saying hey you know we see you did this and this and this and like whoa what's going on but sometimes people just need a reminder to come back and complete their purchase now I'm not saying that that's what you need to go do create a whole bunch of reminder ads for people to improve your results because just like this campaign right here we're running for a hair care company we're simply providing more information for the consumer to make a purchase confidently so what we did was we created a few different video ads showing off different parts of the product you know answering different questions so for this particular product we're answering questions about how it was made how to use it what to do unboxing it so they're very well educated and further build a relationship with our brand before they make the purchase and it's working extremely well for us so this requires a lot of audience research and in this audience research you're going to look at fuse look at similar products on other websites other companies websites look at Amazon find you know a product similar and figure out what people are commenting on Amazon you know a few different descriptions and stuff like that you need to do a lot of audience and product research to understand what to put at this stage so instead of running a discount code and you follow all of these steps right here what you can do and where you can implement discount codes is further down the buying cycle and buying process where it's more of like you know say for example we like to run discount codes for people who engage with the page in the last 30 to 180 days so that way it's outside of a 30-day window so the hot people that people are actively looking at our brand and it's further out to re-engage people re-get people to come back we're giving them a new offer to come back and look at our products that catch their attention same thing for website visitors and stuff like that you can go out for older audiences make sure you exclude the current the active warm market right now because if you start giving out discount codes for as simple as things let's come check out our website oh you checked our website here's 10% off your order you know you're training people it's always expected discount and if they always expect a discount it's be harder and harder to increase your prices it's be harder and harder to continue carrying on and you know building momentum and scaling and stuff like that so you do not want to train people to get a discount code now it is ethical and it is works really well for us to do discount codes when we do a sell and we only recommend doing a sell maybe every six to eight weeks because if you do it too often consumers again are trained to it and they only purchase at those times and then you know you lose a lot of like sales and stuff and it's harder to scale but also too they always expecting a discount code on your cells you're gonna have to do a bigger discount code and then two when you do do a sell and you never do a sell ever you never offer different discount codes and you do do one it's gonna blow up the park because it's the first time something's seen a discount from you guys seen a sell and it's a lot more effective and it won't really ruin your reputation with your brand so tone back pull back when offering those discount codes dive deeper into consumer's mind look at customer support questions and stuff what are people asking before they place an order what are some of the questions people have and use that in your bottom of funnel retargeting and to be a lot more effective hand hold them to the sale get them all the information they need to make the sale properly you know do competitive analysis look you know compare your brand to other brands in the market obviously don't call off those other brands by their name but just hey compared to the to the competitors we do this and this better here's our shipping rates here's some customer testimonials here's an unboxing video here's how to use it here's our warranty on it all that type of stuff and if you have any special what's your unique offer what's your unique value you bring to the marketplace you communicate that all effectively to your consumers and you're gonna have a lot more effective bottom funnel retargeting and personally i believe it's going to do a lot better than just hey you look at our website here's 10 off what no i'm not even at that stage yet because once someone comes to your website they you know they're they're gonna become aware of the problem you you're um you solve and become aware of your product they might look at a few other products that offer by similar competitors and stuff like that then i might have some questions about shipping and then they're like okay well maybe you know for example right now i'm looking at a desk you know i'm looking at okay pricing competitively okay that looks good shipping that's a big thing right there for me so and then the specific you know technical benefits of that particular desk i want to make sure suits me so create more content around that i also want to see more setups and people using it in their setup so i can see how people geared towards them okay cool so now i'm i'm educating the consumer exactly the information they need and you gotta really dig deeper into psychology so hope this video kind of
