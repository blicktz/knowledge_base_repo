what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick terrio CEO of terrio solutions and I wanted to bring this video today to talk about the top mistakes clothing brands are making with Facebook ads we spend a lot of time day to day between auditing at accounts of prospects hopping on consulting calls and actually running the ads for our current clients right now just in the last few months we generated over seven figures in this industry and we see a lot of good and bad type of ads that people are running mistakes they're making and then today this video I want to discuss all of those so that way you're not making any of these beginner mistakes so the number one mistake I see most clothing brands making is the content they're posting on a day-to-day basis doesn't tie into the culture of their ideal audience so for example if you're a gym clothing brand and you're marketing clothes to people who like to go to gym let's say lift weights bodybuilders you understand your ideal audience but every time you post a picture on your social media you're posting someone in a tank top repping your gear but say on a white background with no other information in that environment so a good thing to apply to your current strategy right now with day-to-day content posting is adding lifestyle photography in your marketing so basically instead of just getting people posing with with the outfit on on maybe a white background like a typical model does is actually get lifestyle photography of your product in use so if you're a gym brand you want to get people working out in your fit if you are a lifestyle clothing brand that's going after people who like to go out and party you want to get a bunch of context a lot of photography around your product being out and about use people going to eat places hanging out with friends having fun and you want to put all that together number two mistake i see a lot of people doing is they're not testing look-alike audiences this is a huge one if you already getting say a thousand to two thousand dollars a month in sales on your clothing brand and you have the facebook pixel installed inside your shopify site and you've been tracking all of that data and you have over a hundred conversions of purchases at carts view content etc you should be able to start running look-alike audiences and this is very powerful because what it does is instead of targeting interest on facebook it allows us to target people who look like our exact buyer which allows us to target a more sophisticated audience more higher quality audience as more likely to buy from your brand i've came there and use a successful implementation of look-alike audiences and running them in a proper way when starting with one of our clients and they went from a 1.13 row as to a 2.5 2.6 row as just within the first seven days of us working together so running look-alike audiences is key and if you're not using them already i would recommend to start doing it now now number three is not testing enough creatives a lot of clothing brands they'll come in and they'll take a picture of their shirt that they're trying to sell right now and they'll use that one picture to put all their ads been towards and test that creative so use them may use multiple different audiences but use one creative for that product highly recommend testing multiple different pictures or videos of a product and testing multiple different variations for the ad so every time i'll launch a product for a clothing brand when testing say audiences or testing the likelihood of how successful will be will come there will test a video of it a carousel ad and a picture of it so we have three different variations for the for the kind of like the placement the ad type and then we have a few different pictures few different videos a few different collection ads created so you want to capture a lot of content around that product to really sell people on it you know grab a few pictures overview pictures of it a few lifestyle pictures of it and then get a few pictures up close and showing the detail inside that product has any special features or benefits in it so overall test more ad video pictures for our product and overall test more variations of how you run that whether it's a carousel of video or a picture format now number four is user generated content if you add this to your ad strategy you're going to drastically increase your sales and your back end of the ad strategy and your back end of the ad strategy and your back end of the ad strategy and your back end row as so a big thing with user generated content is clothing brands is all about social proof no one wants to buy clothing that no one else is wearing so what user generated content is is you get a bunch of your existing purchases to come there and take a picture take a selfie just show off the clothes that they bought from you and with a positive review on it and you run this content towards your existing warm audiences people who viewed your website engage with your Instagram engage with your Facebook page and what this allows you to do is it allows people who are just got introduced to your brand who are still skeptical about your brand skeptical about your clothing it's a way to follow up with them and say hey look how awesome these people are in this clothing and basically if you want to be as awesome as them come check it out plus they have a good review on that particular product so it drastically increases the social proof of your product and makes people want it more increases the desire and the likelihood of someone purchase will also increase which will increase your ROAS overall and lastly number five is every product you launch on your store is going to have a certain level of desire for it so some products I'll see has a really high desire everyone wants that product it does amazing on cold audiences warm audiences etc really really hot product then there's some products that you launch and it just kind of does alright for the cold audience for the cold audience and the warm audience does pretty well just because they're already introduced to your brand and everything and a lot of clothing brands I talk to on a day to day basis they're not scaling those winners and the cool thing about clothing is yes you can always order more of that particular style and you can literally scale up and do six figures on ads with just one particular product for one of our clients we did six figures in a month over a hundred thousand dollars in sales at a 3x ROAS with a pair of pants yes the pants was a hundred dollars and we scaled the hell out of that campaign and literally just that one pair of pants did over a hundred grand for them in that particular month they did like 300k that month and almost a third of their revenue came from that one particular product so if you have a hot product don't be afraid to scale it and focus all your other products that are not as hot on a cold audience put them in your warm audiences and remarket it to people who's already been exposed to your brand maybe previous buyers and stuff and you know the cold audiences aren't purchasing if you would like to work with me and my team helping you in your clothing brand I'll put my link below to where you can actually schedule a call with
