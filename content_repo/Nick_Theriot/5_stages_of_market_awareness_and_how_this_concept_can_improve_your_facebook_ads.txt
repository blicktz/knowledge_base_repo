Hey what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theria and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today we'll be talking about the five stages of market awareness this is something that's me very very interesting and it's gonna try to challenge a little bit of how you think about advertising and kind of give you a whole new perspective a huge new perspective that when I first learned this I was mind-blowing and when I learned this as we're applying it I've seen a better improvement in my results and stuff just a warning this is gonna be just more of a higher level thinking of how we create creative how we create copy more of like a like a basis to create off of when we're creating ads so now we're gonna get an ads manager stuff which be more just kind of showing you guys a few cool you know thought processes essentially of how to think about things around marketing so before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday let's get started guys so today I want to talk about the five stages of market awareness this was created by Eugene Swartz in breakthrough advertising so if you don't have a copy of breakthrough advertising this is what breakthrough advertising is I have this book and it's one of been the game changer for me in terms of advertising and just learning about how to actually think about marketing and stuff and it's incredible I highly recommend this book you go to breakthrough advertising book.com I believe it is and you can pick up a copy for about a hundred us a hundred dollars USD and it's a lot cheaper than going on Amazon where you can charge like a few hundred bucks for it so um just if you just for that it's completely legal and all that like literally it's like one of his friends that just repurposed the book and printed it again so um nothing illegal or anything like that so but anyway let's get started why the five stages and what are the five stages so the five stages of market awareness basically the put it in this perspective is basically the awareness people have of their current situation around your product so the five stages are unaware people so these are people that are clearly unaware to your product your brand or their problem or solutions or yada yada yada they're completely unaware they are a target market just they're unaware about everything so this is a subsequent part of a target market if that makes sense now your stage two is problem aware people 95 of the marketers they kind of lay in this particular area um the problem where market is basically people who are aware of their problem they have they just don't know what solution they want to go for yet so oh I have knee pain oh I have back pain oh my facebook ads are terrible my performance sucks okay you see now and now we went from just hey I run facebook ads to now I have a problem I'm problem where I'm aware that my facebook ads suck now number three is solution where solution aware is people that are aware of the problem they have but they also too are aware of different solutions to their problem so this is someone that oh I run facebook ads my facebook ads suck you know I'm getting terrible performance the different solutions I have to that problem is maybe testing new creative maybe changing up the ad account structure maybe just improving ltv so now let's figuring out what solution though is the best fit for me now stage four product aware this is we're going to start getting into retargeting so in retargeting we focus on four and five and in prospecting our cold audiences we focus on one through three so just an very very very important note to understand so this is going to start giving you the foundational thinking process of what you need to illustrate at each stage in terms of like either top of funnel or retargeting so again I've split up my process now my ad account techniques where I basically run my ad account I run two campaigns one prospecting which is cold audiences and one retargeting and just jumble jumble all my retargeting messages in there and it's been working really well so this is retargeting and this is more top of funnel right here now product aware people are people that run facebook ads and these people have a problem their performance being bad they're aware of the different solutions and their solution that they're aware of and they really want to dive more into is improving their creative performance and they're aware of my product that is creates highly engaging ad creatives for them and then the product aware people these are people that need to know that hey there is five other people that produce facebook ad creatives for me why should I choose you and that's the big thing right there so I'm gonna show you some more examples in a second too so if you're a little lost right now it's holy get it it's a very complex topic to understand but once you understand it you can start better kind of creating your ads and your structure and stuff now most aware number five these are people that's going through the whole process and they love your brand they trust your brand and everything there's price sensitive so this is when you're going to go through that discount free trial quick little offer and stuff that's really going to catch those people so let's actually go dig further into this and actually show you some examples here so stage number one pet parents so these are unaware market so for pet parents let's just say for example we sell dog food so we sell dog food and our target demographic is pet parents um and you can even say dog dog pet parents however you want to put it uh because we sell dog food so how we can open up to this market with our ad can be something like this 75 percent of dog foods have this one type of bacteria in it and it shortens the life of the dog by 25 percent or this shocking new bacteria in dog food is affecting the dog's uh health um dog's health uh um let's see shocking new health and most dog owners do not know about it learn more so like we're basically it's a really great way for the unaware market to kind of probe at something so you know it's straightened like fear or um because people are more curiosity because now it's like oh wow like there's bacteria dog food it's 75 percent of dog foods like i need to check this out now and then i can start talking about like the problem of it blah blah blah so like again unaware is gonna be your hardest market to open to and we don't recommend even opening to this market until you're really just trying to find new people because you scaled up so much of your business you're trying to find more people so as again it's a very hard market do not expect any crazy returns from this unless you know later down the line and you're really spending more time to really refine this but i would not start with this at all if you're watching this video now problem aware market so these are pet parents and dog pet parents who just ran out of dog food they have a problem now their problem is they don't have any dog food and they either need to go to the store to get some more or they might be in research method to try to find some more or they go to the store and they're trying to figure out which brand of all the brands to choose from these are problem where they just ran out of dog food so you can even run an ad hey just ran out of dog food let me introduce our amazing new food blah blah blah like that's very cheeky and obviously it'd be a little bit more harder of an example and stuff but that's that's definitely a problem aware market right there they need dog food let's open up to their problem and then agitate a problem a little bit so just ran out of dog food question mark uh yet again you told yourself you would stock up but you didn't stop going to the store spending hours of your time in traffic yada yada like agitating that pain a little bit welcome you know chewy.com we deliver dog food to your door at you know half the shipping costs of the competitor yada yada yada so like there you go pair of parents who just ran out of dog food boom now solution aware people so these are people who ran out of dog food but now they're deciding whether they want to go on a raw food diet other dog food brands human food vegan food yeah so they're aware of their problem that's the key point right here they're aware of their problem they're just trying to figure out the best solutions to their problem when there's a ton of different solutions out there so let's say if my problem was to lose weight there's a lot of different solutions to lose weight i can go on a keto diet macro count uh counting i can go out there and you know just do like kick cardio and stuff like that so a great way for solution aware is to us versus them ad is pretty cool another one could be like making these other diets or making these other like dog foods seem a lot worse than they actually are do not call a competitor out directly by their name but you know again you can go back to you know um i'm trying to think of the best way to explain this to make sense essentially but you know for let's say for like counting calories when we were um i do counting calories for my dieting and everything like that um i i like to always strive of like you know keto removes an essential carb or essential nutrient your body needs to work on for a day-to-day basis so that's why i introduced you counting calories you can eat what you enjoy while still losing weight so i just like knocked another solution also i pulled back to this is what you need to do and also pull back to the frame of mind of hey you can eat what you want and love it so like it makes it seem so much a better solution than all the other ones so like if that makes sense right there so solution aware people you want to kind of just really like stand out in front of all the other solutions you make them sound a lot harder than actually a lot harder and make your easy your solution sound a lot easier and more like hey that's the solution i need to go to now product aware so while stage three you're fighting to prove yourself all the all that are solutions and stage four you're fighting against all the other competitors so this is where you're going to start going down into your retargeting so again pet parents who just ran out dog food now they have decided on feeding their dog the raw food diet they have discovered your brand have taken a look at what you offer but there's still other companies that offer raw dog food and now they're trying to decide which one to go to so they've gone through the process of needing food so they went online they researched different dog foods they've found raw food they found human food they found you know just other dog food brands that's similar to theirs they found vegan food and then their solution is they want to go raw food diet so they went from unaware the day before to today needing dog food to doing a little bit of research and figuring out they want to go to the raw food diet as their solution they looked at five different companies that essentially offer the raw food diet and they're trying to figure out which one to go to they looked at all their websites including yours and now which one i want to go to so this is where an us versus them ad actually works very well um not not the solution versus you know solution aware part but product aware is where us versus them works really well if you can identify your brand strong three or four benefits that outshines all the other competitors in your space then really outline them right there because it makes the consumer process a lot more easier when they see your brand sticking out in front of the other brands so that's very big key right there you really want to sell yourself as and ask yourself the question if out of all the other brands doing what i'm doing exactly you know if i'm selling raw dog food with real bison meat in it whatever then like and other competitors are what makes mine different and why should competitors purchase for me do we have the lowest prices fastest shipping best customer service and stuff if all the other ones have really bad customer service complaints we shine by our best customer service we have a guarantee we have a no money back no question sacks 30 day guarantee if your dog does not love it send it back or don't even have to send it back just send us a message and we'll send you money back like why should people choose your brand versus others we have 65 more protein in our raw dog food than the others we can show off our like story like of how we got started and stuff our competitor like not a better story but our like about the founders and showing off our you know story of how we got started and very inspirational and very like awesome and people can tie into that and build that relationship that community with us and then they they have a reason why to choose us over the competition because they have a better like you know like they have something to buy into essentially and that's very very strong and very powerful right there so that's another big thing right there so product aware people this is again it's gonna be a retargeting level is gonna be your first retargeting level um solution aware problem aware and unaware people that we're opening up to these are not retargeting people there's essentially um prospecting people called audiences now stage five is most aware people most aware people they know you they trust you they've seen your brand the only thing that they are is price sensitive so they've gone to your website they've seen some of your retargeting ads and stuff they've seen your ads they've read your story they've they everything like they they know your brand but they're price sensitive they are um very like they're gonna be the first people that's gonna hit up a deal a discount and this is why we do not recommend running discounts 24 7 because it screws up this batch of people because the moment you launch a 25 off for you know black friday these people are just in there pounding away like generating you massive amount of sales so this is why we only do sales once a month for three to four days at a time once a month for three to four days is when we do our sale period so make sure you understand that but you can also do retargeting ad where it's like five percent off or ten percent off your first order make sure you're talking in that that perspective and you can also do like a free gift with your first order as well like you don't necessarily have to do a discount you can also increase the perceived value to make it seem more to where basically essentially that um that price point looks a lot less and that's really really great so that's another thing to really look at so yeah guys the five stages of market awareness and i know this is a very complex topic but hopefully i was able to break this down for you basically the best way to actually implement this is just to start writing different copy creating different creatives around this create some video creatives around this and then just launching them and testing them and starting to figure out what works just testing a lot i don't think you need really don't think too much into this don't really get too great like you know stay pretty granular with this stay pretty broad with this just like hey problem aware i'm gonna write five pieces of copy for problem aware real quick boom done solution where five pieces boom done all right go in the ads manager take my best creative put those five different variations of ad copy on it and then boom launch it test it for a week see what happens and then move forward like don't get hung up because i first i got i got hung up when i first learned this and it took me a lot of time before i applied it then i just started applying it and just i keep it very simple like just it just keep it simple keep it rolling and that's gonna be your best way to actually test this uh right here this pretty much is five stages of awareness so i really hope you all enjoyed this video if you are an e-com business owner and you're doing at least

to make it up to you guys i'm basically leveling raising the level of which i'm creating content for this channel now because at the end of the day a lot of the content is overly repeated of just you know cbo this cbo that and like i really want to dive more into this marketing stuff and this is going to be the course so now i'm really contemplating right now whether or not like if i just put
