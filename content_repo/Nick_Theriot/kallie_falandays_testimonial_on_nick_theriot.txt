Hey guys, this is Callie from Telltale Poetry. I worked with Nick for about a month on my Facebook ads and he was awesome. We worked together to develop a new strategy and a lot of it involved video and so that's why I feel super comfortable talking to you guys on video.

He helped me figure out who to target, how to target them. We ended up getting some new leads in. I had a video that got like over a thousand views which is awesome compared to my like normally eight view videos and he was a pleasure to work with.

He was super collaborative. He sent me awesome weekly updates that were really informative and he like kind of let me see the inner workings of the Facebook ad process which I wasn't really privy to before working with him and he was super kind and collaborative and I would recommend him to anyone who needs a reasonable smart Facebook ad manager. I was just trying to think of like how you call him so I guess he would be a Facebook ad manager but also he involved a little bit of business strategy which helped me kind of solidify my own goals outside of Facebook as well.

Thanks so much Nick.
