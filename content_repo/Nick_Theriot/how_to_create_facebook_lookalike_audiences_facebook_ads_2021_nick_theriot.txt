yo what's going guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys you guys have asked me a lot nick what does your lookalike campaigns look like i'm like what i run them exactly the way i do an interest campaign and stuff but i thought i'd make a video for you guys and literally show you step by step me creating a campaign me creating a lookalike audience why i chose this lookalike audience and what you should look out for when creating lookalike audience campaigns and stuff and exactly how to test it and then scale it up so that being said let's jump into this before we get started make sure you hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday friday and yeah guys let's get started okay so diving into the ad account um first things first i'm just gonna hit create and we're gonna create a whole new campaign we'll do conversions always name your campaign agency initials this will be a tofu campaign so top of funnel and this will be a test audience testing and website conversions and it'll be abo name is ad set we're gonna call this or we're not gonna actually edit we're not even gonna name that just yet we're just gonna hit continue and we're gonna leave cbo off because we want to do an actual like specific test to see if we spend exact amount for all of these ad sets which one will yield the best results so now we're inside here what we're gonna do is we're gonna set the daily budget to i recommend two extra average cost per purchase you can also do one x so anywhere from one to two extra average cost per purchase so i'll just do ten dollars a day for right here because let's just say for example you don't even know what your cost per purchase is then here we go let's just do ten dollars a day to start off with and we're gonna create a custom audience we're gonna go website so there's a few different lookalike audiences in fact that you can actually create you can do social engagement so like instagram engagement facebook engagement works super well video views work really well as well and then you can do different website actions and then you can also upload a customer list so what i recommend doing is if you don't have any purchases yet add to cart yet i recommend doing more social engagement lookalike audiences so instagram engagement 30 days facebook engagement 30 days video views 30 days of your main performing ad and then if you have a lot of purchases then go for more purchase lookalike audience add to cards initiate checkout my standard is i want to lease a hundred events of a specific action that i'm creating a lookalike audience based off within the time period that i'm optimizing for so if i create a 30 day purchase audience and we're getting 90 purchases within a 30 day period i want to go for maybe a 60 day period where i know we're getting at least 100 so just for example that's how we set the time frames of which we're creating lookalike audiences so so let's just do a standard like website visitors lookalike audience for this specific one so all website visitors i know we're getting at least 200 300 website visitors every day i would never do a one or two a day unless i'm doing like black friday but i would do a seven day and i would also do a 30 day so i'm just gonna do a 30 day for this one and i like to name it my initials i'm just gonna do website visitors 30 days and then also too i'm just gonna put this for youtube example and then create audience so you need to create a custom audience first before you can create a lookalike audience so whatever cus whatever lookalike audience you want to create you got to create a custom audience first of it so now hey your audience custom audience let's say create it now it literally gives you the option now of what you want to do next and we want to create a lookalike audience we just want to go straight to it it'll have a variation and then you'll see some stuff right here one percent two percent three percent four percent all up to ten percent starting out you want to do a one percent and then as you outgrow that one percent you want to start going up to higher percentages to better scale the ad account and we'll get to get to that in a second exactly so i'm gonna say create audience for this and then there we go we got our lookalike audience in it and your reach may be low because it hasn't had time yet to populate so it takes a little time to populate before you can still use it but you still may take some time to populate and stuff and grow in there so now we want to exclude some audiences because this is a cold audience ad i like to exclude some custom audiences so let me do custom audience and i want to exclude i literally want to exclude website visitors 30 days because i don't want anyone who's visited the website last 30 days to be my cold audience i also want to exclude purchase 30 i want to exclude ig engagement 30 and then i want to exclude facebook engagement 30 so the reason we exclude these is because i want all my warm audiences hot and even past buyers not to see my new ads i want to be going to purely cold ads and just because i excluded a website visitors 30 day custom audience and i'm running a lookalike based off that custom audience that does not mean it won't run all that's going to mean is we've created a lookalike of 2.1 million people of this specific custom audience right here and i don't want anyone that's in that audience right now to be included in that people so that way we're purely cold people now i'm just going to leave this targeting right here um generally when i'm running a lookalike audience i don't change any of the targeting and then detail targeting expansion you can turn that off or look like expansion leave that off for right now and then you can leave placements on automatic and stuff and then we're just going to title this let's just grab the name for it pull c and then i'm just going to title it like that so and then let's just create an ad real quick super quick let's just use existing post see what pops up let's do ads post i'm just going to use this obviously i would normally go ahead and create like an ad and stuff usually but just to save time for this video i'm just going to do that select the domain you make sure all your stuff's set up and cool that looks good and then i'm just going to name this ad number one you know you can do ad number one carousel whatever we have specific naming conventions we use inside the agency i just don't want to share them on this specific video it's for another time and i don't want to confuse you guys so we're just gonna hit publish on that now now that we got our ad in there i'd recommend at least doing two to three ads inside of here but again just for purposes of this video we want to make it do simple we're gonna hit publish on that and then go back to our ad sets right here and now what we want to do is we want to test more look likes because all we did was create a website visitors 30 day look like there's other look likes we can create for this specific account so what i like to do is just go click on this ad set and hit ctrl d maybe even command d if you're on pc not really too sure i'm on mac so now we want to do is is you'll notice when we do that all we do is duplicate it which is really good we want that and we want to remove our existing look like we want to create a new custom audience and let's say we let's do a video just for showcase for you guys content type let's do at least 75 if you have like a five minute long video running as a facebook ads obviously you're gonna do like 10 seconds but we have a video we're running for 30 seconds it's performing really well for this account so again you need to make sure you're getting at least 100 views within the time frame and honestly i wouldn't even bother creating a video view custom audience at least i had like 10 000 or 5 000 video views so i'm gonna choose video i need to go right here i need to type in the exact count or exact page and then i have one right here we have 641 000 views on it pick that's the one that our main ads are running so i want to create a video view custom audience of that specific video and i want to do the last 30 days because i want fresh data so generally a rule of thumb you can do seven days if you're getting enough convergence that seven day window 30 days pretty much the standard it's worked really well um a pretty consistent one but then 180 day has been kind of okay uh because you're getting the longer data periods and sometimes just those buyers aren't in the market anymore and in fact honestly let's just do a seven day just for shits and gigs for you guys show you kind of exactly different ways you can go about it again same thing 75 percent are watched mother's day so watch mother's day video because that's the video in this particular one 75 plus and we'll do uh seven days youtube example create audience and i want to create a look like audience make sure you have your location in there and we'll do a one percent as well again and the reason why i excluded that customer remove that custom audience because we don't want the custom audience to be included in the look like because we're going after a look like we're not going after a custom audience so and i'm not putting video views in here because these are my warm audiences i want to exclude so that's why we did this a little different and then again i'm gonna copy this and just paste it up here and then publish so what you can do is you can do video view percent you can go ahead and do an ig engagement one a facebook engagement one website visitors one add to cart purchase if you really want to hit a few of them and do 7 30 maybe a 90 or 180 just depending on how often you get those 100 events of each one so let's just say i did five of them now what do you do you essentially want to run these now for 72 hours that's the key 72 hours maybe even a week just depending on how often you get your purchases and stuff you want to run them for a few days and then you want to pick out the winners so let's say for example we run this for a few days and you know just hop back on here let's say we run this for you know seven days and the website visitors one performs the best and all we'll do is we'll turn that one off we'll turn off the opposite the ones that didn't perform let's say visitors one performed the best so now what we want to do is we want to just leave this alone and we want to duplicate this ad set into a new campaign do a cbo and do say 100 bucks or 500 bucks a day and start scaling it just depending on your risk tolerance and stuff and your product and stuff like that of how quickly you can scale and you want to start scaling up and let's say if you have two or three best performing lookalikes in this specific ad set right here or in this campaign right here then you want to duplicate those into that cbo so you have one cbo which are best performing lookalike audiences at a minimum of 100 bucks a day to say 300 bucks a day now here's the next step what you want to do is let's say website visitors 30 days continues to perform you scaling that cbo up and website visitors 30 days continuously performs good over and over and over now we need to start increasing that lookalike percentage because what's going to happen is you're going to burn through that 2.1 million people that's inside of this specific audience so there's a few different ways you can do it my favorite honestly is just to go and duplicate this and create a 3 a 5 and a 10 variation of this specific look like so what's going to happen is what you can do is you're going to control d just like you did and we're going to create a whole new one and we're going to remove this one we're going to do create a lookalike audience because we already have the custom audience set up and i think it was what website visitors do other sources website visitors youtube example and then we're going to do is we're going to try uh we're leaving out one but we're going to try a say a three percent so we'll create that audience i'm going to just simply copy that go up here paste it now i'm going to hit ctrl d again to duplicate this one go down create new or remove that create new lookalike audience and then what i want to do is go to i think it's what youtube example website visitors see if it pops up there we go custom audience and then we'll do five percent now we will have a little bit of auction overlap with this because a one percent a three percent a five percent is going to have you know your five percent is going to enclose your you're one and three percent you're your one you're zero through three percent your three percent is going to close your zero through three percent so your one percent three percent is going to overlap your one percent through your three or five percent overlap like they're going to overlap a little bit but it's okay so we're not scaling all three at once we're just trying to test the three real quick and then we're gonna we're gonna start scaling the winner so great audience publish now i would also do the um or i forgot to copy my name but i would also do the 10 right here so we have one three five ten we already scaled the one so we'll just be testing three five ten you could also maybe do three five seven and ten just have a few different variations but what happens is you'll notice when we start scaling up or start doing these higher percentage look-alike audiences we're going to start increasing the amount of people that's inside each one so a five percent will have like 11 million people in it whereas a one percent will have 2.1 million people so the more you scale up the look-alike audience the more people in it higher percentages yields you know further scalability with particular creatives access and stuff like that so that's how that's why i like when a look-alike audience stops performing sometimes it's just because we've touched everyone in there and 2.1 many people won't get you far at all you know we're trying to go to 10 as quick as possible as as long as you know as we keep scaling up and stuff and i've also seen it where you test one three five seven and ten all at once and a 10 while the gate will outperform all of them so it's not like you have to go one to two then two to three to three to four sometimes it can be one then ten percent it won't always be just right then and there so that's just a quick example too as well of you know how that works specifically so but once you create these these other higher percentages you want to run the same thing run for a few days test them and then duplicate the winners into your cbo scaling campaign and you just want to keep building up that cbo's campaign can't skeleton campaign with a few thousand dollars a day a budget your best performing audiences and your best performing creatives that's kind of like my look-alike audience strategy i'd literally do this exact same thing for interest that's exactly the same if you're trying to replicate those results as well so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you are a shopify business owner and you're looking to scale your business
