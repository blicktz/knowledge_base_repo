today we will be live building a facebook ad campaign with you guys specifically for shopify with purchases you know going after purchase conversions everything like that you know keep in mind this can be applied to any account we run the same exact structure for legion for personal brands things like that the only thing that changes is the objective itself but yeah so that being said let's dive into this we're gonna go over the full thing you know we'll be going over today so you know obviously the first thing you want to do is your research your market research is what allows you to you know pretty much create the ads and stuff that you'll be launching today we want to identify about three to six completely different ad angles we can position our product into the marketplace from our research and you know we want to look at the desires what people want in the product and everything and then what we can push those onto our product itself then we're just simply create those ads we're going to create basically one ad per ad angle and then what we're going to do is we're going to launch a cbo campaign which we're going to show you you know now exactly how we do that cbo campaign one ad set broad targeting we're going to run that for seven days and then we'll start our dct testing dynamic creative testing and stuff which i'll also show you guys today but yeah so you know that being said assuming you get the research done you got your first couple ads create it let's actually go in the ad account this is one of our ad accounts that you know pretty much just used to play and you know make youtube videos with so you know nothing too crazy here but you know this video this video can be beneficial for people starting brand new accounts this also can be beneficial for people that are actively doing our setup and stuff like that so either way it's you know it's good for you guys but we're gonna create a campaign we're click on sales really quick we're gonna go to name this campaign i always like to add my agency initials you can add your store initials personal and issues uh issues whatever i'm gonna call that prospecting you know it doesn't really matter boom and then what i'll do next is i'm gonna name the ad sets i just like to call it zero one we're gonna be targeting usa somebody usa we only want to target one country at a time melpa's female this product is 18 plus i'll do 18 plus broad and then ap for automatic placements and then we're gonna optimize for purchases and then ads i'm just gonna call this ad number one for a second really quick continue i want to do a manual sales campaign main reason why i want to do a manual sense sales campaign is purely because advantage plus prioritize this more middle funnel bomb a funnel so it's it's good for a sprint but it's not good for long term and that's what we want we want something long term are you just me consistently frustrated and constantly having to relaunch campaigns and just it's a mess i don't recommend that at all okay cool campaign details we do auction campaign objective sales we're going to turn off use a catalog and then from here we're going to turn on advantage campaign budget set that up whatever you want i'm gonna do a hundred dollars a day you can start off with ten dollars a day look full transparency if you're spending less than fifty dollars a day like you know probably facebook guys ain't the best thing for you but i'm gonna do a hundred dollars today that's typically where i start all my campaigns off at highest volume or value campaign bid strategy go right here it's ad sets i'm just gonna do a website i'm not gonna do website and shop if you have success with shop cool you can do that if not then we'll just push whatever you want you know for pixel cafe whatever you want to call it all of that i just use the native shopify facebook integration feature don't really see a need to make a video on that because pretty much everyone watches channel already has that installed and you know quite frankly just not my ideal audience if you don't even know how to set the pixel click through seven days view through one day when you get charged boom i'm not going to turn on dynamic creative yet and then from here start date i always like to start off at midnight i don't know i just like having everything start off fresh boom audience controls here this is where we're going to go into this we're going to click on edit let's see hold up let me switch to original audience all right cool reason why we switched to original audience is for the exact same reason it prioritizes more middle funnel bottom of funnel content due to that all we're going to do is we're going to see a higher frequency out the gate and it's just going to force impressions on people that just technically don't want them so this particular product we're pushing in the united states i always recommend one country per campaign get successful one country before you expand to other countries age this product is 18 plus you know i rarely ever edit age unless i'm dealing with a product that's 21 plus or something like that or you know we have this one particular client that sells ambulance insurance and we have to target 60 plus for legal reasons but yeah so for the most part i'm leaving it 18 plus gender if you're specific to a like you know if you have a female clothing brand specific to females then cool do female or vice versa for men this product is unisex so i'm just gonna target all again i don't do any targeting at all the only thing i'll do is i'll just do like you know purchase 30 day i'll exclude that uh wait that's why i'm spelling it wrong purchase 30 day and all i'm gonna do is exclude this audience there we go and then turn that off right there so make sure you can exclude people properly exclude there we go cool united states boom placements i leave ap on automatic placements on and then yeah that's pretty much it you know go to next and what i like to do starting off is i like to roll with what you call it i like to roll with you know if i'm doing a brand new campaign and again this is not like if if you already have an experienced account you're gonna run with the next setup which is dynamic creatives this is more for people that you know starting brand new account you know more of like a beginner style thing right here so select your facebook page select your instagram accounts select single image you can leave multi-advert advertiser ads on i don't see any problem with that and then we're gonna go add media i have a couple things we're gonna add today we're just gonna upload desktop and there we go got a couple images here for you guys and have a couple videos as well for you guys okay cool so i have my couple photos uploaded so i'm just gonna go ahead and create these your original for that your original for that next all right cool and then done all right now what i want to do is i want to import my body copy all right cool let's see what's that url there we go as far as you know should you link to the product page or the collection page it just depends on what's going on this particular right here we're going to be pushing this product but let's actually grab i have a best sellers page for this website so i'm just gonna copy that and then boom all right cool now what i like to do for primary text and headline primary text i like to just add a little bit more to the creative itself to celebrate the infinite memories that lie ahead there we go all right that's pretty simple pretty straightforward headline so what i like to do is i like to write something on the body copy that just goes with the creative itself and then the second thing i like to do is for the headline is i like to give a reason why people should click the learn more button or shop now button you have to keep in mind that this is the hook right here just so it stops people's attention the whole visual itself is the second thing that stops visual it's like that people's attention so all of this is what stops people's attention and then here is just to add a little bit more to this this is pretty vague what i have right here so you know i just kind of did something similar and then the headline this is a reason why okay i'm aware of an affinity sign you know i'm sold on it technically now you know the headline is just a reason for them to click now i've seen quite a few variety you know you can do something like get yours today and surprise your sweetheart something simple like that i've also seen stuff like order now and get free shipping i've seen that work really well yeah i'll probably do that right there call to action do shop now i'll always do shop now and then pretty much that's it if you're on like triple l or anything like that you can add the url parameters and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna load in my next couple ads in here and all of these ads are going to be completely unique from each other because again each one should be testing a different market hypothesis from your market research if you're not doing that then you're making a big big mistake right there and look some of these are gonna be images somebody's gonna be videos all i'm doing here is i'm just testing very different things from my research so i'll do one more in here for you guys boom boom boom all right perfect gift for your sweetheart give her something she is not expecting okay cool and then i'll write a body copy for this uh perfect gift for your sweetheart give her something she is not expecting guys if you want to make her scream this valentine's day yeah we can do that because valentine's day is coming up there we go boom cool and i can leave order now get free shipping boom and then just to show you guys buh buh buh i'm me putting a video in here as well i think we'll click like this add video upload all right cool now we have a video all right cool got a short little video here nothing too crazy just get girl talking the thing how do i sweep my partner off their feet do something around that if you want to make your partner watch this let's try that boom there we go for videos i like to do for like the body copy and stuff i like to just add something here like something that tells people to you know basically watch the video also i even try something like this i want to make your there we go if you want to make your partner fall in love with you again with you again you need to see this all right cool so what i'll do is i'll upload in all you know three to six ads you know that's typically what i go for just make sure i show you guys this really quick three to six different ads i'll do up to 12 12 as the max but assuming you're gonna spend like 100 something dollars a day for that what i'll do is i'll publish that and i'm gonna run this now for seven days right and that gives me enough cycles in the marketplace to determine a what got the most spin but no purchases or b what got the most purchases so ideally i'm looking for an ad that got purchases that's going to give me the most confidence in this performing but if there's no purchases at all in seven days what i'm looking to do is look at the ad that's getting the most spin and i'm looking to create iterations off of that because if it's getting a lot of spin that's showing that a lot of people are resonating with this ad but it's just something that's lacking the conversion power so what we want to do is we want to go ahead and we want to build a new ad off of that that has a better conversion power so let's just fast forward let's just pretend seven days went by and let's just pretend that ad number three worked amazing so i'm leaving this asset on that's cool because this is my new control and everything i do now is to beat this existing control so how do we beat this control ad set all we want to do here is to load in new creatives and these new creatives the whole goal here is to beat what's currently working so let's just pretend add number three right here the video let's just pretend that this video got the most spin maybe a purchase or two maybe it wasn't profitable maybe my target robust was a three and maybe we got a a one so we really need to improve this right so what i'll do is here is just simply go ahead i'm gonna leave all that on because my goal is to build and beat that i'm just going to go and create a new ad set and this ad set is going to be called dct01 you actually do two zeros because you're likely you test a lot of dcts over time and what we want to do here is same setup boom website pixel make sure you're selecting purchases regardless if you're a new account or a brand new brand and what you want to do come here and click on dynamic creative click on continue same thing you can select this to to run at midnight all right and then here make sure you switch to original audience because you know facebook is going to go ahead and and select that for you you know add your exclusions which is purchase 30 days boom there we go and then from here we're going to do is we're going to go into our ad itself and then here select your page boom okay cool now let's say let's see let's go over here to videos and like i said our video worked really good so let's go and make three new creatives around that video so we know the video worked well but we only tested one hook so let's start off with testing the hook first and what we're going to do is going to create three videos so we had one video we identified that the hook could be better so we went create three new videos exact same video with just a new hook on it that is all we did because we know the hook is responsible about 80 of performance so and again you want to do three and you do not want to upload the original video back in here so like this was the original video and here's our three new videos and i'll show you guys really quick let's see let me turn this off and let me add in a url really quick here we go there we go so exact same video just new hook right here and you can see right here i got three versions exact same length because they're exact same video with just different hook on each so first thing i want to text now what i also want to do is i want to pull in the existing winning copy so here's existing winning copy we're going to pull that in we're going to add that as the primary text and we're going to pull in the existing winning headline okay order now and get free shipping oh we made a mistake we forgot to change the call to action to shop now but that's also something else you want to do all right so you have three videos you have the winning copy and the winning headline now you want to add in a new primary text as well so that way you can also test new primary text if you have no new primary text to test on an iteration so like this is an iteration right here we're doing if you have no new primary text to text that's okay you don't need to add it in but if we're testing a whole new concept then i would likely want to add in a new primary text as well so just kind of depends on the scenario right there if it's a whole new concept we never tested this concept before i would add in a primary test uh text to test if uh we're just doing an iteration on something we already know works i likely probably want to add in our primary text or a new headline we'll just use the existing one that worked well so sometimes it's three two two three new creatives two primary text two headline and sometimes it's three new creatives or three creative iterations with one primary text one headline that just we know it works already so just being completely transparent with you guys on how that works and what we'll do is we'll just go ahead and publish this and we'll let this dct run about seven days every week we upload one to two new dcts into this campaign and our objective here is to find a new dct that works at scale so let's just go back to that prospecting really quick that we created forest today and you guys can see we uploaded this new dct i don't know why it's learning because i put it as 12 a.m my bad but yeah so you know that's our original top performer our goal with the dct is to beat that best performing that's it if we never beat it because it doesn't get much spin that's not because oh this is performing really good and facebook doesn't want to spin on this it's hey this is weaker compared to this and this doesn't deserve the spin and that's totally okay guess what we're going to turn it off so we test two new dcts a week if they don't if they don't take panjartia spin we turn them off and i'll actually show you guys and let me turn this off really quick just because i don't actually want to run this i'm going to show you guys an actual ad account really quick so here's another ad account we're actively spending on we're spending about twelve thousand dollars a day here let me show you guys yesterday thirteen thousand dollars a day so let me click inside of this we built this campaign exactly the same and come in here so here you know you can see this out of our main and we found new winning dcts so dynamics and we've been working on this campaign now since literally all the way back in april i think it was like april 1st was our first one we launched yeah so you can see right there 104 is one of our first ones and stuff like that and you know we've tested now i think 80 dcts you know in this particular campaign right here so we just keep looking to find more that work at skeletic majority of spin we run them for seven days we turn them off they don't perform well you can see 180 right here we launched this one i think tuesday tuesday through friday we didn't really see it much and then pretty much on saturday 180 took off got majority of spin i mean ten dollar cost per purchase we literally went from a 2.2 2.3 row ass with the store to a 3.5 i'm doing like 10k a day now in profit right there and you can see pretty much from friday or saturday till today so we're taking majority of spin within a couple days you know was that 13th through the 17th it's about four full days we spent 33 000 on that one concept one ad right there it's been doing really well so yeah that's pretty much how you go ahead and how we run facebook ads so identify those angles we create those ads run them in the cbo for seven days then every seven days we just launch two new dcts we run them for a week if they don't take majority of spin we turn them off and then we go to the next week now what we're going to do is we're going to keep looking at finding new winning ads and as we get good performance we just keep scaling by 20 that's it we keep it very simple we keep it very repeatable that's how all my students do this all of my clients do this and we've been running this structure now for about two years and we've been seeing amazing performance inside of the facebook ads and stuff like that so i think the only way you can go wrong with this is a you run ads for seven days you don't see any results you get discouraged and you try to go find something else which you know all of our focus here is to create the creative is what is the king that's what creates the impact in the business so you know we're testing one to two new dcts it's about three to six new creatives every week about 24 creatives a month and a lot of you guys are testing like three creatives getting discouraged and then boom you're done you quit so that's also another thing make sure you're testing like you have enough budget to test for like 30 days don't just try to throw something up for like seven days blow your budget and have nothing to keep testing with so the likelihood of you finding a winning ad and set in the first seven days is very low so that's why we want to figure out what's getting most men what's giving us some success and we want to build off of that again that current ad right there is the standard or the control that we want to beat so a winning ad is not necessarily profitable in the beginning it's just something that's giving us purchases so like for example we have a target row as of 3x we're getting a 1x right now well the 1x is our current best result so our objective here is to beat that 1x then you find an ad that does 1.5 that's your new winning ad then our then we want to beat to 2x you know whatever your target bro ass is that's what you want to do you want to keep working your way up that ladder then once you start getting profitable ads then you can start spending more and more and more to where you can actually scale and grow the business itself so yeah guys hope you all enjoyed this video hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday if you have any questions drop them below in the
