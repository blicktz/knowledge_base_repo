2023 is finally here and there is a lot of exciting things that will be happening this year in the advertising space and i want to kind of go over my predictions of what's going to happen what do you need to do to prepare for yourself and what should you expect so if you're new to the channel again my name is nick terrio welcome back to the channel and hope you guys are having a great holiday time

ads for clients click link below for either one you know literally say like have nick terrio run your ads for you or um have nick terrio mentor you and we spend roughly around seven figures a month for facebook ads and uh we helped multiple brands call it seven figures a month in revenue so that being said make sure the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and let's dive into the video so 2023 it's uh gonna be an incredible year i'm really excited for this year because you know 2022 i spent a lot of time rebuilding a lot of our processes uh systems and stuff like that inside of the agency to where 2023 we're going in with the goal of optimization okay and what does that mean that means we've done a lot of work in 2022 to build a really amazing foundation that's working really well for us and now let's just go turn the knob on a few different things that's going to improve the output of those things so here we already have the foundation you know here's how for example i like to make this this analogy all the time me and you both know if i take get in this car and i get in it i can drive from point a to point b okay now with optimization we spent the whole year figuring out how to go from point a to point b okay now we know we have a solid route to go from point a to point b now with optimization is is is that the best route and can we do it faster can we do it better can we do it with less gas yada yada yada to where we truly know we have the best one boom boom boom so yeah so that's basically we're doing in 2023 but that's not what you you guys are here for you guys are here for my kind of predictions and things like that so first thing i just have to address is this ever you know expanding market right now of ai technology okay so there's a lot of ai stuff that's coming around and you know quite frankly some pretty good shit that's happening right now with you know chat gpt um you have like jasper.ai which automatically writes copy for you you have a few different creative tools now it's where you literally just type in a few things and then boom you get creatives just pumped out for you and these tools are quite frankly are very powerful and um they're really going to be helping a lot of people in this marketplace now there's also a lot of people that are like holy shit every copywriter every visual creator is going to be like you know running and losing their jobs and yes i do agree at some extent but also no okay and let me explain so the cool thing about ai technology is that ai technology it can grow it can learn it can improve itself and it can do things for you okay the problem with ai technology though is that it doesn't have that high level thinking yet i say yet okay one day it will but yet it's still like learning it's still improving and it's you know it's like it's the difference between like a teenager who like you know let's just say for example you learn how to fish for the first time it's like cool i got this and there's this there's this theory right there of where it's like um i forgot what the law is called but you know when you learn something your confidence improves okay and then all of a sudden you learn something new and your confidence drops okay so let's say for example you go fishing for the first time you throw your line in oh i know how to throw a line now i got this your confidence super high because you can throw a line in now but then it drops when you don't catch anything then you learn that the spot you fish at dictates the place that you know you fish okay and then also your confidence shoots back up as you start catching fish but then like it keeps going up and down over time so with ai right now it's like it just learned how to start fishing it just started learning how to throw a line in okay but it doesn't know how to make those other high level thinking of oh well is this the best spot to fish is this the best line and bait to use all my hook to catch this type of fish i want okay ai just knows how to kind of like throw in the line and so far now do i see it improving oh yes i definitely see it improving and the way we're leveraging ai for like my copywriter my visual creator is it's giving them a foundation to start off with so when you have that like creative block for example let's say i need to write some copy boom boom boom you type it up and then you shoot you know you get all information to ai you throw all your ideas down ai kind of takes it and it puts you like a rough draft okay you could more than welcome take that rough draft and push it out and it's going to do better than probably 90 of the average markers on the market but for the high level markers the people that really know how to run ads correctly that's where that other 10 of effort is going to make the difference between this account making a hundred thousand dollars to a million dollars this year or making a couple thousand dollars this year okay so that is my next thing it's if you are average or subpar when it comes down to marketing copywriting things like that yeah you're shit out of luck like you you better hope your your clients don't start learning about these ai tools and start leveraging themselves now if you are an amazing marketer keep fucking growing and keep advancing your skill set because yes you might be at a level now where it's like hey ai still can't beat me but one day it will if you keep up with that mindset of ai can't beat me so understand that ai can't beat you now but it will at one point so i need to keep growing i need to keep surrounding myself with higher level markers and keep growing my skill set so that's very important right there so that's my theory on ai hey it's there it's doing okay job it's probably doing a better job than majority of markers that just getting into the marketing world but it's still not better than advanced marketers who have been able to generate really good results for clients i would leverage it as simply a tool as a foundation to start getting you like started on a project so definitely still use it get it to use like you know get you started on a project and then apply your high level marketing tactics to basically improve the results you get from it to maybe hey you get some coffee that might generate you ten thousand dollars to now hey i tweaked that ten thousand dollar copy to make it me a hundred thousand dollars now so that's where the higher level marketing plays out um if you look at it from a perspective of like just think really really high like tv commercials and stuff think about the super bowl tv commercial okay the super bowl tv commercial you know you might pay a couple million dollars for that 30 second mark okay so they're not just paying any average joe blow just to go spend 30 minutes creating that concept and then boom and then here's what they should run they're they're paying that you know guy who or girl who puts together a commercial for a super bowl a fuckload of money to get it right one time see that's something i've learned the difference between a professional and an amateur is that professional practices they in and out to get it right every time whereas an amateur might get it right but they don't have a hundred percent uncertainty of getting it right every single time okay so that's something i would look at that's my prediction today ai tool it will get better it is already better than most marketers now but if you have a fear and you have a paralysis of just not taking action because you're scared of this yeah it will overcome you but if you work your ass off and keep growing as a marketer and working with this ai tool it can be amazing asset to cut down your workflow and stuff like that and also another thing too it's still reliant on a lot of your input to get you a quality output so an amazing marketer using this ai tool is going to be able to get substantially better output than an average person because an average person would just be like hey give me some copy for this microphone to sell with a facebook ad whereas a really good facebook marketer would be like you know give me copy that you know sells the reason why you should buy this xlr microphone over every other xlr microphone on the market because they've properly identified the market sophistication they've identified that that people have already gone and purchased other microphones before so now we need to position this one's the better one than above those because we're not trying to purchase for a first time a microphone buyer so you see it's just going to be a tad difference right there so that's my predictions on ai all right now the second thing we have to look at too is the facebook scope changes and things like that okay so with facebook we we have to realize is that they're pushing more and more every day to go broad okay if you go look at look likes if you look like at interest targeting and things like that they already have that little you know it used to be a box now it's completely auto enabled of automatic expansion okay they have to look likes and interest okay now they have custom audiences custom audiences when you use a custom audience now it has a box okay interest and look like both had these boxes as well now they have been removed i'm looking at facebook to go ahead and start to remove custom audiences not necessarily by removing them but by removing their targeting potential by making custom audience expansion mandatory now we just recently ran a test right here where we used a custom audience on black friday for one specific account and we did retargeting in that perspective right there and we were only able to spend like four or five thousand dollars with these specific retargeting ads okay with a budget that has like 15 to 20k a day over the course of like six seven days okay so it had the potential to spend somewhere over a hundred grand but only spent about 5k of that total budget okay now we just recently ran some new ads with christmas same structure same concept but with audience expansion is on and guess what we were to spend 45 000 over five days and it became our new best performing ad account so facebook identified that hey the custom audience expansion these you know turn on it allowed facebook to do its own work and really figure out who is going to get the best performance with these ads whereas when we had custom audiences off or custom audience expansion off facebook was purely reliant on what we gave them and due to that it had to use ship poor custom audiences and it couldn't figure out anything that worked and we couldn't really spend a lot so due to that i do find that custom audiences expansion will be automatically on by the end of the year not because of the results but because of history of history of what facebook with it interest and history of what facebook did with lookalikes and now people are realizing that when they trust facebook like they used to just be this trend and um this trend of if you're making like if you you know just getting we start with facebook ads and only spend a couple hundred bucks a day like there used to be a trend that's you versus facebook whereas now we look at facebook as a trusted business partner and we look at facebook as working with us and ever since we've adopted this belief that facebook is working with us we no longer sit down and like fuck you facebook yada yada yada screw you facebook you don't know what you're doing yada yada yada let us do our job now we're like okay facebook why didn't you spend money on this ad okay so then we ask that question and we look at those ads i'm like oh wow i understand why those ads look like shit compared to the top performing ad so yeah so we look at facebook as trusting with us um we leverage broad targeting don't use any retargeting recently we just did as a test to test like audience expansion on our custom audience expansion that's purely it but yeah so i do look forward to facebook further filtering out people who do interest targeting look likes and stuff like that so if you haven't adapted to broad targeting yet and you're still averaging look likes and you're still averaging interest and you're still averaging custom audiences i would look at switching over to broad okay now if you are questioning well nick how do i do that look it's simple just start designating 10 a day or 20 a day of your budget okay let's say you're spending a thousand dollars a day we're going to designate 200 bucks a day to specifically broad targeting and you want to continue to invest in broad targeting and make it work for your accounts okay now when i say make it work for your account keep testing new ads against it until it becomes profitable you might have to test 100 different ads because you're not that great at building ads let's just be honest here and that's what it takes to get it working then do so but your ability to create high converting ads will completely dictate the performance of broad targeting if you cannot build good ads then that's going to slow down your goal of becoming purely you know unreliant on interest and look likes and just doing broads targeting okay all of our accounts run broads targeting we have accounts spending consistently 15 to 20k a day we have accounts spending 15 to 100 bucks a day we leverage broads targeting for all of them we do not do retargeting i have a full 20 30 minute video on why we don't do retargeting just look up my channel literally uploaded like a week ago okay very simple so i'd be really focused this year on broad targeting i'd be focused on leveraging some of these ai tools and stuff like that to be able to help you improve your ability and then lastly it's the same thing every year every year more and more brands start to expand on facebook um which is going to create more competition if you're not building a brand that's going to like serve for the next years to come next decade for example then you're going to be severely leaving money on the table okay what do i mean by that so what i'm noticing here is that there's too many businesses that are purely reliant on performance on facebook okay if i don't hit a 3x on facebook today i won't hit a 3x for us overall i won't be profitable yada yada okay your objective here is that you want to build a brand that's going to serve the next decade so how do you do that well you do that by improving your customer retention side okay if you improve your customer retention side you can be less reliant on facebook performance and because of that because you're having a good flow of new customers on a daily basis but also existing customers on a daily basis being less reliant on facebook performance will allow you to keep growing the brand without worrying about facebook performance because you have a mixture of new customer and existing customer revenue on a daily basis some of our brands doing six and seven figures a month literally do a 1x on facebook a 3.5x overall and it's a good blend between new customer revenue from facebook and existing customer revenue coming in on a daily basis from repeat buyers now when you're creating repeat buyers this is why i say you want to brand that last the next decade because you want to keep evolving launching new products launching better versions of your current products now look at apple just look at apple and really study apple apple number one has their core products their iphone their macbook their mac pro and then they have their like ipads and ipods okay then they have you know their accessory line of of um you know like the magic mouse the magic keyboard um the airpods all these other little tools and stuff as well then they have new versions of these core products that come out every year so they're constantly getting you to buy either new products or better versions of the existing products and you want to consistently focus on this because what's going to happen is that facebook as as the years come facebook's going to get more competitive over and over and as facebook gets more competitive it's going to have higher advertising costs so you no longer can get a 10 cost per acquisition you need a 20 cost per acquisition now the problem that creates is that that all of a sudden that decreases your efficiency on facebook and when that decreases it decreases your performance overall but if you've been doing your job and building a solid retention plan into your business you don't have to worry anymore about that cpa on facebook you can spend more at a lower cost i mean i like a like a lower like performance rate in that sense right there and not be worried because what's going to happen is is that your retention will be so good that you'll still hit your overall kpis you'll still be growing the business but you'd be less reliant purely just on facebook and this is my last prediction if you're still stuck in that that realm of hey i only have one product you're purely reliant on new customer revenue every day it's a lot harder to build a business like that and scale that business to 10 million dollars a year or even you know a million dollars a year yeah well you can scale it's a million dollars a year no problem at all it's that 10 million dollar range that you want to go to it's extremely difficult and also to the longevity that business is gonna be a lot less if you just have one product and that's all you're focused on you need to focus on building a brand that's going to serve and actually create an impact over the next decade and that's going to that separates a lot of the business owners that we talk to on a daily basis i turn down so many clients on a daily basis because they do not have that mentality their goal is hey nick i have this you know little car right here and you know it's just a random product i found drop shipping i scaled it up to 10k a day now performance is dropping can you come in our business i'm like no the performance is dropping because it's a trendy product for a week now it's not hot anymore whatever okay i want people that want to build the brand i want to work with people that i want to build the next apple that perspective right there they're very passionate they're selling and they have a long-term plan ahead with new products new better versions that are products extending their ltv and their retention rate and all that because that's going to create the better brand that's going to survive the next 10 20 30 years versus a lot of you guys who have brands that last literally like maybe a couple weeks and that's it they're off the ground so so yeah guys that's my predictions and things looking at 2023 like i said number one leverages ai tools to help you out with getting you started and getting moving forward don't fear yet they're not coming for your job yet but if you let that mentality of hey i don't have anything to worry about run you then yes you will be on a job in the next couple years keep improving your marketing mindset and become irreplaceable next thing is focus more on broad targeting zero retargeting things like that as facebook will be moving to shift away from all that and go straight to prod and things like that in 2023 and lastly build a brand that can serve people for the next decade that will actually be memorable because these simple little pop-up shops they are not going to last long term focus on increasing your outs your ltv your retention things like that this is going to outlast rise in advertising costs and allow you to build a long-term brand so guys hope you enjoyed this video make sure to like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday that being said make sure you also check
