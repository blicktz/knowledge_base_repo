I'm finally facing it all, fearless Alright guys, welcome back to the vlog Currently experimenting with like a new little camera location I'm super hyped up with like all the different like area and room I have in here To actually record videos now because my old place I like have my bedroom slash office slash chill area So it was hard for me to set up like different lights and stuff in there So I'm actually excited now in multiple different locations I can put a camera, film in the office area So I can make some more videos and more content and stuff So hyped up with that I just finished kind of picking up the office a little bit Cleaning up a little bit through my little break So I have a few more minutes left for this video to render And this is actually the video you all watched yesterday So got that finished up And then we're going to jump into like a four hour work block from 12 to 4 Update on Phoenix's cage And you actually see he's burrowing in right now But I do want to actually go ahead and paint this I'm going to try to find some good paint that's like safe to where like it's not has it doesn't have a strong odor So now we have to worry about messing him up I can kind of leave him in there And it's not paint on top No big deal And also too I do want to get rid of this light I really like it but the practicality of it It's not bright enough Really I want to get an LED light strip And have it mounted back here So like It'll be like sitting up here But back here So that way it kind of like lights up the whole cage And it'll look a little better And also too kind of like remove just some of the clutter and stuff Make that look a lot better But that's just kind of later on Just some little updates Some little office things Overall my office is pretty much done Besides some paintings on the wall That's it Kind of like just keep it very plain Just really nothing in there No clutter It just allows me to work better with less distractions and stuff And yeah Alright Currently right now I am just doing some thinking time and stuff I am going over Just a few questions in terms like For the digital agency and stuff Of how I can make my clients more money In terms of Alright What psychological factors can I implement in the marketing What's some different ad angles I can create What's some different ad copyright I can create What are some stuff I've done Or I haven't done yet In terms of these For these specific clients So helping them out Trying to see how I can maximize their money Make them the most bang for their buck So Currently sit down right now For the next few hours Working on this I still have some LinkedIn outreach to do For the agency Probably budget about an hour and a half for this Then I have another like two hours Or another hour to do More like the LinkedIn outreach terms Like that Good morning guys Currently sipping on some greens right now It absolutely stormed last night So Need to check on the new chairs And Not sure If they're still there But let's check it out Because the wind was pretty bad Let's see Oh There's one Trying to Push you up the way Out there too Okay cool So Yeah the wind was really bad last night But Luckily I was scared It would be Somewhere out there Alright we're good So yeah I did pick up two chairs Now for the apartment These were literally like 16 bucks At Target I was going to get some more expensive ones But I was like You know what Is it perfect? It's metal It's awesome Over to the pond Here Nice day So for today's video topic I wanted to talk about Morning rituals I think it's something That's very commonly discussed In the entrepreneur community Everyone believes That you need to have This Million dollar Morning ritual To You know If you want to achieve success You need to have A two hour morning ritual You need to do All kinds of stuff Before you get to work And I Already All these crazy Different routines And stuff So I wanted to talk to you guys Today about My morning ritual As I'm getting back on it It's been You know Since I've moved To apartments Since last Thursday I pretty much Haven't really been Focusing on morning ritual Besides like Maybe cold showering And journaling But My overall Morning ritual Just to Give you an insight On that Is currently Right now I'm Waking up I'm just waking up Around nine And ten o'clock In the morning Whereas I do want to try to get that Back to about seven o'clock So that we can have More time Throughout the day To get a full work block in Next thing Is I jump straight Into a cold shower After a cold shower Brush my teeth Get dressed And the typical stuff Then jump into A morning meditation Then after the morning meditation I take my morning supplements And then I do a journal So the whole thing From start to finish Takes about Forty five minutes To an hour Depending on how Fast I'm moving Usually No more than an hour And also Two I do fast Fast So I don't Eat right when I wake up And I really love it For the performance benefits I feel like I work a lot better On a Fasted stomach As when I have a lot of food in me It does two things One I have to fix the food So it takes more time For me to fix the food In the morning Two After I eat I kind of crash So if I wake up Do all this stuff Eat Then crash My first hour To two hours In the morning It's really not as productive As if I am Fasted So I usually fast The first six hours Six hour workbook In the morning So going into Morning rituals I've tried Everything Home of the sun I've tried waking up Straight to working out To You know Blah blah Eating Showering Etc I've tried everything Me personally I believe You need to You do need to Try a lot So that way You can figure out What works best For you As I feel like You know Me personally At this time In my life Waking up To a straight To a gym In the morning Is not something Well obviously For the quarantine I can't do But even before The quarantine I still prefer I feel like I live better Towards the end Of the day I feel like Get a bunch of food In me I'm more awake Me personally I also like To get straight To work In the morning So I don't like To have a long Morning ritual It takes a lot Of time You know I mean I think Just between A cold shower Meditation That right there Takes a lot Of time Obviously Taking supplements Is nothing Journaling Takes five minutes I was writing A few notes So overall I'm happy With what I got And through My experience I feel like You need to Test different things Figure out What works best For you Also too I don't believe In waking up Super early And trying to Get a bunch of Work done I feel like I did that At one point I used to Wake up like 4.30 5 o'clock Get a bunch of Work done In the morning But I would Only get about 4 or 5 hours Of work done Before I crash And really Not get much Else done After that So it's better To get your Full mile of sleep And only give Yourself 4 to 6 hours To do as much Work as possible And during that Time period You can be a lot More optimal With your time Versus say Waking up at 4.30 in the morning And working 10-12 hours a day And like your First 4 hours Can be productive And your last Few hours You're just gonna be You know Fucking around All day So You do need to Be cautious About that You know Give yourself 4 hours 4 hour work block Try to get as much Done in that 4 hour work block Optimize the hell Out of that 4 hour work block Don't talk on your Phone Put your phone Away You know Focus purely On what matters In that 4 hour work block And then slowly Start to extend it After you get Your performance Down During that time period So And in terms of Journaling in the morning Pretty much what I do Is I Go over Like You know Very very simple What I'm thankful For that morning Some My goals Affirmations My You know Today would be great If this happened And then my to do list That's it It's nothing Nothing crazy Very very simple journal So Yeah Hope you guys Enjoyed this video I just wanted to Talk about Morning ritual
