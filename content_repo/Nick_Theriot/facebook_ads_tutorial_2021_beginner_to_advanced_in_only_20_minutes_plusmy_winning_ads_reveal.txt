yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys where I'm actually going to take you through a full tutorial on how to create a Facebook ad campaign this will be specifically for people using Shopify people running e-commerce advertising and you know how to set up a proper cold advertising campaign before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit the subscribe button for new videos just like this one every other day let's get started so step number one is obviously making sure you have your creatives in place and your copy in place before you actually launch the ads manager so I like to do all my planning in Google Docs I'll go and I'll create ad copy I'll get creatives whether I need to go shoot product creatives give my clients to shoot product creatives or whatever however you get product creatives you want to get your product creatives and you want to get your ad copy together I recommend starting out having about three to four key pieces of ad copy and three to four key pieces of creatives you can use inside your first few dummy ads so let's dive into my computer I'm actually going to show you some ad copy I created just for this video for a winning product that's worked extremely well for us this is one of my client accounts this is a real product this is not a drop shipping account this particular product right here I have the direct link to the manufacturer so for this client there my client is the manufacturer so you know we can scale very aggressively with these type of products and stuff it's custom still signs so it's a very niche product and very very hard to actually replicate just because it's you have to have access to a custom laser machine all that good stuff but anyway enough about me let's dive into the video so again get your ad copy on that first setup before you actually go ahead and create the campaign before you even touch the ads manager itself so this is the ad copy I got right here just something pretty cool it's for this little metal infinity sign right here where people can customize their names this is one of the creatives I got in terms I can use to really promote it really establishing that factor if I'm giving it to you know a wife my wife you know I'm giving it that's that's what we're trying to establish with this ad copy so that's what we're establishing as well in the creatives itself excitement on the face and everything just really trying to hit that core desire of making your loved one happy so I've actually done a lot of different angles advertising angles for this particular product and this is actually one I'm literally about to test after this video right here where instead of going after the the traditional factor of give this for a loved one now I'm going into more of a how to so how to surprise your wife five easy steps this will appeal to men specifically because it wants to surprise them it wants to put a smile on their face they have a core desire to make them happy so I'm grabbing attention first with the how to I'm immediately appealing to their core desires so my three key techniques for advertising is grab attention create desire and a reason to take action now so I'm grabbing attention I'm creating desire you know just further explaining in there you know further building the belief of social proof right here of a review in there then also a reason to take action now is I'm giving them a discount code and they have 24 hours to take this coupon code and use it for 10% of their order so I'm establishing more reason to take action now so I'm leveraging all three key pieces of my ad copy in order to you know really make an effective ad I got the creative really well put together so if you get all that put together in your creative that's going to make the difference between a really great creative and a really bad creative the same thing for our ads you know ad copy itself really good copy versus bad copy really establishes all this now the headline could be a lot better I could put something along the line of 10% off and actually you know putting the headlines whatever my offer is and then newsfeed description just further adds the the credibility and the legitimateness of this business of over 10,000 happy customers so all establishing key pieces of psychology in order to properly pre-frame the customer before they click on this ad here's the landing page for the product show you that guys right now super simple has some good really good reviews nothing crazy in terms of a whole bunch of pop-ups and stuff you know free shipping I got a little social proof app right here and a shipping date it's been working really well and a really clearly easy you know just really simple and these type of landing pages and websites perform way better than some of these websites I've audited before of a ton of stuff we clean all that up make it simplistic to take action and we convert way higher because it's easy to leverage so now once we get all that done make sure you have your pixel installed there's lots of videos on that setting up your pixel setting up your business manager it's not one of those videos we're gonna go straight into creating the advertising campaign now so we're gonna go inside right here we're gonna go hit create and we're gonna choose conversions campaign I don't care if it's a brand new ad account we've tested it from time and time again with clients the curve version campaign straight from the beginning has always performed from time and time again way better than people saying oh you need to run traffic campaign engagement campaign first run conversions campaign straight from the beginning now I'm gonna name this campaign I'm just gonna call it tofu for top of funnel because we're going out there completely cold audience we're not retargeting anyone in social engagement or website visitors we're going out there cold audience I'm just gonna do testing because it'd be our testing campaigns always the first campaign you set up before you start really spending so there's our testing campaign right here and then our ad set I'm just gonna call this uh we'll go after an open audience first always like to leverage an open and broad audience first before we start doing um you know some of the interests and the LLAs so I'm just gonna go in abroad first and then I'm just gonna call this a photo because we're using a photo ad and then I'll copy the first piece of ad copy right there so that way I have a key identifier of the actual particular ad itself so now um it's actually if you want to do campaign you know budget optimization no we do not want to do that at all and then it's going to take you right here which is the ad set name now you should have the conversion events right here yours might be on few content at the cart initiate checkouts or anything like that we want to make sure it's right there on purchase and what I want to do is the daily budget I recommend anything from ten dollars to forty dollars a day for the daily budget it really just depends on your budget but we want to make sure whatever daily budget we can do is we're doing we're gonna do at least five ad sets so five ad sets I'd say a forty dollar a day budget is a two hundred dollars per day for testing and we want to make sure we can run that for at least three days so that's six hundred dollars for our calculation so if you have a smaller budget so let's just say it's fifty dollars a day didn't do five ten dollar ad sets and again you're gonna run that for at least three full days without touching it so you're looking at somewhere spending around 150 dollars so I do forty dollars a day for all my testing ad sets reason why is I work with clients that spend multiple thousands of dollars a day even with high high budgets I still start off with a small daily testing budget because just the way Facebook works sometimes if you start off with a really high budget they think you can afford those high cost per acquisitions and they'll just keep feeding you you know shitty results so I like to start small and slowly scale up it's from time and time again it's worked extremely well for our clients so our software daily budget forty dollars right there again purchase conversion events now custom audiences you want to make sure you exclude 180 everything so 180 purchases 180 facebook engagement 180 day ig engagement 180 day website visitors we want to make sure this ad is being seen purely by cold audiences now for the age you know if you don't know your pure dim age demographic yet then go ahead and just leave this open since it's our broad ad set all we're looking for is age and gender in terms of targeting so I want to go ahead and do for this one um 21 around 21 to let's say about 55 years old works really well and we're targeting men now again that's because we have prior history for this particular product if you don't have that history then go ahead and just leave all of this open even if it's a male product leave it open for women because we'll tend to see women buyers purchasing the product because they're purchasing it for a significant other or something like that so let's keep going down um detail targeting expansion you know we can leave it on for this particular ad set because it's literally completely open but if I'm going to test the look like audience or interest always want to make sure this is turned off now I'm going to go right here to placements we're going to click on manual placements and we only want on the facebook and instagram now when you start off and you select automatic placements if facebook is giving getting the best results we'll still tend to see facebook with the most spin when we break it down on a deeper level so even if you don't select this it's not that big of a deal it won't be the biggest thing that's going to break your results you might see a five percent increase in ROAS if you leave it just as manual placements but it's not you know the in all be all type thing if you've been running automatic placements so nothing really to stress if you haven't now we also want to go here and show more options we're going to do attribution setting and we want to make sure it's on a seven day click so we're optimizing the ad based off the last seven days of clicks sometimes we've even seen a better optimization on a one day click now i know it's attribution but we have been seeing some interesting results testing seven day click versus one day click so that's why we do a one day click sometimes when we're testing new audiences or we're spawning off our best winners by creating new tested variations but just starting off with a seven day click now what i like to do is since we kind of went a little further into a demographic now is actually go ahead and you know deeper into the naming process so i'm just going to call this us since we're targeting just us and then i'm gonna do let's see we're doing 21 55 male and then we're doing broad open same thing all we're doing is just demographic targeting we're not doing any special interest targeting at all now i'm gonna click next and you make sure your instagram page and your facebook page is connected and we already have our you know our specific ad name for this particular ad now we go add media add image and you can actually do account images where you can already see the images on there you can go to page images if you want to pull an ad from one of your previous posts but because i want to just want to use one that is on our computer i'm just going to upload find a location it's not that difficult to do so got it uploaded and click next now make sure click done before you actually go live with this you want to go to edit media and honestly just optimize it for square and make sure it's perfectly centered exactly how you want i've been just noticing better because i have weird creatives turn like really weird optimization sometimes by facebook so i like to just optimize it for a square from immediately we have been seeing like what like four by fives perform a little better because it takes up more real estate on the screen but for this example we're just going to do a square optimization for the crop and stuff so now what you want to do is go ahead and copy your link to your website so this is it right here i'm just going to remove some of this extra stuff uh from when i was coming to the website ctrl c and paste it now for your primary text right here this is where we're going to go ahead inside here and we're going to copy that over so let's do boom ctrl c and paste and there you go and then also too i need to add the link so let me go back again boom and then there we go so right here um you can see it breaks so that's one thing i'm looking for right now is the page break so this is how it looks on the news feed and that's okay with me because the arrow is pointing down so that way it's making one of people to click more which is fine that's kind of what i want i want to drive and leverage that curiosity factor and get people to invest the time and attention to read more so that's looking pretty good right there i really like that now what we need to do is do the headline so i'm gonna go back over here personalized metal sign it's actually a tested and proven one for us so there's not nothing like new i'm gonna paste that right there personalized metal sign now description that's the newsfeed description and again i'm just gonna copy that right there ctrl c and paste that there we go so now how to surprise your wife in five easy steps put the biggest smile on our face with this one one simple strategy and people are gonna click that um and you can even kind of do a little bit more click bait let's see if we can bring that up a little bit yeah no okay cool so we're gonna have to leave that so we have that page break because again we want to get people to click on see more so sometimes we have to leverage some type of curiosity to get them in there now we're gonna do our call to action always put shop now you can test other variations learn more and stuff like that if you want to make it less direct but that all looks good so there you go that's as simple as it gets let's scroll down real quick and we want to make sure our pixels select it properly and then let's see sometimes i like to just kind of view it on other variations and stuff but that all looks good so i'm gonna hit publish and that's it that's as simple as it is to go ahead and create an ad campaign now that's not the final step though because now we do need to test some other variables here we're basically locking down one audience the broad we're assuming that someone's gonna work and we're not testing anything else two we're only testing one creative so what you can do is you can go ahead and create we've been seeing three creatives uh work the best so three ads inside of your ad set so let me show you example right here i would go ahead and let's go back to our ad set so this is the one we just created let's open that up you're assuming you know putting all your eggs in this one particular basket and i do hundreds of coaching calls and this is literally the same for every ad account that's spending less than probably 300 a day something some type of barrier between that zero to three hundred dollar a day spin of people just not you know opening up their minds a little bit more and testing more and that's totally okay that's totally okay so new everything so um that's why you're here to learn more so we want to test at least three creatives starting out so um what we can do is we can with and what i recommend is doing three completely different angles of approach for your particular product three different ways you sell your product you have your one product three different ways so um how to surprise your wife in five easy steps i can also do give your loved one something to remember another one that worked super well for us for this particular product is surprise your sweetheart you can leverage a testimonial you can leverage a strong benefit first and you can also leverage like a strong pain point first so you can test different angles in which you promote your product i just recommend three creatives and then on the flip side also have three different pieces of either a video or a photo so my other two ads will have two completely different creatives so i can do a video of these this particular product in a different setting another one can maybe be a video testimonial or influencer holding the product so i'm testing a whole bunch of just completely different variables to really give the system different things to test if i would just go duplicate this ad two times and just change the the picture then i'm limiting myself of this being a bad piece of ad copy and that being the reason why i'm held back so make sure you test three completely different ads um starting out just boom three completely different ads to make it simple so i'm just gonna go ahead and duplicate this two times so we just hit ctrl d and then i'm hit ctrl d one more time there you go so let's just assume i went ahead and added new copy in new creatives heck you can even do different headlines as well maybe even test a few different offers so let's just assume that now let's go back to the ad sets because like i said i want to start off with at least five different ad sets so let's start abroad so i recommend at least one broad for everyone you'd be surprised of how many times i've ran a broad creative on an ad account with zero smith and actually perform better than some of the look likes interest and all that stuff no sure not clue why but it worked so let's go with broad and then we're gonna do two interests so for this particular one right here i'm gonna go ahead and i'm just gonna duplicate it so i'm duplicating the first one so we don't have to go ahead and keep creating new creatives and stuff and all that i'm gonna go right here to detail targeting i'm gonna turn detail targeting expansion off and then i'm gonna do romance i know this is one that's worked really well for us from time and time again in this particular ad account uh just because it's romance it's love it's people who's probably looking at like different sweetheart things for their loved one so just in that specific niche that mushy niche and then i'm just gonna copy and paste that right here there we go so i have one interest except we're gonna shoot for two interests right there and then i'm gonna do is for my third one i'm gonna go ahead and do uh i'm gonna do in a relationship so the reason why i'm doing in a relationship is because this is men and it's a product specifically marketed to surprising your wife so let's go ahead and do that love so let's go in a relationship boom and then also to again turn off targeting expansion that cheeky little thing keeps keeps wanting to come on now we got our two interests let's go for two look-alike audiences now i want to go extremely different for each one so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna do a website visitors for one if if you have a you know newer ad account you're probably going to do website visitors if you have an older ad account you can maybe test purchases if you're getting at least 100 purchases a week then i would go maybe with purchases and stuff like a 180 but i'm gonna do a website lla 1 and then let me see what i have saved already so i want to make sure remove the interest turn that off and then i'm gonna do 180 website i think i have a 180 website let's see let's just do website visitors there we go uh let's do 30 days right there and then lastly let's do one completely different so let's do something more like maybe video views so if you're running some videos and stuff you could do a video views la 1 boom and then remove that and like i said i didn't do it in this video but make sure you have your exclusions on there we go i got a 50 percent 10 you know 10 look-alike audience for that example but see if i want one percent there we go so we have our intro video which is for this particular sequence on this particular ad account a few different videos and start enter a video to introduce people to the brand of what we do so there we go so we have four completely different audiences or two completely different llas because what will happen is once you start getting into website conversion events your purchase your view content your ads card and your initial checkout they have a high amount of audience overlap so you don't want to run all of those at once so you know i like to split up a few website ones a few social engagement ones that way i'm testing completely different ways of which facebook builds those look-alike audiences now what i'm simply going to do is i'm going to publish that right there and what you want to do is you want to run this for at least three days so from the moment these ads go live because they can go and review for a period of time from the minute those ads go live set a timer for three days and do not touch it so you make sure you have the spin and all that that's okay so we can spend that on testing make sure you have that set aside spend this for three days and do not touch it you're going to get some data back and that's where you're going to make your key decisions okay what ads performed the best let's do more like that what audiences did the best let's do more like that so what you want to do is you want to kill the ad sets that performed bad so you know whatever and and you may you may not get some purchases and that's totally okay because it might be more to the puzzle might be some stuff with your website maybe some stuff with your product maybe it might be some stuff with your ad copy but whatever one performed the best in terms of you know highest event so if you got one with like 10 ads of cards and and everything else nothing and that one that one with 10 ads cards didn't get any purchases now let's see what we can do to further tweak it because it may just be more something with the funnel versus the actual ad itself because we know that people are resonating with it people are click on it they're adding to cart so you want to look at the the core results view content add to cart purchases and see which one has the best of the highest event in the funnel then what you want to do is you want to double down on those test some more creatives keep testing new audiences you should be testing new audiences all the time and then what you can do is you can start increasing the spin by 20 percent once a day as long as your lifetime roas is above your your kpi your immediate goal so this is the easiest way for anyone to really start facebook ads and stuff and what you can do is if you do see bad results on a particular ad set uh you can just turn off the creative so if you like if we go back here let's say for example we have a lifetime roas of like 1.3 and our kpi is 2.5 and we look at it and we see all the spin was on like one with like a horrible roas another two with some really great roas then we're going to turn off that particular ad and let those run a little bit more so when you're analyzing your data make sure you look further into it and actually look at some of the deeper stuff in terms of like what creatives are responsible for that particular return on ad spin now if you want to scale further you got some really amazing results in that period of time i do have some videos on the channel you're more than welcome to check out let's go more than further advanced scaling but starting off is just really establishing those immediates of testing some few different audiences and testing a few different creatives and really narrowing down on those creatives and self really creating some strong creatives because those are
