I'm finally facing it all, fearless Yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel today I got a cool video I just got a new ghost scryable of supplements and stuff So I wanted to just simply unbox it for you guys We'll taste test it and I'll let you know what you guys think I got some of their new nut and butter protein powder Different pre-workout and then some aminos and some of their newest product size So we got a few different products in here I really want to try And let's get to it guys So ghost, a little bit about ghost Ghost has been probably one of my favorite brands to get supplements from Essentially since over the past year I got into them And at first I thought they were just over hyped and stuff You know they had a lot of influence from marketing and stuff like that Which is not bad but sometimes it just seemed too good to be true As many people are talking so good about it All these big influencers also had a really big discount code So I was pretty skeptical at first trying it Then about a year ago I was like you know what I'm going to try it for a hundred bucks I can get aminos, pre-workout, and protein So here is the Welch's grape amino acids I have the Welch's grape pre-workout and absolutely love it So super stoked to try the amino acids Let's see we got the size and the size is lime And again I don't really know everything that goes into size It has creatine in it and a few other muscle building components So we'll see how that goes Then we got sour watermelon pre-workout I tried the green apple sour warhead and absolutely amazing I'm a big fan of the sour heads and stuff And then we got a few things in here So next thing we got is Nutter Butter The peanut butter lover cookie Protein powder right here So this is their newest flavor It just dropped, I bought it on opening day Then we got a hat I have a ton of hats by Ghost And then, check this out They have included some Nutter Butter cookies in there So that's pretty cool I definitely may have a Terri I'm on a diet right now so I can't eat these But thank you guys for the extra cookies and stuff So let's get this out the way So let's show you guys Let's start off with We'll save the best for last So I guess we'll just do like a typical taste test real quick From like you're starting off You're probably going to want to do your You know Your pre-workout starting off Or Let's do the size first So we'll do a size test Taste test first This is the line This is probably something you drink maybe midday or something It doesn't have like any like Pre-workout formula in it Oh no it does Okay So you would actually want to take this size with your pre-workout Because that has beta allean in it And if you don't know what beta allean is Beta allean is the stuff that kind of makes you itch Or tingle or pre-workout So you definitely want to take this with like this And your pre-workout together But I'll try each one separately So pop it open So let's see I want to do a full scoop So I'm just going to do a little bit Just enough to you know You know Taste Taste So Pour a little bit of water This is the size And it's lime flavor You know how bad that would be if I accidentally spilled this inside here Let me just close that just in case I do have to say their lime tastes absolutely amazing It tastes exactly like lime Lemon lime Gatorade So if you're a big fan of lemon lime Gatorade I've had their lime aminos before Tastes amazing And their lime size tastes exactly the same flavor A plus on that goes So again the size is like your muscle building components It has some Beta-aline in it Some protein in it Epic action Some stuff I can't say But Yeah And it's apparently a muscle builder question But now we're going to go to the Warheads pre-workout This is the sour watermelon Which I'm super super excited about Let me open that Alright I don't want to do a lot of this Because I'm already like Revive consumption of caffeine today But Do the same thing So this is the sour watermelon Oh wow That tastes good So it's a warhead flavor Sour watermelon But it tastes exactly like a watermelon Jolly Rancher Mmm That's been good So I'm going to mix those two Not going to mix it right now But tomorrow for my workout I'm going to mix those two together And we'll see how that tastes So now let's dive into the amino acids So this is something amino acids should take During your workout Oh wow that's so good So I have the Welch's Great pre-workout And The thing about it Is the grape flavor with a bit of like a little bit of sourness to the end of it because it's pre-workout so I was like all I don't know other stuff in it but this is just super smooth grape now for the finale let's do the big one the nutter butter protein batter so let's dive into this let's just see I really don't even know what to expect on this one um I'm a big I was a fan of all their protein powders but to be honest uh I'm a huge mint chocolate chip person and I've been loving the mint chocolate chip from isosurge but all of ghost's protein powders are super good um that I've tried so far it's really a strong peanut butter smell so I wanted it to be like their peanut butter protein they have right now that's also really good all right here we go nutter butter nutter butter ghost protein powder so I'm gonna put too much water but it is exactly like nutter butter it tastes exactly they have like nutter butter crumbs in it I would say it's good I'd go for it it's it's not as strong of a taste I was expecting I was expecting a really strong taste to it I guess let's just try all these but overall good I would definitely buy it again and I don't have a affiliate code to give you my honest opinion here um cool I find a lot of pre-workouts I have used especially like cellucor black market labs um I don't know all these other insane names I use a pre-workout for like a month by these brands and then like the next month it's like I don't feel anything whereas ghost I've been doing pre-workout every month uh I mean I took a little break during quarantine but for every month for about a year now it still feel like the same every time like I haven't gotten used to their pre-workouts so which is super good and they're not overly compelling so like it's a moderate amount of caffeine it's 200 milligrams which is typical for all of them which I know like cellucor has our black market hat labs I think it's black market labs have stem which has 400 milligrams of caffeine in one scoop of pre-workout I think that's what it's called can be wrong and I'm super over compelling whereas these are pretty moderate but also at the same time pretty strong and I enjoy them a lot so highly recommend the ghost products and again I have affiliate code to use um you can go find like I know like Christian Guzman I use his code it's just CG at checkout you get 20% off your whole order uh so this whole order was like 160 did 20% off got 30 something dollars off then I had like 10 dollars in shipping so um highly recommend all these products if you're trying to find good products to use or if you've been wondering what type of pre-workout and what type of products I take uh this is pretty much everything I take around the fitness area and I have some other products for mental performance I could do a full video on and stuff but highly recommend all of these and I'll see you guys later peace
