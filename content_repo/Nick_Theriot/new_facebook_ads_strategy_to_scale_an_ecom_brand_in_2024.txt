new facebook ad strategy you need to be using in 2024 if you want to scale your brand what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today we'll be going over the exact facebook ad strategy that we're leveraging in 2024 how we plan on running our account what's the ways we're testing creatives and how we plan on scaling the account moving forward so let's get right into it you know a couple clients that we've actually leveraged this far men's clothing brand we've helped them go from 380 grand a month to about 1.8 million dollars a month leveraging this strategy a wall art brand that we took from 1.130 thousand dollars a month to 1.1 million dollars per month i'm leveraging this strategy the ambulance insurance for legion so you know out of e-com because this works for a variety of different you know like niches and stuff like that uh we're able to spend 4.5 million for them in 2022 and you know they were spending about a thousand dollars a day at the time so from a thousand dollars a day it's like 10k a day and using this strategy as well so what we'll be going over today uh what is this new strategy how to deploy it how to manage it and how to scale your account so why am i credit with teaching this obviously besides the the results and everything like that you know results speak for themselves let's just move forward new strategy so what this is is number one it's basically making the account simpler to manage and easier to manage it's relying on facebook's algorithm ai if you want to call it that i hate that word now because everyone puts it on front of everything and then using that to scale faster and next focusing on creating better ads that scale now the way you want to set your ad account up is you want to leverage one campaign per business objective so for us we have one campaign per country we have one campaign if we have like a unisex brand where it means like both male and female buy from the brand but uh they buy the same shirt like for example if i'm selling a shirt that both like it's unisex where anyone can wear it boy or girl then we'll have like one campaign but like let's say if we have like a women's collection and a men's collection we'll have like a women's collection campaign and a men's collection campaign right there for a supplement brand we're just pretty much tossing all the supplements in the same campaign maybe we're testing products but like we don't need the product to work it's just we want to launch a new product and see if it works or not but we don't need it to work then i'll just toss in the same campaign but if we need the campaign to work as in like we have to have this other product to work and we need to invest into it then we'll create a new campaign for it let's see what else i'm trying to think of all these scenarios for you guys so i get these questions all the time in the comments below and i just want to help you guys fully understand it how we look at it from there another one is you know like maybe if we have like different types of products so like one's like a twenty dollar aov and one's like a two hundred dollar aov then obviously we're going to prioritize one in one campaign because of the drastic difference between the product prices and stuff like that but then again it's like only if we have to like i try to advertise as few as products as possible the fewer products you advertise the better your results because you'll be a lot more focused on one the biggest mistake a lot of people make is they try to advertise too many products and create like try like as soon as they learn about this one campaign structure they start creating one campaign for all kinds of crazy stuff it's like the fewer the better unless you're like advertising in multiple countries that's a different story now what we'll do here is we'll just go ahead and create uh and let me go back to this real quick this is a cbo campaign so like when you're creating that campaign make sure it's you know sales i do a manual campaign setup i do not do advantage plus campaign that's purely because advantage plus you know more prioritized it's like middle funnel bottom funnel traffic so your frequency shoots to the roof a lot faster which means it's not really good for long term maybe for short term but why are we thinking short term when we're trying to achieve long-term business goals so but yeah so regular sales campaign or manual sales campaign advantage campaign budget turned on so that way you can turn on we can add the budget the campaign level and then what we'll do is we'll have different ad sets and how many ad sets do you need to start off with one and you can have up to three three to four three to five live at a time we test two to three new ad sets a week and each ad set the only variable that's different is the creatives okay so what do i mean by that everything is running broad targeting which we'll show you in a second we're running dynamic creative turned on and what we're doing here is we're seeing what ad set is getting majority of spin i see this comment all the time well nick well that's not fair some creatives will get more spin than the others and it's like yes that's absolutely correct i'm not fair at all i want certain creatives to outperform and i want certain creatives to be punished because they're not performing well and they don't deserve a lot of spin so i'm totally okay with that if some creatives get more spin than the others there's a reason why certain creatives are getting more spin than the others and i would ask yourself the question is why 95 of the time it's a better creative it's better engaging it's achieving facebook's goals facebook can care less about your cost per purchase like facebook has no clue what your target cost per purchase is so i see people all the time nick it's getting more spin but it's not hitting my target cost per purchase why would facebook spend on it because facebook does not care about your cost per purchase it has no clue what your cost per purchase is for a target it cares about satisfying their customers which is like they're the people that are actually viewing these ads on facebook and it cares about their experience so if a lot of people are touching a lot of people are stopping the scroll and stuff like that on that particular creative it's going to get more spin secondly each creative takes its creates its own audience so even though you're doing broad targeting each creative creates its own audience based off the number of people that appeal to that particular creative so if you launch something that gets significantly a larger mass appeal facebook can spend a lot more in that than say something that has a very small mass appeals where facebook can't really spend much on it so just recap here one campaign per business objective cbo or advantage campaign budget we start off with one ad set up to three to five live at a time and we're testing two up to two new ad sets a week with the only differences is new creatives and i'm gonna go over all this again so again these new ad sets can be dynamic creative turned on here we are doing broad targeting age gender location one campaign or one country per campaign do not start expanding countries until you're doing at least 50 to 100 000 a month in one country first if you're drop shipping and just starting out just do united states okay yeah no custom audiences no interests or anything like that i'm only excluding purchase 30 days that's just because i don't want to keep hitting these same people out that they purchase with ads again and i'll only do 30 days because i want people to comment good about their products that they received on our ads if you're you know have a shit product and people are not liking it you deserve the hate in your comments on your ads because quite frankly you need to go build a better product because that's unethical for you to keep pushing that same product that's trashed and just ripping people off so um oh yeah i don't want people to see my ads because my product is shit fix your product you don't need to go fix the ads you need to go fix your product okay again broad targeting because every ad creates its own audience facebook has thousands of just different like i would say like it analyzes the ad and pulls thousands of data points from it and when it pulls these data points it starts to create audience segments from that ad and it goes and starts positioning that ad in front of people it's the same way if you go on like instagram reels right now or tiktok whatever your your personal poison is and you start scrolling and then maybe you see a gym video that pops up and you watch that full video now all of a sudden all of the the content is is like gym content and stuff like that same thing with ads right there someone starts watching some gym content on reels or like their stories or their feeds then guess what we're gonna start serving them gym ads and facebook is consistently auditing who likes the ad and who dislikes the ad now this is not the little like button this is hey they stopped the scroll and they engaged with the ad in terms of like watching the video or just checking out the comments and stuff like that it stopped the scroll it held their attention on that particular ad versus if they disliked it they're just scroll past it it's going to serve it more to people that scroll or that that like actually look at that ad and it's going to serve it to less people who dislike that and just scroll past it so just keep that in mind more people who stop in your ad the more people it's going to serve it to the more people scroll past it the less people it's going to serve it to and the algorithm is always learning and always improving so that's why i don't look at learning limited or active or learning it's always learning and this is just more proof in the pudding if you're a follower of the channel you've already seen this you know but essentially right here this is a creative right here with a male golfer in it that's getting majority male spin because it's a male golfer in it this one right here is a female golfer with majority female spin look at the difference here seventy six hundred dollars in spin and six hundred and seventeen dollars in spin this one has significantly more female why because we showed a female golfer now to be fair here it also has a male golfer in it or like male like spin that's just because it's a pretty girl playing golf what male would not pass that who's into golf as well both of these in the same ad set targeting broad targeting okay and the way we structure idct is three two two so what we do is we do three creatives two primary texts so one body copy one that's new and one existing winning body copy so whatever's worked really well for us previously on the ad accounts and same thing for the headline a new win a new headline and existing winning headline that way we can give these creatives these new creatives we positioned into the market we're giving these two chances to work we're testing them with copy we already know works and we're also testing new copy that kind of goes with that particular concept right there right so each one of these ad sets is a different dct that we've tested we turn them off again i only put like two testing at a time and i leave those running about three to seven days and i turn them off and i judge success by what gets majority of spin you can see right here this dct took majority of spin 973 dollars it's getting majority of spin you know it's no longer this broad ad set which we saw in a couple slides ago let's see here we go broad is taking majority of spin now guess what this one's taking majority of spin now keep in mind we've tested a couple others that did not work they did not take majority of spin this is not going to happen boom usually we see about one out of ten dcts take majority of spin to perform oh well nick is it just bad dcts yes it's bad dcts in the preference of its creatives that are bad the dct itself is simply just a hammer hammering a nail if you build the house incorrectly and it looks like shit you don't go blame the way you hammered the nail you go blame like the architect and how it was planned out and put together so if the dct does not work it's not the act of doing the dct it's not the ad account structure it's simply the fact that the creatives you put in were terrible and facebook is truthful with that and how do you know you're not really getting spin you're not really getting purchases and from there it's like okay cool we need to go back to a drawing board and figure out the type of creatives we need to create that's where i go do a lot of customer research and sometimes it's like you have even the right customer research it's just you're a bad at like writing hooks for example you're bad at writing copy maybe the type of creatives you're filming are just trash for example those are like the little things that we discuss in my inner circle my mentoring program and that's how i review creatives for my students and stuff like that to be able to give them that feedback to create ads that convert so if you're interested about that link will be below or maybe even want to like work with me and me come in and run all and create all your ads and stuff like that link below for that is down in the comments below so once we see what dct takes majority of spend we'll see an immediate impact on the business here's a good example right here this particular account uh when we saw that you know dct take majority of spend may 18th may 18th we saw revenue rose about 47 percent saw profit rise 155 percent and since then we've been able to scale this account now to literally doing about two million dollars in december of 2023 from here we can just start scaling up that cbo budget now that we're pushing more spend to that campaign and we can let that particular ad set just continue to crush and then uh from here this is just more of the managing aside uh we'll still launch two to three new dcts every seven days really just kind of comes down to this like if we find a strong winning ad we don't technically need to test new winning new dcts until we hit a point where it's like okay cool you know performance is like dipping so what i mean by that is like we start we start scaling we're pushing hard and stuff like that and then we don't test any new dcts for a couple weeks then it's like okay we're stuck at 10 grand a day in revenue cool is there anything new we can test that'll improve that or do we need to build the business differently you know do we increase the upsells do we increase the ltv retention do we increase the conversion rate optimization things like that so i always try to work on these other things as well because a lot of people neglect this but still testing ads is still significantly important with finding new winning ads because there's been more cases where i just found a new winning ad and boom the account like crushed and rocketed and again if it doesn't lower overall cpa turn it off goal is to find new ones that take up 50 or more spend that drops overall cpa it allows you to spend more now as far as like scaling how we're currently scaling the ad account itself you know we're looking basically at the overall nccpa for the business this is triple well you can see right here 25 nccpa if it's hitting target cpa over the last 24 hours scale by 20 okay that's it so every day as long as it's hitting targets in cpa for the last 24 hours we scale i never make decisions based off the current day performance i see too many people do that oh like yesterday was really good but today starting off kind of okay i don't care scale 20 just do it then what i'll do from here is if nccpa is not hitting target for the last three day average scale down by 20 every three days okay so basically you scale up you scale up scale up then you hit a point where like nccpa kind of like okay you know we're above target now now i'll scale down and i'll just hover until i find new winning ads allow me to scale back up that's all i do but cool that's literally how we manage all of our accounts we spend close to two million dollars a month on facebook ads i've done over 100 million dollars in revenue for our clients and stuff like that this is the way we do it you know we spend probably 10 to 15 minutes a day inside of the ad account itself and then the other what eight seven hours and 45 minutes of the day that you know like technical like work day we're focusing on building better ads and like other opportunities in the business to improve so you know we barely spend any time in the ad account it's a huge huge problem is just spending your time all day in the ad account fucking refreshing that screen that's how you break things so you know we keep everything pretty streamlined that way we can spend a couple days thinking about the next ads we want to run we can build some really good looking ads that essentially just helps us improve performance significantly with just one or two ad tests right there so yeah guys hope you all enjoyed this video hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos in monday
