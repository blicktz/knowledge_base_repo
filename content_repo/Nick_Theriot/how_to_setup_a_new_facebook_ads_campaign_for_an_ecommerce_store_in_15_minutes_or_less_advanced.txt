yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have a new video for you guys on how to properly set up a new campaign or my infrastructure and the way I set up a new campaign kind of comparing it to this like the campaigns I see every single day when I do audit calls and that's like one campaign one ad set one ad and they're like spend 20 30 bucks and like hey why isn't my ads converting so I want to show you guys kind of like an overview of how I set up my new campaigns and all the variables and stuff I test and like how much testing goes on when I launch a new campaign so let's dive into it this is probably what your campaign looks like maybe a little bit higher budget maybe a little bit more audiences in it maybe a little bit of more ads in it but something very close to that so when I create a new campaign this is what it looks like this big monstrosity right here and don't worry it's super simple setup make it very easy for you guys and the reason behind why it works so well is because I'm testing lots of different data points I'm giving Facebook a lot of different points to which they can test so like you know this photo combination right here doesn't work they have plenty of others if your ad doesn't work it has nothing else to test and you waste more money so let's dive into it first thing you want to get is four different pieces of copy writing so you can open up a google docs go ahead create four different pieces of ad copy I like to do these four right here so a testimonial hook it's morning your first few sentences is a testimonial you lead with a little bit of a product description and a buy now but boom next one is a pain hook so you know are you tired of spending money on unprofitable ads that's the pain Facebook advertiser just getting started so I lead off of that then deliver description by now a pleasure hook hey put a smile on your dad's face with this amazingly custom metal sign it's a pleasure you're gonna put a dad's smile on your dad's face you're gonna put a smile on your face you can do this different ways this cost would be a benefit pleasure slash benefit of your product that you lead with and yeah so write that down and then a special offer hooks I don't really care to do these too much but sometimes they work really well and a special offer essentially it's just hey for a limited time we're offering free shipping or for a limited time get this book for free just pay shipping so you're not even leading with really any direct like information about the product pain pleasure or whatever it's just hey here's an offer then here's what the product is so I'll create four of these and then um what I'll do is I'll go ahead and get a photo and a video that basically represents that product really well so you literally need to just one photo one video and then yeah so that's literally the creative side getting this campaign started once you get those things ready it's time to start setting up the campaign so inside this campaign I like to do a CBO campaign I do a purchase conversion start off at $100 a day assuming you're gonna do 10 ad sets just do $10 per ad set you do so if you got 10 ad sets $100 a day if you got five $50 a day um and then inside those ad sets I do a single interest a single lookalike inside each one so I don't stack interest I don't stack lookalike audiences I don't stack open audiences even though there's no way you can do that but I'll show you guys when open audiences in a second um I'll go ahead and create one ad set so I'll start off with this interest number one now create one photo when loading that first piece of ad copy duplicate that photo loading that second piece duplicate that photo again loading that next piece duplicate that photo again boom super easy way just to get everything in without having to try to like recreate ad like four times just duplicate duplicate then edit each one's have each this piece of ad copies also to the headline I like to use it's just a product title a description something about the product slash offer that's a news feed description so that's a little thing under the big headline um and then same thing with the video I'll literally just duplicate I'll select all these duplicate them so now you have eight ads in that single ad set and I'll just like literally select them all click edit you know like load media and I'll just you know add in my video so now I have four of the exact same photos four exact same videos but then I have two uh like one piece of ad copy with a photo and a video to it so that I hope I hope that makes sense but that way I just load everything in nice and neat uh then I have this nice ad set right here that is loaded with all my creatives now what I can do is I can just duplicate this let's say if I want to go with five ad sets because I only have $50 a day budget duplicate it four times I have you know $100 a day budget duplicate nine times maybe I want to do $200 per day but do only five ad sets to like test it quicker spend a little bit more to it go for it that's up to you but here's what I like to do so I'll duplicate this ad set nine times I'll load in three more interests for three different ad sets and then I'll do four ad sets each one look like audiences and then two ad sets each open so that's no targeting at all that's purely that's targeting let's say if you're targeting USA um you're targeting 230 million people and I'm purely reliant on just a Facebook uh algorithm to find me buyers without loading any interests or look like audiences so but yeah that's how you set that up and that's super quick once you break it down it's just the order of operation of which you do things because you've come there and create this campaign go ahead and create one um you're trying to create 10 different ad sets then try to create each one of these it's just it's time taken so uh simply do it but that's how I'll launch a new campaign it's pretty straightforward pretty simple um but now it's how do you manage it because you can launch this I don't want all this running I'm testing a lot of audiences because I want to I want to try to figure out what's the three audiences that are going to make me the most money the quickest that's why I test a lot and you can see right here this is I created this campaign yesterday so I don't really have any data on it yet nothing crazy um I like to like I said right here I like to run it for three days so three days of not touching anything and just letting the algorithm do its thing so far we only have two purchases so far and this is also a brand new product it's not proven yet so and this is a proven product already for this ad account it'd probably do a lot better but it's not so let me go ahead and just select all of these these 21 ad sets and actually have a few more I'm doing a carousel I'm going for carousel for photo for video for each ad again if you have higher budget you can go for it if you want but uh would recommend it unless you're spending a few hundreds a few thousand a day so I got 252 ads in here and you can see right here almost all of them are pertaining to this piece of ad copy right here which is good that's why I'm testing I don't want all of these ad copies to work only like maybe one will do good one to do okay and like two other ones will just like do shit so but that's cool I'm starting to figure out what's working and that's allowed me to give me the information I need to start turning off stuff that isn't working so what I like to do is after three days I do not touch anything for three days that's just like the 72 hour window of Facebook likes to optimize the campaign then I'll go ahead and I'll start turning shit off so let's say if your cost per acquisition is $15 like that's your ideal one and you have a few of them for like seven dollars eight dollars so really good really profitable then you have something like 20 30 40 bucks unprofitable uh what I like to do is I like to turn everything off at the ads ad level so not the ad set ad level uh the reason why is because I may turn off an ad set that has a cost per acquisition of 60 bucks and then I fell to realize that inside there there was one ad that was getting cost per acquisition of five dollars but all the spent was spent on these ads so I just turn off you know the ads with the most spent so it's pushes more on there um and get better results so literally just go ahead start turning off stuff so like let's just say for example these had a high cost per acquisition my ideal cost per acquisition is $15 and these are getting cost per acquisition of $20 each or 20 25 30 something crazy turning those off um and that's also going to force spin to these other ads that maybe haven't got enough spin yet to be tested and also too that may have not um got any spin at all just purely just pushes the spin maybe one already is profitable with like $5 cost per acquisition and only got one purchase then more budget to it and we'll see you know we can get more purchases for that same price or is it kind of just like some low hanging fruit facebook gave us so um but also too if you keep doing this just turning off ads and you do this every single day so i've done profit ones you'll start to notice ad sets will won't be running you won't be turning off the ad sets but you'll notice that the the ad set won't be running because there's no ads active in it and that's good again because you want to be left with only like a few ads ad sets and ads that are working i'm talking about like three like you you literally probably not like three it'll probably be like an interest and then maybe like a look like maybe all three lookalikes who knows you know maybe you'll have four four that are really good and that's okay it's totally okay but now what you can do is you can start kind of pushing that budget up a little bit uh then you also too you can start creating variations so like let's say if this is your winning ad right here this photo number four uh with a special offer hook uh you can start testing other different special offers or maybe if your winner is this pain hook come over here so maybe you're winning creative uh or winning piece of ad copies this pain hook all right now let's see how can we break this apart so it's hard it's hard spending money on unprofitable ads so that's like your typical facebook advertiser what are other stuff they're already tired of what are some other pain points of a facebook advertiser uh can't seem to scale ads uh that's a good one that's a really good one watch i'm not gonna take that better ads break after budget increase i know it's like a hot really hot one right there boom you can test other pain hooks so you start splitting off you know maybe uh maybe this video number one right here it's your best performing creative and this is your best performing copy then you go ahead and just literally just make you know copies of it each with different paint hook or other pain hooks you're gonna test now what you're doing is now you're further expanding on stuff that's already working to find better stuff you always want to be able to improve and optimize campaigns it's the best way to do it uh so then you test all these and let's say you know uh so let's say that one works right there what you could do is you go ahead and test new videos so this would be like video 1.5 you know 1.1 just different variation so i hope that's that's literally like facebook ads in one video i noticed face this video didn't have like a straightforward kind of like narrative on it or like kind of focus on it but uh really just kind of showing you guys how i can like set up campaigns manage them a little bit and a little like kind of understanding of you know my bird's eye view of when i'm looking at accounts making changes making adjustments and stuff so but yeah guys that's uh i just want to kind of show you guys a little example of how i kind of go into creating a new campaign what i do uh this one specifically top funnel cbo so hope this brings some insight and helps you guys out when you're testing your first you know when you're testing new campaigns and going out there and looking to see
