yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys we're going to show you exactly how we took an ad account from a 2x ROAS to a 3x ROAS within 30 days by simply just making a few tweaks in the ad accounts and kind of like the systems and processes this client was running and how we managed to revamp it all and really just go from a 200% ROI on their advertising to a 300% ROI on their advertising and absolutely every day just further increasing that so I'm really excited to share with you guys we did literally you know we did around 60k and 30 days and sales less than 30 days and sales so really excited to show what you guys what we did before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for your youtube channel for new videos every other day just like this one so let's get started guys so recently we signed on this new client for our agency a really great client really great product all that good stuff you know they were they were to get some good success with their ad account you know validating their product scaling it up a little bit getting some results and everything but they were also too kind of lost you know they had like one side of the advertising and their goals and all that correct but they were missing the other side coming to systems and processes and you know that person to bring that you know bird's eye view to their brand and that's where we came on and we did some really cool stuff with their brand starting out you know to quickly jump in their ad accounts make some tweaks and stuff of how they're testing and all that stuff and then also to look at their brand as a whole versus just one side of the cost the customer acquisition side we can also look at some stuff public customer retention all that good stuff so we came on board uh they did probably around 27 000 in ad spend the month before you know the 30 days before we started and then they did around 52 000 in sales so a two extra ask to have a break even around 1.3 so you know they made some they made some profit they made some change and stuff uh with their business uh then we came on board within our first month together we've actually been able to go from a um you know spend around 20 000 and make back 58 000 so we spent seven thousand dollars less and we made nearly seven thousand dollars more so that's what 14 000 total i'm not gonna say in profit but you know difference in terms of spin and revenue and you know for both months and stuff like that so um i want to share with you guys really quick what we kind of did just a few you know numbers inside the ads manager and stuff and how exactly we achieved that and you know kind of what they were doing before which a lot of you guys are currently doing right now so um if we look inside of the ads manager right here you know this is this month right here like i said we spent about 21 000 total and it shows about 1.86 in the ads manager we're like really the only thing driving traffic to the store so it's not like an outside source that's attributing all the sales and stuff so and if we jump inside of their shopify you can see this month we're at 58 000 so we're in the near three extra turn on ad spend if we look at last month we're at 52 000 in sales and if we look back at ads manager you can see right here last month was 27 000 spent so we're obviously not even at a full month yet because today is only the 26 so we saw five more days in a month with them averaging near three thousand dollars a day well we could be looking at somewhere around nearly 70 000 with this brand for this month first month together so their biggest month yet absolutely crazy you know their their goal their objective was 100k a month and six months with us within our first month together we nearly added an additional 25 to 50 or 50 of revenue to their business so absolutely insane but what did we do how did we just come in there and make a few tweaks and stuff and really um kind of scale things up well first off is just taking a look at their ads account you know i thought we validated our product and stuff and you know we seen that they had a great product we wanted to take on we validated their account and stuff and um you know we took a look at that account and we just kind of noticed a few things first off that campaigns everywhere um i like to make this reference and you know no offense to anyone doing this no offense to any of our clients and stuff that had did this but you know we take a look at their ad account and stuff and it looks like literally a third graders homework or preschoolers homework with colors all over just scrabble scrabble everywhere and you know that's okay getting started but you need to have the proper systems to run advertising if you don't have the proper systems and you don't run them effectively and stuff what you're gonna happen is you're gonna run into this this thing of chasing your tail you'll be turning campaigns on turning campaigns off and stuff you'll be running ads everywhere it's just gonna look like a mess so what we did was is first off we established one or two campaigns we wanted to leave on because they had a lot of campaigns similar to each other and what we did was we went to inspect it inside the ad set you can hit the little inspect tool look at the last seven days of data and we could really identify quickly what ad sets had auction overlap auction overlap increases your cost per acquisition increases cost per acquisition equals lower row as so we first off by cutting off a few campaigns they're running actually increased their row as by just turning off a few things we didn't even touch the other campaigns that we left on we just turned off a few other ones which naturally allowed the ad spend to spend better because we weren't doing cop auction overlap we didn't have any you know we weren't bidding against ourselves now the next thing we did is we wanted to identify what audience worked well in the past we wanted to look at what creatives worked best and we also want to look at rooms for improvement so we want to look at audience exclusions were they excluding audiences and stuff or how they tested carousels how they tested video how they tested gifts we want to question all everything they have done in the past how do they have a catalog installed on their website to that way we can do recatalog retargeting ads you know what's some of the stuff they've done inside the ads manager and then once we do all that we want to gather all that together so we like to create two campaigns one one is for winning creatives in the past and one is for uh winning audiences and we just load in all of our winning audiences in that campaign and we load in all of our winning creatives in that other campaign and this only might be four or five winning creatives that we think are great creative the clients created in the past has done really well but what can we do to further improve them or can we rerun again with a better ad set optimization so that way we we kind of optimize the ad set a lot better you know we add exclusions in we test these new audiences and stuff you know what can we do to better perform it better manage to spin maybe that's just the case right there so once we get all of their assets sorted out we like to go through the funnel look at their click from the ad to landing page view rate so we can see if there's any discrepancies of people clicking on the ad to view in the website we look at people who view the website they're at the cart rate so how many people view the website how many people add to cart what percentage is that then from ads cart to purchase then from initiate checkout to purchase so we can figure out the different conversion rates between ads cart to purchase initiate check out to purchase view content to purchase click to purchase so that way you can see if there's any data discrepancies of people exiting the funnel at certain rates and then once we do all of that right there we can really build the whole picture of the brand and we can really go in strategically from there of what ad sets to create what creatives to create do we need to fix the website do we optimize the website maybe it's just something simple as that and for this particular account they had great everything except the audience campaigns structures and creative testing he didn't really have that set up properly so we initially went in we set up our scaling campaign which just left one of theirs on as our scaling campaign and then we set up an audience testing campaign a creative testing campaign we started testing batches of creatives we like to shoot for a new batch of creatives every single week for example one particular creative we got right now is literally running a 10x return on adspin at cold audience yes i know absolutely and crazy but we've also done five batches of creative testing with some of those going way less in row as even barely break even but that's the whole point of creative testing is going through the process of testing different variables and stuff to where we can really lock down on laser focus uh one that works well now audience testing campaign we're testing new audiences ad sets and stuff they haven't did yet or that has maybe worked in the past and see if we can further optimize on them we simply just load in all our best performing creatives in the past run it like that and usually just been our audience testing campaign our creative testing campaign get some pretty good results about 100 to 200 a day in ad spin right there and then we start cranking things out you know we cut off what doesn't work we cut off what works and stuff and then you know we slowly started building out the retargeting side we kind of shift a lot of our stuff now so we're spending a lot more on customer acquisition or a lot more on customer acquisition so that way we can really focus on the back end the customer retention you know getting traffic old traffic to convert you know retargeting and stuff like that but we did a few things as well as increasing their average order value by just making a few tweaks that are offer a little bit we increased their average order value literally from like 35 all the way up to like 45 so for example if they do 100 orders a day that's an additional thousand dollars per day because it's 100 a day plus 10 per average order that's an increase so literally just little tweaks like that that's made big impacts so that's everything we did and we literally took them from going around you know obviously like i said you know a 2x return on adspin and we're looking at average cost of advertising with average you know revenue and stuff for the month so um you basically take your your total amount of revenue for shopify and your total amount of ad spend for all channels and divide that that's your true return on ad spend especially for these brands that are doing purely just paid advertising so yeah that's literally everything we kind of ran into uh with this brand and stuff and we got a lot of really big things planned we kind of did some of the dirty work now now we're doing more strategic side and really pumping up and trying to see how can we get a 4x return on that's been how can we get a 5x you know how can we beef up their customer retention loyalty programs facebook groups all that good stuff and really building out the brand as a whole so this is a really really really really fun project i'm having with right now so uh team loves it i love it great client great overall so it's uh it's nice man it's
