what's going on guys welcome back to the channel today we have me reacting to your facebook ads i recently posted on twitter drop your facebook ads below and i'll review them and i have about four or five people that responded back with a couple facebook ads so with that being said let's dive into the video and react to some of these ads so here we have the first one this is by brett davies brett davies said do your worst brother need all the help possible let it rip this is my best performing ad which isn't saying much so his ad right here let's see a side fitness seeking your spark unleash the power of our no days off hoodie a catalyst for unlocking peak performance both in and out of the gym limits of free shipping all uk deliveries okay i don't even want to read the rest of the copy like that's impression number one i don't really care about the copy that's the first thing second thing i see the hoodie i see the boxing glove i see the rope the speed rope first problem here is that obviously like the hoodie the i gotta give you a compliment on this the way everything's positioned it immediately strikes my attention to the hoodie that's the primary focal point of the camera and it's laid out on a flat leg that's good i love that that's very good product photography here now the problem with this is i see a lot of this work more like middle funnel bomb a funnel kind of like your lower retargeting levels again i don't run retargeting i put them in my main campaign broad targeting as well on the same ads but it just appeals to that a little bit lower funnel type of demographic here you also drop the results looks like you got 32 354 dollars of spin or is that pounds i think that's pounds uh 354 pounds of spin 32 purchases let's see roos is fairly decent 2.75 that's pretty good i don't know what time range this is as well let me see if it shows a time range no okay so how can we improve this so first things first here is that for fitness clothing it's highly competitive that's the first thing everyone has a fitness brand now so the first thing you have to figure out is who is your identity now it's not gym goers it's not fitness lovers it you gotta go deeper you know here you're showing boxing gloves speed rope me personally i love boxing i train it two three times a week so like i appeal to this so if you're trying to appeal to boxers then this is a good job at that you're in a step direction if you want to build a brand around boxers that's good you could probably even toss in like muay you could probably even toss toss in like kickboxing maybe a little bit of mma as well and you can start to kind of appeal to that like fighting demographic the martial arts demographic right there the next thing is for me to want to want this product you have to appeal to my lifestyle or you have to show me a lifestyle that i'm appealed to that i resonate with so you know you could showcase like guy walking into the gym you immediately see the no days off hoodie some some cool like close-up b-roll of it him going lacing up his gloves and going either do some sparring or hitting the heavy bag asrv has a pretty cool one like that and what happens here is you're kind of showing that lifestyle and you're also increasing the brand perceived value in the consumer's mind for the first impression so something like that right there is a really good ad to kind of like oh wow that's pretty cool that's a very good vibe again vibe is really big when it comes down to clothing if you look at like alpha leap for example it's a lot of like gym motivation mindset if you look like a knock of power a knock of power is kind of like that misfits vibe young la is more of like the bro of la bro i mean it's the easiest way i can say it right there and then like asrv is for more of that like richer wealthier status individuals right there just every a way they do it so what is the vibe your brand setting apart and right now you're not really doing any of that you're just kind of like boom here you go so bring this product to life how do we how can we bring this product to life gym footage someone wearing it while working out some really cool photography some b-roll as well you know we used to do a lot of ads for mentality if you've ever heard of the brand mentality and that's what worked well for us you know from the creative side right there just simply showcasing that vibe and that lifestyle that people live with your product and showing them that content and that value first that's what grabs the attention of these consumers and then this is like i said it's a really good middle funnel bomb funnel ad right here you can have this ad kind of like in the same campaign same ad set all that good stuff just facebook won't spin as much on it because you have other ads that's focusing more on that at top of funnel kind of bringing people in whereas this is more about appealing to that middle right there so that's my biggest advice for you brett hopefully that helps you out right there with kind of what type of creatives you should be pushing forward with inside of this account all right let's see who do we have next got a few other people on here and i have a hard stop in 10 minutes so i gotta watch this out so okay cool so this person has two of them just click on his libraries i don't know what i'm clicking on okay cool so it's just one right here all right let's see you can just play it okay so it's a lamp all right it's just music playing in the background okay so this isn't bad and here's why i'm gonna say this like let's just keep a few things in mind number one if i want a lamp for like the corner of my room just go on amazon right so this is a very unaware market why do i say it's unaware because solution where people are just gonna pull up amazon and look it up oh shit i need a new lamp boom so we have to almost appeal to that unaware market of i don't need a lamp right now but if i show them a really cool lamp that really catches their attention that's going to incline them to want to purchase next thing as well is you're also showcasing the unique features which is really good the unique mechanism which is like it taps and that's it keep in mind there's still a lot of those in the marketplace as well so it's not really bad like you're doing everything correctly from a marketing fundamental side it's more so i would say the product itself that's extremely competitive and when people need this type of product right here they're just going to go to amazon they're just going to go to google oh i need a new lamp for my room i'm just going to go and boom so it's more so the mindset itself so from here a couple different ways you can do this is one you can position this lamp in high authority spaces so people with a lot of influence i'll give you an example really quick those claws it's k-l-a-w-s i think it's called i have no desire to want one of those but when i see a whole bunch of my rich friends that have them in their house i'm like i kind of want one now right so it's all about where you showcase this product at and you need to do it with high when it doesn't have to necessarily be like high status high wealth individuals but people that other people look up to you need to showcase this product in those people's houses and those people that your customers resonate with and then everyone's like oh she has that lamp oh my god i want it so that's the more key route that i would go with this particular product overall like i said the creative isn't bad let me go back to the hook really quick just review that real quick so the hook itself i would showcase this is the first hook right here because no one cares about a box box means nothing to me but right here where you showcase that a lamp being turned on that's really good i like that because you're showcasing the unique mechanism also too where are you filming at you know she looks fairly good that plays a role i've seen that happen a lot you know she looks like a little bit on the wealthier side you know she looks like she has a little bit of money she also has like a nice house and everything like that so it's going to appeal to a higher level demographic which all looks good so overall like where you recorded and stuff pretty good ways you could have improved this as well higher res camera to further help sell that perceived value but other than that not bad more of a product thing all right what we got next all right i cannot understand that so i'm just gonna mute that she is putting stuff on her face she also has a lot of makeup on good lord okay so it's a product for makeup artists now not even makeup artists just literally any girl can use this it's definitely on the higher inside so all you need to do for here is showcase a lot of like higher end wealthier like makeup artists and stuff like that like makeup youtubers using this with some high good like very good footage you just need to showcase those people using this product and that's it showcase the unique features of it showcase any problems or pain points that other people have with their current mirror so like maybe their current mirror doesn't have enough brightness so like yours is like 50 times brighter that's all you have to say that's one route to go with that but yeah and this also looks all like stock footage as well i don't think this is like stuff that you filmed yourself a lot of different color color palettes but i don't know it just kind of looks like different people film this and you compile it all together so i would look at filming it get some really good new like b-roll films really showcasing those features of this product and the benefits of it obviously you know this is already like a common knowledge product so like what i would look at is since it's a common knowledge product a lot of people already use this product so the sophistication is higher i'd really be hitting on what makes it better so it's brighter more mirror space which makes it easier you know because it has like that kind of like 360 kind of like curved effect right there with the two panels so like really showcase how it's easier for the person to do all that and you can just go straight forward right into showing all that you don't need to really spend too much time of like showcasing these other things you're showcasing before okay next one comes from craig hunter uh we started testing creatives like this about two weeks ago this one particular is going to seven to nine row s running straight to the landing page cool look it's converting well obviously like i have very limited knowledge in this particular niche so like i understand what the product does let me just make sure it is yeah so i understand what the product does it's essentially just helps you remove the canopy i see you can't be your hard top off of like a jeep gladiator so that's cool i like it as far as wikimi improved i mean she's a photo so show people like show someone just pulling up at home and you probably even do the hook of it just lifting off the car effortlessly show someone just pulling up at home boom it lifts up and that's it you're also doing 79 row ass straight to this landing page i mean double check this landing page real quick there we go so there's also there's a couple different markets for this product i know at least in like the jeep world now it's starting to become common knowledge these types of systems exist i've also seen a lot of other people that start to like do their own as well so i would start looking at it all right you know you're doing a 79 row ass phenomenal that's really good likely it's also because you're saving a hundred dollars with the bundle also i love the fact that you're saying save a hundred dollars because you know it's fifteen hundred dollars so like ten percent of that that's not even ten percent off at a hundred dollars but you're calling out the number versus the percentage because it's a lot higher so a higher perceived value so i love that you're doing that right there what i would start looking at now is all right what are the different like how do we scale this up you know seven nine rows all right cool go spend more are you hitting walls really quick all right cool then we need to go look at essentially going ahead and expanding our markets and start opening up like that unaware market or even problem aware market as well with people who just don't like don't can't take this off by themselves oh i love this okay so one bombed and one scaled let's see this okay you're gonna be out before by the guy okay so i'm not even gonna watch this whole thing i'm gonna focus on the hook because that's gonna tell me a lot of what i need to know no idea how to use ai at work what do i do all right let's look at this one stop what are you doing check you the teacher's got a major upgrade and it's downright scary the jet gpt now knows everything on the internet through april 2023 it can literally make the biggest difference for example you can show it a picture of your fridge this is pretty good too right here okay so this one's cool i like this one very good in terms of editing the pacing like everything is spot on phenomenal with it i love it it kept me entertained and kept me engaged one problem here is that you focused on educating so you're not really selling me anything you're just explaining to me about chat gpt about a key thing about it and then saying hey if you want to learn more about this type of stuff look at the neuron newsletter okay this one let's watch this one now no idea how to use ai at work what do i do that's why you should be reading it's a free daily newsletter read by over 150 000 people including from microsoft apple and salesforce they use it to stay up to date on okay this one's really good all right let me explain this one real quick so first off no idea how to use ai at work what do i do so this is good because this is actually a really big problem in the market right now where a lot of this ai is coming out people don't really know how to use it they're hearing about it but they have no clue where to start and here you are even hitting on a a a fear of like hey someone can come at your job for you with this then you're introducing a solution which is your product you're also calling out some really big authorities here microsoft apple salesforce okay my money is on this one because this solves a more fear and problem that people have whereas this one you're just kind of telling me something so i'm definitely going to go with ad number one let's see who i don't know i'm gonna say ad number one my guess all right we have time for like one more two more actually that's actually it okay cool all right last one here this ad is perfectly clear to pillions of people at stage one two miss a structure really let's break it down all right this ad is perfect repealing to people at stage one and stage two mark sophistication okay well that's the first problem is that you can't appeal to two market sophistications structure brilliant strong market fundamentals let's break it down okay let's do this okay hold up hook was really quick you barely see you know this hectic okay so calling out a problem hectic marnins barely been me keeping your protein levels high is a must okay my go-to has always been a lot peanut butter cup guess what i'll just shook up my routine in the best way okay so first thing here is the pacing is a little fast like i'm trying to watch this and it's first time while you're watching it and it's stopping before i have time to even kind of like comprehend what's going on obviously if it's working for them that's good i feel like they could add just like a half a second to each scene it'd be just a little bit better wouldn't say a full two seconds i literally say just like half a second not even a full second that's the first thing i really love the the hook so you know it's barely those hectic mornings you barely have time for coffee let alone breakfast so they're really resonating with people in that particular case right there of like you know who have that same problem as well keeping your protein levels is a must as a high all right so that's also another thing it goes from let alone breakfast that's been me and then so it talks about the problem and then it talks about something else which is keeping protein levels high i just i just feel like you don't really need to state that yet it's a it's something you need to state but yeah so what i would look at you know those hectic mornings when you barely have time for coffee let alone breakfast that's been me call out something to introduce olola olola my go-to has always been and then showcase this and then call out the protein benefits as well also i really like this one right here where they introduced the sample pack but it's just there's so much going on in this one ad because i say that not really from a good perspective it's like okay you call out the problem you introduce the product but first off you talk you call the problem then you go talk about keeping your protein levels high like if i wanted to keep my protein levels high what i would do is i'd probably call out something like i've all i've been looking for a breakfast a high protein breakfast alternative that's really important for me like my 2024 resolution is a high protein diet so i've been looking for a really big high high protein breakfast alternative that's when i found aloha start talking about the product and introducing it but instead they introduced the product then immediately start showcasing here's more of it too so here i know you're barely sold on the product here's more of it now so in this case this one like this could be right here where it says aloha just shook up my routine this could be a start of a whole nother creative and introducing the sample pack of things like that could be a whole nother ad right there and that's gonna be a very product aware ad so it's not really gonna get a lot of spin but it's more so to showcase to people how they have all these other like things um a lot of benefits here that's what i'd be focusing on people eating it people in like different environments on the go it does a fairly good job as well on that it also doesn't really call out let's see i guess right here it calls this out so this is also another thing it highlights way too much in this second right here way too much at once people are only going to retain two maybe three things so i would be showcasing the two or three things that's the best both times i've gone through this now in this video i haven't been able to read all of these so i've only been able to see like one or two which is like fully plant-based and then it goes to the and then it's over so just keep that in mind but that's everything so if you guys want to get your ass to be reviewed hit me up on twitter follow me on twitter and what i'll do is next time i do
