what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys on learning limited and how to get out of it and what you need to understand about it I get a lot of questions around learning limited and it's important to understand how it affects your account and what you can do to get out of it how to stay in the active stage and whether or not you should be worried so before we get started make sure you hit the thumbs up button below and hit the subscribe button if you're new to the channel posting new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys okay guys so learning limited so there's three phases of an ad set you launch it and initially it starts off in the learning phase right away so you launch that set goes to learning that's it simple so after you launch it it goes into learning phase and everything it'll have two kind of paths it'll take over the next few days it'll either go to active right here and you're probably getting somewhere around 50 conversion events within that time period to get to active in order to get to active you need 50 conversion events within a seven day so a week window so if you're optimizing for landing page views you need 50 landing page views if you're optimizing for purchases you need 50 purchases to get into that active stage now learning limited right here this is when it cannot get into active so it learns and then it goes straight to learning limited and the reason why it's going to learning limited is because it's not getting those 50 conversion events so it's basically telling us that hey this ad set is not optimizing anymore it's limited so an ad set when it goes in the active stage it'll continuously optimize and reach new new people and facebook continually optimize the performance on that particular ad set whereas learning limited it may start learning and stuff and then it's not getting the amount of data it needs so then it kind of like hey this is the people we're going to target we're just going to hold off on these people we're just going to stay with these people right here we're not going to go try to reach new people we have you know an audience of 2.1 million people we locked on probably about 200 300 000 of those people that are actively willing to you know work with our particular ad right there and that's it we're just going to lock on those people because we're not getting the 50 conversion events so we're not we can't go in active we're active and continuously optimize and continues to reach new people um we're going to learn limited instead and it's going to over time degrade performance on that particular ad set so it's not something you'll see immediately like hey i went to learn limited now my ad account sucks no it's going to be something that you're going to see over time because that ad set won't be able to continuously optimize and reach new more people and continuously grow it's going to fall short it's going to stick to the same group of people to be limited and you're going to once you burn through it it's likely it's just going to start suffering really bad so depending on your budget if your budget's five to ten dollars a day it might take forever to go through all those people in there but if you have a massive budget of a few thousand dollars a day like the accounts we work with then you know we try to get an active and stay in that active range so let's talk about now how you can get out of learning limited and into the active stage so first off you gotta understand that you need 50 conversion events now facebook recommends for us to drop back and do something like you know let's do landing page views and it's nothing wrong with optimizing for lpv if you're trying to get you know just traffic but if you want traffic that converts then following this advice is just horrible do not do that do not optimize for something less than purchases to get those 50 conversion events because you're actually going to do way worse than as if you were into a learning limited stage and again this is from working with hundreds of ad accounts multiple e-commerce brands all all that good stuff to where we went through and we tested all these and we always performed way worse optimizing for something other than purchases even if we were in that ratio right there of not getting 50 conversion events we're getting 50 conversion events so let's optimize for something less and other than purchase optimize something less than purchases and we perform way worse so do not follow facebook's advice but hey let's just optimize for landing page views or let's optimize for add to carts or initiate checkouts or stuff like that because you're just gonna get very trash traffic and you're gonna perform way worse i've still been able to scale ad accounts with learning limited so that's why something that i don't really take too too seriously but something i do have preventive measures to take to ensure that i can you know kind of bounce off of it in case i do hit it so what can you do so first off you've got to make sure you're getting 50 conversion events that's that's the number one thing so yes you do need to focus on ad copy creative offer and stuff you know if you have really good performing ads you're gonna get a lower cost per purchase you decrease cost per purchase then you increase the amount of conversion events you get for your ad set so that's that's the first step but let's just assume you took that particular action and then now you're still like what else can i do so when i look at people's ad accounts they might have you know let's say an abo campaign whatever you might have and you might have one ad set spending ten dollars a day maybe one spending 20 maybe one spending five and then let's say a ten dollar one so you have multiple different ad sets let's just say this is a purchase one percent website visitors one percent uh atc one percent and then maybe a view content one percent so let's say for example you're going through and you're testing you have all these different ad sets right here you're running and whether it's abr or cbo you know you're spending on average about you know ten dollars a day on your purchase one percent twenty dollars a day on your website visitors one percent five dollars on atc one and then ten dollars on um what about right there uh view content one percent so let's just say for example that's what you're spending on right there you have four different ad sets well the problem with this is purchase one percent website visitors one percent atc one percent view content one percent these are all very high intent actions so these are very high intent actions because they're all you know pixel on your website of the high intent so a purchase is a very high intent action that's something we want website visitors they view website they're more likely to buy from you than say they like your facebook page as a cart that's a pretty serious and you know view contents pretty closely to website visitors and what happens is i'm gonna draw you know these circles right here and you see how they kind of overlap a little bit well what it is is one of these right here could be purchase one could be website visitors and one could be atc and these ad sets all overlap you know by a certain percentage i've seen 40 i've seen 60 i've seen 80 so they overlap in a percentage with all these different audiences so all of these ad sets are targeting different groups of people but they have high overlap between all of them you know your purchase one percent it's not going to be that much different between your atc you know you're probably gonna have an 80 or 60 overlap so what that basically means is you're targeting the same people just with different lookalike audiences so what you can do is is instead of going after you know purchase website visitors atc is you can actually consolidate and group all these together so to maximize our budget so let's say if we're spending 10 20 that's 30 40 45 i should say we're spending 45 dollars a day on this campaign and each ad set needs you know 50 conversion events per week then what's going to happen is right now our budget is so diluted between all of these ad sets that it's hard for the algorithm to get those 50 conversion events sending us into learning phase and because there's so much overlap between of them it just doesn't make sense to keep running this particular structure right here so what we're going to do now is consolidate them we're going to create a completely new audience and let's just call it you know 45 a day i hope you guys can see that yeah so 45 a day and let's just call it high intent one percent so what we're going to do is we're going to take the best performing of these so maybe you know you look at this and stuff you're like all right let's look at the last seven days of data and let's see which ones perform the best so maybe our um let's see maybe our website visitors one just completely sucked and our you know atc completely sucked but our purchase one and our view content one performed amazing so let's do that so those are two assets that performed amazing and we're going to do is we're going to funnel them all into this new ad set we're going to create we're going to kill these two and we're going to do the total daily budget of all of these which is 45 a day and we're going to put them all into one ad set so you're going to essentially test a few different ad sets that are all likely you know like audiences you can go inside the audience manager you can select a few different audiences you're targeting and you can click on the show audience overlap and you can actually see the audience overlap between these and when they have these high percentages of audience overlap i do 20 plus anything with 20 or more of audience overlap i like to go and i like to combine those our test see which ones perform better kill the least performer and then take the winners and put them into a single ad set and what happens is this forces the algorithm to go ahead and push all that budget to that audience you know these two audiences right there in one new ad set this is kind of how a cbo campaign works because you'll go ahead and you'll put together a few different audiences and then the cbo campaign will go ahead and just push all that budget to whatever ones performs the best it doesn't even worry about the other ones and this helps out with getting out of the learning phase as well so consolidate the winners of like audiences remember i don't want to put high intent audience right there and have like interest in there no i want high intent high level conversion events in there so now we have this new audience right there and we're more likely to get all the learning limited because we consolidate it what doesn't work and what does work or we consolidate what works and we got rid of what doesn't we put them in one asset right there so now instead of you know the budget by being diluted between a few different ad sets it's all being forced into one or you know maybe a cbo campaign right there and it's you know it's pushing through right there so that's how you do it with lookalike audiences you can do this exact same thing with interests except what you want to do is there's a little inspect tool you know right by your ad set that's probably horrible right there but it's a little inspect tool on your ad set so say these were all interests you can see all right which interest is performing the best then let's look at the last seven days of data and let's hit that inspect tool and let's see which ones are showing audience competition we're going to turn off the ones that are competing with our best performer and then what we're going to do is we're just going to let that one best performer run just let it run for a few more days we'll bump up that budget that's when it gives all that you know get us into that 50 conversion events per week area to where we get out of learning limited for that particular one so that's one way to get out of learning limited you know cough it doesn't work go ahead put together like audiences together of high intent so like we can even do a social engagement one percent where i put you know my facebook engagement my ig engagement my video views all my social stuff i put all that in together it's an ad set sometimes for social engagement one percent after i test them and then i you know consolidate them and put them into one ad set so that's one way out of golf learning limited now let's look at the other way and that is you know diving into your retargeting campaigns so retargeting with learning limited so let's do retargeting so inside retargeting campaigns you might have a ig engagement let's do five dollars ig engagement and you know let's just say that's 60 days and then you might have a another ad set five dollars fb engage you know 60 days and then maybe a five dollars uh video views 75 percent vb 60 day so you might have in a retargeting campaign this is more for your mofu so let's just say mofu so this might be your mofu campaign right here where you have a five dollar ad set for ig engagement five dollar ad set for fb engagement and a five dollar a day for video views so it's your mofu you have three different ad sets and what's happening right here is the same exact thing your budget's being diluted but these audiences are all similar you know all these audiences are very similar in the nature of what there are their social engagement they're warm audiences people that maybe liked when your folks commented on one of your ads go on head liked your facebook page watched one of your videos they're all warm to the brand but we make we know they're not high intent audiences yet because we know we're running exclusions on all of these that's excluding website visitors excluding purchases and all that stuff so they're really very warm audiences so now what we can do to get out of the 50 you know get into that 50 conversion event is simply combine them all very simple you know this one it's a little harder for your targeting to get all that learning limited because you have to scale up your front end to scale up your retargeting you can't scale up your retargeting when you know you're not spending that much on your top of funnel so it's very hard to scale up your retargeting but what you can do is you can combine ad sets and it's been performing extremely well for us i mean just crazy bro ass now because we're basically giving facebook a big pool of people of like you know their consumer behavior at this stage right here and understanding where they're at in the buying process we're giving facebook those people and they're all very similar so facebook's performing extremely well because we're giving them a big pool of people and we're hitting them with the right message so we'll do is we'll simply just combine so now we'll have a 15 a day ad set and we just call it social engagement that's what i like to call it this is a 60 day so there we go that's simply all you do you combine them and then you have a 15 a day social engagement 60 days so that's literally all you do for retargeting you do the same thing with bofu i have an ad set that's view content 14 days plus add to cart 28 days for bofu and this i mean just performs extremely well because we're consolidating stuff that works already and we're giving that particular ad set more budget so in a day that the 75 is doing really well for video views then you know it's spending more on that inside of this ad set so recommend trying it it performs really well and this is all ways to get out of the learning limited phase because you're you're combining and you're maximizing budget so you know now we have one asset with 15 a day versus three different assets each getting five dollars a day because to get out of learning limits that you have to have each ad set or an ad set has to get 50 conversion events so if you're getting 50 conversion events for you know the 75 right here at five dollars a day per week you're not going to get you know it's not like the whole campaign gets out of learning limited it's only that one that gets that active status and you'll keep reaching new people retargeting is a little different because you're not really reaching new people you're only retargeting people that has already con you know has entered the funnel but still we've seen improvements right there so just quickly recap you know coffee doesn't work consolidate look at audience overlaps and you can identify audiences with high overlap so that way you can combine simply combine them in a single ad set that's an improved performance and then you know again if you're doing a lot of interest and stuff try to identify the one or two major interests that are performing extremely well if they are have or if they are you can also look at the inspect tool to look the last seven days of data look at auction competition kill off the things that's competing with your ad set so that way you can give it more budget and kill off stuff that doesn't work now if you are currently
