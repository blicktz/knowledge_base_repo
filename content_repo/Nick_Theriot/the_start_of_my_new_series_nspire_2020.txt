Over the last few months I've been looking for a change. I've lost the focus on what I'm truly passionate about. As I look forward, I know my current lifestyle cannot support my vision.

I've spent the last few weeks recalibrating my day-to-day actions to align with my vision for the future. But looking back, I've come a long way. Alright guys, I just got to the gym.

I'm about to get a little tricep ab workout in. And go from there. I got a few meetings today.

They want to see a story of someone, you know, a success story. They need to see a success story. Alright, write down how am I reaching that goal?

What am I doing to reach that goal? So you want to plan what are you going to do this week to reach that goal? What are you going to do this week?

The past few months I've been making progress in business ventures, fitness. But I feel like there's still room to improve. I feel like I'm not pushing myself hard enough.

And I believe, you know, living a happy successful life, fitness also needs to be there. Or you need to be a healthy person in general. And I wasn't living that healthy at all.

I love entrepreneurship and I love fitness. That's like my two biggest. I love making videos for YouTube.

You know, editing videos. I love that. I love trading.

I love doing like digital marketing and stuff. So that's like what I'm spending all my time on lately. I know that personal development is key.

And just bettering yourself in every aspect of your life is something I love. You know, trying to be the best person you can. That's what drives me.

Now it's time to start the next chapter of my life. I'm going to trip to Houston today. I'm going to be staying out there until Thursday.

Today is Monday. And I basically woke up Saturday morning and said, Hey, I want to spend this week in Houston. So that's what I'm going to do.

An online digital agency where I help clients, the e-commerce space, make more money with Facebook ads. So welcome to Inspire. A 90 day run where I push the boundaries of our current mental and physical limits.
