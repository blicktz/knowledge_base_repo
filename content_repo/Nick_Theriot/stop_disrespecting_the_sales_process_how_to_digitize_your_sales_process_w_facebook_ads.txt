I'm gonna show you exactly what all these people have in common Specifically related to Facebook Ads today so what a lot of like big personality brands like to do is They like to come there and they just launch a guide They build some type of good a webinar Something related to that and then they just blast it all over Facebook. Hey download my guide Hey sign up for my webinar, and they're not building any report first people don't know them They don't like them and they don't trust them yet And they're expecting signups and web and you know downloads to a complete cold audience.

It's crazy It's like if you go run around in public and try to get people to Downloads or take basically give you money, you know Imagine person who comes up to you. Hey, can I have a dollar? Why would you give them a dollar you don't know them you don't like them you don't trust them yet And that's okay.

You have that right You don't have to give them money yet if you don't know them or like them or trust them yet And that's as part of these sales processes building that relationship first Before you get them to commit just how I am building awareness with you and showing you a problem and showing you education through Facebook ads and stuff That you're going to see on this exact video right here You can build some awareness for me You could see me you could kind of you know See if you trust me if you agree with me with us on this process if you don't then hey you can leave there's no commitment to this video We're gonna go right into the ads manager and I want to show you guys something so I put out a free guide myself and Yes, see if I can show it to you right now but I just put out a free guide related to Facebook ads basically download a free Facebook ads guide and You get to come there and you know learn a few things regarding to Facebook ads And what I did was you know, I targeted just a broad business audience And the reason why Facebook ads has been doing very well regarding targeting a larger audience And I could run a simple engagement objective campaigns talking about 3.4 million people and I can you know take this age and kind of change it up Regarding you know say for instance your audience if you wanted to work with me Maybe if I wanted to do a little higher 24 it's about 40 Regarding towards more people in the digitizing or the digital space And then I can come there and you know just doing some basic targeting of you know one of these six audiences I like to run I'm very data driven and you know run off specific numbers and I just assume and put all my eggs in one basket So I can come there in the details targeting section and I can target people likely to be business owners who are likely Already on Facebook. I want to show people how to run their ads better I'm not trying to sell people on running Facebook ads And I can basically go into detail targeting and target people who are Facebook page admins I can target people who also like entrepreneurship who are in the business space And I can also target a few high-level people that are very aware in the business and active personality brands that are in the business space That kind of preach on and doing what I already like so Gary Vee's always talking about how you need to spend more Especially on social media. So Gary Vee Grant Cardone, I just want every business person I know basically knows the two and then they also need to Be contextually a business owner or small business And I can also narrow it further and add like something like a premium credit card like American Express almost every business person I know has an American Express card and And what I can do is I can come there and take this audience I can put out a few videos Kind of kind of like this making people aware And kind of trust me and you know be able to see me and I can push those videos out and I can have them in a strategic order from someone who doesn't like me To someone you know, it's basically kind of making me more aware as well allow people to build that trust with me They can kind of start Developing their own opinion of me putting in the right mindset, you know pre framing them putting in the right perspective And then I can come there and follow up with them just like an email marketing list So guys, this is the custom audience in Facebook ads and a lot of people like to just do the standard upload a list of POS transactions You know develop a customer file create a look like audience and target those people But I like to go a little further due to my different understanding of Facebook ads of being able to invest in my education I've developed a higher level thinking I can go to the engagement right here I could choose a video audience and then I can under engagement I can choose up to four different time frames of people watching my video 25% 50% 75% 95% and Mean you can both agree that if they watch three to four videos all the one specific order strategically that we chose To put them in the right pre frame just providing education just providing entertainment not trying to get them to commit to anything And we follow up with them who've been watching 75% of your videos.

They're gonna be a lot more qualified They're gonna you know, you have to spend a lot less to get people to download say your free guide sign up for your free webinar You know anything else you want to push out my visit consulting call if you're going some specific niche and we can build up an audience that we can consistently remarket to and then So now you have your top of your funnel then you have your middle of funnel Which you're actively retargeting people has been engaging with your ads with a some sort of commitment, etc some type of you know, maybe landing page webinar downloadable and then you can follow up with people who even went even a little further we can target people specifically to who viewed the landing page and Didn't you know opt in and we can create video content contextual to the specific area of where they are in the funnel So hey, if you did not then well, I can put up cinema guide Hey, our cinnamon ad follow up with them and say hey, you know, we live here's where you can continue your order Here's some video testimonials regarding my coaching with you and you know Specific areas of allows people to push them into a sales process Digitizing the modern day sales process into Facebook ads into paid advertising something that is going to offer a greater ROI than just running around and pushing people into Hey, download my guide. Hey, you know, it's not my webinar who don't know you who don't like you yet yet And don't trust you yet and they have no reason to they've never heard of you. You know, you can take some multi-millionaire Who's on you know in real life and basically they can create a Facebook page create a book and just launch that book and you horrible if No one knows about them yet so we can develop and tell their story through video content first follow up of those people who's been you know Watching it and have a super warm smaller compact audience that we can consistently remarket to and it's automatically rotating to where you know automatically on a rolling 30-day block to our 180 day block at most and And to where we have this audience that's super powerful We can even create look like audiences and target broad or warm or cold audiences with these people with this look like audience So, um, this is just kind of like the modern days digital process in about a five seven minute long video So if anything anyone would be interested in this drop a comment below We'd love to help you out guys.
