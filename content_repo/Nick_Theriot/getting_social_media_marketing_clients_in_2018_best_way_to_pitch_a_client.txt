hey what's up guys Nick Theria here and welcome to this quick video I haven't made a video in a while so thank you for tuning in to YouTube channel and stuff like that my kind of goal is to start pushing out more videos here regarding the digital marketing niche more like tutorials and how to and niching back down to my traits I used to run a gaming YouTube channel our specifically focused on the editing and the different editing platforms and I make videos on how to do special effects and stuff I know something that really made a big difference in my life something I really love to do so I want to start making some of these videos back on the channel I'm not going to guarantee your poster day I'm likely guarantee your post a week I'm just gonna make them when I'm up when I want to make them I want I'm inspired to or when I can kind of pick up something that I can show you how to do so I want to show you guys my process of getting social media clients this is something that I've just started implementing in my business recommended to me by my mentor and that this mentor has done outstanding with he runs a seven-figure agency and you know it works really good so it's basically the process of video pitching and I'm not gonna act like I can draw or stuff like that so I'm just into Google slides kind of write down some of the chart notes and stuff for this video but the whole thing with video pitching is you're basically creating a short you know short seven to eight minutes video with a clear process to revenue so if you don't know that means it's basically showing the client exactly how you plan to make a money with social media marketing so hey okay so here's so and so client I'm gonna show you how I make you you know ten thousand dollars the next month using Facebook and our Instagram influencers if you're an Instagram person I'm a Facebook ads guy so I'm gonna show them a few things with the Facebook targeting you know kind of clear-cut way of how these Facebook guys and get a more business and instead of month and you know kind of some of the numbers they're gonna expect so it's just different with stuff like that so just a short video where it's exactly like this video you know I got my same setup everything I got my camera you know if you have a laptop you can literally use the camera on your laptop the audio on your laptop just something better than a single like an email you know no one cares for emails anymore this is more personal this is more direct to that specific client and you know you're just gonna pitch them you're gonna show them real quick you know clear process revenue exactly what you know you can do for their company you know pull ups on their pages and stuff takes on their content interact with it you know show them you're not just some random person that's pitching them through email so you only clear process revenue show them how you will and dollars at our bank account so that's that's basically the instance of video pitching so it you know it's probably gonna take you roughly 30 minutes per video at first and once you really get good at it it'll take about 20 minutes per video you know that's just basically it's seven to eight minutes or so shoot the video with about a one minute add it to that for quick you know if you mess up the intro or something like that so quick something like that then you're generally gonna open up the page and stuff for about five minutes look at everything and then spend another five minutes of you know shutting off the video and maybe adding a few notes and stuff to it and then at the end so I generally come there and do about I shoot for ten videos a day but realistically you know I'm at six videos a day right now that's where I'm at I try to lock in a good solid two hours every day for video pitching and I'm yet six videos out it takes me about 20 minutes per video that's where I'm at narrowed down to so but uh and then what you do is you come there and then you just upload it to YouTube and then after you upload it to YouTube you send them the link and what you can do is you can come there you make sure you upload it unlisted so you come there you create the video you know use OBS OBS is a free streaming software screen recording plus screen recording plus you know audio plus camera so you know if you can talk to front of them you know like like you see me exactly on this video is how I pitch my clients and that way you can come there and you can pitch them they can see who you are you know you're not just some random person it's like there's so much trust there you're putting yourself out there so much more ways than just pitch them in an email real quick hey I do social media marketing would love to talk to you blah blah blah this way you're adding so much value up front they're gonna do two things they're gonna take it and run which is okay because they will never bought your services in the first place and there's so many of you got to understand that if if you give some client some advice they take your stuff and they've run they were gonna run in the first place and that's all that comes down to is you're doing bad at pre framing these class or not as they're pre framing and finding these leads and you're pitching the wrong clients you know if you're pitching a client for $10,000 a month and all they make is $10,000 a month in their business you're finding the wrong clients you need to go pitch a client that makes $100,000 a month if you're trying to pitch a client for $10,000 a month so understand that ratio as well another ratio to understand is are you delivering the results and stuffers and stuff making sense etc so I'm not gonna get all into that in this video so the incense of the video pitches you know short 7-8 video 8 minute video of a clear process to revenue show them how you're gonna make the money you know 30 minutes per video you know you can probably get that down to about 30 and just put 30 to 20 minutes per video you know shoot to try to get everyone has about two hours a day free time so try to get you know 60 video 10 videos today so now I'm gonna show you a few other things as well as like finding these people in my like whole process so prospecting first off you want to niche down you've got a niche down guys I focus I'm a personality branding coach that's what I do I focus on running Facebook guys for personal brands help them scale their business from five figures to six figures a month and that's my mind that's what I do with info products and stuff like that that's what I do you've got to find your niche look you know finding your niche ain't that hard you know too many people try to look for all where's the money at just try to find something that makes sense to you so you know if you really love Dennis and you know everything about Dennis because your dad's a dentist and you really know the market then you can go ahead and start pitching Dennis or you gotta find some type of business you know of because look my very first client was in the automotive industry I've always ran ads for the automotive industry because I started running guys for my small little detailing business I grew that and then what I did was I came there from that detailing business I got my first client automotive industry so I already kind of knew like what kind of videos and pictures and stuff to use for the ads being in the industry where I'm promoting already kind of like promoting finalized results for detailing you know I've kind of just it's I always look for cars for sale you know bought three vehicles so I kind of know like what's the like subject to you know what's that industry and what that allowed me to do is you know I'm gonna kind of knew like how to run the ads and stuff that makes sense whereas you know I don't know what the hell to run for a dentist you know why don't I'm gonna spend so much time on figure that out and try to master each niche so find a niche and another thing that's gonna allow you to do is be easier because if you just go right now alright I'm gonna create some video pitches who don't want to work with today you got to start focusing all your time on one niche because it's like investing you're investing your time in this one niche and what that's gonna do is the more you invest the higher your chances of succeeding so if you're constantly putting yourself out there and Dennis Niche eventually you have Dennis come there and approach you but if you're putting a little bit of time in a dentist a little bit of time in say roofing a little bit of time in chiropractors you're not putting enough time in one inch to be successful so niche now find one quick figure you don't look back at your life you know figure out some few things you always enjoyed few businesses you know I recommended a guy to I know there's a guy Jeff Miller who's killing it right now with bike shops bike shops and I know I had another guy kind of message meeting stuff about like what niches to go out there and stuff he was just kind of basically looking for a niche of money and I looked all of his profile he has a bunch of stuff about skateboarding and stuff like that I'm like why don't you go like the skateboarding niche something like that go pitch it something so I don't know if he took my advice or not but just something to think about chiropractors dentists all these clients are blown off the water with how many people pitch them and stuff so niche down easy way to do it is you know it's a prospect is you want to pitch you know too many people go out these smaller businesses so you want to pitch it a business that's already succeeding oh god so you want to pitch a business that's already succeeding with you know social media let me I'm gonna let me let you know about this because look you want to help winners win if you want to charge the right kinds of money and if you're afraid because you're thinking oh you might only make them you might only do worse with their contents going better then you need to go elevate your results because just about everyone's on social media now just what everyone's on Facebook guys etc and now it's where the real consultants the people who are paying or investing their time into education and learning is where they're gonna stand out I pay a few hundred dollars a month for a mastermind with Kat Howell to ensure my branding or my skill set is constantly being elevated to where I can have the confidence to pitch clients at six thousand dollars a month all up to ten thousand dollars a month with Facebook ads this is something you need to be doing in your business as well I also pay Jeremy Haynes who helps me run my social media agency who helps me you cut not necessarily helps me run it but he mentors me in their proper rules and stuff to you know be the trophy on the walls which you want to be you know in a mastermind for personal development and overall life you know betterness so anyway you know you want to invest time and stuff into your education with social media don't just because you can make a few posts on Instagram or Facebook that you can be a social media guru on you know really niche down you want to find business already succeeding when you know like Dan Lok says you know he helps winners win that's what you want to do too you want to help winners win more that's all you want to do that's all you want to do with the social media and then you also you want to focus on one specific service so let me get this straight if you can only have seven to eight minutes to pitch a video how are you going to show them a clear process to revenue with SEO with YouTube ads with Google AdWords with Facebook ads with Instagram influencers all of this in seven to eight minutes there's no way possible and why seven eight minutes no one wants to watch a 20 minute video by some random guy seven to eight minutes with the first 30 seconds to really get their attention to keep them engaged drop the whole video is key so you want to focus on one specific service for me it's Facebook ads it's easy to quickly build up a mock-up campaign you know kind of put some their constant in there and stuff like that show them how much do like push it out show them the strategy and I'm also pitching clients really high that I know their value for time and money and stuff like that they don't want to spend the time trying to learn all this because they're making way more money focusing one other thing in the Facebook and social media is just an additive so that way they don't mind investing money with me that's why I don't mind showing them because you know there's a very likely chance they're gonna take it in run and that's what you're gonna do with your business so you want to focus on one specific service when pitching I hope I didn't kind of could go into much of a rant right there you want a niche down you want to focus on business already social succeeding on social media and help winners win more focus on one specific service now this all this all comes down still to the pitch so when I'm pitching on 17 minute video it's with personality brands specifically in sales entrepreneurship and personal development and real estate coaches I'm also kind of doing a little bit of Shopify courses too so I'm focusing those niches basically info products personality brands I'm a focus just on Facebook ads and keep the video seven to eight minutes long I'm gonna do this we're about 20 minutes per video and then like kind of like the process I had to the overall process is I'm gonna film all the videos oh and by the way for prospecting to find these people so say if you're working with dentists just look up blurry you know Google or Facebook depending if you're doing Google hours or SEO or you know that's just quick ways you can do like Google or Facebook you know dentists in you know some city name boom you have a list boom there you go now the whole process is after you film the videos you want to film the videos and then let's see let me do like a one two three type thing so first off you want to do a Google sheet with the businesses or people you want to outreach to I recommend getting this out the day before or night before you never want to do this when you schedule off your block of time to pitch so you wanted to do this sometime you know before do this the day before so that way when you come into video pitch early to open up to computer you're pitching you're not sitting there and trying to find businesses and stuff and then to get distracted by other stuff and blah blah blah blah and then you want to just turn on your computer you have everything go you click a link you know you're on their Facebook page you pitch them you shut off recording pitch next clients boom boom boom boom pop up those video pitches as quickly as possible or you're gonna you know lose time and you're gonna take way too much time you're gonna run out of time etc so open and pitch so three see let me just put record and pitch so I do record and pitch all of your clients you want to upload to YouTube unlisted and then you want to find their contact email so you want to email them at prefer contact with video video link and the email can literally be something simple so like you know let's see let me just do a mock-up email real quick so this will be the email you know subject right here subject you know following up or you know maybe see ideas for social media I created a video for you you know hi from Nick or hi from whatever your name is etc so I normally do following up and it works pretty well for me for the open rate for the subject lines just get them to open don't overthink it you're not pitching the subject line so ideas for social media a few other things real quick the email address you're using make sure it's a business email you can get one like five ten dollars a month you know your name like mine for instance this Nick at Nick terrier org also have one for Mike so I have my personal brand which is just Nick terrier org I email from that one to push on people because I'm a consultant coach last thing I'm brain myself but my also have a back-end agency you know kind of ran behind it as terrier solutions comm and you know I still have a sales at or nick at terrier solutions comm email address so make sure you use like a professional email address don't use your gmail or stuff like that so they both work and you know that's all you have don't let it limit to you get it out so like you can just be like hey you know Nick you know I created a simple video our luck let's see I spent never started your senses with I I see hold up hold up hold up you know a great job Facebook content I spent some time going through your brand and this could just be whatever you know if you're pitching them on SEO you know maybe great job on the website etc blah blah spend some time going through your brand I did a full full video audit with some actionable video audit showing you a few things that could be fixed fixed fixed okay that to watch you know put your credit card in your wallet and watch it here boom send them the link etc that's just basically saying put your credit card on all that's you know it's not you have to pay to watch the video and you just put thanks and then you know your contact info you know Nick blah blah email phone also putting your email your phone and your address no one's actually gonna come to your house or anything like that I'm not gonna say I recommend it but I don't have a problem at all putting my address my actual house address and stuff like that in there because it makes it look more credible when I can provide email phone address everything like that versus just some random cold emailer who literally just puts like thanks Nick or you know if you provide all kinds of information have a really professional email signature it's just those little things that the human brain season associates it with a big and professional business so uh how much time are we at right now gallery at 19 minutes so um after you email them at that for contact or email this is what you got to do you gotta go to their Instagram Twitter you know Facebook um if they have a YouTube YouTube doesn't have that anymore so Instagram Twitter Facebook that's probably the three best ways send them all the DM let them know that hey I sent some content over to your email look forward to hearing back from you oh and also for this email after you sent it also you want to put in the bottom what let's see put it at the bottom I have a sign on me to do it properly please send me over a few times that you would like to discuss a few times that we can hop on a phone call and discuss the video so basically after you send the when you send that video to you need to have some type of action like what's the next step to take and for me it's like hey just send me over a few times that we can discuss this video so we can hop on a phone call kind of discuss if you have any questions objections etc you know and then you can sign them on right there you know you the proper sales process so nothing to email the video link don't stop there you want to immediately go to Instagram Twitter Facebook and you want to DM or send a message or PM them I'm saying hey let's you know I sent you over video and stuff then you want to wait about you can sign them on right there you know you the proper sales process so back you know the video link don't stop there you want to immediately go to their Instagram Twitter Facebook and you want to DM or send a message or PM them saying hey unless you know I sent you over video and stuff then you want to wait about you know 24 you know to 48 hours let's just say 48 hours if no reply cinema DM and an email again or if they were part of about 48 hours you want to just kind of slow start following up so send an email again just hey what you think of the video maybe send them an Instagram Twitter Facebook again and you know you want to constantly follow up the keys in the follow-up and you want to be creative with the follow-up you know if you can send a video you know phone right here I know you can just simply go on select Instagram DM and you can just press press the little video icon in the Instagram DM and you can quickly do like a quick like such a video style thing just by like hey you know what's going on essentially some information etc you know follow up follow up you do 48 hours still again if there's nothing you know and we do 72 hours etc you know keep following up with these people especially if they're ideal clients you know you kind of a rule of thumb is like two days follow up nothing follow up four days from now nothing follow up about eight days nothing fall about two weeks and just keep following up too many people send a video pitch and then they just are send an email or you know pitch someone on something and they never follow up and that is the number one mistake right then and there you gotta keep following up with these people keep them in the loop because you know maybe they weren't ready about a week ago but they might be ready in two weeks ago and they can't find your emails anymore and they go look and hire someone else so you got to stay into their line never give up too many people complaining on clients and stuff and they never follow up or anything like that so it's something you've got to do and work into your schedule get creative I'm a video guy I love video that's my type of thing that's my shrimp so I'm leveraging as much video as I can when pitching these clients when I'm following up these clients as I can and I like it it's something I like to do if you're very creative at texting and creating these little short tweets sentences that give their attention then go ahead go with that as well leverage what you're good at when the following up and pitching these people um so that's kind of the whole process and you know the whole goal of all this is to get get a phone call so I went on the phone call you can come there and get the go ahead or you know answer any questions etc you know you basically is from then and there is you know figure out where we're gonna go with this you get on that phone call you answer any questions you can answer any objections you know part of the sales process that you can go ahead and take action with I'm not gonna go ahead and go from here but this is kind of the whole idea the best way to kind of get social media clients so send them a video pitch you know prospect correctly you know really get one streamlined service and then also you want to keep a notepad so I forgot to mention the notepad on your hands and write down all these little things that you notice you need fixing your videos your first hundred videos are gonna suck your second hundred are gonna be good and then your third hundred to me where you're really gonna excel at and probably out of a hundred videos you send your goal is to get about a 10% conversion rate on a hundred of them which are you could probably get about a 30% I don't really have I don't really have the exact conversion numbers yet I'm still waiting I haven't hit my hundred pitches yet so but if you can get about a 10% conversion rate that is pretty good because you can sell out about a hundred videos a month doing it two hours a day and you know I do five videos five to six videos a day or what I've been averaging the past few days and I don't want to say like I do this every single day because like I said I'm still picking up and implementing this into my business this is all stuff I've been recommended to me by my mentors and I'm kind of helping you guys out so that's all stuff you can do make the time for it hope this helps you have great day
