so in the last 24 hours we were able to scale a shopify store from literally like fifteen hundred dollars a day in profit to five thousand dollars a day in profit and i'm not lying to you but to show you guys exactly how we did this within 24 hours so that being said let's dive into it so just to show you all triple well really quick last 24 hours you can see okay net profits this is after shipping cost of goods spend so like this is not including like any other fees but ad spend shipping cost of goods those are like the dominant what i would say you know expenses when you're scaling a shopify store so there's a couple other things but it's pretty damn close to 5k in profit right there all we did for you like results was we looked at our market we did our market research within market research consisted of this consisted of reading reviews on our site reading reviews of competitors site looking at tick tocks of you know this particular product and like other competitors products looking at amazon just to understand how people perceive this product and why people use this product so we can understand how we can position it in the marketplace that's where we identify the mass desire of the marketplace we identified the market sophistication we identified the market awareness all of those good things right there then all we did was simply created three creatives around this particular concept that we storyboarded that's it and then we launched them as a dynamic ad set in facebook so let's see how that played out so here was the facebook ad accounts about seven days prior of us launching this particular dct so you can see there's a few different dcts we've tested no real success we're averaging about 42 30 30 40 to 33. so in between that 30 to 40 range for like a cost per acquisition specifically for facebook i should say about 35 right in the middle between 30 and 40 and then here's the facebook last 24 hours right so last seven days last 24 hours you can see one sin right here just rocketed to take all these spin this is yesterday april 25th 18 dollar cost per acquisition no 40 and 30 cost per acquisitions this is literally 18 18 18 cost per acquisition this is also number 110 which for me i always start off all my dcts at 100 so this is the dct number 10 that we've tested in this particular account so we had we tested 10 different dcts which nine of them completely failed like nine of them didn't work no performance i mean you can see right here 105 a 42 cost per acquisition so some of these concepts we created for this client did terrible 40 30 this was not profitable for the client but as i've mentioned hundreds of times on this channel i stay consistent with successful actions over and over i don't go change the ad account structure because 106 and 105 didn't hit the cost per acquisition oh well nick dct didn't work for me no it's the creatives you put into the dct that's what creates the results here we tested a testimonial but like a specific type of testimonial this one i forgot what we tested in this one something else and then we tested something completely different in 110 and now if you stay tuned i will show you the winning creative at the end of this video so this crushed 18 cost per acquisition and here is the winning creative i didn't mean to blow the load too soon but yeah this is the winning creative itself nothing crazy literally a static image itself before before after i'm not going to read that headline but yeah you can understand the type of product we're selling here what makes this good number one it's fairly blue ocean type product there's not many products that's being promoted around this particular problem what does that mean for us we get a little bit more of that blue ocean which is what this does now keep in mind we tested a ton of creatives around this it took us still a long time to crack the blue ocean so i just want to keep that in mind second thing it's very intention grabbing also showing the desired state that people want to be in this is still applying the marketing fundamentals i teach in terms of desire and showcasing where people are at now and where people want to go now well i thought before and afters aren't approved by facebook well keep in mind here this before and after we're using you know what i would say a pastry to demonstrate this whereas you know if we actually did this correctly with the real pictures yeah that wouldn't get approved at all on facebook just full transparency right there but yeah so this is what it works this would scale this simple image i did put these boxes to kind of cover up the product itself if you find it cool if not i don't really care but yeah so client super static literally about fifteen hundred dollars a day in profit you can see it's about a 65 increase in profit day over day sells up 15 they helped them hit their first 10k a day so this video too now they're averaging about 12 to 15k a day in revenue they came on board at five now they're about 10 to 15k within literally 30 days of us working together lastly we're at a you know 4x for us overall we're happy to scale at literally a 2.5 so plenty of room to keep scaling and pushing you know ad spend and things like that so but yeah just want to show you all this really quick little case study here again process we followed you know to actually get this and hopefully this helps you guys out just kind of reiterate on the fact of hey number one even when things aren't working good to nine ad concepts didn't work we're still looking to test new things second thing of just following that process of market research all the way down to ad creation and then lastly just hey here's what the winning
