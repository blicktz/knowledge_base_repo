what's going on guys welcome to my crib all right guys it has been long awaited for the official apartment tour and got everything situated how i want it so i thought i'd finally give you guys a little tour a little reveal from this right here which you guys saw a long long time ago and now too but you're gonna be seeing in this video so walking right into the apartment we are in the kitchen area and this is probably one of the biggest reasons why i've chose this apartment is because a if you look up really high ceilings in this whole apartment and a very big open kitchen living room vibe a lot of white light sunlight good light coming into the apartment and that was a really big key for me so between those two things open good sunlight natural light coming to the apartment we're high on the list of whatever apartment complex i chose and this is one of them so in the kitchen you got all your standard stainless steel appliances all came with the apartment everything got your typical stuff rice cooker right here which is like my go-to right now uh it's currently doing the vertical diet so i cook like rice every single morning for that uh typical cookware toaster knives all that good stuff you got your seasoning cabinets and i don't know if i'm gonna go through every single cabinet but you know typical stuff you need to cook and everything nothing fancy nothing sexy just your standard stuff we do have the supplement cabinet up here uh full of the ghost products which is one of my favorite products right now currently in the fitness market all of my you know kind of like biohacking different performance stuff brain stuff all like good stuff uh i'm currently taking right now and then literally just stocked up the fridge again nothing sexy your typical stuff so that's the kitchen and we go over here into the living room which we have the insignia it's like 43 inch 4k ultra led tv one of the most amazing tvs i've ever purchased for like 300 bucks a year ago i got for like christmas uh full of christmas sales and honestly at first i was sleeping on it realized how amazing it was i used to see for everything watching youtube videos getting ideas for future youtube videos if i'm doing like research and stuff uh playing music i literally just jam music i was saying all day while i'm working in my office and stuff uh playstation don't really play it that often my girlfriend likes to play fortnite a lot so uh she puts more usage on it now than me got the entertainment center right here just your typical stuff your playstation wi-fi box plant and uh girlfriend got it for me needed something super easy to maintain you miss it with water every few weeks all good so uh some books and stuff that i haven't read yet so there's decorations right now but some really amazing books so couch this is couch is awesome because you can actually like pull up this part a little bit and the back folds down to make a sleeper couch some artwork i got from amazon cheap just some stuff to kind of like add to the aesthetic i really like the black white a little bit of red hints here and there are blue hints which i'll show you guys in a second so yeah that's the living room it's awesome i'm not adding anything into it anything else to it i contemplated putting a coffee table and stuff but like i said trying to keep it open trying to keep it bright white all that good stuff so here's kind of like our little dining table area we got the mindset is everything poster one of my favorite pieces of art i've ever received i know it's super cliche and super like overused now uh but honestly i love this piece the way it sits in the kind of dining room area and we got a small little dining room table which is what i wanted i didn't want anything big i didn't want something that like really took up this whole area again to keep it nice and open this is perfect two people can sit down uh maybe three people sit down eat work on projects i like to put my computer right here and actually kind of just look out window and everything and work my laptop when i'm writing some ad copy something like that and i just hung up this little piece right here literally today uh so this is a puzzle me and my girlfriend did literally took us like two months so kennedy was kind enough to go ahead and mod podge the whole thing to make it all stick together and we had one little missing piece so we did is we just took a little sticky note you can only put our anniversary date on there so it was it's nice little touch so but that's that's the whole dining room table area the dining area um it's cool and stuff and right outside that this is one of the favorite pieces of this whole apartment is the outside so this whole area right here gives you some really nice view of the apartment complex the pond we got a little hammock sitting up out there and it's uh very nice very beautiful all right so now we are moving into the room where no magic happens i'm not a magician so there's really no magic that happens um i'm sorry i never really went to like magic school so um i sleep good in here though i sleep really good the bed's comfortable and it's it's nice i have the phillips hue light right here this is the only thing of phillips i have so far i do want to get the phillips phillips hue bulbs and put them all throughout the house so i can change colors and stuff make it look really cool instead of vibe but so far it's the first in the collection got the airpods charging and yeah that's my bed uh nothing too fancy it's it's your room i really just come in here to sleep and that is it here's this is probably one of the best pieces that i've ever my girlfriend got kennedy got me as like a little investment is my room is a fan i've never slept with a fan before but it makes a huge difference with sleep and everything keep it nice and cool got my dresser and stuff all that's set up and then another amazing piece about this apartment is the walk-in closet so it makes it super easy to store everything in here shoes clothes all that good stuff so again nothing sexy nothing cool but uh it works does its job and it's huh yeah true true true so moving into uh this is also another one of my favorite pieces of the apartment is the bathroom bathroom is very nice in terms of just how big it is and stuff so and you can also kenny she's filming this whole thing right here so big thank you to her and shout to her but this whole place does have a bath and i look i'm a guy i know most girls like taking baths and stuff but i am a huge believer take a nice hot bath with some epsom salt or some dr teal's before bed i sleep so much better it does well for your body especially if someone likes to work out a lot get sore helps with recovery and everything absolutely love it and then right behind the door we got a full shower so it's really cool how all this is set up so that way you have both a best worlds and it's not like one of those that like has a shower and a tub together so don't really care for it that type of style too much but yeah you got your nice open bathroom very big spacious and it's nice so let's go ahead and move to the place you guys all probably do want to see where there is some creative magic that does happen in that room and that is the main office area so this is a two bed two bath i'll show you guys the two bath uh the second map first it's again nothing cool just small bath um yeah that's it so so uh moving into this room right here this is the main office area yeah you see good you're fine okay so this is the main office area or the second bed of this two bed two bath and yeah it's very simplistic and that's like what i want it i don't like a lot of stuff in my office i like it nice and minimalistic so we got phoenix he's in charge of billing for terror solutions so if you're a client watching this video he's the guy that if you can't pay a bill that's what you know that's you have to talk to so phoenix is our little king snake he uh about two years old he got really big over the last few months i've been feeding a little bit more he does he is throwing a little bit of a temper tantrum right now so i ain't gonna be taking him out the cage but uh he's pretty cool excuse the tank mess i literally just got back from vacation yesterday so i gotta do a lot of cleaning with them but we have one studio light right here which gives me a good backlighting for when i actually record my videos so moving into this whole setup right here i got the macbook pro this is the 15 inch fully spec'd out from 2019 uh and it's connected to the lg ultrawide 4k monitor it's a 27 inch uh i just invested into this piece and honestly i don't know why i didn't do it sooner it helps so much with work because i have a better bigger screen can open up more tabs a lot of drag and dropping stuff and open up multiple different windows i can just input more into the computer and get more out quicker uh versus trying to do everything on a laptop so got my tripod and i'll throw up some video on my screen right now of what it looks like uh but i am using this camera right now to record this video but uh it's usually where the canon eos 90d sits with a 16 to 35 millimeter uh canon lens which was probably one of the biggest investments i've ever made besides my laptop into this whole creation thing and honestly i do not regret one bit of it moving into some of the other things on the desk we have your typical kind of like little notepad and stuff i usually i've been using a um mule skin notebook and honestly i just kind of threw this on the desk for right now and honestly i've been falling more in love with this now than my mule skin so uh just something to take notes during calls and meetings and simple as that throw random ideas down we do have the apple keyboard and apple mouse yes i'm an apple fan boy i think i will be trading the apple mouse out one day though for the logitech or i think it's the logitech mx master mouse which i used to have and i want to get another one because honestly it makes amazing for video editing we do have the akg p120 condenser microphone on the desk with the road arm and also to the focus right little uh adapter thing stereo thing i'm just getting into condenser microphones and honestly it's something i've been wanting for years finally got it it's super thankful to have it because it sounds absolutely amazing now for video commentary any type of videos making where uh you know just kind of talking for long-term things and also too if you notice i don't have a webcam set up because i actually use the canon camera and the akg p120 for all my calls so when i get on a zoom call it's like a full one production in here for that call right there so i get a lot of compliments on it and absolutely love this setup inside the desk i do have a few different things right now i'm currently reading becoming supernatural by dr joe dispenza uh just some blue light locker blockers you know some credit cards and stuff and then also some like hard drives for storing videos so moving over um here's my kind of like bookshelf i have a lot of different books and stuff i've collected over the years bought different things like that uh little reading lights again i want to get a phillips and this is another light i want to get a phillips bulb for so i control everything with wi-fi um awesome little badass mini badass book and also a badass button i'll play it for y'all guys real quick do what you love this is something again my girlfriend kennedy she got it for me with uh you are a badass the book absolutely love it and moving over i got the bose qc 35s i think um again just another piece that i invested into and absolutely love it's something that you can literally put on you cannot hear a thing outside of whatever you're listening to it it blocks out a lot of sound so it's absolutely amazing especially in the morning with uh when i'm doing meditations and stuff so and here's one of the first cameras i've ever started off with it's a eos t3i by canon which is a very old camera it shoots 1080p like 30 frames a second and the quality is actually miserable but it's a cool camera it's something i started with so i just want to have as a little memorabilia um yeah and then lastly is the athlete backpack this is where i use everywhere i go for you know i'm traveling somewhere with my laptop and stuff or just quick throw a few things in there we do have a few like papers and stuff and a few other like mics and stuff um you know it's the road mic right here used for like fun vlogging or something um and then in here it's an absolute mess we've kind of put together a bunch of legos this is legos from my old house and we me and kenny just kind of like messing around with it right now so we're not really sure what's going to happen with all that but that's just another storage closet got like my golf clubs in there and a few boxes from the upgraded setup so that that that right there will pretty much conclude the whole tour um lastly i guess i'm just gonna show you guys real quick uh this is the yeah the few snacks i have uh i feel like it's a lot easier to stick to my diet if i just don't have food in the house because that's usually when i want to jump around on something it's just between while i'm editing or something like that if i'm editing running the room video and i want to eat like a quick little snack but uh yeah that's everything and then show you guys real quick the laundry room this place does have laundry kind of like in your apartment so full size washer full size dryer in here and yeah i mean it's it's awesome it's pleasure to have this so i don't have to like go walk and like bring it places and then lastly you have your kind of like cleaning cabinet right here so and yeah that's it that's the full apartment so that's the full apartment guys i hope you enjoyed this tour i know it's long awaited i just want to get a few more pieces in here and get the office situation uh set up i don't really have any plans besides adding some more artwork to the walls and those phillips bulbs i don't eventually want to get so uh thank you guys so much for watching this video also a big thank you to my girlfriend kennedy for filming this for me i really
