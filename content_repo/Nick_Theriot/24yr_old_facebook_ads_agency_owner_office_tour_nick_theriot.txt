YouTube what's going on Nick Terrio here and welcome back to my channel this is completely different than a lot of videos you're used to seeing on this channel yeah I did upload my name Wednesday and that's because I had COVID going fine good to go but I had to upload something for you guys this week I could not go a week without uploading so I thought about doing something special for you guys I thought about doing an office tour I know back when I was like 12 years old I used to obsess about everyone's gaming setups and stuff like that very excited to kind of show you guys everything let's introduce you guys to Phoenix Phoenix is my California king snake come about a year and a half ago when at a time I never thought we'd get a snake but I've overcame my fears used to be completely terrified of them and I love them for people who don't know really much about like king snakes their thing they're they're non venomous they don't have any fangs or anything like that green lizards and run around like your house or those geckos and stuff like one of those like if you pick one of those up they like bite you literally same thing so this is overview of like my whole entire snake tank and it's pretty cool and here is my Canon EOS T like T3i one of my first DSLR cameras really great camera and in fact my girlfriend actually uses it for her jewelry business for photos and everything but it's a potato when it comes to recording and these are pretty cool it's the road it's navaleer mic basically receivers I use for filming like stuff online and you know where I need to like use a lavalier mic you know tripod and a one of UV filters by Canon so just quite a few little things around for my camera just stored below the tank and have a few wires pretty much your typical like office stuff now if we move over to the corner I have a kind of easel with some giant post-it notes that I'll typically use for some videos to you know straw things out or even the course coming up to educate people in different things ooh and I almost forgot this is an amazing little quote that my girlfriend went ahead put together got a frame that everything it's called the man in the arena by Theodore Roosevelt so if you have not looked this up and read it I highly recommend it something that's very motivational passionate awesome now if you look right over into the center of the room there is a marvelous piece of history in the making this is one of my first desks is literally like a $50 chair and $50 desk from Walmart now that my amazing girlfriend uses for her jewelry business quick plug to her check out all of creations co on Etsy for the perfect gift for your girlfriend or girls if you're watching this make sure to check it out grab you some really cool earrings necklaces all handmade great and on top of the desk is something that I've actually been putting off but I need to get this probably hung up and put together and like a frame this is a really cool article this Shrut magazine did for me when we did 800 and like forty thousand dollars in 20 days for my clients it was a really really really cool just getting published and everything like that and really cool experience now if we go ahead and look up this is a really cool piece that my girlfriend made for me it's basically my logo for the business terror solutions which is my marketing agency and it painted out on a nice little piece of canvas and I visually also want to get one just like this but a neon sign just that wall it pointed at off to the side and put that right over like my computer and stuff because I think at night a neon sign a blue is just gonna be popping in the room so that's gonna be super cool but yeah so this is pretty much the whole kind of like little desk setup area overlooking kind of the outside like a little pond area at my apartment complex so when I do decide to come sit at this desk just to maybe do a little bit of thinking time a little bit of reading really nice relaxing view and like I said it's something I used to really enjoy but now I have a whole new setup on the other side of the wall which about to show you in a second so now moving on to the last part or probably the main part of why you clicked on this video essentially is my actual desk setup this is where I work at this is where I probably spend four to six hours almost every day at and it's something that I'm very comfortable with it's completely custom to me welcome to my autonomous dream desk setup and the reason why I say autonomous this is just who basically made the desk the chair and you know the monitor mountain with full regards this is not a sponsored video or anything like that in fact I was very torn of which brand to go with when it came up to standing desk and ergonomic chairs and stuff like that but this desk is a monster sitting at around 48 46 inches wide with about a 20 to 30 inch depth look I'm not perfect with math and numbers and stuff like that in terms of these measurements but it's something like that in this desk is a monster now I was really skeptical of how much I would actually use to stay in the feature of this desk but the beauty of it is you have four programmable presets you can put it to exact height you need save the preset and it makes it super easy for just pressing a simple button and it said that's the exact height that you need for whether you're standing up or if you're seated sit it down and my performance is going through the roof with this because without even thinking about it I can simply switch to a more comfortable position throughout the day while working at the center of my desk you'll notice this massive 24 inch wide ultra wide LG 4k monitor and this thing is a powerhouse for throughout the day of maybe doing a little editing work or having multiple different tabs opens for ads managers different reporting software and is beautiful to look at this monster is powered by a workhorse this is my 2019 MacBook Pro 15.5 inches one of my first Macs ever and absolutely love it I come from a long line of custom-built gaming PCs and it's my first kind of laptop powerhouse I've ever purchased it is a major key for my work efficiency between setting it down plug it in with two USB C's it's just about maxed out so it's very powerful and absolutely amazing to work on every day at my fingertips is the sleek and very modern designed Mac keyboard I guess you could say and I just love how sleek it is I love how satisfaction it is to type on this I'm very simple guy when it comes to my peripherals and that's also why I'm using the trackpad I originally was using the magic mouse and my hands were cramping like crazy on it I could not stand it and I'm coming from like a Logitech high-end Logitech mouse from like some like PCs and stuff which I loved but the magic palette is a whole new level moving over to the right is one of my favorite parts as well setup this is the Focusrite preamp I think it's a Scarlett Solo because it's just a one input type of preamp which is powering the big bad AKGP120 this is a beautiful sounding microphone and it's a fact it's exactly what you're listening to right now probably one of my dream XLRs or dreams to have an XLR and it's something I use on a day-to-day basis it sounds amazing and I will be upgrading soon to the sure the big bad sure but for right now this one I'm using sitting on a road kind of like podcasting arm to make it very quick and accessible for zoom calls throughout the day now in the corner is a 4k webcam generic found it on Amazon on this little arm because I cannot stand having a webcam sitting on top of my LCD screen so I love having it off to the side I used to in fact have a kind of like 4k camera that I'm using to film this video on a tripod and use as a webcam and it was nice having it off to the side but I just use a simple little tripod found online that's used to like store cameras in places you typically don't put cameras so just a little you know snag it to the desk and use it like that and it also leaves a pretty cool angle for zoom calls so this is kind of like my webcam and mic setup of the desk while I run a YouTube channel purely around Facebook advertising you think I get questions of like hey do you offer consulting hey do you have a course on Facebook ads hey you know love your videos you're similar cool dude let's hang but no in fact actually one of my most top comments is what type of glasses are you wearing and these are the ibuydirect.com blue light blockers I highly recommend using blue light blockers throughout the day there's a lot of harmful or UV rays that come off your computer especially if you're working from home anywhere from four hours eight hours a day behind a computer screen you absolutely must need a pair of blue light blockers to protect your eyes now moving over this is also one of my favorite little knickknacks I have in the whole entire collection these are my bose quiet comfort twos these are a bluetooth pair of headphones that have probably one of the longest battery lives I've ever had on any type of headphones and they're also noise canceling headphones when I put these things on I cannot hear anything so for people working home during quarantine these were a really great gift to just kind of help out with you know kids and stuff like that home and you know having other people at home really great way to block out the distractions and stuff and really focus on what you're working on I like to throw on some neural beats on Spotify listen to that while I'm working it really allows me to get deep into kind of like a zone of work these are my favorite just my dream headphones and um absolutely love them other few things that are commonly available on desk I have breakthrough advertising right now which if you haven't read breakthrough advertising I highly recommend it one of the greatest advertising books you can possibly read turning back and forth to it a lot right lately it's one of those books you read two or three times and just keep by you and constantly go back for like ideas and stuff like that around campaigns so very powerful book and then lastly on my desk is a notepad I just get these basic you know like journals empty journals from Amazon and I'm always writing things down um I journal in the morning I write notes throughout the day for meetings I do thinking time in here I have like seven of these filled ups from the last year so 10 bucks on Amazon 240 papers uh pages per one highly recommended lastly is just a water bottle I drink a lot of water throughout the day I try to get about a gallon in per day I'm really big into fitness and everything like that so you know I try to keep my water level pretty high throughout the room you can find some other knickknacks throughout it there's some tripods in the corners there's some light boxes we typically use for YouTube videos my girlfriend I use some for her jewelry business to take product photography and everything like that in fact we're actually looking at upgrading to maybe more of like an LED style and you know we'll keep you guys posted on that so but uh yeah this is pretty much straightforward of how the whole office setup is and it's where I spend a lot of time at it's completely centered around kind of what gets me productive throughout the day in a very special place too but uh yeah guys if y'all enjoyed this video make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday I will be back in action next week like I said just getting over COVID and everything like that I'm perfectly fine though with my quarantine and stuff like that so sorry
