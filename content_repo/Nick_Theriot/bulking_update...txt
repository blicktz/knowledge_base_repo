sponsorship from anybody like it doesn't have to be a big company just so that you can like promote their brand you know uh have someone support you on a long year of your journey that'd be awesome

back till not gonna break all right guys that was the finish of that leg workout um i know we didn't record a lot of it and i'll post the workout on the screen but all i gotta say is there was a lot of sets a lot of reps so even though it didn't look like much so much of single sets it was all about high volume uh we kind of like pyramid sets where we worked all the way up to like five reps of
