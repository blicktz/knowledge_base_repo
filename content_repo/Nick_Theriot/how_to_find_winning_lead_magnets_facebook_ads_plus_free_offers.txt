Hey, what is going on guys Nick terrier here and I want to bring you a free video Value-packed video regarding testing free offers with Facebook ads Probably one of the quickest and easiest ways to validate a funnel at a very very small Basically time investment About a hundred two hundred dollars of Facebook ads before you actually launch and build out a funnel that takes time and days And spend a bunch of time testing, you know lead magnets and PDF guides and creating all that that just takes a lot of time I'm gonna show you in about a how about a hundred two hundred dollars in a course maybe three or four days You can actually test this this idea to where you can see what people are interacting with and what You know, it's how believe the magnet will work for you Now this can be applied to any offer whether it's a coupon for a local business for a percent off or just a dollar amount off Or even online business for a percent offer a coupon or a dollar amount off a webinar a PDF guide or a Sales call or a learn more coaching calls type thing Any top offer, you know, maybe a few products jam pack together Any type of offer you can create you can test it through this way It's basically just taking Facebook ads running a messenger objective and then You know basically just saving you time, you know, a lot of people they get this offer in their head They start creating the you know the content they come there I spent all kinds of time create a PDF guide they build a funnel out with a landing page CRM, you know integration if you are my emails They do all of this and they spend a whole bunch of time They launched it with Facebook ads and basically no options come in they barely barely getting any engagement on Facebook And then just people are simply just not interested in it And if you pay for someone push, you know, we got a bunch of money Basically wasted and it flops in front of you and you're just like what the fuck? You know why didn't work something's wrong, you know, it's the offer that's not right, you know You could do it all over again and boom You just waste a lot of time and then you can be doing it to be productive in building your business So, you know you get kind of upset and stuff Um the solution though, you can use about 100 to 200 dollars of Facebook ads to allow data driven decisions I'm gonna show you the second and then you want to go ahead and First before you start doing this you want to start funnel hacking you want to go find other people in your niche Figure out what they're doing to get people into their business and then get some ideas off of that And then you want to write about write down six different offers you can test So right now I want you to go ahead Or you know after this video step one is to release the go ahead find six different offers that people are doing already in your niche So, you know if you're in the real estate niche, you know generating leads for you know Realist relators go ahead and go find top ten relators that are using Facebook ads already find the lead magnets They're using they're just getting results. I mean honestly Facebook so transparent now You can just go look at their info and ads go find their stuff their lead magnets write down six different ideas based off of those lead magnets and Then we can use them to test them and I'm gonna show you all this in a second So here's a campaign I ran for one of my businesses.

It's a detailing company I own and You know, I just did a quick test for our high-end ceramic coating and it's about 1700 to $2,100 product and Basically you add a few different ones. Hey free extras if you purchase you get a few free things $100 off if you purchase it if you purchase it you get 25% off or if you purchase you get four free details on top of that Four different offers all with the exact same ad copy and ad image The only thing different is you know, I have one call the call to action is different for each one and they call it action is the offer so Purchase now and get four free details purchase now get 25% off send message to claim simple purchase now get hundred percent hundred dollars off send a message to claim purchase now and get xyz extras for free send message to claim now simple And then I basically ran it for I don't know I think three four days I spent a high amount of money So I'm $145 I quickly tested and I got some actual data back So right now this is just the performance you can go right here performance and clicks And you can actually see the data backed Decisions you can make from this so if they're all the same and the only variable Different is the offer and Facebook's feeding this out regardless of how much you spend I mean obviously this is this one probably could have spent a little bit more maybe twenty to forty dollars You know this should have been a little bit over twenty dollars for this one But for overall I got some pretty good data back from it and I'm still this one performing really bad on the click-through rate You basically want to look through at the click-through rate. So basically people clicking on this side more versus these When they all have the same thing just a different offer.

Why would people click on it if they're all the same? Obviously, it's the offer they're clicking on it for the offer So this one of the highest click-through rate in the logos lowest CPC which is cost per click Overall so and then basically just had some message to claim now and this one only had had less but also I spent less than this one So that's also another you know thing why it's not really worried about how much I spent right here Versus you know the messenger objectives now conversation started so basically what I did was I just ran a simple messenger objective ran these ads all at once targeting one audience and See what the audience replies how they respond to and then now I can say hey, okay There's three extras one right here. I can start building out a funnel for I can build a landing page now I can build some you know CRM behind it with a few multi emails and I can do all this now and Go ahead and you know start building out the funnel so That is what I can do within that business and then you know now I can start scaling in and put some money into it because I have the data back It's been 145 dollars.

That's it And I think this took me about 15 minutes 20 minutes to set up and I'm gonna show you how to set it up really quick in this video Within the ads manager, so that's it. I said that I let it run about three four days. I came back to it I looked at the stats and boom now I didn't feed let this one feed out enough so what I should have done was pause these three And then just let this one run to force Facebook to feed money to it and then see what kind of results I would have gotten back you definitely want to run it for you know, I recommend about 16 um 8,000 impressions overall honestly, I recommend at least try to get each about three to four thousand Of impressions on each one and like I said this one didn't just been a little bit more money on it Some people recommend spending about 8,000 impressions on each one, but you know that might be a little hard especially Will require more than a hundred forty five dollars I mean 100 $200 so as long as you get about 2,000 impressions each Basic impressions is just how many people it serves it to so that way you can kind of know you know hey All right, you know based off this amount of people You know we have enough data behind it or we know that's been sent over You know enough people's timelines to where you know we can kind of see that hey a lot of people viewed it You know if this not people still viewed it and this you know, we're still getting these type of results can you know kind of confluent Together or fluent together Then you know we can go ahead and start leveraging money into this specific offer now within our business, so How do we set all this up?

uh notice person i brands learns uh Just organizational purposes So i'm gonna hit confirm And then i'm gonna go back to it through the ads And then i want to go ahead and just simply duplicate it and what this allows me to do is literally keep everything exactly the same But i'm just duplicating the ad now The camp the ad set that we set the 200 spending thing Controls how much money you spend So you can have six different ads within the asset that doesn't mean you're gonna spend 600 per ad because it's like a folder in a sense And it distributes the money to each one So now i just duplicated the ad and i literally just want to change to call the action um So let me just do this one three ways to build a loyal following as a personality brand Are you a personality brand i'm literally just going to copy this I'm just gonna put learn three ways to build a loyal following as a personality brand Boom And look that's all i changed and then i'm gonna go up here For organizational purposes learn Three ways Again, just short just quick something that i can remember hey that was that that specific campaign or a specific offer And i basically want to do that for all of them right here Um, and then you can allow them to run Uh, just like i showed you at the beginning of the video Uh in those specifics so And then like i said guys you want to go right here columns performance and clicks and you want to spend about 100 to 200 dollars i'm not going to load in all of them because you got you guys get the point You want to keep everything the same and just change the simple offers Call out your audience put the offer tell them to send a message to clean now And that way you have you know actionable data because you know hey they're all the same ads just different call the actions So you know if it was say if i did a different image for each one Just the image might pop up more in that image timeline so you might have a higher click rate Just because that image pops up in their headline more so you want to be aware of that type of stuff That's why you only want to change the offer and that way you can make actionable Data-driven decisions right first off and just you know randomly pushing out stuff Out there and spending a bunch of money on you know For instance different guides and stuff and building all these funnels and spending a bunch of time so I mean this whole video is 23 minutes long and i was with me explaining everything so you can build all this fairly quickly Uh in your ads manager Um obviously you will probably have to get some facebook ads knowledge But this is a lot quicker than coming there and you know spending a bunch of time Uh you know building out of funnels and stuff so guys I hope you guys can learn about this now again I don't know if i mentioned it in this video you will have some collateral of people Basically opting in and you don't actually send them this free offer When you test these offers so you're probably that's probably one question you had this whole video is well What if i don't have these offers set up yet? That's okay Because what you do is you're gonna have collateral, but you're only gonna spend 100 to 200 dollars Um and again, you know it's up to you between that you know you can spend 150 and call it like that So it's whenever you think you can have enough knowledge.

Um, I recommend about 200 at most To really see and if you don't get anyone to opt in you know Through the offers, uh, then i definitely recommend kind of changing stuff up and testing some new set of offers So, um, if you have any questions, please drop a comment below If you agree with this type of method, please let me know I would love to kind of talk to you about your opinion And like I said, you will have some collateral of people opting in and you just tell them hey your system's down right now You know, uh, it's not ready yet. Uh, I use this to validate a business idea that um, you know quickly tested it It it worked it got really good messenger rate So now I want to decide if I want to pursue that business idea or not But it's just quick ways to use facebook's algorithm and everything or not really facebook's tools that it offers to you Um, oh and one thing I forgot to show you guys real quick when I duplicated this one Uh, you want to go back to edit right here. So this is the three ways And you want to go right here.

So this custom template, uh, you want to get rid of that one You want to create new Basically, this is the messenger thing when people message page you want to change it for each ad Uh, quick reply, um, and then just put you know, I want my three ways to Uh, I forgot what this one was build a lot of following Finish finish publish So, um, you will have some collateral and that's okay. I mean if you're targeting the whole united states, you're gonna have 0.0001 percent of people No, one's gonna leave a bad review or anything like that Uh, if they do just turn off your reviews or something you will have some collateral Maybe even test on different page. You will have some collateral, but that's okay This is how a lot of other big digital agencies test these different offers and stuff for funnels Um before actually launching them out Help save their clients time and attention.

So just tell people hey, um, sorry for the inconvenience systems down We'll notify you when it's ready and um, you know, or we'll notify you when you can validate your offer Sometimes you can just give people the offer as well So guys, thank you for watching if you have any questions drop a comment below remember to subscribe And if you're not signed up yet with click funnels, please just my affiliate click down below and also active campaign for sales crm software Guys, thank you for watching.
