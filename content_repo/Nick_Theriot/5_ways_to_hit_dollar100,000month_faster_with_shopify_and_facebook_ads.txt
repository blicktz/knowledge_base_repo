five ways to hit a hundred thousand dollars a month faster with your shopify store coming from someone who spends close to two million dollars a month on facebook ads for my clients and mentoring over 100 plus students on a monthly basis around building facebook ads so with that being said let's go into number one number one is desire we're working with a personalized products type of business back in 2020 and you know with this particular business right here we were stuck at like a thousand dollars a day for example and we were stuck we were stuck scaling and all of our ads were just kind of like here add your name personalize it boom boom boom and then one day we kind of realized that hey we were too much focusing on the product and what the product does and we weren't focusing enough on the market and what the market won after going research the market wanted basically a gift for their sweetheart so what did i do i literally went ahead and said the perfect gift for your sweetheart our personalized you know product itself then what we did was is we take a step further and we went get some content shot with this product and then like two girl a girl and a guy basically holding the product and like loving each other with the product in their hands so that way we can really articulate that desire of what people are looking for and also to call what they want when we're able to do this we're able to scale up to ten thousand dollars a day with that particular ad because we stop focusing on our product and we start focusing on our market and when our market wanted and creating content that appealed to our market's desire so this can be very very powerful for your business if you're not hitting on the right desires inside of your business and channeling those onto your product it can definitely leave you lagging behind in terms of other desires so there will be some desires that are a lot stronger for your product and some desires that are kind of average now do you need to consistently keep testing desires all the time no you will get to a point where you've tested them all and you're just kind of really nailing in on one or two that are driving majority of the performance for the business now number two is awareness levels awareness levels is pretty much how far or close someone is from purchasing your product now awareness levels kind of deals with a a couple different things there's the unaware market which these are just people that are separated by characteristics so for example moms who are pregnant that is it it's just a type of people now problem aware people are like moms who are pregnant and are prone to like maybe some type of a birth birthing problem right there now solution aware market are like moms who are pregnant who are prone to this particular problem but they're aware of a solution to fix it so they're after this particular solution right maybe it's pilates every week i don't know i'm just saying something random here that could potentially affect this birthing problem then product aware which is moms who are pregnant who have a problem of some type of birth like birthing problem who are aware of the solution for that problem which is pilates and then product aware is they're actively looking at a certain particular gym so like or like pilates gym so they're aware of these couple different gym names and they're trying to figure out which gym name or which gym is best for them to go to these pilates at for the birthing problem because they're a mom who's pregnant and then lastly is aware which essentially aware is is they're aware of all the different gyms they can do pilates at they've chosen one and they're just waiting for the right price for that particular gym which is a little bit more expensive so just kind of waiting for that right price for it to come so awareness levels here we have this one particular product it's an ambulance insurance and we were spending about ten thousand dollars a day for about six months straight and we started to a point where our cost per lead target is about 35 and we started hitting around that 44 45 mark so we're actually underperforming based off of the client needed i also too was running this for six months so it's about 180 days spending 10k a day it's about 1.8 million dollars over six months i personally thought maybe hey just maybe maybe we reached out everyone in this market and we just need a whole new offer but the marketer in me said okay what awareness level we're targeting now we're targeting problem aware and we created for six months that's 24 weeks and we created two to three new ad concepts per week so we tested somewhere around 48 to 72 ad concepts which is about three creatives per concept we test about 210 ad creatives over six months in the problem aware market so what we did to spend more and go from 10k a day to 15k a day was we reached out to that unaware market so we called out a characteristic about our markets and then we we highlighted on the hidden fear of losing money so what we did was is we called out little known secret about medicare so the dominant audience the common characteristic amongst our audience who had a problem or like a fear of ambulance bills was that they were all on medicare so we called out medicare we called out there's a hidden secret in medicare that could cost them a lot of money now this appeals to everyone with that characteristic and it's a much larger group of people outside of that problem aware market because we realized how small that market was of ambulance insurance bills and then what we did was is we were able to find new winning ads on this unaware market and we're able to scale from 10k a day to 15k a day ad spend and we're able to drop cpl down from about 45 all the way down to 30 to 35 dollars so yes it was massive case study right here and awareness levels play a huge part do i recommend you go up or down the ladder it just depends on your market you know like a t-shirt for example is very solution aware do you need to go to prom aware or unaware no not really that's where you start looking at like sophistication levels also and focusing more on brand identity and just having a better t-shirt you know if you go to like the the cars and stuff like ford versus dodge and stuff like that they're focusing on like better features than other cars they're also focusing on better identities i don't think of like jeep for example they focus on an outdoor kind of identity look at like ford trucks kind of focus on like the workhorse type of things right there so you also have kind of like sophistication levels which play another role but for the most part awareness levels can be really big for the marketplace of helping you reach more people because you might be currently limited by the number of people based off your messaging and you just need to expand your messaging to reach more people now number three is renaming your product or introducing a new process to result so let's say for example everyone's selling the same water for example all right if everyone's selling the same water what essentially happens here is that there's no difference right so everyone's selling the same water there's no difference who do i pick it's just pretty much gonna go to the one that everyone started off with so what you want to do is you want to introduce a new process result what makes our water better so for example like fiji water comes from like i don't know where's this come from it kind of comes from like the rainforest and like i think like volcanoes and stuff like that like water by volcanoes and stuff i don't know the full story but it's like they have a unique process of where this water comes from that makes it seem more valuable and also it shows how much pure is it has like a 7.0 something like the pureness factor i forgot what exactly what it's called but you can see right there is that they introduce a new process to result a new way the water is formulated which makes it more valuable something else i can turn back to is my youtube channel i looked at all the other youtube channels and pretty much everyone was hiding a lot of the things that they were doing to get results because they're trying to sell a course or something like that my youtube channel i give everything away for free because i want to help you guys i want to stand out obviously there's some financial incentives if you guys joining my agency and me running your ads or be joining my mentoring where i can review your ads and give you feedback based off your ads and stuff but you know those are very specific to a person whereas like you know for a course content i give everything for free this youtube channel but it separates me from the other youtube channels that are on the markets another thing personally from like a agency positioning i talk a lot about how we create ads that convert whereas all the other agencies says we're going to scale your facebook ads we're going to run this account type of ad account structure these types of things i show them the exact marketing fundamentals we're going to leverage to make them more money with better facebook ad creatives because we've realized that they already kind of know they need to create better facebook ads but how what's that system to creating better facebook ads that's where i introduced our system called emotion baiting and it's how it's helped to scale multiple brands now to multi seven figures a month now number four is switching the persona you are targeting sometimes if you have the wrong persona in type of the ads you're appealing to that can greatly impact the number of which you can charge it also can greatly impact your conversion rate so i'll give you an example really quick i was with this particular mindset coach one of my students before this call or for i did film his videos and stuff like that and this particular student was targeting people how to fix their mindset and how to how to how it can just better their life right and he was really struggling with you know intentions of like making more money and like you know charging more and stuff like that he was looking at different ways to like you know basically kind of rebuild the business i was like look you actually have a relatively simple problem here is you just need to change your persona so for example if you're going to create this mindset course and show people have a better mindset improve their life can you flick that over to a different persona for example the entrepreneur someone who already owns a business someone who is still feeling the same way of stressed and anxiety and stuff like that but you're targeting a different persona and you're linking it back to how it can make them more money because that's what they care about from a desire standpoint so how this particular thing can make them more money that way you're targeting a wealthier demographic you're targeting a wealthier demographic you can afford to have higher rates you can also afford to have a better conversion rate and stuff on your products because essentially just targeting a more financially qualified particular person another example really quick is you know our rates start off like 15k a month for like our agency and stuff of people coming on board so i only allow people that's doing at least 100 to 200k a month to book a call with me on my calendar because i already know i'm gonna get about 50 conversion rate on that particular sales call now if i had people that were booking calls all the way down that would want 10k a month i'd probably have 100 no's on 10k a month because it wouldn't make sense to pay me 15k a month they're making 10k a month revenue with their shop by store so that's a big thing right there i changed my persona to charge more and make more and guess what i'm doing actually the same amount of work so that's also a huge thing right there is the persona you're targeting can substantially impact your results with your business last thing number five is is your product superior in the marketplace are you selling an iphone 4 when everyone wants an iphone 15. seeing this play effect hundreds of times where people come on board they're like nick you want to work with your agency i look at their product and everything and it's just like bro you're selling an iphone 4 whenever one's an iphone 15. this product is not superior at all i can name five products that are more superior than now you need to go find a new product i know it sucks to hear and i know you're like really eager to make more money but this has been the biggest catalyst i've had a student in the program go about two three months no and i haven't longer than that like almost eight nine months in the program the same product kind of just bouncing back and forth like 10 20 30 k a month and then finally switch products to a superior product in the marketplace and he was able to do 200k in december because he found a better product in the marketplace that was just superior better niche all that good stuff so you do have to play a little bit of devil's advocate here because you know you do want a superior product but you also don't want to be consistently chasing products so at certain point you have to kind of figure out all right you know did i actually truly give this product a test and you tested enough creatives around it you really exhausted your options or did you just test one ad around it didn't work now you're going somewhere else that's why i always recommend people to literally go for like a good solid 30 days of a product really exhausted and tested test a lot of creatives and stuff but also to do more research before you pick a product as well you know if you're going to go into a space you should know all the top competitors in there so like if i wanted to go and introduce a new phone on the market i'll look at like iphone i'll look at apple i've got samsung verizon all these different phone brands and i'll try to figure out all right all the negative reviews about these and then we'll go make a phone without that iphone does that every year hey you know what's the negative reviews on the 14 screen size battery life is not as long can't hold as much photos camera quality is okay all right cool let's improve those much better and every year they keep doing the same thing because guess what that's what people care about that's also where it goes back to desire we only really focus on the things in our products that people care about because that's what's going to give us our best results when we bring that product to the marketplace all right guys i really hope y'all enjoyed this video make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and
