what's going on guys welcome back to the channel currently just made it to my desk and feeling drained right now we pretty late last night just a lot of kind of strategic planning and stuff for if you can't paint through running and stuff and kind of figuring out how we can generate a specific client more revenue and lock down a pretty solid UGC strategy so hitting it as early it's 10 a.m. 10 a.m. about to create some campaigns for a specific client for an app installed client in the money mindset space so really cool so let's dive into that showing you how simple it is to just get content done this was literally done for a client really super quick and like literally he just filled his outside with his iPhone and you know we're gonna test this ad right here it's just part of just the process of doing some research we found this cool brand called Everest horology products and they sell like watch bands for Rolexes and stuff and our brand sells Apple watch bands custom Apple watch band so we're we're gonna test the theory of you know kind of replicating some of their ads right here just part of our creative process in terms of like advertising and stuff when we take on a new account or which new creative that's one of the things we do and highly recommend for everyone to do is go out there find other advertisers that's selling your type of product do some research of what's working for them and then replicate it so some people might call us like borderline selling and stuff but I can understand if we were selling Rolex bands as well same product everything like that this is no difference than like you know replicating headlines that's been successful YouTube videos has been successful and stuff like that you're not ripping their things or whatever it is so now if I would literally be selling watch bands Rolex watch bands and then go out there and create a whole site it looks like theirs create all the advertisements look like there so I mean that's that's borderline just but hey that's happens in advertising so but yeah we're just kind of taking the general thing but having issues right now with media encoder right now just being a pain in the ass and this is one of those concepts right here of let's see I'll zoom in this is one of those other concepts right here that I've been really working on is why the hell am I doing after effects work right now I just spent the last 30 minutes on it and why the hell am I doing this as an agency owner because there's a lot of other things on my plate right now I need to fine-tune a few things for our sales team real quick so we can really just massively increase our sales team and I just need to fine-tune a few more things in the onboarding docs I have some new ads some higher level ads like ad strategy some of the angles to be targeting for another ad account and right now I'm playing with after effects so it's like a $10 an hour task so this is something I'm gonna really be more cognizant with I just wanted to get this done really quick and that belief right there I just want to get this done real quick is what happens when is why you have a to-do list of like 50 items at the end of the day and end up with more to-do list items at the end of the day than when you start it and that's something I've been cognizant of about as you can see haven't been the greatest at this little time period right here um but I am getting better at it so with my efforts to be more cognizant about that I created this cool little like time tracking sheet right here and literally just like each week I'll create a different one and throughout the whole week I'm gonna track everything I'm doing by 30 minute marks even 15 minute marks and listing my activities area which inside my activities area I have literally $10 per hour hundred per hour thousand hour and $10,000 hour actions and these two I want to fill up and I'll remove all of them in here so that way it's just these two I'm focusing on everything and these are just all to the side this is outsourced hard out etc so just got off a call with a another potential sales rep that's another thing we've been hitting hard with the agency is literally going through and hiring more commission-based only sales reps literally giving them our system and our proven strategies and stuff to close clients but basically just increasing that outbound as much as possible because we know our process our inbound our our inbound by our strategic moves and everything like that with the creative and strategy and all that is perfect so now let's just massively let's open up the floodgates start closing some more clients that's what we're gonna do right now to really scale up the agency and that's what I just got off another phone call with another potential sales rep okay guys this is the abnormal not so everyday day of life of an agency owner it is currently 12 12 12 o'clock a.m.

in the morning it's late dogs upset say hello to YouTube Xander what's up buddy hey so I don't normally do late nights typically like to try to stick with a eight hour a day work schedule Monday to Friday Friday but we got a lot going on so there's a few key areas right now where we're struggling with we got the the father's day campaign for one specific client that we're struggling to get off the ground throwing a lot at the algorithm right now and not really getting any traction so what we're gonna do is is we are going to be my marketing forum we're literally going to ramp up that email marketing because we have about 26,000 customers we've gained in last year for that particular brand brand and a majority of them are female and the father's day campaign so we're trying to leverage a lot of email marketing just to get some profits in so that way we can make up for some of this a lot of spin we're kind of wasting essentially I'm gonna say I'm gonna say wasting but it's not really wasting because we're testing a lot of stuff right now to get it moving so it's not really wasting it because it's going to a good use and it's something that has to happen as long as you're testing efficiently we're testing as efficiently as possible so you know like I said we're trying to maximize that ad spend and stuff so we got that going on right there so we got to figure that out tonight kind of figure out like hey how much before it's just like trying to move a dead horse like you know hey this just ain't going anywhere how can we flip this how can we rotate this and reposition this all for in a new way so we'll look at a few different key options with that right there next thing is sales team so I had an amazing call today with one sales rep specifically just absolutely amazing I think it'll be really great for the team perfect for it so we're gonna look at possibly just fine-tuning I got everything I need for my sales team the scripts and all that good stuff but now it's just fine-tuning the onboarding documents so to where they can just literally get into our system and be efficient from day one so that's we got to figure out that figure out what's up with SOPs and stuff we need to create documents we need to put together to loom videos and they create so currently putting that right now and then lastly one client again it's it's a client that it's an app client and we're really pushing hard a new campaign or a new you know you could say you know yeah new campaign essentially so and film some new UGC ads as me is like the person for the ad so just hold my phone up to the camera like hey look at this new app it's really amazing and so far I haven't got to really dive into the ads manager but just peeking at it on my phone we're gonna four to five dollar cost per click and I was seeing the two dollar cost per click so we could be getting very very very close but again that's entry level data haven't got to spend for a few days after spending for a few days it's really going to tell whether or not this campaign will take off so I need to create one or two more ads for that and that's just targeting different angles and all that all that is changing up the ad copy so we'll find you fine tune that fine tune the offer for that other client from father's day and then fine tune the sales and operations and stuff so that all has to take place tonight and I got a meeting a day full of meetings tomorrow so it's gonna be an exciting day hopefully I get at least two hours of sleep tonight um we'll see but uh I'll keep you guys updated this is just one of those nights with facebook ads where literally none of the data is being reported this is literally going three accounts refreshing turning things off turning things on this is ad set level and this is all showing earlier no problem at all this is just beautiful beautiful thank you facebook so so last night got a good bit of work done sales operations and everything got some pretty detailed SOPs put together for sales team so as a hiring people just link them one document I don't even need to sit there and train them so really good huge time saver for me still still those two campaigns for those two accounts that talk about is still not seeing the results and yeah it's uh it's one of those that's just kind of very stressful right now but little advice that's pulled me through it through it is I know I will figure it out I know I will get there um it's just we're staying optimistic and not falling in that mind trap of I can't do this results suck I can't deliver results I can't run facebook ads etc since you follow that mind trap that's never gonna succeed but to succeed with that you gotta stay with a positive mindset optimistic and everything um try one thing if it doesn't work try another thing because you're gonna get there if you keep trying and that's that's exactly what I'm gonna do today I'm just gonna fire up another round of creative whole nother round and uh just tweak the copy and everything like that and we'll see if that helps out with everything so I got about two hours of meetings to jump into uh one company I work with uh we've run two of their ad accounts so literally for jump on the call for one ad account then jump on another call for the other ad account because it's a lot of different team members part of it then good work luck and then uh I think I'm gonna sell us rep call today but I'm bad as bad can be so bad that is hard to believe oh what they say about me I'm bad I'm bad as bad as bad as me I'm bad take a look and see so bad campaigns as well because most of those advertisers were spending so heavily on the both um you know somewhere in there break even and now we start you're you're you're obviously you know uh you know very professional with ads and and and very good in that lane now put together you know the business piece of the content team and stuff and uh and even other little things my customer service team you know us moving to fedex I mean there's just a number whatever you know it's like hey what are we we're we're we're doing better now are we improving year over year I mean you know it's a whole new level so um we're definitely making some big impact so I really just want to get on this call which I know we're running over time I know it's actually you've lost 20 minutes of your time we're going to a party man it's not that you're a busy man so um I don't want to take up all your days so I know the value in it man but uh I can keep growing it's a little bit of time but I do know obviously for I just got off my third meeting I still have two more meetings for today uh we got one with a potential client slash prospect had a call with them a few months ago and they reached out to me and they got everything in place because I have a specific criteria with every single client um I want to make sure that they have in place before I take them on board and then I love a new uh a new gold leap over too yeah yeah and yeah last month you're still going the same thing because you get that piece of content in from an influencer well then you need to send it over to NLC to get edited right um I'll forward you over did you get the usage content yet from Pernita? no I haven't that was the thing I was going to ask you because he didn't even respond in that uh in that group message Saturday morning right now sipping on my greens it's a little 10 a.m. um um wanted to get up at 7 but then I'm gonna take it up like 9 30 so uh had a pretty late night last night yeah Friday night late night whoa Nick must be getting hammered at the bar no no not actually at all um from like 10 30 to about 3 o'clock literally worked on ads cleaned up 3 accounts um got some new creators rolling so that's exciting part of an agency owner right there so um currently right now laptop and everything got the little dude right there his name is Xander by the way if any of you guys want to know Xander see you boy yeah pretty chill I like to drop him off at daycare it's Saturday so you know typically I like to drop him off at daycare like 2 or 3 times a week just cause I mean in this apartment right here and he doesn't really get much running around time and this dude has a lot of energy so I'm gonna drop off at daycare play with a few dogs I'm gonna go hit up a coffee shop I need to plan this week's videos which I was like cool I got 3 videos to film and I was like wait a second this video this video is dropping this week so I really only have 2 videos to plan out um I already have the topics and like titles and everything I just need to go like put out the 3 key points and I need to refine a few things with the intro and the outro so got those things going on damn I forgot how heavy this camera is so by the way I guess you wanted to know here is the setup right here got a lot of people accident talking about it I got the it's the Canon EOS 90D with the 16-35 Canon lens and the Rode VideoMic Pro this camera right here is literally my pride and joy I'm a super techy person and throughout my whole life I've looked up to having a nice camera like this it sent me back about $3,000 yeah but I've never had something this nice I mean the nicest camera I had before that was a $500 camera and it's something I'm super super thankful to have and be able to use and look I've been on YouTube since 2008 it's 2022 2021 damn getting some things prepared for today's videos and then also do just a few other little housekeeping things for the agency last task of the week is to record content right now so I'm about to get the studio space set up so I'm going to show you guys that right now but basically you got these soft boxes got to set those up got the tripod up and then I've been liking the stand up and record lately I feel like I can just speak a lot better than sitting down better energy and everything so I'm going to set all this up I have one video playing where I'm actually going to show you all the ads I saved for like the last six months so that'll be pretty cool dropping a whole bunch of value in terms of just showing you guys ads I enjoyed and then also too I don't know the other video but probably more of just kind of like a sit down and talk video just cause I don't have much time left before I need to call it a day but yeah and Saturdays is usually my day to just play a little catch up you know like refine anything left that still hasn't been done for the week also too it's a day for me to film content it's only about 1 o'clock right now I usually like to call it a day at 1 o'clock but I sleep until a little later today so not really holding myself back but usually like Saturday afternoon Saturday night Sunday Sunday night just chill, family, girlfriend, dog like I do not want to touch work or anything related to work I'm going to play some Fortnite have some fun, enjoy myself and I work pretty much every other day Monday through Saturday morning I work and you know put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed so let's just set you down right here that's pretty much how I set up the whole like YouTube studio got a light to kind of fill in got our main light I'm ready to upgrade these to some type of like you know LED panels or something just because these work really well but they're very big they're very bulky they're like 40 bucks total for like $20 for each one the bulbs inside of them were more expensive when I had to replace the bulbs but yeah that's the setup nothing fancy and then I got the AKG Focusrite for some really crisp crisp sound I sew a little bit but got this going so now what I'm going to do is actually going to film the content and everything so just a quick recap for the agency this week so if I as I do these videos kind of want to like a recap at the end of the week just how everything went and stuff so recap of the agency we didn't sign on any new clients this week but I did have a sales call yesterday with a really cool brand that we may be starting with so really cool we hired on five new sales reps or six sales reps this week one of them already pulled the trigger and left perfectly okay I love it because you know as an agency owner I only have so much time during a week and I only want to be spending my time with the people you know the right people in my business that's going to help me achieve my goals and I'm also helping them achieve their goals in terms of like monthly you know revenue and income and stuff like that so I'm helping them they scratch my back I'm going to scratch their back simple as that so but guys thank you all so much for watching this video I don't really know how it's going to turn out I just picked the camera a few random times put some stuff together so we'll see how it turns out I got two videos to film and then I'm going I'm leaving the office I'm chilling for the next day and a half having some fun so I'll talk to you guys
