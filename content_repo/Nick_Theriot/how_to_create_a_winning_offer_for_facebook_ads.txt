probably thinking like oh cool nick you're gonna teach us how to do a discount code 10 off free shipping free gift that's not the case guys that's not the case at all okay so first off what is an offer that's the first thing you have to ask yourself is what is an offer okay there's so much miscommunication around what an offer is okay an offer essentially the value you are giving someone for exchange for their money okay value in exchange for their money hey i got this car i'm giving an offer of thirty thousand dollars take it or leave it okay cool so an offer is a value giving people in exchange for their money it's more than just 10 off it's more than just free shipping it's more than just you know a free gift which you purchase okay and the importance of having an offer again that's that's your product that's your packaging that's the experience the benefits everything they're getting everything they're getting and the offer can also be part of the branding if you're you know if your particular unique offer unique offering is that your branding is a lot more on brand and gives people community and things like that long story short the importance of having a good offer is that good offers allow you to scale more aggressively and create quantum leaps in revenue within your business now the reason why i like to say quantum leaps in revenue is because i have seen it from time to time again we'll spend like a year-long process of just testing creatives testing messaging all this stuff around this one product and we just can't really get to go anywhere for this particular brand and then launch a new product that's just a better offer and their business literally goes from on the ground to the fucking stratosphere like the wolf of wall street scene come on like hubert let's throw in a little wolf of wall street scene to the stratosphere that's gonna take this company into the fucking stratosphere because it is the like this happens over and over and over okay um so yeah so that's the importance of having a really good offer but how do we craft one that's the next biggest thing okay now look you guys you can go read a hundred million dollar offers by alex hermanzi it's a really great book but i'm gonna try to condense that whole book down into literally three slides i still recommend you reading the book you can gain immense value but i'm gonna try to make this as easy as possible for you guys to understand this one video so which one of these particular examples would you buy would you buy a twenty dollar pin would you buy a twenty dollar stainless steel ergonomic pin or would you buy a thirty dollar stainless steel ergonomic pin that comes with a year's worth of ink cartridges and let's actually like let me let me do this or twenty dollar just standard plastic pin some your little you know bic i think it's called is what the name of the pins is okay or do you want like a stainless steel ergonomic pin by i don't know matt ray let's see put that there boom yeah anyway so obviously a lot of you guys are probably going to want the thirty dollar one because the thirty dollar one gives you the most bang for your dollar okay but the problem here is that if no if one and if two and three were never introduced to the market okay if these two were never introduced to the market and all that there was was like there was literally no pins at all okay like literally no fucking pins at all people are still using like charcoal or some shit like that you know for lead or graphite okay and all of a sudden someone makes a pin makes the first ink all that stuff like that boom and the first pin goes for sale for 20 bucks okay all you have to do is have to have a pin and that's it you have a pin people purchase it that is it there's no you need to go find a winning offer and things like that because people will literally take whatever you're offering because you're the only one selling it okay now the problem is is that when there's more people that come sell pins now you go from the only one if you're the only person selling a pin on this whole planet think about the money you would make because everyone needs a pin okay so now there's 10 different people now all of a sudden your sales are basically cut to buy nine tenths you're only getting a temple which you used to be getting because there's more competition there's more people purchasing okay more more more competitors so how do you craft a better offer okay so the next thing the first evolution of crafting a better offer is by offering it offering to fix a problem that the other product has okay so in this particular case i'm using this 20 pin this plastic pin and it hurts you know my fingers or you know like kind of like that space between like your thumb and your first finger like it just it's getting sore i'm getting my hands are getting all cramped up and like that and then all of a sudden i create a 20 stainless steel ergonomic pin you know you put this thing in your pen in your hand you can write for hours you don't get hand cramps anymore now all of a sudden i created a better offer because it's the original product everyone started selling but now my product does all that stuff plus without the you hate about the first product okay so now all of a sudden people are being more inclined to purchase this and honestly you could probably sell this for a little bit higher because it's a better product so it's not always the case of hey we can't we can't charge more we can probably charge a little i mean we like a lot of people think you have to charge 20 for all of these it's just a race to the bottom but you can actually charge more with a better offer because your offer is just a better fit for them now obviously it feels insane if it's like 50 bucks it's to be hard so that's why price point does do pretty good so now all of a sudden all your other nine out of ten competitors are all the other nine competitors all of a sudden now they start selling the stainless steel ergonomic pin okay so now you're like how do i differentiate myself between all these other competitors well you realize that hey no one is selling ink cartridges because hey we're selling a stainless steel ergonomic pin as well but the problem is is people use it for three four months and they have to come back and buy a new one so what if we included at least a year's worth of ink cartridges inside of their initial purchase now all of a sudden we can sell a 30 offer and people will tear it up because now all of a sudden instead of spending 25 every three or four months now they have at least a year for only 30 bucks now obviously you know that might actually be a bad business decision if you're looking at it from an ltv perspective so that's also something you have to look at too as well but just for the sake of this example that's where we're calling it from so this just shows you how to craft a better offer now what's key here is that you're consistently looking at what other people are selling what other offers are on the market because if you analyze all of those you can understand what's the standard because a lot of you guys are trying to sell products below the standard of what everyone expects so first thing you're going to do is figure out what the standard is then once you figure out the standard you can figure out what you can improve on so figure out the standard of the market then what you can improve on how you can offer a better offer or service delivery things like that and we're going to go into in the next slide of actually how to improve that so again if no one was selling a pin you could enter the market of a 20 pin like no one's selling a pin here you go 20 bucks buy it take it run with it you'll crush it you'll blow up you're the first person ever to offer a pin on the market okay now when if everyone was selling a 20 pin exactly the same how do you differentiate yourself now there's three three particular key areas right here okay three different routes you can go you can offer a pin at a lower price you know you can figure out how to make this 20 pin you can figure out how to make it you know for three times cheaper while you know and then you can offer a slightly lower price and all of a sudden boom there you go and that is one route again there's nothing wrong with that that's just another route but a lot of people watching these videos compartmentalize the fact that to have a better offer you gotta offer a better discount or you have to offer a more aggressive yeah you have to offer lower pricing but that's not always the case in fact look at iphone every year they offer a more expensive iphone but with a better offer in the terms of it has more things that's better about it and guess what every year people buy it so the next level you can offer a pin at a lower price or we can offer the pin on the same price or a slightly higher priced and offer a new and approved version what is everything people hate about 1.0 and offer 2.0 without all that they hate then all of a sudden now you have a better offering okay now number three or c in this particular case is offer the pin at the same price with bonus items being the second order problems that are created so now all of a sudden i purchased this 20 pin but guess what my problem is in one month from now the ink cartridge is going now all of a sudden my new problem my second order consequence which is basically when a second order consequence is the is the consequence that happens due to something else another problem happening so i look i'm probably doing this i'm probably saying that completely wrong but that's basically the case like you would never have the problem of needing e-card to just if you never bought this pin but now because you bought this pin i have to buy in card to just that cost me money you know you never have to worry about washing your car spending money on car supplies like to wash your car until you got a car and all of a sudden you have to wash it all of a sudden you have a problem of oil change now you have a problem of gas you have never had that issue if you just didn't have a car so same thing here what are the second order consequences so now the new problems that are created because of this pin is that i have need the need for ink cartridges so you've got to look at what are the new problems that are created in someone's life due to them purchasing your product these aren't bad problems for example but they're new problems look at apple you buy you know you buy your phone from them and all of a sudden what are some new problems well you know new problem is i want a lot of music well here's our itunes subscription fills you up with all this stuff you know might have a problem with i need a phone case now to protect this really expensive phone well here's all of our phone cases in that perspective so you really have to look at second order problems that are created and that's another route to go so you have three different routes to improve your offer first off is just offer the product at a lower price second one is offer a new and approved version and third one is bonus items um you know for it that's also like going to help out the second order problem now another thing here is you have to do your market research really good because if you do not do your market research you won't know what the standard is and if you don't know what the standard is you might enter the market at a bad what a bad offer and you will never know so you need to do some market research you need to really research your competition amazon listings all this stuff right there and really figure out your unique selling points or you your offer or like what the standard is so you can improve based off because if you don't know the standard is you don't know where your offer is that if you don't know where your offer is that the likelihood is you have a bad offer so you need to understand what the standard is across the market and then how you can improve and create something better so hope you guys enjoy this video going into offers this is something that i really want to start venturing into um at more education in this perspective because it's something that a lot of people lack and it's like the single biggest action you can take to make a quantum leap and stratus you know launch your business into the stratosphere by having a really great offer so thank you guys so much for watching
