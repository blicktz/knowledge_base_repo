any purchases get a roll of paper towel five dollars off for first order buy one and get second 50 this is too much going on right here just put 10 off 20 off that's it that's all you need that's all you need yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have a pretty unique video for you guys i will be reviewing over 200 ads on today's video basically over the last two months i've been just screenshotting ads i see on social media and i want to actually go ahead and review all 200 plus with you guys i will be going fairly quickly but just to get you guys some insight of what some of these good ads look like and what some of these bad ads look like so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit that subscribe button and hit the like button if you enjoy this video as i post weekly videos on facebook ads e-commerce and overall just marketing in general and with that being said let's jump right into video guys so let's jump into it i'm in my iCloud photos i made sure i opened up the right album because i didn't want to drop any unexpected pictures for you guys that may scar y'all and possibly get my channel demonetized so i have over 235 photo or have 235 photos in this specific album and basically like said over the last two months i've been just screenshotting any ad i see that catches my attention on facebook so let's get started uh first one right here is by cherry um they sell some of these necklaces and stuff it looks like got some pretty cool engagement on it so i guess they've been running it for a while um handmade pieces custom designs and the headlines so it's basically just stating exactly what the brand does and also and for the copywriting it has to create one of a kind piece as as unique as you are so it captures people's attention it gets that curiosity spike um you can clearly see the uh item being shown off so you're not confused if this is a pretty far out shot i love lifestyle photography but it does have a fault with jewelry because it's far away from the picture and people are seeing like five other items it's hard to tell exactly which item you're showing off so they did a very good job but a nice close-up shop shot clean easy to see a very good ad let's move forward i can't really tell you guys if it's like you know converting well because just from seeing from an outside perspective impact dog creates uh this is a really this is actually in a retargeting ad and the reason why i say that is because i've actually viewed this website um literally just found it on google landed on this website and then about a few days later i started getting hammered with ads um a lot of these ads that are specifically saying 2000 plus reviews the last doll crate you'll ever need basically just hammering into this thing this creates the best doll crate ever and this is a video but simply it's just a fast face video that is just stating all the cool stuff about this specific dog crate so made of high-grade aluminum all kinds of other cool things about their brand very good ad because it shows off the product it states the social proof and also it states a bold statement which is the last doll crate you'll ever need so arouses some curiosity overall very good ad um it's also an instant experience so this is the dog crates i looked at right here and instant instant experiences you lead with a photo or a video um for those so again another dog crate ad i said testimonial for some social proof only dog crate you'll ever need guarantee so again another bold statement world's most trusted dog crates made in american one-short lifetime guarantee so literally everything in this specific ad state something that the um the consumer would enjoy and again all right this is alphalete uh i'm a huge fan of alphalete this is a retargeting ad and it's basically just saying hey now available now i do have to say um it probably could lead more into this ad because it just says now available and it says shop our unique product collections if i were alphalete i would go ahead and put something along the lines of a hype up video saying you know this collection just dropped and that way i'm a little bit more aware of what dropped what is available now is the girl available or is the clothing available what is available uh again impact crates showing off financing to overcome any objections with because they are expensive they are probably around 800 so showing off um a barrier objection of their price i i mean again like seriously and again this is a really good one because it really speaks to your ideal audience as it's saying houdini proof and a lot of people with dogs um that have escape artists they call them houdinis so uh it's kind of like speaking to our ideal audience we have a 10 year dog damage warranty so stating a very specific claim about their product awesome finally something else okay so um a testimonial uh surprise someone you love with the most thoughtful personalized gift speaking of emotion really digging into someone's emotion and then personalized canvas gift so specifically what this is so um it's pretty cool because yeah you can customize the names right here so that speaks to me what this is other people love it and kind of like what i can do with this i swear i forget another impact dollar crate awesome all right um i've never been to this brand before uh okay so let me restate that again a family gift code i actually visited our website so i this is a retargeting ad i've never visited this brand before so this is a cold ad um or at least likely a cold that because i don't follow money on social media and best case i ever bought so it's specifically just stating you know how awesome this product is um yeah i mean i don't know nothing really super catches my attention i do like how well this is put together though this looks very clean you can see a nice detailed shot of the product uh but yeah this right here i'm just like what what's going on what's it's so much going on that it loses my attention a little bit uh but if you start off first and and specifically for like a instagram like story ad if i have to think for a second i'm swiping away so this one right here best case ever bought chart simple sweet i can see the product boom all my attention is focused right in the middle i come right here i i see the sharts but i don't know i just i feel lost like if you jump from here to here i feel lost just me i don't know our new tie-dye has arrived um this one again is a cold ad this is a cold ad right here uh just creating awareness that a new tie-dye has arrived um this is a story ad so the thing about story ads is you want to keep your text short and sweet like this you want to be just be quick boom our new tie-dye has arrived best case ever but what's going on here so uh this one right here uh this i can't consider name d voyeur a leaders in design and quality this is a retargeting ad right here probably a collection ad because i did visit their website let me look at a few of their key pieces and the cool thing about this one is they state something about their products the leader in design and quality so they're stating a claim and then also to they're saying their new collection is now online so this is kind of like a brand deal fear of god exclusively for kind of announcing new products and stuff i know these type of people are very loyal audiences so probably works well i don't know i just don't like this because i can tell this was not meant for instagram the way the images cropped like that in a text this wasn't meant for instagram at all uh it's one reason why i always run my instagram story ads in a separate campaign and one key thing about right here is again it's just stating the best bang for your buck when it comes to copying a chelsea boot that comes across super design nissans and all this text i blah like i don't care don't want to read that show me something starting sweet that's what's instagram story ads are for and you're not leading with any i guess you could say really main reason why i should buy the chelsea boot again another really good example so like which one you think is getting sales uh another retargeting ad i've been to this website before again some of instant experience set up right here um but again stating something discover investment pieces for the new season ahead this one's really cool softest hoodie ever so they're claiming something about their product that's how they're selling this product to you just like saying hey softest hoodie ever people who love hoodies will love that most requested color ever now in olive green so really cool um this may be a retargeting ad because i did kind of visit their website because i'm working with a client similar so i know this popped up after i know the guy that's running this brand he's absolutely killing it he's spending like 400k a month making like 1.6 million dollars back um he's absolutely crushing it um with his ads so can't say too much about it but i think the biggest thing about his is it's always a unique benefit about the brand or about the products now this is pretty cool this is pretty cool i i enjoy this one um it's it's one of those that's just kind of like a lot of colors that make you stop for a second um but again i don't really know what's being sold and i'm not paying attention right here and here my eyesight's right here so that's why i love the the eyesight of putting that text right in the middle this one was pretty cool because it says you know the captain black mat that's the type of boots um i did i'm not too sure i think i've actually visited this site first so this may possibly be a retargeting act because they've been hammering me pretty hard since then and again it's all about like how their boots were made is this so it's like this is a picture but it's a video these are cool i like these um specifically for some some type of people can pull it off really well or just like putting a little these little dots to like different things that's going on so responsibly made custom fitted made to order premium fabrics um this stopped me i was like whoa this is pretty cool so again could work really well so this is really cool um now one thing is i never visited or yeah i never visited this website so i'm not sure why i got this one because it says so close get a free mystery box with your first order when you finish signing up for the box of awesome but i never visited their website so this would be a great retargeting ad um but it's also stating something they're getting you know free mystery box with your first order so it's like basically saying like hey there's a free gift and that's like a trigger to get people to do something talentless premium quality authentic design only shirt worth wearing just simple text right in the middle it's basically stating a big claim uh where would you hang this piece homework finally delivered stay motivated with these inspirational artwork so just showing off these stating some curiosity it's it's making you curious then saying what it is and art is perfect for your home office giving you a free pair of shoes when you sign up for threadbee subscription i want to get one freestyle line for a limited time so this is definitely retargeting as i visit this website um another family gifts co ad reviewed back uh softest hoodie ever all right we can move before one stunning ah that's pretty cool handmade heavy metals so again it's just showing off very quick statement what's the unique selling factor factor now this is one reason why i screenshot this one because it never stated anything like yes it's water resistance you know 20 200 meter dive resistance all that stuff i don't really care but it doesn't really state any major benefits of this ad that would really be shocking because i think almost every watch now is like water resistant up to a certain amount and it's like never even go diving or never do any of that so um i think one thing with this ad right here is going to go into a few more key benefits um to your like exact you know person you're advertising to private row i wear uh this is definitely a few of them i just did screenshot only short worth wearing cuts now this one's pretty cool right here saying some pretty cool blames and again you can see all of these look where the text is at and again you want to run a instagram story ad in its own separate campaign so the placement will be just instagram stories that's why you're gonna see bad ad like this like yeah tell me these new styles are available but like tell me something about it what's special about your clothing again nothing nothing cool product shot though cool product shot but nothing aluminum crates see impact dog creates crushing again another one right there over one million designs beautiful tremendously solid extremely detailed easy to set up so i did not know what this product was until i looked down right here so i would definitely have something that states what the product is so this metal posters right here i put like right here and right here because i did not know exactly what this was until i looked down and there's a lot of people that shouldn't scroll past that and never look at that most comfortable pants lounge pants oh i hit with another one exactly the same thing um just this one had feeling good never felt so good so i guess they were running some of their own unique split tests um this one obviously i would prefer to run because i don't just feel like something's missing with this one right here another really cool one there's coffee and there's feet confit shop by our latest styles and best sellers prefer going all new colors cozy stylist and comfortable so here's all their new products there's coffee and there's feet confit so you know super comfortable stylish love it the last work shoe you'll ever need love this again i think it kind of goes back to the impact dog creates it's stating something something of longevity like walking on clouds so it's like giving you some type of like something to compare it to and then the best all day work shoe so really solid it what's going on here what what uh okay so maybe this would be a retargeting ad because i did visit this website yes it's running shoes but and what's your unique unique selling property what is your benefit what is what are you doing differently that separates yourself from the other running shoes simply just going after style and look get you here but then when you also solve a big problem and get you here it's showing me two pairs of shorts one's five or seven is one's a seven or nine and seam but what's the unique selling property why do you want to buy this and this one's cool i like this one liver protection daily packets 100 100 money back made in the usa daily drinker protect your health so this is a video i had right here it kind of goes through you know it's promoting that right there but one specific thing i would do with this ad right here is also maybe try to find like a dr phil segment or a some type of segment online with a news to really come there and like push that this is probably one of the best things to do that would increase some authority i do have a little bias because i love this brand right here it's right hook digital that are an agency amazing e-com agency but if you look at it six times six x growth and sales facebook and instagram ads for e-commerce brand so it's calling out who they want to do it's driving some curiosity with here's the truth dot the secret to highly profitable so it's saying here's the truth and then it's saying the secret and then it makes you want to click more to read so it's it works well if you're looking at it from that standpoint i guess it's supposed to be a retargeting ad because i don't care you're restocked if i don't know you um 18k start goal starting at 57 again and i don't know cool product shot really cool product shot but honestly i would go further in all right so this is a retargeting ad from zegna i'm seeing a guess maybe not maybe that's not a retargeting ad maybe that's such a type of instant experience zay full limited deals best choice for you code blah save blah so like you see how like this specifically goes into the benefits and why you should order from this brand it's love it doing good i don't see anything or then to work and got can they say it was my browsing history and my both of those depends what so this is all i see for this specific product right here so stuff pocket now this was a few different ads so um this is pretty cool because this is the first thing my eyes gravitated to so i'm imagine the other two were pretty much macros digging in huh what no no no this is probably the worst thing you can do right or buy four get fit for free get buy four get fit for free buy four get fit for free any perfect any purchases get a roll of paper towels what what any purchases get a roll of paper towel five dollars off for first order buy one get second fifty this is too much going on right here just put 10 off 20 off that's it that's all you need that's all you need so i like this but i think i would go ahead and again make it a story ad proper format move this center and maybe test a few different variations of product shots now oh no no okay so this one i will have to give this credit just say like wait for enough for workouts there will enough for the outdoor stylish enough to wear with a button down so this one actually goes to like some coolest things about it promoting the product itself i do like this one again just reformat it we already covered an ad by these guys they're crushing it on the institute facebook side but yeah reformat this for instagram what's going on now that's cool because mom eyes immediately went to odor control abrasion resistant and then moisture management so this would be something that uh for this specific brand um this is your unique selling selling proposition all that stuff works works good i do like that that's cool but again yeah you guys get the point did this just looks like attitude is everything code fancy 3000 get you like i don't know this just looks so amateur when you compare it to something like this what to what reformat that show me it's good genes don't just put a guy standing there show me working from home show me walking outside show me the variety and how this product is used don't sit there and just put a guy standing there and saying all these claims about the product no no no i'll write it no still searching for the one these all right now this one's really cool i do like this one because it's literally lemon and it's basically saying still searching for the one so basically saying hey what you're looking for still searching here's some awesome products here's products you looked at weatherproof versatile jackets do it all they're stating something of what the product does they're weatherproof versatile jackets men's jackets and outerwear they're stating something about the brand how it works with you it's not just 25 off now if you complete your order you know um i think it's just cool of how they relate to that copywriting that's the only thing i like about this is now that you found the one i don't know i have mixed mixed feelings about this one i've visited their brand and now they're just restating so not bad we we have um something similar up for one specific brand does absolutely amazing boots handmade in spain shop our new arrivals before they sell out free shipping and returns free shipping and returns free shipping returns look restate that go deeper so this one would be cool if you know they redid it to where like just athletic fitting shirt that lasts you know they're in your closet reformat this that good stuff no clue what's going on here sleep better improve your performance be ready so i do like that really cool but yeah maybe maybe some different images all right i don't know about that uh what's going on obviously there's some type of text i'm just not saying it now this one's just promoting a special uh save 118 on weighted blanket bundle so it's giving me the bundle so this is a retargeting axe actually visit this website first i like that i like that so um i know legends were crushing them earlier but first it's all performance chart there we go stating something clearly i can understand what's going on we actually got this ad earlier but it was like all messed up from zoom to the living room so this this is a good one because and they even say state shop job shop joggers uh because this was during kind of thorn quarantine and basically it works really well because it's stating something people are going through and stating you know what their ideal audience is probably doing these are probably people working home on zoom they're probably going out there people still have a job so they're probably more of a performance and more or more pricier pair of pants and to living room so just stating what they're probably doing every day so same thing miles imperial featherweight four-way stretch fabric durable water repellent treatment so that's cool joy one shirt for all the ways you train i like it so social proof um kind of like stating something about your about like how you use these and then also to like the pain reasons why you would want to buy i love this ad i don't know why i love it they have some extremely good product photography and i every time i see this specific ad it's constantly coming different variations with the two hoodies super close like that and just i don't know just seeing that hoodie like that it looks super nice and appealing and makes me really want to buy it so um very props to you guys and it's not even the text it's just a good product photography right you're seeing that hoodie in that detail just makes me really like wow looks good what is for sale here the car the boots the pants the watch t-shirt jacket house what's for sale here or is this guy just trying to get some likes and presses you know instagram maybe as a bumble maybe trying to get more exposure on his bumble to us you need to shop the signature collection i like that this one's really cool free international shipping that screams drop shipping to me better quality than bed in a box so i don't know what bed in a box is but it's basically comparing this to that bed in box with less hassle then it states a few things a mattress mattress that lasts something right here something right here so showing benefits in the headlines it's using everything it can um really really good product photography um i enjoy this i like that short simple straightforward there's a new breed of dog collar um i like that smart dog collar cool looking for a new chain jackson's best selling stack is crafted so i actually visited this website so this is definitely a retargeting ad so they called it out looking for a new chain now i did check this website out this is pretty cool getting extra 50 off today with code get 15. this is just a good retargeting ad i'm using a carousel ad works really good because it allows you to capture people who are actively looking at your stuff and promoted discounts again back on board 316 collection um back in stock i've i've engaged with this page in the last probably six months so they're probably targeting just everyone who's engaged and familiar with this brand so that way they're just sitting out this massive ad to everyone um so i think they did pretty good with that and they're stating it's back in stock so i highly recommend that if you ever have a product back in stock targeting all your engagement audiences all your website visitors and stuff like that so like get the most best holds ever i feel like that was really good like all this is at a good but i feel like i definitely see some different copy variations to it and maybe a few different headlines i honestly surprised this even got approved that so a plus for you guys getting approved i don't know i just don't like this this buy three get two free code like you realize how much stuff people have to remember for this okay wait so if i buy three canvases i get two free or if i buy two do i get one free if i buy one i get one free and then this long ass sign hustle b3g2 like what who no one's in a room of that code so then if i buy three or and then forget the code and put five in the cart just to not become free i don't know like just uh salus suture aesthetic thomas fits completely true you need details function buy once get buy once wear forever like that pretty much is some social proof with some major authority again i looked at these products so they're showing me again social proof it looks it looks good it looks good but i just rip stop climber pant what how does that speak to me what is your pants good for so there we go the reed sneaker a minimalist sneaker that gets better of age shop the collection so i really like that um this is cool i'm pretty sure i spelled don't right don't wrong i know the screen's drop shipping to me um good yeah yeah don't care do not care and these people like retarget me almost a month after i visited their website for the first time that's awesome they understand it takes probably like a month to two months they probably have a 30 to 60 day buying cycle but it's products of how long it takes for someone engaging their product and then to actually purchasing now i'm a state because i engage with one of their ads that that's why they're hitting me up with this up to 50% off open box items who offers for you always offer one thing always offer one thing makes it easy for people to understand what they got so i thought this was pretty cool because do what you love longer they understand that these people will be outside doing stuff and solar powered so you don't have to worry about their like watch dying so specifically calling speak considered an ideal audience so i really like the first sentence engineered for hours of lasting comfort shop our latest assorted packs of painted patterns for easy everyday use available now that's cool it's pretty much just stating a review but the reviews kind of chopped off a bit so i would reformat that cool close-up shot but i don't know doesn't really greatest hoodie ever made specific details they're kind of talking a little bit about like what they did but this is definitely retargeting ad because i've actually came there and viewed this website forgot this ad ghost gamer that's what i'm sipping on right now highly recommend it go grab you some honestly this stuff's pretty good it got like 70 milligrams of caffeine per serving honestly just replaced like 3ds and stuff like that for me monsters definitely i'm active on this website and stuff so i know it's just more of kind of just say hey retargeting all their engagement and you know websites audiences and stuff maybe even some previous purchases but ghost gamer delivers an epic combo of brain boosting tropics and natural energy to ensure you're dialed in for an afternoon so boom there we go hitting them straight with a specific thing like what this product does um it's a pretty cool product photography that fits their brand image increase your your session time or gaming i don't know like stop drinking energy drinks drink goes gamer oh this one's cool i like this one because it's the yoga jacket your jacket is lightweight and highly flexible delivering delivering on technology without sacrificing clean style so states exactly what this does it's cool product shot states the product name all that good stuff free shipping blah blah so just testing a few different variations for targeting um so essential fleece jogger range cuff jogger constructed from a durable cotton fleece and treated if high so i would probably restate that more it's what a consumer understands some more cool product photography basically saying how how awesome these pants are and then stating some social proof of it actually working uh this brand just has some really cool ads because the whole brand behind it is they remove the head from every model um so like before the shoot they take like a knife and just cut the head off um so then and they do these really cool shoots and uh i think it's really cool so really really really cool brand um feel bad for all the models though young la now this one the thing about young la is young la itself is actually a really cool brand i've purchased from them before um i would just redo this whole ad cool cool what are you promoting the hat the shirt this one's calling a specific pain point out need to add new revenue streams to your agency question mark yes we got you we've asked agencies just like yours about the services they offer and i've included so obviously um seven agency services for increased revenue um so that's that's really cool headline most comfortable concealed carry undergarments i like that a lot uh so this is going back to i think i already reviewed one ad for them but new release rug and matt and like i said i've actually visited this website so i know this is kind of like a retargeting ad don't care the reason why i say i don't care is because i don't know this brand i don't follow this brand like i think i'm you know like so if i don't care imagine everyone else who's getting this ad that doesn't care that calls for decreased cost per result i mean or increased cost per result because a lot of people seeing this ad that don't care and i already forgot about this brand so not really like love them so it just calls us for a less engaged audience i really like this it says this creative hacks of low ad performance so that's a pain point right there it's driving some curiosity ad fatigue is a real thing so this is just a video going through i can't scale my ads any further another pain point so two pain points and this guy right here i guess this video stating travel in your own terms control your experience your environment and your well-being this is pretty cool i don't even know why screenshot of this all weather ready durable fabrics and high-tech features keep you warm and dry okay shop out of wear uh so just stating specifics uh showing off behind the scenes then making it so i've visited this website so i know fairfax retargeting ad so it's showing behind the scenes and making wow actually a lot of work goes into this bought three of these wooden you know some social proof of the works and better made and built in usa cool i like it now meet the classic sweatpants yeah i feel it i really have no clue why i'm getting so much aviation ads now um i've viewed blender's eyewear website a few times now so i know for a fact that this is actually just an ad coming from funders by retargeting so just kind of hey usher in the fall season cozy we can spend the stuff for your dreams uh just all of this right here just all this wasted space right here i don't care like literally just put something straightforward what these things do oh testimonial i can't even freaking read this no uh yeah pax on unisex wear what you like it's like yeah this is sometimes there's sometimes you want to leave a benefit but also sometimes you want to just instill up action or emotion in people when you advertise to them ah i like this one so this one's literally just saying alcohol delivered to your door get in 60 minutes or less five dollars off when you are through something and showing off boom number one alcohol delivery and it's showing like right there like the app in you so this is a pretty cool ad straightforward very straightforward boots pants him what's what's going on the and that would catch my attention is black rifle company so either they're targeting this as people who like black rifle company but it's just like this is the last thing i look at it's stating some actual benefits and that is it actually so awesome ready guys i hope you enjoyed this video i know this was completely different than what i normally do but i wanted to do something different that help you guys out especially with the holiday season coming around i'd give you guys some ideas of some good ads and some bad ads and stuff i look at and actually just show y'all examples so i hope you guys learned a few things from here i hope this allows you to understand okay i need to go fix up some ads and maybe transition them into this way and let's you know and see if it increases my results so i highly recommend screenshotting ads keeping a folder and using it as a way to have like an archive of ads so if you're ever stuck and can't figure out how to market a product you have all these examples of other people marketing other products and that will help you open your mind up and look for different perspectives you can use so i do this all the time it's a
