hurry up and fill up the Harris shower and hopefully we make it to the airport in time all right get gas in the Harris we are good to go she better still make it on time yeah a little pool for y'all all right let's play the game again can we find a parking spot in this airport this is the small town problems right here of living in a small town and then the airport gets to the point of like literally no parking during the summertime now I could uber but the ubers here take like 15 to 20 minutes just get to your house so I usually just drive here and risk it and we'll find a spot as always at least one spot there was literally a girl walking and like a front row area like she just got off her plane got in the car and look at that look at that there's always a spot open just gonna believe it all right be good girl we'll be back also my girlfriend thinks we should name the Lambo Sasha so for now on the earth so now be called Sasha made it to the airport with actually no problems at all currently right now going through some of the trainings that we'll be doing on the 21st which today should be the 18th when this vlog is actually live and everything so on the 21st exactly well

going over exactly what's scaling facebook ads since 2025 three specific things we've been doing that's been helping us speed up the process of hitting six and seven figures a month in revenue for our clients it's gonna be action-packed people do a live call with me it's limited only 100 people because zoom only allows me to have 100 people in the call that once so first 100 people that show up to the call get the call completely live and then on those who are in my active marketer group I'll be dropping a recording inside of there we'll be going over how we're doing 500k months how we're literally cutting cpl in half for clients this client right here cut their cpl down dropped cost per acquisition and now we switched over to week-to-week reporting so but still that week-to-week right there is looking phenomenal and also too how students are literally cutting their cost per acquisition down by 50 again just go to this link right here it should be the 18th of when this video is uploaded you should have about two or three days to actually reserve your seat just going over client accounts right now we literally launched just these two new ad sets last night july 10th today's july 11th and brand new client so we're currently trying to beat their control right there zero zero four has about 27 cost per purchase both those brand new ads we just launched last night so far eight and nine dollars still way too early to tell if they're successful or not but really cool to start seeing some lower cost per acquisition just getting started also it's cool to see another client up 36 today in revenue at the time of filming this video prime week has been really big and it's been taking a lot of accounts so what we did is we rebranded our current offer to where like if we're offering 60 off site wide year round all i'm doing now is rebranding it so like today we did uh christmas in july rebranded it 60 off i'm not making a youtube video on that so for those who are watching the vlog go rebrand y'all current offers now it's christmas in july it's working really well for us so yeah it's a little insider for those watch the vlog made it to atlanta and it's a 20 minute walk to the next concourse try to get some of those steps and obviously i usually take the train when i'm here from like one terminal to the other but i was like you know what got like literally an hour to kill before my next flight and i needed those 10k steps so why not five minutes down 15 more minutes to go literally seeing a whole different side of lansing last 10 minute stretch check out this never seen this before last little stretch ended up coming up to the sky lounge because it's literally right next to where my gate is at and we just did that whole long 20 minute walk for the gate to be moved so now i have to do another 10 minute walk and we're back to the tunnels of walking also sipping on my lmc right now just get some hydration in already had 30 ounces of water today this is going to be 30 46 and maybe had a couple whiskeys on the plane we got delayed so much on the flight like literally four hours on the plane between like an hour play over for the weather hour layover like two hour flight and then like almost an hour just chilling on the torment waiting but we're in miami now also we finally got the monster if you remember from the new york vlog where i could not find a monster we got one right away gotta love miami i'm gonna grab dinner right now with one of my good friends zach kasterberg paid events.com y'all think about the gray and orange urus should we change it out taking one story elevator they made me toss my orange monster oh the whole crew oh my god yo yo yo yo it's the next day right now currently at jeremy haynes's mastermind one of my personal brand mentors and uh about to have some fun so it's times right here after the mastermind and you are full of food not trying to crash on the couch just met up with sam sam is actually an old student from the inner circle and he's like hey nick you help me out with a lot of amazing things so sam why don't you take him through real quick what uh what you've learned in the inner circle so i uh started working with nick 18 months ago i had maybe five or six thousand dollars in my bank account at the time i was making about 10 maybe 15 000 a month at the time hired him for coaching changed everything and how the way i thought about copywriting ad account structure best practices copywriting market awareness and sophistication like that i took my income for about 50 000 15 000 to about 50 000 a month in personal income over the last six months i've been managed to invest in the past six months close to a half million dollars at this point in about 18 months and nick's been one of the if not the biggest mentors in my life i can't recommend him enough guy knows what he's doing master of his craft a lot of the other people in the space that smoke and nears nick is somebody you can trust you should definitely go to you should trust your precious advertising spend and budget with him so can't recommend him enough yeah thanks appreciate it man thank you very much thanks this rolls this rolls looks so sick damn yeah i like it that spec looks so good pretty new one what's what's currently working on facebook it's already recorded what's currently working with facebook guys right now what's currently working what's your what's your biggest advice for someone running facebook ads uh do some market research honestly i mean i'm not in ecom but we sell tickets to virtual events and i think one of the biggest things people make a mistake on is they will go launch an ad campaign hoping and praying that people are going to buy your offer or click on your ad for you know one of the things we like to do we'll run market research uh ad campaigns where for literally a couple hundred dollars you could split test headlines products offer ideas and just i mean almost instantly within a couple days you have real life data that supports this is the exact offer you should launch this is the exact price price point it should be at this is the exact title of the product or name of the product it should be called and those will make such a difference on the actual performance of your real campaigns most notably we have a client we just did this with where she was selling tickets for a virtual event seven dollar tickets her lowest cost of acquisition was around seven i'm sorry for a seven dollar ticket was around three hundred dollars three weeks later after we did a quick little market research campaign uh her cpas are anywhere from 120 to 150 dollars we literally have them from one market research campaign so that's my that's amazing i know i teach a lot of like market research and stuff and i know uh the dude with the podcast from england uh the diary of the ceo yep he does a lot of that where he'll launch a like engagement campaign and he'll have like a few different headlines and each of those headlines is a different title for his podcast okay um you know what that's actually a good idea i'm actually gonna try that with a few youtube videos do it like just here's my big list of youtube videos and i'm just gonna put that as a bunch of static ads and see what works best yep so but yeah this is zach i already gave you a shout out earlier paid events.com so if you're running a challenge funnel and pay live events he's the guy to go to help you out but specifically on the facebook outside yep we're headed right now to carbone and we're about to see what this is all about just made it back from carbone little lesson here if you decide to go to miami and you decide to go to carbone yes i know drake rapped about it in his songs and all that but a very mutually agreed opinion on carbone is that it's about a six out of ten it's not that great with that being said i want to give you a quick little tour of the hotel room real quick if you ever do stay in miami the place to stay at is the jw marriott this is my favorite place to come here every single time i'm in miami it's in the brickle area which is not south beach but it's more like the city part it's fire so yeah we're gonna grab us a nice little sparkling water let me uh figure this little thing out i get the moss there we go we need one of those and then we also want one of these i don't like drinking the regular red bulls because of how much sugar it is but that's all we have right now solid spot overall nice little room tour let's get the little view real quick we got uh really far away down there a little water a little bay area got a nice little hotel right here about it got the king bed you know that's how we do it and then we're gonna come in here we got a nice little bathroom setup going on about to take a little time a little little quick little 10-15 minutes charge my phone up and then uh me and zach are gonna go grab a cigar red phone booth if you're ever in miami red phone booth solid cigar spot but you do need a membership to get there all right we got the padrone 1964 i don't even know what which one this is but it's one of the higher end 1964s and yeah pretty solid spot red phone booth over here miami that's zach over there zach's gonna introduce this is a cigar world first time smoking a cigar it's not the first time i don't know what i'm smoking give me the bottle let me pour mccallon 25 years let's see how this is definitely recommend i'm a big scotch fan i love scotch love bourbon more specifically scotch and mccallon 25 years definitely recommend final day here in miami today i should be flying out here in a couple hours nice little the the view real quick there we go yeah so yesterday we ended up going to jeremy haynes's uh q3 mastermind i've been to jeremy's group now for about to be four years this december actually i've been in this group long story short it's a group specifically for people like me who have personal brands and you want to learn how to scale up your digital products scale up your offers and everything like that so you have a personal brand you're a coach and you want to learn how to scale up call funnels and like build out your personal brand further highly recommend joining jeremy's group not really an econ group a lot of you guys on this youtube channel know me for like e-com and stuff it's not really an e-com place but for personal brands yes highly recommend that great talk great events couple good golden nuggets we can go take away um definitely have some new things for three new digital products i want to launch which i'll drop more value or more details on that down the line couple other things my flight was actually supposed to be taking off in like 30 minutes now we got delayed all the way it's about 12 30 now and right now it's literally only like 9 30 so we have a lot longer here to stay and i'm also kind of like getting a little worried now if i'm gonna be stuck here for the rest of the day which not a bad place to be at and to stay at but i also want to be back home with my dogs at the same time so that being said we'll go do a little quick little walk along the water get some steps in for the day good old brickle it's actually not brickle it's actually like just across the street from brickle but uh it's definitely still one of my favorite places to stay at in miami it's also another really cool spot right here it's just the ashton martin tower really cool place they'll typically have a lot of the big yachts style park in front of the ashton martin tower right there and then also to my buddy zach they also earlier in the vlog sent me a picture of a gray bugatti that was chilling uh right under there so it was pretty cool and then this right here it's called brickle key brickle keys where a lot of other big celebrity influencers and stuff like that live but yeah check this out this is aston martin tower further let's say they have one little boat over there we'll go check it out this is one thing i like to come about to these events like this in these different cities and stuff it's just to simply be in groups of people that are like crushing it there's a lot of people in the group that we were at yesterday with multiple of them doing million two million three million dollars a month in revenue and these are not shopify stores so fat margins and that's something i love about being in these groups over here because it just helps you think bigger and understand more of like what do you have to do to that next level the biggest thing for me that i've personally noticed is mass market offers and high ticket those are the two biggest things that i think i see between every single person in the room that's going a million two million three million dollars a month it's high ticket mass market offers great example iman godzi brez scales for example he was also in there i know you've seen a few clips of him yeah so that was like my biggest takeaway from just like yesterday i don't have any like quote-unquote mass market offers yet so three different offers that i'm looking at setting up right now is going to be number one just simply how to start and scale an agency so going over how i use the youtube channel to grow and scale an agency the second part or the second offer i want to test out is actually going ahead and building an offer specifically around the whole aspect of running an agency running a coaching program and how to scale everything with that and then lastly is going to be just taking the same marketing fundamentals approach i have now but putting that in a higher ticket program that is a little bit more step by step and kind of done with you in the sense of like the coaching offer which is the inner circle so those are three offers that i'll be looking at setting up so let me know what y'all think of those offers let me know if that's something that y'all be interested in or there's anything else specifically that y'all would see like hey nick we see you talk a lot about this you don't have an offer around it we'd love to pay you for that and we're back that's the building right here we were somewhere right here just now where we're staying at the jw marriott and we're back and just like that we're back in the room and my flight got delayed a few more times so but with that being said we do have to commit and at least go try now and hopefully it doesn't get delayed again but now we're leaving at 12 45 12 45 50 whatever usually at this point of a miami vlog i'd stand on a balcony right here and apparently i'm supposed to give some type of motivational inspirational speech while i moved to miami and you know making a lot of money and stuff like that but no i'm just gonna end it right here yeah miami's dope it's cool to come here for two three days this is like my 50th time being here so it's nothing new for me getting off the plane all right so we got on the plane for the plane got delayed supposed to fly flat at 11 then it got delayed to 1 30 we got on the plane at 1 30 and then we sat on the plane from 1 30 to 3 o'clock 2 45 and nothing a bunch of storms came through so it was either get stuck in atlanta tonight or i already still had an extra night for my hotel over here in miami so i was like well i might as well just get off the plane now stay in miami and then catch a really early flight tomorrow for united i want to be back home tomorrow i got a fuckload of meetings tomorrow so yeah that's the move we're gonna meet up with zach we're gonna go to a uh my favorite restaurant to miami two-star michelin star restaurant la alier joe robachian really good sad reality of coming scan this card one more time to go to 23. i thought i was done unfortunately not and it works i was honestly scared of it not working i wonder if housekeeping housekeeping never came in because i had the do not serve thing on but that's okay like it's a weird feeling coming back to a room that you thought to be honest you would not be seeing again for at least three to four months so yeah i don't know it's kind of weird see all the boats coming in for their little 5 30 p.m little sunset cruise right now let's take a look at that this guy does this guy filming a tick tock oh yeah he's definitely vlogging it yeah it's all right dude this is insane how crazy this camera goes for all right quick little fit check real quick and a louis vuitton shirt back on it's actually the like only piece of designer i own outside of like my wallet and it's the biggest waste of money you could possibly get but definitely fits the miami crowd let's grab some food we going we going we going we going i i see where where you're going but no actually i eat everything because i want to get the planet and my workers also in the industry and he told me to eat them i think the funny thing is is that like when he sets up the uh little like utensils you just don't know what you're getting next yeah it's a little bit of white pepper spice you know uh it's me again you know how i said earlier i wasn't going to do a like motivational miami outro on the balcony you know what i think it's actually time for one because there was one thing i did notice about today and it was very particular when i was on the plane one cool thing about making more money and like being an entrepreneur and like getting rich and all that bullshit like that is the simple fact of you literally do not give a fuck so i was on the plane we what playing at the lane two hours i sat on the tarmac for two hours i watched the new avengers uh i say new avengers avengers end game 2019 real ones no i watched it for two hours before i got the opportunity to get off the plane because they're like yo we're not going to allow like you know anyone who wants to get off you're welcome to but we're gonna try to sit here another hour before we attempt to take off i got off that plane walked to the front desk talked to the front desk for like two minutes and then i walked away and on my way home or on my way back to this hotel i booked a new flight on my app in like two minutes to me four minutes to deal with that whole situation whereas everyone else was going to sit at that counter and like wait for refunds and take that money and go book a new flight where i was just like you know what you know what i don't give a fuck i'm just gonna go book a new flight because what six hundred dollars a thousand dollars it's no big deal at all and that's the thing that's the thing with making more money is that it allows you just to walk through life and not have to deal with all the other bullshit that like broke is up to the way and if you are broke it's your chance to get rich right here all right enough but just had a couple drinks good some good food with zach and everything i'm crashing and hopefully in the morning we actually get on the plane because it you know what i'm actually still a pro key because if i was rich i could fly private jet and it wouldn't matter when i land when i leave it would just be like get here and back and that's it so i'm taking my broke ass to bed well take my broke ass to grab one more drink with zach and i'll see you all in the morning all right it's the next morning let's go see if we can actually get on our flight today and actually at home and look who made it back we are finally back home so we're gonna officially end the vlog here go back to nervous we're doing good thank you all for watching have a great rest of your day
