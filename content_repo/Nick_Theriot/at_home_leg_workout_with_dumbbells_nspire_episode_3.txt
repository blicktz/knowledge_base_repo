I'm finally facing it all Fearless Good morning YouTube. We're about to do a quick weigh-in this morning So let's see where we're at All right, so we're currently sitting at 156.8 And we started at 156.2 so Completely no stress at all that is good. It means we're holding weight We are not gaining weight because like I said right now I'm at maintenance calories and to be honest I'm already feeling like I'm loosening up.

I feel like I'm less bloated I feel my muscles feel more fuller and that's just because it's the first time in like two three or two three more I've actually been tracking my calories and getting the right amount of nutrients in my body So I'm filling up a little bit and just for a visual And like you said just like I said just filling up a little bit and that's it So as the title states we will be jumping into a at-home leg day today I am very hyped up for this workout today because a I got small legs. I need to grow them Two I haven't worked legs literally since the week before the gym's closed It's been like three weeks since I worked legs These two weeks of quarantine so far. I've just simply went running rode the bike and stuff and I've never actually trained legs officially so today be the first official leg day workout even got the Alphalete leg day official shorts on to make those Maximum leg day gains.

I'm about to right now I need to take my morning supplements and I need to clean phoenix's cage He left a few meatballs and then I have a lot of work to catch up on and I'll bring you guys with me on Showing you guys a few things with the digital agency of week-to-week operations Obviously in the morning we got to start off with our greens and I'm going to rumor if I do I'm going to drop a link to all these supplements I use in description They're not really like supplements. They're more of just like things I use to enhance my performance in terms of like krill oil coconut oil I I take raw shilajit which honestly I probably didn't say it right I take you know like I think it's niagen True niagen So I don't really take anything like you know test booster or your typical bro supplements I take just some performance enhancing things that drastically helped out with my like just focus and mental clarity First tour of the morning we need to go ahead and clean out phoenix's cage He did like said he did leave a meatball So go ahead and clean it out his cage Start off with this in the morning He's been very active so far and I'm going to turn this off like last night and stuff I stayed up late and Pretty much still with me so it's my little holding cell farm And what I do is I just collect trash bags or like target bags and stuff And scoop out whatever throw it in there And of course rubber glove That's all you need to clean out a cage King snakes are already extremely docile Um you know I was watching a few videos last night of I forgot what is YouTube what his name is But he has a lot of herping is what he calls it in um Alabama Georgia area Uh basically what that is just going to flip over shit and finding snakes and he found a bunch of speckled kings And he would literally just pick them up straight like these are wild snakes It's never probably seen human in their life And like completely didn't do anything they would just chill them like this so King snakes are already very relaxed There's a few people that do say they More prone to biting you in terms of just because they're always hungry They are pretty much a garbage snake So all they want to do is eat eat and eat so Um, he has no I mean, it's also something else too. He has no things at all Uh, it's I forgot what they're called It's just like regular TPS.

So as like a human your dog and stuff So like a cat bite or a dog bite would hurt way worse Uh than this little guy right here. So that also is what Like doesn't freak me out about Oh my god Okay, dude But if he Say it was venomous or something like that honestly, I wouldn't even own him I would never put my life on the line like that just to house a snake Uh, that's venomous. So even though there is some amazing snakes that are venomous such as the pit viper Um, and the king cobra, I think there's amazing creatures to house So All right, so I look so I can see I kind of put a stick up in the corner kind of wedge it up there Oh, he gives a little bit of elevation and that way I want to be able to like perch up So hopefully that works well.

We'll see how he likes it I Mean you talk about a snake right here that grew up. He's two years old He's grown up with humans his whole life. So we really don't pose any threats to him I've seen snakes before that went for a live feeding For the first time ever and they're actually scared because they don't know anything else Obviously that their instincts and stuff But they don't know much else And also to Snakes can't love you like a dog or something like that Um They definitely aren't the smartest animals at all.

They really are completely um instinct driven animals But what they will do is they will get docile around you and they'll see that you're no threat Obviously you'll have your accidents here and there, but that's okay Okay Currently right now i'm working on some ad copy or not really ad copy some sales copy for terrier solutions I do a weekly email blasts something I just started so basically I do is I take all my prospects I keep them in active campaigns to manage Different touch points of the follow-up process and also to i'll send a once a week I'm gonna start sending out a Automated email to where it's more of just in terms of sales copy and stuff And basically trying to get them on a call so another form of follow-up So right now i'm trying to put together some really good Copywriting something some just bouncing ideas right now of how exactly I want to do it I really like the copywriting that kind of starts off with like a picture or something and then like Tying the relevancy into that picture and like hey boom Book call now with me and we can talk about your ad campaigns and stuff So that's what i'm currently working on right now After this I need to create a post for terror solutions. I need to update their facebook page LinkedIn page and the youtube channel So basically I know something that i've been seeing a lot is i've been getting a lot of traffic to my social channels for my digital agency And as a digital agency, I really never post anything on it Just because I get all my clients through prospecting and stuff on linkedin and Double down on that etc But I do am that I am getting people viewing my social channels for the agency and I want to build up my credibility and authority And if I have nothing posted on those sites first off It makes me look bad as a digital agency owner selling them on ads and stuff Am I posting content for the very least on my own channel? Um that's an issue so I need to focus and fix that as well um Pretty much it yeah, that's it So i'm working on all that I actually did eat already for the first time today and let's see Show you guys what I had um I don't really have a picture of it, but I had 96.4 ground beef.

I already kind of mapped out my meal plan for the day today But so far sitting good So i'm gonna go ahead and take care of all of this And then next clip you'll see we'll be jumping into our leg workout And like I said i'm hyped up for this because it'll be the first leg workout of this current uh prep But also the first leg workout at home, so i'm interested to see what we could put together Uh for this video today I'm really not gonna lie it's currently 3 42 a.m in the morning And I have just started recording this commentary for this video But uh yeah, so today is leg workout This is the first leg workout I did at home since this quarantine And actually like the first leg workout I did in the last three weeks, so uh How did it go it went i'm honestly gonna not gonna lie it went better than I expected I was actually able to do a lot more with weights than I originally planned and I kept just getting Creative so I started off with just throwing some dumbbell lunges And I know for me I forgot what these are called but basically just kind of like You do single so you'd like all your 10 I did four sets of 10 on everything but I did 10 reps on my left leg and 10 reps on my leg and that was a set Uh and then I jumped right here into some front squats Uh basically we have this little bicep curl bar uh with some 25 pound plates And uh you like to a seven and a half pound dumbbell or a seven and a half pound plate and a two and a half pound weight Both sides so I don't know it was like maybe 80 pounds 90 pounds this little setup right here and uh just focusing on that front squat honestly guys it worked really Well, I felt very exhausted just after these and this is four sets of 10 So and this is me coming from the gym doing you know sets of 225 Uh higher reps so but I think what I wanted to talk about today was really just Digging deep right now into all of you guys situations Obviously, we're all in an overall bad place right now Um, you know, you could blame Government you can blame the fire ministers.
