yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriot here and today I have a new video for you guys where I'm actually going to show you exactly how I manage all my ad creatives because once you start building up a lot of ads inside of an ad account understanding how to manage creatives is a big part in your success with Facebook ads and actually how to keep social proof on ads as you start to duplicate them around the ad account because social proof has a huge impact on ROAS especially with e-commerce it's a big thing so with that being said before we hop into this video make

profitably of course okay so how to keep social proof on ads and manage your ads better one problem right now we experience is as you start to duplicate a creative especially if it's winning you know the post engagement gets messed up you lose that post engagement that's the likes the comments the social proof for that particular ad and I know Facebook will like keep the engagement when you hit duplicate on it but sometimes it doesn't work and for me I never get it to work so I'm like okay I need a structure to where we can always keep post engagement and I was tired of constantly you know trying to use the post ID over and over and over every time I want to you know put in a new campaign I would get confused of which ones were existing versus the non-existing so I needed an organizational structure so again less social proof equals less compelling which equals drive results down so we needed a good way what we came up with was an ads holding container so like literally a storage folder inside of your ads account for all of your creatives you're currently using so what we do is we come there we set up a you know purchase conversion website conversion campaign we always leave it off so this is what the name of it literally looks like you just ads holding container I make sure I put a note keep off so we know if my team actually goes in there and like maybe turns it on or something like that and I start to create ad sets as sub folders of different campaigns we're going to use these ads for now this ad account don't have many ads in it but I might have an ad set for like you know holiday sale 2021 direct response all products that's what I have right here in front of us and actually made a mistake in a second which I'm gonna show you we're actually created a bunch of Valentine's Day creatives in here that I shouldn't have done just a little mistake on my end we're not all perfect so with that being said let me show you exactly how it looks like so in type inside of that ad set direct response all products I put all of the ads for this account I create all the ads in here so I go in here I'm gonna create a bunch of ads and what I do is I create all the ads in here so that way I can easily copy the post ID into a new campaign and then in those newer campaigns I can just simply duplicate that ad because it's just an ad using an existing post and I can just keep duplicating it over and over and never worry about anything because the ad the main ad that you edit isn't here now it does may have an issue or two because you can't just quickly edit an ad but this way I can set it in stone and duplicate it to new campaigns um and you know it works really well I've been using a strategy now for two months and it's made an amazing improvement in the way I handle creatives inside of the ad account now another thing is you need to have a consistent theme for your naming conventions this is a huge mistake I see a lot of people make I do a lot of consulting calls every single day with people that are just starting Facebook ads maybe spending you know maybe a few hundred dollars a day and their naming conventions look horrible it literally looks like a two-year-old win that ad account that's just learning how to speak and start typing up random words on type of their ad accounts so you need to have a consistent theme for naming conventions this is the theme we use for our creatives so this is a valentine's day creative we ran campaign so I literally went ahead and for the beginning of every single ad put v-day one for that particular ad v-day two for that particular ad and I literally did all my top of funnel mofu bofu all of the ads pertain to this campaign and even the newer ones I created I kept using that naming convention v-day and a number of you know that associates to that particular ad then what I do is I do video photo carousel dynamic whatever that type of creative is I'm gonna go ahead and list it so right here I photo videos and stuff like that and then the next thing I do is I like to copy the first sentence of that piece of ad copy on you know just to fill up the rest of the meaning the remaining of that particular like ad name so that way it's like v-day 15 is the 15th ad inside of this campaign video and then the first sentence the deadline is order surprise your sweetheart still looking for the perfect so this way I can track individual ad performance so let's say if I just want to type in v-day search all the ads I have v-day in it I can see all of the ads that we ran for this particular v-day campaign and I can figure out which one's performing the best perhaps maybe I want to see the performance of v-day 11 across all of the you know particular campaigns you're running that for valentine's day what is working so I'm gonna type in v-day 11 and just look through all of the campaigns that have v-day 11 running and I can see how it's performing in each particular campaign so there's some easy there's some better ways to track individual ad performance I can even do carousel and look at all the carousel ads running versus video versus photo to see which ones are presenting the best return on adspin for this particular ad account at the moment so there's a lot of really cool benefits to having naming conventions in place and a lot of really cool ways to track performance by using proper naming conventions now to simply transfer these ads into live campaigns all we got to do is go ahead and you know preview an ad see facebook post by comments and then you'll like get taken to this link right here and which one you want to do is you want to copy the second group of numbers and then you want to transfer it to you know use existing posts when you're creating your new ad in your live campaigns so what I'll do is I'll create the ads inside of this ads holding container I'll you know put them in one of these particular ad sets and you can have multiple different ones you could have testimonials as an ad set you could have user-generated content you could have unboxing videos you know whatever like your different types of content and ads you like to create you know create different folders for them and then the key is just keep it simple to where you're going to consistently do it over and over again like I said I made a mistake I was supposed to put all these V-Day ads inside of a separate ad set called V-Day 2011 or 2021 well if only we could go back to the days of 2011 but any way you can go back to the day of 2021 but any way back to this video so again you could literally go create another ad set Valentine's Day 2021 Mother's Day 2021 so that way in 2022 when you create your Valentine's Day 2022 you can actually go back and look at those ads you ran in a very very very simplistic way to compare it to trying to dig through all the campaigns that are active at the moment and again just create them all inside there name them really well if you're going to go back to the day of 2021. copy that post ID and you know transform your live campaigns which like I said the next step right here is to take these creatives either put them in retargeting campaigns or putting them in a cold audience creative testing campaign. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video again just showing you guys exactly how we kind of manage creatives and a really good way of setting up the ads holding container keeping that post engagement so that way we can consistently have you know good social proof on all of our ads which helps with results a lot especially in the e-com niche.
