Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Terry and today I have an exciting video for you guys today.

I'm actually going to kind of dive into my agency operations a little bit and show you guys exactly how we've generated over $15 million in online revenue for clients in the last two years. But more specifically around the operations, kind of like the systems that we have to play, um, that allows us to continuously generate amazing results for our clients. So that being said, make sure you hit that like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

I think fun fact, I think this week we're actually uploading Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Uh, so just excuse this week. And it's just mostly because of, uh, just busy with Easter stuff.

But anyway, let's dive into the video. So how did we generate over $15 million in online revenue in the last two years? So again, you know, just going over a few case studies first, we've helped brands like Gritty Soul to more negative on assets, $2.3 million in 15 months, metal address times from $7,000 per month, over $3 million in revenue in 24 months.

Brands like Icon Amsterdam, from $270,000 per month, doing $2 million in revenue within the first 90 days of us working together. Black gold from $17,000 per month, or $70,000 per month in revenue in six months of us working together. And lastly, uh, you know, Legion client.

I know I talk a lot about e-com, but we also do work with a variety of other businesses. Took this Legion client from $1,000 per day to $10,000 per day at profitable KPIs they're shooting for. Um, and they're doing somewhere around a five to six X ROAS, um, on daily spend.

So just to put it in that perspective right there, they're absolutely crushing it. Now, again, if you are watching this channel and you're always curious about what we charge to work with clients, we charge $5,000 per month plus 10% of increase net revenue. Now this is for us to actually come in your business and take over all of your kind of marketing when it comes around to paid acquisition and the creative route and all that good stuff right there.

You know, if you want more of a consulting or like a one-on-one where we just kind of like knowledge and skill transfer inside your business, we generally start somewhere around $250 to $500 per hour, depending on your situation. And now we work with you on a weekly basis, or you can continue watching the channel and get all the amazing golden nuggets that this channel has. Um, and I will be releasing a course, uh, soon on that.

So anyway, current roadblocks, you're likely hitting in your business. So, you know, you're probably hitting revenue ceilings within your business. You're having to spend more to make more.

Um, you're seeing ROAS going down on ads and you're just kind of sitting in a place right there where you're not sure exactly what to do. You know, do I go test a sneak attack method or bully method from Tim bird, or do I go out there and try AB over or CBO? Do I go out there and try duplicating an ad set five times when reality, it's not even that at all.

So, uh, the cause of where you're at is that you sat down a few weeks ago, you created some ads, you found a winner and you scale that winning ad hard or winning set of ads hard. And then ads started fatigue fatigue. You know, you needed some new stuff in there as fatigued profits are to shrink.

And then you finally made your way back. And this is generally what like I've ordered hundreds of ad accounts. And it's just 99% of the ad accounts that we audit from account spending $200,000 a month to account storing, you know, a couple hundred dollars a month.

Now the new way ultimately of what we instill the system, we instill inside of an econ business, a legion business, an app install business, regardless of the business, the system that we put in place is creating new ads weekly. Okay. Creating new ads weekly, new ads weekly will solve a lot of your problems.

That's gonna allow us to find new winners every single week that we scale. And guess what? We find new ones the next week and then the next week and the next week.

And we're constantly having ads to scale and returning off the ones that are unprofitable at scale. So we might find up 10 winners at, you know, spending $10 a day. And then we move them to scaling campaign and at, you know, a hundred dollars a day, but that 10 goes down to five winners at a hundred dollars a day.

Then when we started spending a thousand dollars a day at five turns into three, then we start spending $5,000 a day at three comes down to one. Well, only one out of that 10 initial winners is like, kind of like the one that can scale really hard. And again, that's why we find new ones every single week.

So we can constantly have a surplus of ads. But the big question is how do you create buckets of new ads every single week? This is the biggest problem.

A lot of econ businesses, legion businesses, app installed businesses, business is in general that are running paid acquisition from a customer standpoint is how do you create new buckets? I'm talking on buckets of new ads every single week. So first things first audience research, you should be doing a minimum of one hour every single week on audience research, which is going to stem a lot of new ideas and, and, you know, relevancy into your ads as well.

Because you'll find new ways people talk about your products. People talk about this pain points, the solutions, all that good stuff. And secondly, a lot of competitor research, you should be looking at your top three competitors every single week.

You should be looking at their ads library. Why? So again, a lot of great ideas.

A lot of people push this site for built right here, for example, pushing a spring sale really hard. Should we also go ahead, launch a spring sale for clothing brands? It's very enticing.

Now, once you actually pull all that in play, you can leverage the motion chart right here. These are core eight emotions we all experience. And you can actually start to fill in this chart right here, based off the data you found from competitor and audience research to start to kind of craft some angles.

And you can basically go through each emotion right here. How's my product add? How's my product subtract?

These specific emotions start life. Then you can sharpen that angle. Essentially, this is a sheet I have as like 30 different ways to strengthen a headline slash hook.

It's just a few of them right here. We basically use some of these to essentially sharpen that angle and make it more of a more enticing in that sense. Now, what do we do after that?

This idea backlog is simply just a Google sheet that we on a weekly basis. We fill up with ideas and whether it's stuff that we create it, put inside of here, or new stuff that we just get ideas for as we go through and having a Google sheet with a surplus of ideas. Every time you see an ad you like, toss it in here, things like that.

That's going to build you up a surplus of ads to where each week, when you go to create new ads, your team can just go to the next one on the list. If you don't really know, like if you can't really sit down with your team and have a conversation with them with what ads they go on, then they can simply just go on this list right here and take the next best thing. Okay.

Now let's say for example, you know, each week you create a new ads and one week you hit a kind of like writer's block. In that sense, you already have a list of ads. You can just be like, okay, cool.

Like, I don't really know what to create this week. Boom. Let's just choose that one and go with it.

So that way you're constantly creating, you know, have a surplus of ideas on the backlog to where you can just pull from. Okay. Very, very powerful.

Like this is a very high priority actions, keeping this full. And then you can choose the ones you want to create and then boom. Now, when you actually plan those creatives, you have to understand the quality of your brief dictates the quality of your creative.

You get a lot of people that say, Hey, incense didn't work. I got a bad ad billow. Didn't work.

I got a creator that was horrible. No limit creatives didn't work because you know, I got, I didn't get what I wanted. Okay.

Got a lot of people that comment that stuff on the channel. And the problem is, is every time we look at their brief, it is dog shit. Okay.

And I'm going to say it like that because it's true. The quality of what you articulate to these people is the level of quality you'll get back from your creative. Okay.

So you have to make sure the quality of your brief is what you want because creators, video editors, graphic designers are going to take that and run with that same, what like you're kind of articulating to them. Okay. So use everything you can use storyboards to map out a video, create a mood board to show off the different types of texts you want in there, the colors, like you got to get specific when you get in that range.

Okay. And this is a very big problem. This is something that we're still always refining inside of our agency.

We're constantly going back on ways of how can we improve our creative briefs? Because again, quality of your brief dictates the quality of the creative you'll get back. So you have to remember that now project management.

We love to use Asana. You can leverage, you know, notion or Trello monday.com, whatever project management tool you like, we have kind of like one of these for each client in that sense, right there, you see our creative angles and each one has a number. So that way we know which one specifically is that.

And yeah, and you can see like right here and I got our idea backlog each batch number. Um, you don't have one listed right here. Like this is like batch number one-on-one.

It'll be tied as well. So one-on-one in here and then frame that IO. This is the next hidden gym of a tool when it comes down to creating high amounts of creatives every single week is you're going to have to spend a lot of time reviewing these creatives and going back and forth with your video editor on that.

So how can you in the most concise and most efficient way review a creative, get that information back to your video editor and then get those kind of revisions done. And frame makes an absolute amazing tool with that. You can basically watch the whole video and add specific timestamps to the video.

And in fact, I have a video review of this tool this week. I'm not sure if it's gonna be before this video or after this video, but you can have specific timestamps and you can also draw and add like elements on the screen. It's like, Hey, you know, in this box right here, add some texts.

Okay. So frame that IO absolutely amazing tool when it comes down to reviewing photos and videos, highly underrated. Now, what happens when you get all of these creatives back?

You know, what do you do next? We love to do simple. Like our ad account structure is super simple because it's what like, we focus on what drives performance.

That's the creative aspect. Okay. So add account structure, uh, creative testing campaign.

Each batch right here is either a new angle or a iteration of a best performing angle in that sense right there. So that is literally it. And we test them on low budgets, we find winners, and then we drop them into our scaling campaign.

That's it. And our scaling campaign, we're turning off the ads that are no longer performing and we're adding a new one. So there's never going to be a point where you have a hundred ads live because if you just keep dropping in winners in there, it's that's unrealistic.

That's assuming that every single ad in here is going to hold performance to the level you want it. And that's not true. Okay.

When you drop ads in here, some will be a winner. Then as you start spending more, it'll be, might be a false winner, things like that. Okay, cool.

We're just going to turn it off. And guess what? We have more because we're creating a fund that's mindset of new ads every week.

It's profitable. And we're constantly pushing in here and it's what allows us to really push and scale faster. Now, let me show you guys some high converting ad examples.

So your ads we've ran for our clients, still running some of these, not running these anymore, things like that. They were winners at one point. They, you know, generate a lot of money for our clients.

Okay. So it's showing you a few different ones from variety of different brands. It's worked really well.

So now obviously some of these are videos and I'm not going to play the video. Um, but you know, Hey, you get, you get some little treats right here for you guys. You know, always so kill up.

So, but yeah, so that's essentially exactly what we do to get results for our clients. We're keeping a good backlog or sharpening angles, essentially from that backlog and creating really good briefs, giving it to the client's team. So we work, we work with clients that already have a team in place.

They already have like video editors, graphic designers, people to go shoot content with. So that's generally why we work with brands on 50 to a hundred K a month, because they've already kind of have that established at that level right there. So we basically guide the, um, clients on creatives each week to go create.

Now, what happens when we get a client that, Hey, performance is terrible. Okay, cool. How many creatives have you sent to us in the last month?

Oh, like two. There you go. So a lot of the, like, yes, we get really good draws for our client, but also the client's also responsible for a good 50% of it, because if they're not taking action on these creatives, then Hey, we can't get them.

And that's it right there. So we want to make sure we're working with clients that can shoot film and edit creatives on a weekly basis. So they need to have this team in place and structure in place.

And then we put pretty much add the systems and more of the marketing. I essentially have like what creatives and things like that to shoot. Cause like video editors are great at video editing, you know, filmmakers afraid at like filming stuff and making it look good, but they don't have the marketers, storyline and like all those fun stuff right there.

And then it's just like, Hey, they can't really create great, compelling ads. And that's such right there. So with that being said, I hope this kind of shed some light a little bit on what it is that we do, how we help clients.

And yeah. So if you like more of this, make sure the like button hit that subscribe button and stay tuned for new videos.
