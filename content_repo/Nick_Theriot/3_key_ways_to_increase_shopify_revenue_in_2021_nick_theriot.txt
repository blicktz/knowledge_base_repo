what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i'll be talking about three key ways to increase shopify revenue and these are three strategic ways that we've applied to brands we're working with that we've helped scale to six and seven figures through these routes and these these three core concepts i think probably at least 80 or 90 of brand owners are missing two of these three at least i know a good if you're watching this channel you have at least one of them down but i definitely want to showcase these with you in today's video and hopefully clear some things up for you help realign your focus on these core concepts so before you get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday let's get started guys so three ways to increase shopify revenue and just to show you guys this is stuff we've applied that's helped us scale multiple brands to six and seven figures and you can see right here just some screenshots some you know shopify stats and data and all that good stuff you guys love so moving on number one it's acquire more customers simple if you want to increase your revenue acquire more customers this is the hardest and most cost heavy route you can go and you can utilize paid traffic channels facebook ads google adwords youtube ads but you can also leverage things like influencers and paid or just simply sitting off your product too you can still leverage print tv advertising there's no limits to that depending on your product in your product niche and there's a lot of different paid routes you can go even maybe some organic routes as well organic routes tend to be slower whereas paid routes tend to be faster just more cost intense honestly organic route that takes years to go is big cost intense strategy for me because of the time it's costing me and my life to get to where i want to go so both of those ways are you know they're cost heavy they're intense um and then some people it takes years for them to master coal acquisition for their business so number one way to increase shopify revenue is simply acquire more customers spend more bring more customers into the brand and what's really cool is what i'm about to show you will allow you to actually spend more obtain the row as you want and still profit with your brand so imagine right now you're probably getting a 50 cpa or a 25 cpa and unprofitable with your business what i'm about to show you is allow you to actually ease up on that cpa to where you can afford maybe a 30 or 40 cpa and still profit very intensely with your business so the number two way to increase your shopify store revenue is to simply increase the average order value so you're acquiring more customers now let's increase average order value so this is the easiest one to do i literally took five minutes for one of my clients when we first run on my board i literally just went do two or three things their website took five minutes to do and we add an extra five thousand dollars a month and profit to their business by simply taking this one key action so this is the easiest one to do and just a few options you can use upsells and cross sales so and a great upsell example is when you're booking you know going online.com you know going online you're booking an airplane ticket whether it's united airlines american etc and you see like hey one available for this price you click on it then all of a sudden it's like hey we gotta we get a hundred dollar upgrade you know to go to first class that's a really really great way to increase average order value because just book this ticket now all of a sudden there for a hundred dollars more working at vip first class so offering an optional upsell in terms of offering more value for a better price and what this does is it allows people to start to purchase higher ticket products from you it also allows you to again increase your average order value so if you have people come to your website you're doing a hundred orders a day then all of a sudden you go you know you're doing a hundred orders a day with a let's just say a seventy dollar aov and you don't want like seven thousand dollars a day now all of a sudden those hundred orders are purchasing a hundred dollar or averaging a hundred dollar aov you just took your store from seven thousand dollars a day to ten thousand dollars a day by simply offering them an upsell nothing you didn't change anything with code acquisition you didn't do any type of landing page changes or anything like that you're literally just offering them a great upsell so really big opportunity right now the other way is to cross sell people so this is something that i i see a lot on i mean just lots of different websites but just for an example right here there is you know the cross out so purchase a pair of jeans so you buy a shirt that matches you go on a website let's just say it's american eagle whatever h&m you purchase a pair of jeans you're like oh wow these jeans look good but i don't have any shoes to wear with it then you go buy the shoes okay you know i got the shoes got the jeans i should also get that shirt so amazon this is really well with the little add all three to your cart are frequently bought together i see a lot of fashion sites just really well in terms of you know cross selling other items to like complete the fit that works really well and then also to looking at things like you know for example when i bought this micro here then i was like oh now i also need to buy an arm bought this arm and then oh wait this is a xlr mic i need to buy a you know i think it's called like phantom power uh so i need to buy one of those little um you know digital receivers for it so like i went into buy this hundred dollar mic and i spent 400 bucks on everything else like total because everything i had to get so great way of cross selling people you know when you go to at&t you go to buy the phone but they cross sell you with getting the uh you know the airpods then they're also the phone case then the protective glass so you went in there to make a thousand dollar purchase on a brand new iphone and then you leave spending like fifteen hundred dollars eighteen hundred dollars because you purchased all this extra stuff so these are all some really great ways to increase average order value and one other simple action you can take is literally just increase your prices maybe once every month or every quarter increase your prices so raise them by 10 and this is a two-way thing you can do with this let's say every quarter you increase your prices by 10 so let's say you're selling a pair of jeans for 100 bucks into the quarter you're selling about 110 now like that's the goal or maybe 120 125 bucks so you're bumping it up what you can do is you can run a flash sale hey guys last chance you can get these pair of jeans for this price but tomorrow it's gonna be 125 bucks so you better purchase it today now all of a sudden you created a kind of like a scarcity for it and like hey i need to herpico purchase that and like the fear of missing out and a limited item offer so the herp need to go purchase that so it's a really great way to leverage some psychology leverage running a cell and stuff and all that good stuff right there so number three is increasing ltv so you can acquire more customers you can increase the size of each transaction they do on the website or aov but now how can we get customers to stick with this over a longer period of time so if you acquire a customer for 25 bucks they spend 100 bucks on your website it's a forex roas but what happens if that person comes and places four orders per year at a hundred dollars and you never have to pay for them again in terms of paid advertising so you acquire that customer for uh for 25 bucks and their first order is 100 bucks so pay 25 bucks to get an order for 100 bucks that's four extra s and they're gonna place three more orders over the rest of the year that's a 400 ltv and all you spent was 25 bucks to acquire that first order from that customer which means you're spending 25 bucks to acquiring a 400 customer so you need to understand and start looking at things from an ltv standpoint so you understand how much you can spend per year on paid advertising and you know you can better judge of you know how you can increase profits in your business now how to increase ltv and this is something that 99 of e-commerce owners fail at they felt that increase in our ltv they fell at looking at it from this perspective you know look at it from very limited perspective of hey if we want to increase profits for an increase ROAS we need to just spend more on ads and we need to create better creatives or create better xyz but for ltv we really need to focus on is new products new offers and even some referral programs so when i'm talking about new products and new offers you know fashion nova honestly is probably one of the best examples ever and this is a pretty extreme example so i'm gonna give you an extreme example and a very common example as well so fashion nova what they did was is um you know they they sold very very strong push in the market from i think about 2015 to yeah 2021 well this year 2021 they just came out with fashion nova kids so what happens is is they've been getting all these customers over the last year purchase and they've realized hey they're looking at these customers and they're like hey okay what are all these people going now in their lives like okay they're having kids and stuff and then the kids are trying to grow up and they need clothes for them so guess what they released fashion over kids and what happens is it blew up and they didn't have to spend a dime on marketing because they've already had the sms of all these customers they already had all these customers emails so they're able to leverage lists and leverage customers they've already had and these customers had a very high infinity of that brand and very likely to buy from again you know someone who's purchased from you once it's 10 times more likely to purchase from you again versus someone completely cold so they were able to spend very little money to get that whole fashion of a kids push and they've built up a lot of brand ambassadors they built some influencers and stuff like that through that particular program and they didn't have to spend a dime on facebook ads to promote it because they've they've leveraged all the lists and covers smurs they already had so that's a really extreme example and the reason why is because that's completely shifting a big portion of your business and launching a whole new into a whole new market but it's a very it's a billion it's a multiple million dollar you know basically scenario of increasing ltv massively successful big profits all that good stuff now a common more common example for ltv for one of our um purse our personalized uh metal sign brands for example we've run ads for we literally we have a sign for a whole bunch of different events of a person's life so you know when they do this and this happens to them you know they get married they have a sign for them getting married you know they give us a gift they have a gift for a husband so throughout their life we can be at every step of the way with a different personalized gift they can either give to someone or a cool thing for their house you know another example or ltv we just look at amazon for example think of all the hundreds of you know maybe even thousands you've spent on amazon you keep going back purchase more and stuff because they have a lot of different products and offerings and stuff you can use and i think the last example i can give you guys is just apple i mean look at apple they started off with a desktop computer then they created the macbook then they created the ipod then they created the iphone then they created the airpods then they created you know the ipads and all these stuff i mean i'm literally sitting right here with an iphone a magic pad a you know a magic keyboard a fully spec'd out macbook pro i'm literally sitting right here with nearly ten thousand dollars worth of apple stuff right here and that doesn't even include all of the iphones that's been sold to me over the last eight ten years of my life so that's ltv right there as well and guess what apple hasn't spent a dollar on me since i've acquired you know i've never even uh went through one of apple's uh you know marketing campaigns essentially i went through more of a social proof campaign from them of people you know selling me on them getting their iphone so it's just really great ways to look at ltv and looking at new offers new products you can position in front of your existing customers and leveraging like things like sms and email and stuff building those lists out and really utilizing those to sell to your existing customers that's gonna be a huge huge this is like a six and seven figure growth leap you'll be able to make with your business by utilizing this effectively all righty guys i really hope y'all enjoyed this video if you are a shopify business
