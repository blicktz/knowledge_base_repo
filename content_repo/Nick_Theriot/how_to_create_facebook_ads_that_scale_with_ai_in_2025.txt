here's how to create facebook ads that scale using ai in 2025 add the random idea uh hey let's just go ahead and literally screenshot all of my chat gpt and my manis props and literally put it in a video and then just kind of show you guys literally not the props that youtubers show where it's like you develop some sophisticated fucking prompt and then give it to you but more of hey here's literally the screenshots from my conversations with ai and showing you guys kind of what i'm asking it what i'm getting back and kind of my thoughts on that data what i do next we'll specifically go into headlines today we'll specifically go into like uh longer form like video facebook ad scripts and we'll also go with zoo like landing pages itself also to just side note i am still recovering after being sick for the last two weeks so my voice is still not 100% there there's not some weird fucking filter on this video just my voice itself with that being said let's dive to the video so here's how to create facebook ads at scale using ai in 2025 we'll jump in the first scenario right here where i'm using manis manis is probably one of the newer ais i started using over the last two to three months and by far my favorite ai for you know heavier projects and i mean i'll classify heavier projects in a little bit but here i literally took basically a couple hundred responses from post purchase surveys and gave this to manis and then i gave it the product think and basically just had manis go and create me a detailed customer avatar now what's cool about this detailed customer avatar is that i can use this in future projects where i literally just give this customer avatar now to ai so ai knows who i am trying to write an ad towards unless i'm developing a whole new avatar and research so these are one of the ways to kind of develop me a doc i can use now to give to ai every time i write an ad in future and here's an example one right here this is also like 17 pages long i just screenshot it the first page but realistically this avatar is like 17 pages long now here's another doc just for someone completely different another client this is based off 2600 customers on this right here so really cool way just to get you a nice customer avatar that way when you go and create headlines hooks ad scripts ad scripts sales letters for this specific customer avatar in the future you just give this doc to ai and that way it has all the information it needs on who you're trying to talk to and this will greatly increase quality uh ai stuff you get back now here's another one right here this is one where i'm literally just getting ai to write me a listicle this is one of those listicle ending pages right here i literally just said here's my product i gave it the product link and attaches my customer avatar that's that avatar we built right here please create me a listicle sales letter called six scientific reasons why blank is helping women over 35 claim their bodies now i don't always give it a headline i just knew the headline i wanted to use let me very clear on that and then here i also gave it additional context because i gave it this it started working i didn't like the output so that i additionally gave it carrying her just like more context here with an example from a listicle for the completely different brand and then here's what we got six scientific reasons why women over 35 are swapping their lost methods for blank triple burn system now it's not the headline i wanted to use but when i gave it this additional context right here it outputted a much better headline that i actually personally prefer six reasons why so boom you got that and then here it goes into uh the six scientific reasons why now this is also six scientific reasons why so typical listicles will be more just benefit focused i wanted to go with a little bit more of the logical and scientific side so it's a little bit more data heavy on this here's another one right here this is where we're literally introducing new mechanism into the marketplace when you're selling to a market that's already had a lot of different mechanisms failed we want to introduce a new mechanism to be able to go ahead and create new hope and a sense of new opportunity for people to recapture their attention so here here's my product i gave you my product i want to you to research the market and develop me 10 ways we can introduce this as a new mechanism for example i gave an additional context here uh this is actually a legit case study here where we just did this for another company so i wanted to give it context here uh we have another client who we use this headline powerly laser treatment vanishes acne in 30 minutes as introducing a new mechanism laser treatment calls how people want vanishes acne and a reason why they should give a fuck about this mechanism versus others in 30 minutes the above product blank is in a competitive market in terms of there being a lot of fat burners will need to develop a new image for all this product is putting it by introducing it as a new way to lose weight take the above example for that that other client and find me a competitive ways to make a new mechanism of our blank product and list those out so this right here is basically our prop and then i also gave it additional context after i gave that with my customer avatar and then from here here's some a couple things that we thought again i wanted 10 approaches i like quantity and then i like to basically just go kind of sort throughout and pick out the ones i like so here's the first headline it gave me revolutionary collagen metabolic restoration reverses age-related weight gain in just 90 days i like that a lot i don't like giving uh what i would say time periods to weight offers because you have a high risk of like rejections and stuff but to be fair here we're not calling out the number on the scale we're not saying you're gonna lose 20 pounds in 90 days we're just saying it reverses age-related gain nine days so let's get my pretty go now here's something else i like to do often like i basically said hey i love these can you please rewrite them now for someone with an iq of 90. this is also really cool this is something i recently got introduced to by a friend of mine and what's cool about this is that like in copywriting you want it as simple as possible for people to understand so when you require it rewrite it for someone with the iq of 90 or basically just saying like hey dumb this down that's all do it so here new metabolism fix melts away middle age weight in 90 days new hormone unlock drops upper menopause weight at 60 days a new busy mom trick melts that without changing anything you do so i really like this one and this one i don't care for this one uh busy mom trick just because i don't know i haven't seen that word be used before so i probably do a little research here manually just to kind of see like do moms how do busy moms talk about themselves but yeah i really like this one metabolism fix melts away middle age weight 90 days we're basically just hiding that new mechanism there now here i like those new mechanism ideas but i wanted to also try to focus on like in supplements your unique mechanism a lot of time it's the ingredients you have and your ingredients being the ingredients that no one else has so i wanted to just kind of focus on that and then give me a set of headlines right here new five type collagen fat fusion melt stubborn fat while rebuilding your body in 90 days for money by guarantee not bad it's a little little crazy i'd definitely go back and do this again it's kind of cool this down a little bit but yeah but it's it's on the right track and that was the key thing for me cool now here's another one right here this is basically where like i like the headlines um i picked out a few of that the headlines gave me and now i wanted to actually write me out a script that i can use for i like to do the ai voiceover with a b-roll footage so i basically just said please write me a one to two minute long facebook video ad script for each of the two times new mechanisms these are the two i liked do not give any filming ideas b-roll ideas or words on screen just to script what the voiceover says give it to me in plain text i use any special characters i give it those additional context right there because often what i find ai is that when i tell it to give me a video script it'll be like on a cool summer morning blah blah blah and then like i don't know just it's gay i don't like it so here i basically just gave it like hey i just want the text what the person says and here's what it did here so ladies if you're over 40 and that stubborn weight just won't cut off it's not your fault your hormones have locked your fat in place so here we're just giving a new problem a new problem of why that stubborn weight won't come off which is cool we're introducing a new mechanism i'm 45 struggled with the exact problem for years let me explain what's really happening in your body when you hit your late 30s your hormones start changing estrogen up here's all rise and your body goes into a fat storage mode uh this creates well learned or called hormonal fat lacks your fat gets trapped and no amount of dieting right size can release it that's why nothing works anymore providing a reason why they failed amazing very good job here we're interesting because my doctor told me this is just part of aging that was a lie you can unlock strap fat but you need the right key after my research i discovered there's certain types of collagen actually help balance your hormones when you're almost balanced the fat the fat locks release but here's the problem regular collagen supplements don't work for you you need specific types of collagen within exact amounts this is good i like this now here's just like kind of stepping out from that for a second here's some other stuff i like to do often when i'm writing if i'm struggling to come up with ideas i'll take like various different ads i've seen online and just literally give it to uh to manis so like yesterday for example i went to the store the golf store to apply my brothers a new set of clubs and stuff that i saw how many ads were in there so i came home and i went and like looked at a couple like direct response low form sales letter for golfers and i really like these two so i was like hey like manis here's two ads i like i want you to analyze them and then basically what happened manis analyzed the ads and it already kind of knew i was writing for the product right here so it said like it literally already gave me ideas for that product without me really having to prompt it or ask so i thought that was really cool and then basically i just said hey i like these right here and then it went ahead and wrote me a bunch of them so uh how one backwards collagen trick which takes just 60 seconds each morning melts away stubborn and i'm waiting so fast you can fit your pre-baby jeans by next off wall-eating chocolate that's a solid headline i like that very big claim there all right cool so that was all manis again manis i like for bigger projects in the sense of writing like set like not sales letters but like avatorials listicles taking in like large amounts of data from like these customer surveys and stuff like that and then giving me that but i also really like chat gpt as well and especially to the chat gpt 5. chat gpt 5 is a lot faster with a little bit lower quality whereas manis um not slower but it gives me a much better quality so i just don't like using manis all day because like if i need to go create writing stuff fast manis is just not the route to go i hate it so chat gpt is my preferred method for writing things quickly and just getting things out in a articulate manner whereas manis is better for hey here's some deep research or like here's a big document break this down come up with new ideas and stuff and a lot of times i use them together so for example here i had manis basically do my research doc based off it it's literally this one right here though this one right here so i gave man or chat gpt that doc that that manis wrote for me in my product page and then from here this is where i would give it all this pre-context and data before i start asking it questions like write me headlines hey i want to open up i want to hit on this problem and introduce this solution and like i want to do it in this manner like i do all that i get to give the ai context first that drastically increases the quality of output you get so that's what i did essentially right here here i i didn't picture this before i asked this question i had it write me um a couple ads just following me same like manner right here and then after opening the ad i was like hey where's some engaging image ideas to go with that that user stop the scroll read uh and it gave me a couple ideas and then i asked it to basically like hey this idea number one i want you to give me visual instructions that i can literally give to you chat gpt to make me an image um i don't use these often but it is something i do like to test in the mix itself now here's just some other ways uh i'll do this a lot where i'll just be like hey here's my winning headline please give me 30 variations of that headline that's new and this is just like different ways to write the same headline i may get 30 of them and like like one of them take that one and then go and like rewrite it myself manually and get like new ideas off of that oh here's another really cool one right here uh this is where i just took a facebook comment from one of our ads i said hey here's the comment here's my product please write me 10 out of the lines target directly to this person's comment and then it started writing me a couple different ideas which was cool um i actually really like this one right here uh here's one of my other ways that i i get facebook to write me out like a script and stuff which is hey now write me a sales letter as a master copywriter dan kennedy and then here it gave me like a really long sales letter i just picked the top part right here and then it basically went through imagine this you battle pcos for years your doctor visits blah blah blah blah that's your story read on because you're about to discover really changed the game for carmen blah blah blah right so give me a long form sales look problem with that is that i can't really do anything with that there was a dream ad to a facebook ad so i said hey rewrite this as an instagram influencer of over a million dollar million followers and i've gotten some really good stuff from that now i just wrote i just copied first half right there so basically it it basically pushed everything out for me right here and you already got to know you already see a difference between the two now because this one's a lot more what sounds like an instagram person talking uh if you got pcs you already know zoom weight fill is possible i'm talking fanating blah blah blah go on now i copied this first app and i basically said paint the picture now with multiple different examples of their desired state being achieved so one problem i noticed in a lot of people's copineer videos and stuff like that is that they only show an example of a desired state being achieved you want to show a variety of examples of someone's desired state being achieved so i have about 20 different examples of someone's desired state being achieved and i give that to my research students and i basically just gave it to where then now here it gave me um this is just a clip from that longer form and it just showing a variety of different ways of someone living that desired life now which is cool yeah and then here i basically just copied in that whole script and basically just said finish the script for one call to action for my website and buy now um and it basically just gave me a pretty urgency back closer but yeah hope you all enjoyed this video this is just literally like i said this is literally my chat gpd and manis literally just within the last 24 or 48 hours i use this a lot while writing ads for clients is it my only way no i also do a lot of manual research other things you didn't get to see in here where it's like i already have like a desire when it after awareness sophistication level i want to go after and i'm giving a lot of context to manis or chat gpd so i use it in a variety of ways sometimes i have exactly what i know to write and i give that context and there'll be other times i don't know what i want to write and i'm basically giving it to give me more quantities of data and then i'm sifting through and picking out the things i like and then having it go write the things i like so yeah two different ways a couple different ways i've used this hope you all enjoyed this video make sure you hit the like button and that's a tribe for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday that being said my name is Nick Theria I'll tell you later peace
