Over the last decade of running ads for e-com brands and doing over a hundred million dollars in revenue for clients in my advertising agency I've seen quite a few brands now scale to a couple hundred K a month to even a couple million dollars a month and then fall face first on their face on like warm asphalt in the middle of the summer and just like really hurt really bad and in today's video I really just want to kind of talk about these hidden bottlenecks that I just see all the time from you know just over the years of just seeing brands scale and then die and literally for things that are just completely unrelated to ads things like mindset systems operations and all these things so with that being said let's dive into today's video so we'll switch it up a little bit today and we'll start off with mindset mindset's usually not the initial thing I would talk about but just kind of give you guys some little different perspective today so there's been so many brands now that we've scaled and just a simple mindset of the founder once they started making more money I just completely got destroyed and this is something I'm just seeing over the years where people start making an insane amount of money really quick and they just simply don't know how to handle the stress they don't know how to handle just the responsibility they have now and I can go down a numerous amounts of stories and stuff like this you know we had this one particular client where uh you know we scaled them from 30k a month to over 100 something thousand dollars a month in revenue you know we were doing consulting with them for a little bit I think one or two months then eventually I just came on board and started running all their ads and we scaled them to I think 100 150k a month within like 30 days 60 days of us working together and pretty much after that like everything was good performance was good everything was good I mean we just tripled it to 4x their business within a relatively short period of time and at that time I think I was charging like 2,500 a month with my advertising agency I'm talking about three four years ago and this client let us go right after and I'm like hey like what's going on performance is good you have stock you have inventory everything's solid like you're ready to scale further and this client was just simply like very honest with me hey Nick you know 100k a month is the goal we're happy here now I don't want to seem like a sellout I'm we're just gonna coast to this this is perfectly fine like I don't want to go any further than this and at that time I was just like blown away like what and like I completely understand if like you know we were underperforming and we were under delivering it could be a very valid excuse just to kind of like get out of the relationship but you know when you're paying someone like $2,500 and you're making significant more amounts about that back it's just not going to be that case so like I believed everything this client was saying but at the same time it's just it made me realize that just because you want to scale to a certain level with specifically working with clients in this case because I know everyone who's a founder on this channel wants to hit a million dollars two three million dollars a month with their econ brand just because you want to hit that number if the client isn't on board you're going to struggle because they might have an amazing product and you'll start scaling and crushing but they're mentally comfortable at a certain level so if you're an agency and you want to blow up a client to say a million dollars a month 500,000 300,000 dollars a month whatever your number is you want to help a client hit if they're already not on board with hitting that number that's going to lead to a problem down the relationship down the line it's almost like in a dating world where like if you're dating a girl and you know for a fact you're dating to marry and she's just dating to sleep around or whatever then in that particular case right there that's going to be a problem if you never talked about that at the beginning of the relationship so you need to make sure you set the proper expectations as a agency when like hey we want to scale you to a certain number right there and this one goes on to my next thing so working with this other client and this client i wouldn't really say had a mindset issue but it still falls within mindset of just being strategic about how you continue to grow the business and this particular client you know we helped them scale we uh we came in they were doing about 100 150k a month in revenue i think they had a goal like a six month goal of hitting 100k a month profit and i think we hit that in like three or four months for them and then after that they had like some other goal and we just completely blew that goal off the water long story short we made them like five to ten x more than like originally what they planned to be happy with us after our our agency feed all of those good things right there so we helped this client crush it scaled them seven figures a month and then about a month or two later you know pretty much part of ways with us wasn't necessarily a performance thing they made so much cash they decided to invest this cash into other parts of the business which allowed them to kind of take a new direction or made them believe they need to take a new direction to scale further so keep that in mind they took an action scaled up then once they hit a certain number which was for them was i think it was like 1.5 1.8 million dollars a month decided to stop doing that action to take a new action which dropped them like this face first in the ground and that's another thing i will see often uh working with clients where you know they'll spend they'll make a lot of money and then they just feel like they no longer need to do that particular action right there and this is a big problem because it's like you taking an actions we got you there so why would you stop it like if i go on a caloric deficit for 30 60 90 days get shredded and then oh i hit that goal now let me stop doing that action and get fat then why would i get upset if i got fat because i stopped taking that action so i should know that hey that's the results i'm going to achieve now so you have to understand that the actions you take on a day-to-day basis is going to create your reality so when we scale a client up and they don't want to stop taking that action because they believe they need to be doing something else in this particular case this client you know felt like they needed to rebrand their store so they rebranded their whole store they hired a branding agency this branding agency convinced them that they needed to build an in-house facebook ads team so they parted ways with us they rebranded their whole store and then um long story short it didn't work out well for them in fact actually i had the privilege of talking to this client not too long ago and uh you know they said that was their worst decision they've ever made was parting ways with us and listening to that particular design agency right there no hard feelings at all to that client at all you know i respect the fact that that client reached out to me and told me that and that was a very uh i would say prideful thing but client put his ego down to tell us that that was very um respectful right there so i really appreciate that a lot but again it just kind of shows right there like when you start making a lot of money you're going to want to throw money and spend a lot of money because you're not used to making all that money and when you start throwing it around into directions and you start allowing all these other people coming in it can distract you from the actions that got you there and that can be a big problem that can cause you to scale that now we face similar issues before with other clients we've helped scale there's been two clients now that we've helped them scale i mean technically three with this particular client i just told you guys about but three clients now that we've scaled to a seven figure a month number and they've because they're making so much more money now they need to start hiring people and start building up that kind of corporate ladder right there and all three of those clients has hired people where it was like marketing managers which marketing managers are simply people that manage the marketing team and like all the marketing efforts so that way that client can go do other stuff now in the business and two of these particular clients hired marketing managers and completely removed us from communicating with the client so like we spent you know six 12 months building a close one on one relationship together scaling their ads crushing it for them and stuff then they're like hey nick you did so well by 10xing my business i'm gonna go hire someone now that's only going to talk to you i'm no longer going to talk to you i'm gonna do this other thing in the business and then this marketing manager will come in and i kid you not these marketing managers they hire are never good and the reason why i say they're never good is because these marketing managers are usually people that are getting paid anywhere between three to five thousand dollars a month they're overseas nothing wrong with overseas people or anything like that but you know just long story short why instead of going scaling brands and building brands and stuff why would you just take a fee of three to five thousand dollars a month to just go tell a team what to do and that's it and no upside potential anyway so two of these clients hired these marketing managers that removed the client from communicating with us and now we're only talking with this marketing manager and this marketing manager will just come up with these craziest things that makes them feel like like they i guess they feel like they have authority over us and feel like they have to tell us what to do every day so like whoa again we've already 10x the client so both of these scenarios one client we took them from a thousand dollars a day to fifteen thousand dollars a day in ad spend at a 5x roas this other client we've taken them from 300k a month in revenue to two point uh it was like right around 2.1 22 million dollars a month in revenue out of three extra robots both extremely happy clients we took all the action we got them there then these marketing managers will come in and we'll simply just start to control the deal and start trying to tell us hey we're doing everything wrong we need to set up all these campaigns we need to stop doing this and start doing this and i'm just looking at the marketing manager like yo like we literally 10x this client you came in after we already did all the work and now you're trying to tell us what to do and again it goes back to that action that i was telling you guys before where it's like when you take an action and you start doing that action and get your results don't stop doing that action because you feel like oh you're making money now you don't need to do it that's when you need to double down on the action not remove the actions the exact same scenario here and it's been multiple times where we've had to talk to the marketing manager and either say hey look me and you are both on the same page of scale mcfunder for avenue we've ran ads way lower than you spent more than you and here's why we're doing what we're going to do or hey are you telling this as a thing that we have to do or just simply feedback on ideas of what you think we should do and that's centric there so there's been quite a few times now that we've uh got some heated conversations with marketing managers and then long story short either have to tell the client hey you need to fire this person or b there's been some situations where the marketing manager even like recommended working with other agencies and other agencies have came on board because they thought we were doing a bad job and we just completely destroyed these other agencies when it was like you know 1v1 type of thing right there you know like 1v1 on rust mother warfare two days now some other things i've seen over the years of just completely destroying brands after they scaled we'll kind of get away from mindset now look at other things there's been situations with inventory where people will either purchase too much inventory and you know not have the right cash flow and like it just fucks them financially from like a p l perspective on a month-to-month basis there's been situations on the opposite side people don't purchase enough inventory and then they're have to do like pre-orders and stuff we're working with this one particular client that uh you know they scaled up we helped them scale from 30k a month about 300k a month it was my first ever client or e-com client back in 2019 we've taken them from you know 30k a month to 300k a month in revenue well at about 300k a month in revenue their all their inventory was on pre-order and at this time i'm telling the client hey we need to scale back you do not have inventory in stock and if we keep scaling here you're gonna probably face people want to refunds and stuff like that if you can't fulfill these orders and under my heavy guidance of not doing that this particular client said hey nick with all respectfully we're gonna keep spending we're gonna keep scaling and we're gonna keep going at it inventory will be in next week we'll be fine loan story short pretty much from like september to uh november uh about three months we only did pre-orders and we're doing about 300k a month worth of pre-orders and this particular supplier for this client kept pushing back the date of which the inventory would be in so it'd be like hey next week now two weeks now three weeks now four weeks and every week would be a longer couple weeks long story short uh this client completely ran dry about like january we parted ways and then about a month later they filed for bankruptcy because they did couple months of pre-orders and what happened is all of these pre-orders people started charging back from their credit card so let's just say three four months of pre-orders that's three four hundred k a month that's i don't know let's just say close to a million dollars worth of revenue right there they were doing about three extra of us so about three hundred thousand dollars that million was i don't know let's just say uh adspin they've paid the supplier and manufacturer probably about a hundred two hundred thousand that's about five hundred thousand dollars right there and product costs and shipping uh or product costs and ad spend and then the last about five hundred k they started getting a ton of charge back people are charging back and they had to dish out a ton of cash literally the person had to sell their labor uni person had to downsize their house it's not fun not fun at all for that particular person right there so inventory management can be a big killer right there when you start scaling up uh don't make the same mistake of doing the whole you know pre-order thing if you're gonna do pre-orders i'm perfectly okay with pre-orders just know for a fact that you will have inventory on that date um if you know you won't have inventory on that date don't try to do pre-orders unless it's within a 30-day window that's the best advice i can give you for that now i'm gonna give you last thing we'll talk about today probably one of the biggest killers of an e-com business that i've ever seen in my life this is ltv retention of customers so one particular client they were doing about 30k month all year january through september they were doing about 30k month all year then october did 300 000 november they did 3.5 million then november or december did it two and a half million so the collective total over three months they did about five and a half six million dollars in revenue and on new customers they were selling a kids product and moms were buying with the intention of giving this product as a gift for the christmas the holidays all those good things now when january came around they went from doing about two and a half million dollars uh three million dollars a month in revenue december about midway from december i mean they were doing 100 200k days in december then all of a sudden boom fell all the way down to about a thousand dollars a day in revenue i think they did a total of 24 000 in january and that's when we kind of parted ways with them and you know there's a couple warning signs gave this particular client number one hey you're riding on the fact that people are buying this kids product specifically for the holidays if you go look at kid toy sales 90 of revenue for kid toy manufacturers is going to be in q4 90 of the revenue for the years within three months the other 75 of the year you're going to make 10 of your revenue and that's exactly what happened in this particular situation here so of course client fell down freaked out and there's also this client spent ton of money on inventory so pretty much all the profit they made over november and december was like literally all towards inventory because they thought they were going to do another four or five million dollars in january and keep scaling up to the moon but the reality the market did not exist based off how they were selling this product and the second thing that they made a mistake on was i told them multiple times that we need to be engineering for retention retention is people coming back and buying from you if you turn off all your ads today will you continue to make money that's the big question there if you're not continuing to make money if you turn all your ads off today that is a problem that's a liability for your business all the top econ brands that scale to multiple seven figures a month and stay there or the econ brands that have engineered retention their business they have customers that keep coming back and buying more this particular client didn't have that this particular client scaled up only one new customers they acquired about over a hundred thousand new customers all they had to do was a hard on testing products against those new customers to see what those new customers want to buy again and start being strategic with upsells not from like a in card or something like that but hey you purchased from us 30 days ago here's the next product that's gonna go really well based off what we helped you solve the first time great example i'll do the core side right here on the info product space i have my ebook it's 29 this is something i can push hard with ads and i can push this ebook at a loss with ads and i do it all the time it's a 29 ebook and i pay about 40 to 50 to acquire a customer with that ebook yes i'm losing 10 to 20 every time someone buys it but i'm upselling them to my inner circle which has about a five to six thousand dollar ltv then some of those inner circle students come to my agency which has about a 50 to 60 000 ltv so when you look at it like i'm yes i'm losing 10 to 20 bucks on the front end right there but then with all these upsells and the percentage of customers that go into those upsells i'm at like a 10 to 20 x return on ad spend on that 30 40 to 50 bucks that i spend to acquire that customer into my funnel we want to look at this the same way with ecom what are other products that we can go create and keep having our customers buy more that's how we build a sustainable seven figure a month ecom store well that was a lot of different things hope you guys learn some tips from this if you enjoyed this video hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every
