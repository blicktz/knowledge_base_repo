How retargeting is ruining your Facebook ad results. Over 2022 and even over 2021, retargeting and canceling retargeting campaigns has been a big topic in the space. Us personally, after doing over $50 million of online revenue with Facebook ads, we have completely eliminated retargeting campaigns.

And today I wanna bring you the proof and kind of the reasons why we've done that and try to make the most epic, badass video on exactly from all of our different specific points that we look at of why we quit retargeting campaigns. So if you're new to the channel, if you don't know who I am, my name is Nick Terrio. I basically run ads for people or I coach people into building better ads.

And you click the links below to figure out how you can either work with us for us running your ads or for the coaching side. Again, done over $50 million in online revenue and done some pretty amazing case studies of taking brands to seven figures a month. So that being said, hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

And let's dive into the video. So how retargeting is ruining your Facebook ad results. And again, we're gonna go over what is retargeting in the quickest, shortest way for those who just don't know what the fuck retargeting is.

We're gonna go over like how Facebook's actually removing retargeting, how Facebook is already retargeting for you, how the algorithm works, because you really do need to understand how the algorithm works to understand why we eliminated retargeting in the first place. You also need to understand how iOS 14.5 had an impact on retargeting, the statistical impact of retargeting on results, and when retargeting does do better, because we do have a few cases where it does, and I do need to explain why. And lastly, what retargeting plans I do recommend.

So there's some stuff for retargeting that I do recommend, and I wanna make sure you guys are clear on that as well. And if you're curious why you should even be listening to me, I've done over $50 million in line revenue with Facebook ads. I've been running Facebook ads literally since 2015, and I've tried literally every strategy under the sun that is out there for getting results with Facebook ads.

So what I bring to the table to you guys and show y'all, I've personally done over $25 million in line revenue with just our current strategy now. The other 25 million was from just all the various different strategies I was trying under the sun in terms of like, you know, what we're doing in terms of like performance and things like that. Just on average, I spend five figures a year in my own personal development, learning from the top 1% of Facebook advertisers that are literally responsible for spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year as well.

So even on top of that, what we do in revenue numbers, there's some also, you know, some other further credibility and stuff like that. Meta business partners, then four and a half million and just spend just in the first half of 2022 alone. So that's basically why you should listen to me.

If you still deny any of this, cool, then have fun. But with that, let's start diving into the video. So what is retargeting?

In the most simplistic way possible, because pretty much everyone's been watching this knows what it is. Basically, someone clicks on your ad, they visit your website, and then they might not immediately purchase. That's totally okay.

So then in theory, retargeting is basically taking your website visitors, retargeting them with an ad, and people are more likely to purchase, okay? So that's what is retargeting, all right? You also have some people that maybe just visit your website.

Maybe they watch a YouTube video, or maybe they found you through a friend, visit your website, don't purchase, and then they become a website visitor. And from there, you hit them on retargeting ad, and theoretically, they purchase as well. So that's basically what retargeting is.

And typically, you might run some type of structure where it's like you do a top of funnel, middle of funnel, or bottom of funnel structure inside of your ad account, okay? And further, you might target some stuff like Facebook engaged, video views. You might do some exclusions at each stage of the funnel as well.

And that's typically like most setups were when we were doing it. So like I said, top funnel, middle funnel, things like that. So how is this burning my money, Nick, though?

That's why I'm here. So let's start diving deeper into this. And the first thing you need to know is how Facebook is actually planning on removing this retargeting structure, okay?

So audience expansion has started to come in play now. And we've seen audience expansion come out for lookalike audiences. You can see right here for lookalike audiences.

And when it first came out, it actually looked like this. Looked like expansion. Click this if you want it to expand when it's likely to improve performance.

Used to be unchecked. Then it became checked. And now it is also basically permanent for lookalikes.

Now, recently, the whole advantage plus, everything like that, now there's advantage custom audiences. And this is the first step in pushing, you know, no more retargeting. Because what happens when this is turned on is if Facebook thinks it can improve performance outside of just targeting website visitors, well, guess what?

It's gonna go target whoever it wants. And it's pretty much gonna turn into broad targeting, okay? So Facebook's already being proactive about removing retargeting or slowly phasing it away.

And we can even look further into other audience expansion. We've seen this with interest as well. You can see if I go target something like soccer fans, we may deliver ads beyond your audience for your selected objective if it's likely to improve performance.

And it won't be long before we see that as well for custom audiences. And me personally, I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm totally okay with that.

I'm actually excited for that because then I can stop having these type of conversation of, hey, Nick, what's our retargeting plan? What should we do for retargeting? And to carry on, you really need to understand how the algorithm works.

Because once you understand how the algorithm works, then you can be perfectly okay with it like I am. So how the algorithm works. When you go on Facebook, you set up a campaign, let's say you're optimizing for purchases, Facebook is going to go after people who are most likely to purchase.

It's going to take hundreds of millions of users. And then it's going to be like, all right, these people are most likely to purchase. We're going to target these people.

Then the second thing it does is it also takes all of your ads and like, okay, here's our 10 ads that this dude wants us to target with, the people who are likely to purchase. Which ones are going to be the best ads to target these people with? So that's why some ads get more spin and some ads get less spin inside of an ad set.

Now, Facebook does not care if it's the first time someone sees your ad, so like a totally cold person, or the third time someone sees your ad, so a warm person, or someone who's been to your website five times. Facebook is going to target people most likely to convert, okay? So if I'm not running retargeting at all and someone goes to my website, never seen a Facebook ad before, but I'm not running a designated retargeting campaign, they go to my website, all of a sudden Facebook identified them now as more likely to convert than some of these other people.

So Facebook spins a little bit in cold, a little bit in warm, and a little bit in hot. That is something right there that is proven, okay? And I'll show you that in a second how.

So I try to visualize this as best as possible for you guys to understand. So here's our prospecting campaign. Inside of our prospecting campaign, we literally just run broad targeting, one ad set with all of our main ads, and then we run dynamic creative tests against that to try to find new winning ads.

That's it. And I'll show you in a second of where you can find more information on that. So I just need you to understand that it's how the campaign's structured.

So it's purely broad targeting in here, okay? Now, I'm not gonna say purely cold people because Facebook, yes, will spend majority of the budget on cold because there's more people who are cold on Facebook to our brand than there's people warm to our brand or hot to our brand. And Facebook's gonna spend more where the audiences are bigger.

So this prospecting campaign, this is kind of how it looks. You have a prospecting campaign. This gray box is our total targetable audience by Facebook and the blue represents the people, you know, the blue, the orange, and the red all represent people most likely to convert.

And Facebook's gonna diversify this budget across these three types of people, okay? So, and again, just to confirm, this is literally broad everything. We run one main ad set with all of our winning ads, and then we do dynamic creative tests to find new winners, okay?

Just to reinforce the fact. And I know this is Legion, but we do the same thing for app installs, e-com. E-com is 80% of our clientele in our agency.

So just to reinforce that. And if you wanna learn how to run this setup, go to these two videos, how to run dynamic creative ads on Facebook 2022 tutorial, and how I find winning Facebook ad creatives with dynamic ads, okay? Now, I'm gonna show you active proof that you can literally go from this video and check your ad accounts right now, and it'll actively show you that Facebook retargets for you, okay?

Go look at your last seven days. Just last seven days on your campaign that you're spending all your money on, okay? And if the frequency is above 1.00, you are retargeting people.

Even if it's 1.02, 1.03, a percentage of your budget is going to retargeting people, okay? Looking at this campaign right here, we spent $20,000 over the last seven days, and we have a 1.92 frequency, okay? What does that mean?

That means that we reached 568,000 people, and we served 1.0, 1.0, you know, just say 1 million impressions, okay? So we are actively retargeting people as well as reaching people, okay? So again, go do this for yourself.

Go look at your account now and see where are you already retargeting people in that perspective. And again, strong reminder, just because we're not running a retargeting campaign, that does not mean we're not retargeting people. We're just simply not creating a dedicated campaign for that, and we're allowing our main campaign to do both cold outreach and retargeting at once, based off it knowing who is most likely to convert at the time.

You are not a better money manager than Facebook. Facebook can better manage on what days it needs to spend more on retargeting and what days it needs to spend more on cold. So instead of every day, you'll have different frequency on the same level of budget, okay?

And it's going to improve optimization in your account so you'll get more consistent results. And you'll also have a campaign that's going to consistently get 1% better every single day. And this is how you get more stable performance.

And you're going to stop being like, oh, Nick, well, you know, you're going to have less decisions in the ad account. A lot of people are like, well, Nick, my retargeting has a 3X frequency. Should I turn it off?

I'm like, I don't know. Is it performing? Yes.

Okay, keep it on. So in our prospecting campaign right here, it's performing and just full transparency. This is a product where we literally just need a 1.0X ROAS because we're literally selling subscriptions on the back end of this, okay?

So this campaign is crushing it for us. So we're going to keep pushing more spin to it. And it's already automatically doing retargeting for us.

And we literally just have to focus on one daily budget. And Facebook is spending that daily budget based off what's going to give us the best performance on what's audiences, okay? Now, there does become a mental game.

And when a lot of people start switching from no retargeting to retargeting or from retargeting to no retargeting, it becomes a mental game, okay? Here's why. Let's say, for example, we look at one of our accounts with one campaign, okay?

In that campaign, we just have prospecting. We spend $3,000, make $9,000 in revenue, okay? For a 3X return on ad spend, okay?

Now, our second example, second account, we have three campaigns. We have a tickable of Tofu, MoFu, and BoFu, okay? Atop of funnel, we spend $2,000, make back $5,000 in revenue for a 2.5X ROAS, okay?

Middle of funnel, we spend $700, make back $2,500 in revenue for a 3.5X ROAS. Oh my God, wow, that's amazing, okay? And lastly, bottom of funnel, where we spend $300, make back $1,500 in revenue for a 5X ROAS.

Holy shit, this is amazing, okay? So, at this point, it's like, well, shit, Nick, the second one looks much better. Why?

Well, because the first one got a 3X, and the second one, yeah, got a 2.5X, a 3.5X, and a 5X. Retargeting crushed it in that account, Nick. Like, yeah, but let's look at the account total.

$3,000 in spend and $9,000 in revenue. Campaign one, $3,000 in spend, $9,000 in revenue. Both had the same spend, same revenue, except one of them, you had to work three times as hard.

So, this is where it just does not make sense. And you're no longer seeing the mental separation anymore between Tofu, Mofu, and Bofu. Whereas this one right here, you're seeing a sum of prospecting of cold, warm, and hot all than one, okay?

So, that's the first thing that just you need to understand, okay? So, once you understand this, and you understand that more work does not equal better performance, you can slowly start to realize, okay, hey, retargeting might not be the best option for my account, all right? And this is where you need to understand deeper of how the algorithm works.

Because, again, we already have proof that Facebook does it for us. We already know that just because we have more campaigns does not mean our overalls better. So, once you understand how the algorithm works, then you even fully understand when and how to leverage retargeting in its own unique way.

So, Facebook builds audiences around each ad you create. When you create an ad, Facebook builds a little, like, internal lookalike audience around that ad, okay? So, that way, that's the reason why you can have three different ads in one ad set, and each one will target very different people, okay?

So, we have to remember that Facebook needs you to spend more so it can make more money. And Facebook needs to keep users happy so it can make more money, okay? It needs ads from you that makes users happy and convert so it can do both, okay?

So, that is why Facebook is constantly taking all of your ads and spending more on some because it's more likely to get better performance, it's more likely to get more spend, and it's keeping the users happy that are looking at these ads. So, and even just to further show you of what I mean by a little audience gets built around each ad, here's two ads exactly in the same ad set with broad targeting, okay? One of them has a male golfer and one of them has a female golfer in the ad, that is it.

Well, the male golfer ad got 96% spin on men and, you know, what, like 40% spin on female? And then the female ad had 76% spin on male, or a female, and 39% on male. Now, why did it still get some spin on male?

Because it's an attractive female playing golf. What male golfer wouldn't pass that up, okay? So, Facebook knows a lot about your audience and it leverages a lot of this data because it pulls messaging, it pulls thousands of different variables about each ad to understand what audience to put your ad in front of.

Now, I know you're right like, Nick, well, how does this apply with retargeting them? Just give me a second. I wanna show you something there.

So then, all of our messaging that we leverage in our ads, each ad has a certain message. You know, each ad might appeal to, like, you might have one ad appeals to a problem-aware audience, unaware audience, or solution-aware audience, product-aware audience, or aware audience. When you're retargeting, you're appealing to an aware audience.

When you're, you know, making people, like, talking about a problem people have, you're appealing to a problem-aware audience, okay? Now, why is this important? Because to show you the impact of different levels of market awareness, you can see right here, this 186 winner ad we ran, got $47,000 over seven days of spend.

Now, all these other ads got, you know, $9,000 at most, all the way to $2,000. Why? Because it appealed to more of a problem-aware market awareness.

Unaware has a larger market than problem-aware. Now, it also kind of depends on who you are targeting and your product and things like that. So, just keep that in mind right there.

Now, why, again, am I talking about this? Because I'm proving to you guys that Facebook targets people based off your messaging and based off people who resonate with your ad. So, due to this, that is why we'll literally run remarketing-style ads in our cold campaign, okay?

Because I get a lot of people that are like, you know, I have clients. Hey, Nick, have some testimonials. I want to launch.

Can we specifically push them to retargeting? Or, hey, Nick, we have a new 20% off promo we want to run. Maybe it's Black Friday.

We specifically want to push retargeting. And my first response is, no. Why, Nick?

Why? We need to retarget these people. Because why would we create a retargeting campaign and make the, you know, ad account, you know, harder to optimize.

And instead, just pushing it in our cold campaign, our prospecting campaign, that's going to figure out who is likely to convert based off your ad messaging and your ad creative and targeting specifically those people. And let Facebook do the work and Facebook better manage the daily budget. Because if Facebook can better manage the daily budget than us, we're going to get better performance at the end of the day.

And due to this is why, even if it's an ad specifically built for retargeting, we still leverage it in our prospecting campaign. And the reason why? Because we're confident in the algorithm to figuring out who is likely to convert based off the creative, the messaging, all that good stuff.

But Nick, my audience needs multiple ads to convert. And here again, they're still being retargeted with all the different types of ads in your prospecting campaign. So let's say, for example, if you have anywhere from two ads to six ads in your prospecting campaign with a variety of different messaging, okay?

Facebook takes all those ads in that ad set and kind of rotates them around your audience, okay? So let's say, for example, if we go back to this campaign right here, 186 is really good at getting people from an unaware to problem aware, all right? Now, all these other ads appeal to a problem and solution aware market awareness.

So if someone sees 186 but doesn't necessarily convert, they might see these other ads and ad set and later convert. And we've actually seen the performance improve on these other ads since launching 186 because it appeals to a completely different market awareness and it gets more people in our bucket that we can target. So again, if they need to see multiple different types of messages, build ads that contain all the messages.

In our ad 186 right here, that's crushing it, we literally take someone from unaware in that ad and go all the way through all of these in one ad. We talk about, we take from unaware to a problem. Then we talk about the problem and make them aware of the solution.

Then we make them aware of the solution and make them why our solution is the best solution and why they can trust us. And then we talk about aware in terms of how they can take action today. So that crosses that one out.

And lastly, build better landing and product pages that answer any objections that people might have. And for the people that need to see multiple different types of ads, build better ads that contain all this messaging and also build better landing pages and product pages that contain those as well. So just a quick recap, Facebook is a better budget manager than you.

Facebook's already doing retargeting for you and Facebook can identify the messaging in your ad and serve it directly to those most likely to convert. So we know Facebook is doing a damn good job currently right now at actively retargeting people. So next one, iOS 14.5.

Okay. Custom audiences. Custom audiences are now a lot smaller due to iOS 14.5.

And due to that, we can only spend less on retargeting. Okay. So now instead of maybe spending 25% of our daily budget on retargeting, now we can only literally spend five to 10% of our day of retargeting.

Okay. Second thing is we have a lack of confidence that those audiences that are being properly targeted or actually being properly targeted and properly excluded. So let's say we target audience of add to cart last seven days.

Facebook might only be able to target like maybe 20 to 30% of those people. Okay. So we know those audiences are a lot smaller and are not actually being effectively excluded from the campaigns.

So that's where we want to look at statistical impact. Okay. So again, let's look right here at, you know, pre iOS 14.5.

Let's say we're spending a thousand dollars today, 750 on cold, 250 on retargeting. You know, it must've been 1875. You might get $1,875 on revenue from cold, 875 on retargeting, retargeting.

Okay. Now let's say now we only spend a thousand dollars a day. I mean, we can only spend five to 10% of our daily budget on retargeting $900 on cold, 2250, and then retargeting $350.

This makes up very, very small impact of our overall revenue compared to this one that's driving majority of our revenue. Okay. So that's why we want to put more focus on our cold.

Okay. Now again, just quick recap. iOS 14.5 weakened custom audiences for retargeting.

You can only spend less on retargeting now and retargeting creates less of an impact in overall performance. So now we're even showing that iOS, you know, retargeting isn't even a big needle mover now. Okay.

So now we're going to get more into needle movers. As a brand owner or advertiser, whoever may be watching this particular video, your number one goal should be to focus on the highest leverage actions at all times that's going to make you or your client the most money. Okay.

The highest leverage actions, the people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, they focus on the highest leverage actions every day in their business. That's going to move their business forward. Okay.

That's the biggest thing I've noticed from a poor mindset and a wealthy mindset. I've talked to hundreds of business owners. So I'm making a lot of money and some making, you know, dog shit to be honest.

And the ones that are barely making any money, they focus on everything in their business. Whereas the ones making a lot of money, they focus only on a few actions a day. And that's the highest leverage actions.

Their business is worth a hundred X more and they're working less than these people because these people know that, hey, we need to focus on the one or two actions that's going to drive 80% of our revenue. So why would we focus on a campaign that drives five to 10% of your daily revenue every single day? Okay.

That does not make sense. If we want to grow a business to a multimillion dollar business, you want to focus on something at full priority that's going to drive 80% of your revenue at all times. And that's your prospecting campaign.

That's your cold campaign, your main campaign that's getting new people every day into your business. And second thing is most agencies and creative teams I know work in creative cycles. Okay.

These creative cycles look like one or two weeks basically. So one week they'll focus purely on one specific ad concept and they'll launch in the ad account. So why on earth would I want to take my creative team who's responsible for driving all my ad performance?

Why would I want to put all of their tasks of the week to focus on one ad concept that's going to drive five to 10% of revenue? That's not even going to pay their bills from the month, their invoices from the month. I want to focus on something that's going to, that they're going to create that's going to drive 80% of our revenue.

And due to that is another reason why retargeting is pointless and focusing on it. So let me just show you real quick right here. Okay.

This is a new winning ad concept we found for this account. 186 right here. Over the last seven days, we spent $47,000 on it, hitting our KPI.

We need to hit for the specific account. Okay. Now let me show you the next slide.

This is seven days prior to launching this particular ad concept. You can see right here, these results are nowhere near the same. Okay.

$32,060, $20,053. Okay. Now, if I were to focus on retargeting to improve performance here, I would have made this maybe five to 10% better.

But because I focused my efforts on the highest leverage actions possible, I was able to find a new concept that literally is crushing it and driving 80 to 90% of the performance on a daily basis. So again, you can't scale retargeting without scaling cold. So going back to this, if I wanted to, you know, let's say for example, if I did find a winning retargeting ad in this campaign right here, or like a winning retargeting ad in another campaign to help bring down these cost per results.

Okay. What's going to happen is, is, oh, I want to spend more on retargeting because it's doing good. Well, what happens is I can't even scale retargeting because I need to scale this up.

Well, I can't scale this up because I'm getting dog shit results. So it still goes back to the fact that I need a new winning concept in the account. And if we go look at right here, if you want to scale retargeting, you need more people in your audience pool.

To get more people in your audience pool, you need to spend more on cold. To spend more on cold, you need better ads. To create better ads for cold, you need to stop wasting your time on everything else and focusing on the main leverage of action that you can take to get better ads in your ad account and create better winning concepts.

So quick recap, your moral responsibility to focus on the highest leverage actions at all times to drive the most revenue and make you or your clients the most money. Protect your focus on the highest leverage actions at all times in your business to drastically make you and your clients or your brand the most money as possible. Create ads with better mass appeal versus ads that I can only spend, you know, only a couple hundred people to see.

An ad with large mass appeal, you can spend a couple thousand dollars a day on. It's going to create a lot more significant impact in your business than an ad that you can spend a couple hundred bucks a day on for retargeting. Okay?

Which one, if I'm going to spend the same amount of time, do I rather spend time on an ad that creates a couple thousand dollars a day in business revenue or a couple hundred dollars in business revenue? Same exact amount of time, which one do you prefer? Comment below.

So I can tell you right now, 90% of y'all or rather spend the same amount of time to make a couple thousand dollars a day than the same amount of time to make a couple hundred bucks a day. So Nick, what happens when retargeting does do better? Okay?

There are some times where like retargeting might do a little bit better. Okay? And we're going to go over that in a second right here.

Okay? I'll give you guys a few examples. This was taken from recently, recent timeframes and ad accounts, variety of different ad accounts across a variety of different industries that we work in.

So here's one account right here. We spent $144,000 over the course of 30 days in our main campaign. While we were running retargeting, we only were able to spend $5,000 on a retargeting campaign for literally the same cost of acquisition.

So retargeting this account, nope, not worth it. This account, all right, cool. This was during Black Friday.

We spent $30,000, make $67,000 for a 2.2x ROAS. Below, we spent $855 on retargeting, make $4,900 back. Now, here's the thing.

This is a CBO right here. So we gave Facebook a large budget and told Facebook, spend it as you need. If you look at this, over the course of however long we ran this, we spent $30,000 to drive back $67,000.

This campaign, we could only spend roughly about almost $900 in this retargeting ad set. Look at our frequency. Already at 3x before $900 in spent.

And yes, we're doing good in ROAS, but the moment we would try to scale this up to let's just say $10,000 a day, we would literally be at a lower ROAS than a broad campaign. So this one right here would not be a statistical, like create a significant impact and performance. So boom, that's off.

All right, here's another one. I mean, look, $38,000 makes $70,000 in revenue. Where are we targeting literally did 66 spin and $15,000 in revenue for a 2.34.

So we were able to spend what? That's like 8, 9, 10x, definitely not 10x, okay? Like 8x difference.

And look, I mean, almost the same ROAS, not that big of a difference. If we would spend a little bit more, we'd be at the same, boom, that's crossed off the list as well, okay? All right?

And here's another campaign. 17k spend, $36,000 in revenue, $9,000 spend, $19,000 in revenue. So honestly, it's honestly not that big of a difference as well.

So what we're seeing here is that retargeting, we can't even spend that much more at all because if we start spending more, we're going to get the same performance. And who says we're not competing against ourselves by running this? This performance could even be better, but we're competing against ourselves with the second ad set.

So performance, we're limiting our performance, we're getting the same performance, and we're making the algorithm work harder. So if, let's say for example, this campaign right here, 30k on broad with 2.2 and then $900 with 5.77. Why can't I just go in that account and go put 30k to this retargeting?

Because the audience pool would blow up. Like, we would literally burn through the audience pool in a day and we see terrible performance after that. that 5.77 robots would not hold at scale and this is literally driving less than 10% of revenue right here.

So we do all this work for something less than 10% of revenue. Whereas, if I go improve the efficiency from like a 2.2 to 3x on this, I'm going to almost improve efficiency by over 30 to 40%. That's something significant enough to see performance in the account.

So that's why I can't just go increase budget. How can I spend more if I'm being relied on another campaign? Okay, there's no way possible I can go spend more on retargeting without improving the efficiency of our broad targeting.

Alright, if I go improve, if I could just go ramp up budget on broad targeting, we'll see a lower result and then we could spend more on retargeting but our overall would still be declining. So, we have to improve the performance on our broad regardless. So, we're still stuck in that same situation where we have to improve our efficiency on another campaign or our prospecting campaign.

And lastly, how sure am I that the retargeting that did that job and I'm not competing against myself in my own prospecting campaign which I've done the job for me anyway. So, my prospecting campaign, say for example right here, my broad targeting would have most likely did this job anyway but because of the way things are set up with that mental game right here, then I honestly have no confidence that the retargeting actually did that job and I'm actually just dumbing the algorithm down and I'm making it harder for Facebook to work. So, that's a few things that I'll look at about retargeting and I do want to talk about what retargeting campaigns I do recommend.

Okay? So, email and SMS. You should have welcome flows set up for your website collecting emails.

You should have abandoned cart flows as well. You should also have post-purchase upsells. You should be communicating to people who, you know, abandoned their cart, communicating people who just joined your newsletter and then also to post-purchase upsells.

Okay? Upselling people who already purchased from you, get them by more. Next one is Facebook groups.

Get existing customers into Facebook groups and put content in there. That is an amazing tool right there to do a lot of customer research. And then lastly, organic content.

Keep users around with organic content they actually want to see in, um, like, you know, and come back to. That's what I'm going to keep people around and keep people, you know, your brand on top of mine. So, just a quick summary because that was a lot we covered and I never want to hear again, you know, next year I do retargeting, you know, blah, blah, blah, drastically burning you money and it takes your focus off the highest leverage actions in your business and I hopefully now you should have a clear understanding of what you should and should not be doing in the account.

You know, why we haven't done retargeting all of 2022 and made our clients 10x more money. Retargeting is slowly being phased away from Facebook. IS 14.5 drastically decreased the efficiency of retargeting.

Focus on highest leverage actions inside of your ad account at all times. Build better assets to take the user through the whole sales process plus better landing and product pages and lastly, leverage email plus SMS plus organic content for retargeting. So, I hope this video helped you kind of lay it down.

You know, send this to your clients, send this to your friends who like spends $5 today and is like, Nick, you need to do retargeting. Send this to them as well. Pretty much anyone that's been on your ass about retargeting, send this video to them and hopefully this lays out enough points.
