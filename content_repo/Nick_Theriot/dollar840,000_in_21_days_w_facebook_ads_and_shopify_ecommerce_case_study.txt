what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have a new video for you guys probably one of the most insane case studies I have ever generated we did 847 000 in revenue within 21 days yes 21 days we've gone probably from around two to three thousand dollars a day we scaled up in a Valentine's Day offer very aggressively we did 847 thousand dollars in 21 days we spent 285 thousand dollars or 280 thousand dollars right on the bat and we did about 2.9 extra turn on ad spend with a break-even ROAS of 2.0 so let's jump into the video I'm going to show you exactly what we did what we've gone through with the process and everything is probably more of a strategy intense video but I'm going to show you everything that we did to generate these results so make sure you stick around before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit the subscribe button for new videos just like this every other day on this channel let's get started okay so let's jump into the Shopify real quick I'll show you guys the Shopify the Facebook ad account the tick tock account the Google ads account we primarily did Facebook ads but we did spend a little bit on Google ads and tick tocks I'll show you guys that as well so jumping into the Shopify account you can see right here from January 14th so we ran this offer to February 7th we did 847 thousand dollars in sales you can you know pretty much see how we start off on the 14th doing about 3200 dollars a day we scaled up we just kept pushing it started hovering around twenty thousand dollars a day which was like hey cool that's great it's that's crazy for this particular store and stuff and I was like you know what I want to push this to the limits so we readjusted some stuff with the offer the audiences we were targeting stuff and we were able to scale very aggressively capping out to our highest day of seventy four thousand dollars in a day absolutely insane but it doesn't even beat the twenty two thousand dollars we spent on advertising that day and then obviously because this was a Valentine's Day offer we started to lose momentum because people were like hey it's not gonna come in before Valentine's Day so we had to start scaling down and we had to scale down very aggressively because almost immediately we saw a difference in results once we started pulling some of that stuff back so if we go inside of the Facebook ads manager right now I'll show you again January 14th through the 7th right here you can literally see some of these campaigns were running and stuff we spent two hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars during that time period and we had a mixture of campaigns we ran and stuff and you know some of the some of the row ass and stuff like that is kind of skewed a little bit just due to you know the Facebook the way that things have been updated but if I'll pull you through one of them right here particular we were literally going completely open for one particular campaign and we spent the most in one hundred twenty six thousand dollars three hundred fifty thousand dollars in return so now let's go into TikTok again TikTok this is my first time ever running TikTok ads so for TikTok it was more just retargeting which actually did horrible because we only spent thirty five dollars on retargeting made back ninety two dollars so not really the greatest but we did spend some on the audience testing and stuff and pretty much TikTok was hey we're making a ton of money let's test a little bit budget on this and see if we can get something going but to be honest we started really late and we just didn't have the proper creatives for it so honestly perfectly fine with you know just under two extra hours for this one because it it also brought a lot of attention and traffic to the website that could have been reconverted on another platform another issue with multi-channel advertising so google advertising what we did for google advertising was a lot of just branded search terms and stuff we didn't do we tested a little bit of things in terms of like valentine's day gifts and stuff like that but we didn't see a crazy result because you know just our google listing was not much money was not much time and effort was put into it we did spend two thousand dollars or twenty five hundred dollars made back almost ten grand so almost a four extra turn on ads but you gotta think about it this is also a lot of branded search terms so people on facebook they that we spend money to acquire they go on google search up our business name then they come to our website and make the purchase which attributes to google ads but facebook guys originally we got them so again just a little bit of issue when you run into multi-channel advertising so i would have liked to see a little bit more in terms of like uh you know just just broader search terms that's getting people i've never heard of us to our website converting a little bit better which we saw an okay result in terms of that so now that i've taken you through the ad account the shopify and everything like that you know actually showing you just a little tidbits showing a little sneak peek and stuff what all went right how can we achieve such amazing results in such short period of time so let's start off with step number one okay so step number one is having a great product this is something that a lot of people misunderstand so you need to do a lot of customer research competitor research market research and making sure you have a really great product and understanding what some of your competitors have done to scale a product like that some of the ads and creatives and stuff they used some of the offers they've used so really just a lot of research and stuff and then also to making sure you have a great product you can have a great i mean you can have a bad product an amazing agency and still see poor results because you just you can't sell a bad product if no one wants it regardless of advertising campaigns you have it's not going to be profitable for you and it's something a lot of people run into an issue with so that's why we have a very strong process to make sure we validate someone's product before we even let them on to work with us as on our agency so that way we make sure we're only signing on great clients now the next thing is having a proven offer now luckily for us we actually ran this exact campaign this exact offer last valentine's day for this client and we we did thirty thousand dollars in sales we spent like ten thousand dollars made back thirty thousand dollars in sales the client was shocking all because you know those there were still a new client for us at the time so just proven to them a little bit of success with facebook ads it really just blew them off the water obviously doing twenty thirty x that this year was absolutely crazy so we had a proven offer we had a great product and we also had a scalable product this particular product was for valentine's day and pretty much anyone in a relationship could have used this as a gift so that's the next thing you need a scalable offer if you have a you know for example i've said this before if you have a gaming chair it's kind of hard to scale that aggressively there quick because you know there's only a limited amount of people that actually need a gaming chair right now whereas if you have this particular offer where it's a you know a lower ticket offer it's very scalable because anyone in a relationship could benefit from this product is really if you're in a relationship if you average order was from people 25 to 60 and lived in the usa and had a home or an apartment you know you were a perfect candidate for this so it was extremely scalable in terms of you know how many people could actually benefit from this product if you have a very very niched product sometimes you can have issues with scaling very aggressively like that now step number three is actually going through our three step ad creation process so mastering this three key concepts right here will allow you to pretty much scale anything or get good results with facebook ads using any product as long as there's a validated product so our three-step ad creation process is we want to make sure that we're hitting all three of these when we're running paid advertising we want to make sure we're grabbing attention so some really good creatives number two we're creating desire we want to make sure our ad copy persuades people into buying our product and the key to persuasion is taking those desires people have right now and channeling them into our product so we're not trying to create desire you know trying to find these random desires out thin air and create them out thin air no but we're taking desires that they already have and we're channeling them into our product that our product is going to fulfill all of their key desires right now so we're grabbing attention we're creating desire for our product and then the last one is a reason to take action now you know this is probably the most critical one because we want to make sure people are taking action now it's valentine's day we have a great offer a discount for the product that's it it's all we needed for this particular product we have a great product you know we have great creatives we're grabbing their attention we're channeling their desires and stuff what else do we need we need to make sure they take action now we if we run this on a non-valentine state without any deadline or anything like that we ran this product all the time and it does a little worse in terms we see anywhere from 30 to 40 percent less of results because there's no reason to take action now whereas we're creating that reason to take action now and people are converting now and also requires less retargeting even though we did do a lot of retargeting so but we're getting a lot of really good orders because people understand hey i need to purchase this before this date because of a shipping cutoff it's a great product i really want it i really want to give it as a valentine's day gift let me order now this again combined with all the above allows to scale really hard really aggressively so now that we have all of that above hit where we were testing that in testing campaigns our testing campaigns we pretty much just ran abo we used proven audiences to test new creatives we tested new audiences with proven creatives simple two abo campaigns which are testing stuff figuring out what worked and we came down to about 15 creatives that worked really well for us a mixture of video and images honestly we were so busy with the images and videos we did not run one carousel campaign and honestly i regret that i wish i would have gone back and ran a carousel campaign and i wish i would have gone back and ran a gif because i feel like those two would have did really well as well but hey we did some amazing results and we had about one creative that did about 80 of the revenue yes that's crazy i know we had one creative that worked extremely well it's just a video holding the product demonstrating the product and that's it worked very well for us so we had a bunch of proven creatives and stuff and people underestimate how many creatives you actually need to really scale a product so you want to make sure you have a lot of creatives when you're trying to scale this aggressively it's not just going to be one or two creatives and that's it you want to keep having a back burner of creatives and stuff that's being tested and ready to roll because as soon as some of these start to die out you're going to be stuck with no creatives and you're going to scale all the way back down have to you know test more and prolong the length before you can get back up to where you want to be at now our scaling strategy is pretty simple once we had a proven audiences and our proven creatives are working really well for us what we do is we'll put them in a cbo campaign start the cbo campaign off about a hundred dollars per day we'd have probably three or four proven audiences and we also made sure we took a good insight of audience overlap so we wanted to make sure that if we were running like a purchase seven day la one percent you know if we had to add to cart la seven you know purchase our add to cart last seven days la one percent those can have a strong overlap so we tried to make sure we had some very unique audiences in there even with our lookalike audiences and we always check the audience overlap we made sure we had less than you know 20 auction overlap and audience overlap so two two key areas to look at so we had some very unique audiences when we were scaling this this helped out with auction overlap dropping that auction overlap down and allow us to have some very unique audiences to scale up with and it's also just helped out with cpms and all that good stuff and then so we had those cbo in there about three or four winning ad sets with our multitude of winning creatives in there start off at a hundred dollars a day we ran that for a few days and you know let's just take a look at the ads manager real quick so um we're not the ads manager let's take a look at the the store real quick itself so we ran that for those first few days and stuff and we saw some decent results in terms of you know we started scaling up a little bit we crossed over that you know we went from four thousand dollars a day to eleven thousand dollars a day we started scaling up a little bit and it was cool but we needed to go harder because with a cbo at a hundred dollars per day and just raising the budget by 20 once every day you can't really scale aggressively so what we did was is after we launched that cbo we saw some immediately great results so some three four five extra turn on ad spend immediately so i'm like okay if we're getting some really good results at this level how can we take it up to next level so the idea was i just duplicated that cbo at a thousand dollars a day and that allows to go from you know three to four thousand dollars a day to eleven thousand dollars a day pretty quickly duplicated that cbo again you know it's like three or four thousand dollars a day and again this is something that you you have to have a lot of stuff correct to do this you can't just do this you know um if you have a cbo your your ideal row ass is three to four x you have a cbo you launch it today at a hundred dollars a day and you know out for 24 hours you have a 2.85 row house on that particular tbo with like one or two purchases oh i can just duplicate to a thousand dollars a day that's highly unrealistic you need a lot a good portion of purchases some really high row as a lower spin in order to be able to do that because you're just not going to see the results and stuff that you're expecting so i knew this offer was great i knew this product was great i knew everything was perfectly aligned for us so i just started testing it i started risking a little bit more and i started doing some a little bit more guerrilla tactics to scale these advertising campaigns because i knew everything was working extremely well and i also knew we had a time limit to spend as much as we could because i knew after a certain point the stuff is just going to die out because that shipping deadline is going to happen people won't receive before valentine's day they're not going to stop ordering on a certain period of time so for us scaling was extremely important so all i did was start duplicating cbos at like more you know double or triple the spin of the prior cbo and that has to go pretty good but then we hit an issue we were literally burning out of our audiences so quickly in terms of like just interest targeting one percent la's and stuff that we hit a plateau and you can start to see it right here around this 25th range where we start to see you know budget just bouncing around 19 000 20 000 19 000 20 000 in terms of results and we were actually losing started losing money because on the flip side in the ads manager we were actually spending a good bit so around the 25th we spent 7400 and we didn't quite hit our 3x which is a few points away from it and what we needed to do was we needed to re-pivot and i took a look at everything i started to see our audience saturation was going up so that means more and more people start to see the same ad i looked at the audience size it was like a few millions like we should be good but it just wasn't good enough so what i did was as i ended up taking that and i i found a new winning audience um it was literally just open broad completely broad like i literally just have exclusions in place and that is it it's targeting men and women you know 18 plus usa and that was is what allowed us to really scale up so if we go back inside to 14th and 17th we can see right here this is when we really scale this particular campaign go back look campaign right here you know we were spending twelve thousand dollars a day we had this all the way up to eighteen thousand dollars a day and i started pulling back as you know results started to drop a little bit and then eventually i just turned it off because our ROAS was dropping pretty quickly because again that shipping deadline hit and less and less people ordering because they wanted it for valentine's day now with this particular campaign right here again i went open all so i literally just once i found out that this open ad set was working really well i duplicated it from a you know just an abo campaign and i put in a cbo campaign and i multiplied it by four so we had five ad sets and a cbo all targeted the same audience and i'll just pretty much letting facebook cycle through them because when you're targeting every ad set you create you have a different pool of people that it targets so i knew that so i'm like okay let me duplicate it a few times so we can target different pools of people so we can maximize the efficiency of this particular offer and that's exactly what happened and we can see right here you know we had one right here at 2.87 2.86 2.81 2.69 ROAS you know all would have cost the purchase around 27 26 dollars except one which had the lowest which is a 2.43 return on ad spend now what if the one i duplicated was just going to be in this one right here with a 2.43 and duplicating it allows to touch new groups of people so this is something that i recommend when you're trying to spend a lot of money i try to scale aggressively duplicating it multiplying it and you're going to target new groups of people and stuff and again it's something that's worked really well for us but you have to have everything prior to this correct to do this so make sure you have that done and then like i said we just started scaling up we started increasing the budget by 100 or duplicating the cbo with a bigger budget so yeah we have did both with this because let's say for example we had a cbo at five thousand dollars a day at the end of the day if that one was super profitable over the last few days we literally just add another five thousand we multiplied the budget by two hundred percent increase next day it was at a ten thousand dollar cbo so we tested that we tested duplicating cbo's at higher budgets our retargeting and our remarketing we were doing you know 30 day engagement audiences 30 day website visitors because again it's more relevant to the offer we're pushing and that way we we had some really relevant ads to hey this is valentine's day make sure you order now before deadline you know showing other people that had purchased this product in the past as gifts and showing off those testimonials because it's mostly gift giving in this particular audience that we're pushing so we had that we started testing new angles in terms of like how to surprise your wife for valentine's day versus you know the perfect gift for valentine's day so we started testing new ways of which way we promote the product really great creatives and stuff literally just pulling it all together and that's what allowed us to receive you know generate these type of results okay i want to show you guys one particular retargeting campaign i'm not gonna go too crazy and retargeting and stuff but this is our mofu so this is our you know engagement audiences and stuff and also video viewers so we targeted a variety of video viewers and social engagement i used a abo for this particular campaign because i wanted to make sure that each of these audiences had a specific amount of spend i didn't want just facebook latching on to whatever one's performing best and not spending accordingly so um i originally had these at like a thousand two thousand dollars a day in ad spend and you can see right there we did video viewers which performed absolutely amazing for us and it's an area that we lacked so much in our agency we've we've been so reluctant to target video viewers for god knows what reason but i needed more audiences to test and stuff and that's why we went with this we went with video viewers 50% and it worked really well for us and we used the same ads we used exactly the same ads in our social engagement 30 and website visitors 30 excluding view content and purchase and stuff so we're targeting purely social engagement and people that are warm that haven't viewed any products you can see right here we have to spend double on that particular audience the video viewers and we made literally double and it worked extremely well and but i do know the relevancy you can see how the click-through rates actually lower on the video viewers and that's because you know people are watching i i did 50 of a 20 second long video to a cold audience so whereas an engagement with someone who liked it or commented or shared it or clicked on it so the engagement audience was a little more relevant but it also had less people you can see our frequency jacked up all the way to four which probably decreased the return on ad spend a little bit but in our video viewers and stuff we had a 4x return on ad spend we reached way more people cheaper cpm a little less than the frequency so we could actually probably spend more on this particular audience and we had a little bit lower of a click through rate though so maybe we could have tried some different ad variations and stuff that really was more relevant to pulling people back into um this video now one particular problem with this was when we were running this ad account and stuff is we started to run in issues with cap on spend so if i go right here to say friday the 5th we were literally capped out at 22 000 in spend right here and we got capped out for a few days so we tried reaching out to facebook and stuff like that and we just we could not figure out you know what we reached out to them we just cannot get this cap removed so honestly we probably could have hit some six figures days because our other platforms weren't really performing as well now speaking of other platforms tiktok i'm not gonna go too crazy into the account and stuff like that but we did see some minor results with it again i just didn't have the creative and stuff it was just something we wanted to test throw some extra budget at to see what we could do across platform i got some okay results for a video that wasn't even meant for tiktok in terms of like you know what audiences are used to seeing in our ad and google ads like i said i just did a little bit of retargeting and remarketing and then also to going after some keywords that people were searching but it just it wasn't that profitable and we definitely still have some more stuff to refine on the google side for the next sale we do like this so closing out this has probably been one of the biggest e-com case studies i've ever done in my career seeing these type of results is absolutely insane and it's definitely not something you see on a typical day-to-day basis like i said there was a lot of stuff that went right there could have been stuff that could have been better planned in terms of more creative we could have you know also had more products to upsell and cross sell with which would have increased average order value which again with increased results and stuff we could have had a little bit more stuff done for tiktok and google but again it was more of just hey we're running this let's try to see what we can do on other platforms and luckily we didn't spend too much to really jeopardize the majority of the profit but still with this we did you know 847 000 in less than 21 days and you know just to put that perspective in 2020 we did 3 million dollars in revenue for our clients you know cumulative total whereas for one client just one of our client multiple of our clients we did 847 000 in less than 21 days so just some absolutely amazing results to start off in 2021 and i'm super stoked to see what we can do for our other clients and stuff in 2021 i know my personal goal is to do 30 million dollars in revenue this year between all my clients every year i like to 10x revenue just as a new goal so that's just
