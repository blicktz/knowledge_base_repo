yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriot here and today I have an exciting new video where I want to share with you guys a video view retargeting strategy we've been using inside of Facebook ads has been working really well for us using this strategy is going to allow you to kind of increase your ROAS allow you an increased amount of people in your middle funnel and your warm audiences and honestly it's something that I've been knowing about for a while and I've been very reluctant on trying it and then once I did I'm like wow where have I been because it has been destroying all of our engagement audiences and I'm gonna show you exactly how we have it set up so before we begin make sure you hit the like button on this video and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day helping empower the Shopify business owner and allowing them to scale to multiple six figures in 2021 let's get started guys so basically in our warm audiences I was starting to run into an issue where we were losing people to fill into our warm audiences so I need to expand into more audiences typically I just do a 30-day engagement and a 30-day website visitors excluding people who viewed content out of the cart purchase so that way it's purely people who are just warm maybe just kind of browsing around who know the brand but I needed a way to funnel in more people and for the way that we're having this particular campaign running we had a video that was doing really well at top of funnel so that's key number one is you need to have some type of video ad that you're running either top of funnel or middle funnel and then you retarget people a step below so we're running this top of funnel we're retargeting people at middle funnel if we're running this middle funnel we retarget people at bottom of funnel so it just depends on where the video is and where people are at in the consumer cycle so we had a really well done video at top of funnel that's performing amazing but we wanted to pull and extract as many other people as we can that didn't take the traditional route of seeing ad clicking on it and purchasing it we needed to retarget more people so I was thinking of different ways we did social engagement we did website visitors we did add it to cart all those good stuff what else can we optimize for what else what other audiences are we missing and that is where video view retargeting came at so if we look inside of the ads manager you can see right here I have two particular ad sets one is a vv 50 excluding view content and purchase 30 days so this is purely the people who watch this video of at least 50 or more and then the second one is social engagement 30 days and website visitors 30 days excluding view content 30 days and purchase 30 days so again both warm audiences and the only difference really is one has spent a thousand dollars a day and one has been spending five hundred dollars a day we've been running this for about seven days maybe a little over seven days and the results itself has been very very good so we started off with this particular campaign this is our middle funnel campaign just to remind you guys we our social engagement is around 3x return and our video view retargeting is around a 4.2 return so a little bit more higher little bit more profit and we're actually able to spend a lot more because it's a bigger audiences there's more people watching a portion of the video and not being counted as an engagement audience so we're missing a lot of people that are warm to the brand but just we can't retarget them because they haven't taken an action yet besides watch a video so this is something that's extremely underestimated of the effectiveness of it and it works especially really well with like higher ticket products but for this particular account that's selling a product with an average order value of around 70 80 bucks it's working really well too so i'm gonna show you guys how to set it up um simply just go to edit right here and what you want to do is you want to go and scroll down and you're gonna see right here where you can see include a custom audience i got my exclusions i got my custom my customer audience i'm including i'm gonna click on custom audience and then i'm gonna go right here to video and then i'm gonna choose a content type so there's different ways of which you can go ahead and like target people with video you can do a percentage of the video watched or you can do it by how long they watch so we can do three seconds ten seconds or you can do like 25 50 75 100 of that video so there's a few different ways you can target people based off the time they watch that video what i would recommend is testing a few different ones to see which one works the best for you there's gonna be a big factor here that's gonna be coming at play and that is how long your video is if you have a 10 minute long video and you're running at top of funnel and you're gonna target people who watch 95 of that video it's gonna be very very hard to really get enough people to really target but if you want to target 10 minute long video and you only want to do three seconds of the video you can get a lot more people in there so it's gonna funnel down between maybe you know a couple thousand people to a couple hundred people as you go further down the chain we did 50 of this video because the video is literally only 15 seconds long so we know it's about seven seconds people have to watch um so we can get some people that maybe not fully interested but you know they're definitely aware of what's going on with the brand the average attention range on facebook and in pretty much any video advertising is three seconds so if you can keep people past three seconds you obviously got them hooked into it so if we can engage with those people again they're a little bit more warmer to the brand than say people who are under three seconds so that is why we kind of went with 50 but i definitely would recommend testing a few other ones as well with your brand to see which one works best so you simply just choose one right here and then what you can do is you can actually choose specifically the videos that you want to work with so we can go right here and i click on the page and i can see right here that these videos all have different time range um these videos all the recent videos we used and you kind of sort it by last year's date select dates if you want to go further into back but i'm gonna find our video right here and that's the video we use as 2.5 million views hit continue and then what you can do is you can select okay at what point in the past x amount of days did they watch 50 or more so we just did 30 days because this is a pretty new video we just released so we know we don't really have much background data past 30 days so we went with 30 days so if you have a video that's been going viral for a few months you can retarget all those people and again it's another variable you need to test percentage and plus the days in which they watched it so and then obviously just name your audience and boom and then right here you can see right here engagement video video viewers 50 we have a reach of around 41 000 to 119 000 people with an estimated 26 to 74 conversions per day with you know i think we have like a thousand dollar a day ad spin for this particular thing so this allowed a lot more people inside of our audience compared to say an engagement where there's a little bit less people in fact we actually click edit on that we're seeing a reach between 12k to 36k and this one is you know somewhere around a 41 to 119k now the difference between an engagement and a video view is a video view is actually someone who's watched a video for a period of time whereas a social engagement is a like a comment a share or click on the ad to go to your facebook page or click on the ad to go to your website now i'm gonna have another video soon that's gonna go over all of this and further in depth because this is gonna be something that's gonna be playing a big role in my advertising strategies going into ios 14 where we're gonna lose a lot of data post people clicking off the facebook thing so what i would like to do is set up some more video view retargeting campaigns so that way we're building up more further defined audiences that are more likely to convert and allows us for more accurate retargeting because when someone watches the video they're on facebook's platform and with ios 14 we can still remarket to them because there's no on platform limitations for remarketing so i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're an e-com business owner you're spending at least a
