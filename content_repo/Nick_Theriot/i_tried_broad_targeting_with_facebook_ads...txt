so i tried broad targeting with facebook ads and the results are pretty shocking so i wanted to make this video to show you guys what happened when i tried broad targeting and then also to going a little bit more into broad targeting for those who don't really know what broad targeting is and how to effectively leverage it on facebook ads so first off here's what happened uh one account we were able to scale from 5k a day to 30 000 a day over six months period of time another account we were able to do 1.4 million in 30 days for men's clothing brand that is euro so be slightly higher in usd and then for a ambulance insurance offer for legion specifically we're able to spend 379 000 so it's pretty shocking of what happened when we leveraged broad targeting uh specifically for facebook now if you're asking yourself what is broad targeting if you don't really know if you live in the rock or maybe the first time you've actually watched this youtube channel or just you know first time seeing it broad targeting is essentially going ahead and only targeting age gender location so location you're you want to target specifically the age group this is 18 plus just for this particular account but that doesn't mean you have to target 18 plus if you know a specific age range same thing for gender if you know a specific gender you can put gender but if um you know if it's for both genders then cool you put both genders yeah so it's just aged in their location and the key thing here is that there's no look-alike audiences no custom audiences and no interests specifically involved here now if you're asking yourself well how does this work like how can you get such good results with broad targeting and the key thing here is that when you launch an ad facebook creates the audience based off the ad itself in fact there's hundreds of thousands of data points that are pulled from an ad specifically and facebook starts to build out audiences off of that ad when you upload that ad to facebook and if you want to even test this for yourself go like image recognize.com and then you can upload whatever image you want now again facebook algorithm is like 100 times more powerful than this particular tool right here but it'll basically kind of just point out random objects in the ad specifically and uh tell you like what's what's in it specifically like that so um but yeah so facebook leverages this algorithm to pull stuff from your copy your creative your headline yeah it knows if someone's sad and it knows if someone is smiling it knows if it's a boy or girl if they're in their 30s their 50s their 60s and you know it if you upload a video and it like it talks throughout the video it pulls the transcription and finds like keywords and that's from transcription all that good stuff right there and what it does is it creates audiences so like you see right here people who are likely into weight loss people who likely use protein people who likely use collagen people who likely struggle with wrinkles so it pulls and creates audiences based off the ad not the ad sets not the campaign so now we're leveraging facebook algorithm to tell us hey you know how's the what's the best way to target this ad and facebook is going ahead and just taking that ad and putting it in front of the right people that are going to resonate with this ad and the second thing is that facebook's consistently checking to see what ads are performing based off what groups of people so like if i upload this ad right here facebook will put in front of 100 people all right maybe 50 of them had an angry face to it not not the emotion just like 50 of them just swipe past it never stopped on it and then like 50 of them loved it smiled and stuff like that then and like clicked on and everything facebook's gonna put it more in front of people that are engaging with that ad and people that are angry with it so facebook is consistently optimizing the ad this is why i don't believe in the learning phase or learning limited or learning or active facebook is always learning it's always learning about your audience as you spend and here's also just some more proof right here how the audience is created based off the ad we targeted a ad group specifically like one ad set broad targeting that gender was selected as male plus female so we're targeting both female female and male and this particular ad right here had a male golfer in it both of them have pretty much the same text but the only thing different is the female golfer versus the male golfer and you can see in the male golfer ad 9400 out of 10 000 was spent on male and only 617 on female now on the female golfer ad 7600 was spent on female that's 10 times more than this ad right here and 3 900 was spent on male now why did we also get some spin on male in this one is because it's a pretty female golfer and obviously men are more likely to click on that so the type of stuff that's scroll stopping and engaging that's specifically the biggest thing you want to focus on what is scroll stopping people because the scroll stop is the type of people we're attracted from there so that's a big one we want to look at again both of these ads were in the same ad set but and this ad set was targeting male plus female another example to look at your feed look like your tick tock feed your instagram reels feed your facebook suggested post your instagram explore page all of these are organic content and there's no way to put targeting in them it's just based off the content you like and you love also another key thing there if we want to target car enthusiasts we need to show a car so stop car people in the first three seconds because we already know they're consuming car content etc now facebook want you to do good i think a lot of people have this misconception that like facebook is evil and facebook doesn't want you to succeed facebook knows that a it needs advertisers like us to give them extra content um let me rephrase that facebook needs us because we are the advertisers that make facebook money and facebook knows that if an advertiser is not performing they're going to pull their money back if they pull their money back facebook's gonna let make less money so facebook automatically wants us to do good because if we do good we're gonna spend more money if we spend more money that makes facebook happy it allows them to pay their light bill that allows them to pay their employees allows them to continue to expand and grow their business and the second thing is that the only restriction that facebook has on us is that hey you need a good product and you need to create good content that actually entertains our customers because if we're not entertaining and like and actually putting out ads people want to see on facebook then what's happening is that facebook's like hey we can't really show really show your ad which damages our spin and all that good stuff right there so create good ads have good products that are ethical don't create products that are scams and don't create products that no one wants have products people want create good content and you're going to do good with facebook and specifically broad targeting specifically now why does broad targeting work better big question a lot of people have so the biggest one is scaling potential we can scale significantly further than using interests or lookalikes here here's an example this blue circle is your total market you can target the gray box is just everyone that's within and with within broad targeting this gray box right here is everyone within this interest audience this uh gray box right here is everyone within let's just say a lookalike audience and we can only target people that are in the blue circle within this gray box so like this one right here we can reach everyone in our market which is really good this one right here we can only reach about 50 percent of people in our market maybe 40 percent of people in our market and then this one right here we can only reach like maybe 10 of our people so we can't target everyone in our market in these two scenarios but this scenario we can and facebook's going to push all the ad dollars in this blue circle it's not going to push into this gray box it's only going to push where people facebook knows you're going to get customers from now next one is efficiency i no longer have to worry about is it the ad or is it the audience any ad account failure we have or dip in performance i immediately push on the fact that hey we need better ads and that's that's the mindset we have and that's how we can scale accounts significantly because we create good ads that allow people to purchase and also too i no longer have to spend time setting up audience tests i can't tell you how much time i wasted trying to keep searching for the perfect audience and how much money i wasted i mean i've spent so much money on audience testing you know for example one of our accounts we spent 4.5 million dollars last year i used to do audience testing for that account that means i spent 450 000 i used to do about 10 of our budget 450 000 on audience testing that just went to waste so 450 000 i could immediately put that in something better i could put that hey just pay me to 450 grand and i'll put more time in creative and that's going to make them 10 times more money b put that investment portfolio like there's so much stuff you can do at 450 000 next one is stable results we have substantially more stable results than running interests or look likes or anything like that so here's a legion account um this is just for 2023 so far we spent 2.6 million dollars in this account um january 1st to september 27th for this particular account it's the ecom account we spent uh you know probably a little over 810 000 in this account all stable because we do broad targeting we don't have random spikes in cpms we don't have random spikes in cpas and stuff like that we still have up and down days don't get me wrong but it doesn't happen as often now next common questions that a lot of people ask me specifically related to broad targeting does broad work with new accounts yes yes it does i think a lot of people mistaken the fact that hey i launched a brand new account i need to go interest and audiences and stuff like that to get the account to learn that's completely false facebook is going to build audiences based off the ads you give it so if you can spend more time and money on the ads building better ads you're going to substantially uh speed up the process of which you get results in the accounts whereas if you go target interests look likes and stuff like that you're going to waste money by not focusing on the thing that's going to generate you money hopefully that makes sense this is a brand new account right here uh we're targeting uh people who suffer from arthritis uh we spent like uh i don't know 676 brand new account never had ads ran it before we did broad targeting we did a variety of different sales angles and stuff like that and we got a 75 cost per purchase was actually which is our target because this particular product is a supplement product that is a subscription base like this is actually really good right here and then this is also the first run of that so we're going to drastically improve this results as time goes on next thing is does broad work with niche products get this question so many times so this is actually a student win right here um so uh basically one of my students in the inner circle had if you want more information about that click in the comments have nick terrio mentor you and this particular student right here launched the product in the restaurant niche specifically for restaurant business owners so only restaurant business owners are going to resonate with this ad and he launched this particular account shout to scott right here and he spent 561 brand new campaign broad targeting uh he launched seven ads all very different cells um like sales messaging and he spent 561 make 3600 back at 6.49 roas broad targeting for restaurant owners for a product for restaurant owners b2b pretty much so yes broad targeting works with niche products because this is a freaking niche product right here next one i tried broad it didn't work for me so 90 of our accounts we manage we can jump straight into broad we can do separate broad card and campaign put our best-selling ads in it and boom it crushes then probably like 10 of the accounts we don't see it working from the beginning like it it takes a little bit longer so what we do is we take like let's say we're spending a thousand dollars a day i'll take 10 of our daily budget i'll set up a broad targeting campaign and i'll just keep investing 10 every day in that broad targeting campaign with the long-term vision in mind i don't care what the results are i'm just going to keep investing into it until it becomes my main winning campaign and main winning campaign for me is it's taking 90 of the spend in the account and it's crushing like it's doing good it's hitting all of our goals so from here i'll just keep building better ads to improve that campaign and make broad work for me simple as that and i'll scale the campaign as results follow but yeah so that's broad targeting that's what we leverage uh we spend almost two two million dollars a month specifically on facebook ads between 10 accounts and um you know for our clients and stuff like that our agency more information below um just have nick terrio run your ads and yeah it's what we use we don't use anything else broad targeting is all we use and i don't want to be that person saying like hey broad target is the only way to go and stuff like that i'm just saying hey this is what we use this is how we get such good results and yeah if you like it cool if you want to keep using interest look like cool i'm not debating for anyone but this is what's working for us this allows us to crush it from brand new accounts to niche products to um you know scaling up accounts to spending literally you know doing thirty thousand dollars a day in sales um even one account that did 1.5 million last month which is like uh like i don't know what fifty thousand dollars a day in sales 56 000 dollars in days in sales um but yeah so hope you all enjoyed this video hit the like button hit the subscribe button for new videos every monday
