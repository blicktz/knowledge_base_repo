yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio and today I have an exciting new video for you guys I wanted to quickly showcase a thank you video we've used inside of our Facebook advertising campaigns that's drastically improved performance in our upsell so I'll post purchase upsell to our previous buyers so in today's video I'm going to show you guys exactly what you need to do we're seeing a little round 12x return on adspend if you get this right so hopefully I can show you guys a few tips and tricks and how to incorporate this strategy inside of your Facebook advertising campaigns so before we get started make sure you hit that like button and if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button for some more badass Facebook ad content marketing related videos okay guys so I'm gonna pop up real quick a little like screenshot from the ad account of this particular thank you video so pop it up now we've always used a thank you sequence for this particular ad account of just a simple thank you picture from the clients you know this is this is in the women's clothing so I just had a picture of the client because she's like the main model for all of the clothing and just saying hey thank you for your purchase I'll put a link to the support chat to where people click on it go back to the website so we didn't have any upsells yet set up yet so I was like okay let's talk let's see what we can do to boost the performance of this so I had the client go ahead and film a short 30 second video saying hey thank you guys so much for purchasing shipping takes around four to five business days to receive it in the mail if you have any questions regarding fit maybe it's not fitting properly please you know contact our support team here and we'll happily help you out with getting you an exchange or a return which relates into a store credit and look as a thank you here is 20% off your next purchase it expires in a few hours to make sure you take action now so that was pretty much it just a quick short thank you video explaining what they're gonna expect now in terms of shipping processing time receiving the item what happens if it doesn't fit because that's a common objection in terms of clothing and buying and stuff like that letting them the new customer know that we have them we're gonna take care of them and then we're also gonna 20% off discount code which we never do 20% we're always doing around 10% uh so give them something a really good offer that they'll take action on that's the key you have to test this with multiple different offers to really explode this and also understand what the new client may want for clothing hey here's a discount code go purchase some more um but you may be in different niches where not necessarily discount code but maybe a just a different product that'll be a great upsell on top of the product you just sold them um and what we did was we sent this video off and we targeted people who purchased in the last seven days to upsell them we used ad copy just said thank you with a little bit of scarcity that this coupon code is going to expire soon and then we made sure that we added like some little text on the video to really make it instagram and facebook friendly and we ran 57 on you know spend tweak and you know we generated a little over 10 sales um five dollar cost per purchase when the usual cpa is around 25 to 30 dollars atop the funnel um and we generated 730 in revenue for a 12x return on ad spend now the other thank you image we had before uh we spent 220 on it a little bit more because we ran this one for a little bit longer uh we generated a three extra turn on ad spend at a 22 cost per purchase with 679 in revenue so within a much shorter time much less ad spend we've made just a little more in terms of revenue spent less higher reos and helped a lot boost our back-end performance on every targeting remarketing campaigns so if this is something that you think you can add into your account um highly recommend it i may take some thinking time some strategic you know strategy time to really incorporate this an ad account but you gotta make sure of a few things the right offer the right offer is key and you may have to test multiple different offers now let's say for example was we worked with a client that sold gaming chairs and you only sell gaming chairs positioning a 20 off discount code for them to go purchase another gaming chair if they just purchase one won't be the right fit no i just purchased the game chair i'm not going to go purchase it but what we did was is we came there and we went and got um an rgb kit set up for the gaming chair to where you can put it on the gaming chair and it can light up and show some really cool stuff so what we did was is we positioned that as the upsell so someone purchased a gaming chair and then now here's rgb upgrade kit for 50 off and it's like an almost immediate buy because they're like oh i was already looking at that but i wanted to spend as much as i could on the chair get the best chair but now i get a discount code on this upsell and i'm more inclined to buy that particular product so you have to be strategic about which how you promote this and there's a lot of other products that maybe just have any one-time use buys and there's not really like immediate upsell like buy more you know for clothing you can always buy more especially women's fashion because especially if you have a lot of different products and stuff you can go ahead on your website and you know purchase one and like oh i wanted all this but i sacrificed my you know i sacrificed for these particular things now i get a discount code to go buy more i'm like whoa i need a herbicore bottles other things i want it so different stores will have different kind of strategy behind it and that's a really big key takeaway from this because i can tell you now you'll probably test one offer you won't get the results you want and then it's like oh this doesn't work it always works it's just how you position your offer and then also to the amount of offers you test go create like three or four different offers create three or four different ads run it to them um key key takeaways it's just a thank you video mention their expectations and hey if you want also go take 20 off your offer um make sure you use like the headline like really make sure you push this so don't be so secret about it don't like it just in a video mention it once you know position your ad copy use your headline you know use code come back 20 for 20 off your next order um use like your newsfeed link description for like a you know count like urgency like better take action now spots expire so all that stuff right there um and then your ad copy itself you know thank you so much for your order um limited time for now only go ahead you know use code come back 20 within the next few days you get 20 off your next order so that worked for us really well um as you can see in terms of results and stuff i highly recommend everyone do this and like i said you don't need much spend at all five dollars a day um this store literally does 50 to 100 000 a month in revenue and we're literally just running five ten dollars a day to an audience of seven day purchases because there's not a lot of people there's only a few hundred people in there not even a few hundred just small amount um so we don't need a lot of spin and if you really position this wisely it can be very powerful in terms of boosting your bottom line performance so hope you guys enjoyed this video um let me know what you guys think let me know if you test this out and see how it works for your campaigns i would love to know love to hear some of you guys results and stuff like that um i'm pretty confident it's going to help all you guys add a little extra revenue at only a few dollars per day go and go incorporate
