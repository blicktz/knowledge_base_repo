Hey, what is going on guys Nick here welcome back to the channel I'm not gonna really bring any crazy video ideas today for you guys But I did want to bring a video regarding bid cap with Facebook and it's basically telling Facebook Hey, I do not want to spend more than three dollars per conversion whether it's a link view or a landing page view a add to cart a purchase or a You know a lead and for instance in my case I'm gonna show you guys in this video and it's basically telling Facebook. Hey, you know X amount of money So let's say for instance if you have a thousand dollar product and you've been selling it at about on average of 60 to 70 dollars of ad spend and You want to kind of start scaling that campaign as soon as you pump a whole bunch of money into that daily budget Facebook's gonna start spending a lot more of it to get a conversion and you don't want that So that's why you can try to keep it at that level and I'm gonna explain all that in a second. So this is a Digital guide I have that downloadable That I'm using for my digital agency to get some leads in specifically for some campaign audits and Also to get people on some consulting sessions and buy a consulting session with me So what I am doing to start this campaign I came there and I targeted some business owners people who would likely be business owners Specifically sent this guide out to them and I started off about twenty dollars a day with about 295 per lead And then I started just testing various parts of the ad campaign create a look like audience test the specific placements And then all the way down to where I was getting an average cost per result Of about 275.

I'm this right here is kind of messing it up and Then I was able to tell Facebook. Hey, I don't want to spend more than three dollars for someone to download this thing And I will not pay you more than three dollars So Facebook is only finding the conversions below three dollars and allow me to you know pump this budget up to about a hundred dollars a day Now if you were come there and just use automatic still Without a bid cap and you put this hundred dollars a day on days that Facebook can't find Convergence below three dollars you might it might be spending, you know, maybe fifty dollars for one conversion I don't want to spend that much money. I want to try to keep this lean and Be able to scale it in the days that you can get me.

So for instance I turned a campaign back on about a day ago and Just in the past 24 hours or I mean in the past actually 10 hours because starts off at 12 o'clock 12 a.m It's 10 57 a.m And past 10 12 hours 10 11 hours. It's got me 21 leads a dollar 27 per lead still using that same bid cap so bid caps can be very useful if you are Trying to scale a campaign and you don't want Facebook to spend a lot of money per conversion. So So say for instance if I was spending a hundred dollars a day couldn't find me campaign for about three dollars pop or it could find me Cost per you know conversion at three dollars or under it might spend 40 and 50 dollars or even more And I know there's a lot of a big issue that a lot of people run into with running Facebook guys and trying to scale it at higher budgets You know because a lot of people just kind of duplicate one of these and push it up to forty dollars a day Or might just start changing the daily budget to 20 40 80 and that can be very messy We're trying to scale a Facebook campaign So I'm gonna try to make this video as simple as possible to understand my articulate Articulate it in a way that's easy to understand and you can follow step by step.

So First off you need to make sure you've tested the campaign. I recommend three hundred dollars three hundred to six hundred dollars Testing the campaign before scaling it now again. This is a campaign for the whole country Of the United States If you're trying to test and scale a campaign in an audience as maybe 80 to 100 thousand This is an audience of about 3.4 million to a million Somewhere around that range to be honest.

I think it was 3.4 million originally and once I created a look-like audience it came down to about a million Um, you know, it's really hard to scale a campaign I low result cost per result when are we targeting a super small area? So you might just have to stick to a daily budget or you know a really high Conversion on average. I'm gonna show you that in a second.

So But testing this is my kind of cycle of what I go through. I test I spend about $100 testing my different audiences Then I spend another hundred dollars testing different offers and then I spend another hundred dollars testing the creatives So that way at the end of it after about three hundred dollars to spend I've locked down on one audience one offer and one creative Now it's ready to scale Then I'll come there and the first type of thing on my test is placement So this is all with automatic placements and if you don't know what that means, that's basically when you create a campaign And of where you want to place that it's like the Instagram feed the Facebook news feed mobile desktop And right here on this campaign The one that I'm actually hitting at three dollars of a bit cap It's at mobile and just on Facebook feeds, but originally it was on all of these and what you can do is then when you're and then first initial stage of scaling a campaign is after you got this campaign locked down with automatic placements You can come right here. Make sure Come right here to performance and Breakdown and then you can go to placement And then you also need a device but I'm just new placement And you can actually see specifically of where Facebook is spending your money at and where you can your leads So I kind of for this campaign I kind of did the wrong thing and I just start to scale it and alright It's just started to spend the money immediately on Instagram and Facebook Which ain't bad idea, but I don't recommend Mend it at all Because you never want to assume I kind of did some assumption with this with and that's a bad Mindset you want to make sure you go into Facebook ads and anything business with a very neutral mindset and the thing of assumption It's not good.

So but as you can see right here, this was one of the audiences I did which is Instagram and Facebook and After running it and getting was at like 30 some leads 32 leads right here This is one of the initial earlier campaigns. I was getting leads about on average at 235 But I looked in here and I could see Facebook newsfeed I got 22 leads out of those 32 from Facebook newsfeed at a dollar 49 a pop Where Instagram I was getting them at 10 I was got 10 leads at 367 a pop So and if you're looking at these two campaigns, you know And especially if you launched on the desktop on all the nice network and you looked overall at all of these And you could see how much Leads and where they're coming from what's the average cost? That's where you would come there And you could create a separate campaign.

So that's why I saw right here Facebook newsfeed 22 at a dollar 49 Then I created another audience where I just basically duplicated this ad set and set the placements to Facebook feed right here Um, and then I got 31 leads a see I'm looking at that correctly 31 leads about 345 a pop on average a see something doesn't look right But this is just kind of ways I looked up. Yeah, look right here So 31 leads and as you can see I just did Facebook feed desktop and mobile and it fed all my adspend to the mobile And I was getting 31 I got 31 leads at 334 pop I spent about a hundred three dollars on that So then from there I came there and also I created a look-alike audience And when I created that look-alike audience targeting just Facebook newsfeed and I actually did mobile and desktop again I created I targeted I targeted look-alike audience Newsfeed mobile and then I came there got 41 leads on average of dollar ninety four pop now That's just because I created the look-alike audience after I got my first hundred leads and Then I came there I did a just a few testing of the other things Of the placements and stuff just to ensure I was spending my money correctly And then I went all the way up to creating a look-alike audience I did a big cap of two dollars a once because I saw I had some leads about dollar seventy five a pop But I wasn't really working at two dollars So I came there and I went all the way up to three dollars this manual bid right here This is where you do like what I did. There's two types of manual bits.

There's average and then bid cap So I did the bid cap and then that's when I was able to scale to this campaign right here Where I got 56 leads with cost per result on average 227 with a bid cap of three dollars So I probably confused a lot of you guys But basically in a sense you want to come there so Once you start seeing some averages of results you want to basically just duplicate a campaign So let's go all the way back right here to where I was just running this business owner look like audience 27 58 27 258 years old you simply want to duplicate the campaign that you're running right now Well ad set not campaign is this all ad sets I'm sorry if my camera lags or the audio Definitely need to get a new computer for videos like this So you can leave the daily budget around the same and Then you can scroll down It was just the Facebook newsfeed So make sure you change all your audiences correctly And then you want to go right here where it says conversion or like for optimization Of what you're optimizing for set a bid cap And you want to make sure it's lowest cost not target cost because the target cost is one I was running right here for This manual bid and it was just averaging around a certain one But you can set a bid cap right here to whatever you want So if you've been getting leads at to you know, like 275 225 like I've been getting You could try three dollars And if that's not working you might have to duplicate the ad set again and Set up a bid cap for higher. So If you're not getting results for the target cost you're going for for the the big cap you're going for you might have to duplicate that big cap again and You're gonna have to raise that cost per a little bit a little bit more Specifically so that way you're coming there Because sometimes this three dollars might not work. I mean obviously for me it's been working because it's allowing enough money For this specific campaign to get those results So when you set up your first bid cap you want to do kind of the average that you've been getting Maybe just a little bit above it.

So say for instance if you're meeting thirty five dollar, you know, every thirty five dollars If you have a Shopify store selling e-commerce products, you're selling one specific product and on average you get thirty five For every thirty five dollars on Facebook you spend you get a sale You might want to put that up to about forty dollars maybe thirty six dollars But you want to have a little bit of play of just slightly higher So round up maybe a little bit so let's say forty dollars and then you can set up, you know, you can raise that daily budget You know, maybe three four hundred dollars. I know that's a lot more than you normally spend but Facebook won't get you a purchase over forty dollars So that way you can lock that down. But the key thing is you need to make sure you already have Some sales, you know, maybe a hundred dollar maybe a hundred actions for whatever you're trying to go for and then you can raise that Daily budget substantially higher.

I don't spend a hundred dollars every day because Facebook can't find me leads from the three dollars every day You know this campaign I've only been running this one right here for I Think I ran it for two days that I paused it because I kind of hit the budget I was going for And then Facebook to charge my card and now I'm spending my next budget for this month With a look like audience at a bid cap three dollars and I'm kind of scaling this campaign Specifically right here and I know my numbers basically every hundred leads I get in about 33% of those leads will come there and hop on a campaign audit with me and then 10% of those people will buy a you know coaching session or finding you know come in with You know, that's about three people three people will purchase a 297 Coaching session with me or they'll come there and sign on as a client For my digital agency so I know that as long as I get you know one cell for you know $300 I might spend I'm making my money back in ads been right there and I'm covering the initial costs and I can still remarket to all those people all those leads with you know Remarketing and retargeting so guys I know this video is kind of like a lot like kind of going back and forth But I hope this able to bring some type of value to you I kind of allowing you to kind of maybe get just even if it doesn't really bring much value to you if You know, you can just kind of look at it and see Different point of view from someone who runs these campaigns for other businesses and stuff Of you know different ways to run your Facebook ads and not just being so single focus I know so many people that set up a campaign set up one audience and then set up one offer and then set up one ad Creative spend a whole bunch of money get no results and it's a Facebook guys don't work for them This is all the testing I went into this specific campaign and You know, it's definitely a lot of testing a lot of different audiences a lot of different messing around duplicating assets and stuff I spent more time on all this than actually writing the ad copy and I used a stock image So it's not all about just getting the perfect copy image, but it's all part of one huge picture so guys. Thank you for watching. Have a good day
