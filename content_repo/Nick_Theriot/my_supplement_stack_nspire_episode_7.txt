And they're like How much for this vase? And they're like Oh Then they're not for sale And I was like I mean I'll pay for it Whatever y'all want Cause they didn't have any other vases out there And they're like Okay $4 And they're like Oh it's a little dirty $2 Alright cool So We got it We got the setup So now I'm gonna go ahead and fix this up for her and stuff Make it look pretty nice Back on the big camera And Look what we have created Let's see We hope she likes it Look at that Wow So We'll clean up that vase And then Put everything in there Kinda trimmed up the flowers And honestly guys I think it's perfect I really love the mixture of like flowers in here Got the roses She got the white It really all just comes together I love it So I'm gonna make her like Just come in the room And like surprise her Just before we go on our date We'll see how that goes So I need to take my greens So I thought about Showing you guys Some of the stuff I'm taking Right now First thing Is cytogreens Honestly These taste amazing But you have to make sure you get the green tea Or the berry green tea flavor You can pick this up on Amazon For about $45 For 60 servings Or $30 For 30 servings I've never taken greens before So I don't really know what to compare it to Like other flavors But I noticed that they are going to be I'm going to go ahead and try to get a lot of Some of the supplements I'm going to go ahead and try To get a lot of the supplements I'm going to go ahead and try For 30 servings I've never taken greens before So I don't really know what to compare it to Like other flavors But I noticed they taste bad 99% of people say greens taste bad And I think these taste great So that's just my opinion I've also always liked greens in general So never had a problem with that But Let's go ahead Pour that And I just do one full scoop inside of here And then like that I'll just throw it in my shaker cup Shake it up And I'm good to go Honestly, there's no right time to take greens I prefer to take them in the morning But because it's this morning I started off with some pre-workout I just went to a workout And then you can take them in time But yeah So cider greens That's supplement number one In the morning So when I take them They taste great they taste great and uh get on amazon prime 45 servings 60 or 60 servings 45 bucks acai berry green tea get that flavor it tastes great second supplement on my list is raw she legit i honestly do not know how to say that at all uh but basically what this does is for males it increases natural testosterone it's very naturally it's not like you need to pick a pct or something like that with it it also increases memory it helps with like memory and focus while working and second thing as well increases natural energy and lastly it helps with removing and flushing out fluids out your body so almost like a diuretic next what i'm taking is currently just right now because of coronavirus and stuff and honestly guys i'm not gonna lie i panic bought this i was like coronavirus was high so i was like you know what what can i do to maximize immune system and the first thing i think of is vitamin c so i did just like every other person and went by vitamin c uh but yeah vitamin c supposedly helps out your immune system and stuff and yeah i mean i don't really know what else to tell you about that it's typical vitamin c next supplement on the list is actually just like it reminds me a lot like creatine because when creatine first came out onto the market years ago way before maybe my time it was like this supplement that came out and it was basically like a modern day pro hormone pro hormone in terms of it was really expensive hard to get and had like really not much testing on it so a lot of people like oh my god creatine it is the devil if you're taking that or it's like basically equivalent taking steroids and then now it had a lot of research done on it um it's just a supplement you take consistently over a long period of time to get you know to really see the results um it's really cheap easy to get to now and that's what true niagen reminds me of so it helps with anti-aging and that's it it also helps with energy so it was really expensive like i do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you want to test it out i haven't really seen a big thing from it but from everything i'm reading you have to take this for a while before you see the results next on the list is vitamin d3 now this is a simple supplement anyone can get from the store honestly i don't even know how much i paid for this but i know it's like maybe five to ten dollars at your local food store walmart cariesis walgreens super one if you're local uh basically all it does support your bone health uh bone teeth muscle and overall immune health so now for my last morning supplement is vitamin b12 and this helps with energy it's a boost of energy i think a lot of people like to get a b12 shot like their smoothies and stuff also helps with it aids in the conversion of food into energy so it helps maximize your body's efficiency of converting food to energy which works really good also too when you're cutting uh balken really anytime if you're working out and stuff moving into the very first nighttime stack uh supplement in my nighttime stack is krill oil so krill oil um basically all it is is a more expensive version of fish oil it's a little bit more higher of a potency it offers the same benefits as fish oil which is just basically brain health heart health and as well as your joints um it helps all that all right next one on the stack is uh mct oil which is basically coconut oil and again this is pretty much just another supplement it's just like your fish oils uh it's just providing essential fats for your body uh it's brain fuel a lot of people who are on the keto diet take a lot of these to help get extra fats in throughout the day but uh yeah i mean i don't really know what's the same it's your essential fats now the last supplement i take before i go to bed is magnesium this is something you could simply find at any local store um honestly i don't know how much it was but it wasn't expensive at all magnesium has a lot of benefits for your bone health your cardiovascular health recovery from training some people even saw like a slight boost in training performance one pill of this again this is with my nighttime stack two hours before i go to bed all right just to show you guys the fit real quick work block essentials got a 3d got a glass of water and this whole work block is a consist of editing yesterday's vlog uploading yesterday's vlog and writing down some ad copy updating the books then later tonight i'm going to work on my linkedin work of scouting prospecting and reaching out to people so currently something i'm working on for the digital agency right now is finishing up the weekly email so what i do is i on a day-to-day basis i already follow up with prospects at different levels of the funnel uh that's kind of like my agency funnel to acquire clients and then also too i do a once a week email blast every single person just stay inside their email box and i always focus on providing some amazing amazing value because i do not want to piss off any of these people so like last week it was like three or four key campaigns we set up inside of our funnel for clothing brand clients that helps them get massive returns and then this week it's actually our content creation guide that we use with every client to make sure they have the right type of client before we start with them or make sure they have the right type of content before we start with them so we can generate them the best results possible we can and it's really cool because i just sent that document over to all my prospects and we can go ahead and actually it does two things because a they get an amazing piece of value information two if they actually take action on it and get some really good returns with it then we can come in there and to be like the boost that kind of helps them hit that next um like level inside their business so the world wants to know what do you think of the flowers i love them she finally got them and then also too i'm gonna pick up some sushi now put in the order so we'll see you guys at sushi you're so cute i know you're just cute there you go give
