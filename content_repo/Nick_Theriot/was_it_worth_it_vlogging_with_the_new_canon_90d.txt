of a pressure cooker and i literally just leave it for a few days don't eat it all it mildews it molds and i'll waste a lot of rice so i pay about a dollar a cup i know that's expensive but a dollar a cup always get fresh rice and i never have to worry about wasting rice and it's easy i just grab it go i do one of these a day simply cook my rice you don't have to add water or anything to it simply throw it in the microwave for a minute heat up my chicken this is five ounces of grilled chicken some asparagus and my rice throw a little soy sauce on it and it's perfect in terms of how well it
