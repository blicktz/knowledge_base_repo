yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I want to bring you guys a new video where I kind of discuss a few things that may be keeping your ads from not converting so digging through the data and actually going through the sales process a customer journey for your customer can reveal a lot of different problems and I'm hopefully to shed some light on those for you guys so that way you can increase your conversions on your website or maybe your ads are completely not converting now and maybe it'll help you get some conversions with your website so let's dive into it I'm gonna show you guys three kind of mid topics for you to dig into and analyze with your ads and stuff and your process and hopefully this helps you out so the first thing I like to do is dive into the performance and clicks columns and then I like to also set the date range the last seven days of data so I'm looking at multiple days of data and then what I like to do is go into the performance and clicks and look at the link click-through rate percentage this is the percentage of people that are clicking on the link in the ad out of you know x amount of people 100 people and what we like to do is we like to see a one percent or higher on a cold audience and a two to four percent on a warm audience bottom of funnel past buyers abandoned carts all you're retargeting we like to see a two to four percent so a little bit of a higher click-through rate percentage because we're running or I'm targeting a lot warmer traffic but a cold audience we want to see one percent or higher you can do two different things to improve your link click-through rate percentage one of them is going ahead and targeting and testing different audiences because maybe your audience is just not the right one that you're going after or maybe it's not the best way to target them with those specific set of interests so what you could do is you could go ahead and split that or you can test different photos different ad copy on that initial test you're running on that specific audience and if that does not improve then yes you definitely need to change your audience so you have two different variables right there you have your audience and your ad ad copy itself so those two different things right there to test and play around with to improve your link click-through rate percentage so now the next one is you're getting a lot of landing page views but you're getting no add to carts or no purchases to improve your ads or carts is when people are clicking on the ad itself make sure people are aware of what they're clicking on so if your ad is misleading people are clicking on your ad and then coming to your website and like seeing a completely different product then that's obviously going to increase your cost per ad to cart so you want to make sure people are very clear on what they're clicking on and coming to your website on to view we've had this issue before with one brand we're working with where our first image we were running was getting just horrible return and then what we did was we literally changed up the image a lot we've put people in the ad itself showing off the product holding it and stuff and we literally increased our site conversion rate from 0.5 yes 0.5 percent to 3 to 3.5 percent by increasing the ad creative itself so that way people more aware and better pre-framed when clicking on our ad and landing on our website to view the product itself something else you can do is make sure your add to cart button is a different color or maybe another color part of your website that's you know bright so like say for example if you have like some hints of blue in your website make your add to cart button blue you know if you have typically a lot of brands now have three colors they're like white black white gray black gray and then i'll always have like the third color red blue light blue baby blue dark red orange make your add to cart button a sub color that's easy for people to recognize and also to make sure your add to cart button is clearly visible on mobile devices and actually go ahead and go on your mobile phone and add to cart to ensure your add to cart process is working properly now the last one let's say you're getting a lot of add to carts but no purchases again what you want to do is you want to make sure your customer journey is perfect you have amazing ad copy amazing ad creative people are coming in with the right intent to your website people or have all the information on the website they need to make the purchases your website page looks good it's directly speaking to the consumer they're moving forward they're adding to cart but they're coming to the checkout and nothing so you want to make sure first off you're getting some checkout initiated so you can make sure you can check that in the ads manager itself if you're getting no checkout initiated then obviously you might have some type of issue with people actually getting to the checkout process so maybe your add to cart your little shopping cart is hard to find on the website so one thing you can do is you can there's a thing in shopify it's where like once you click add to cart it takes them to the checkout so you can do that right there and that'll definitely improve your conversion rate so people are like literally taking straight to the checkout and like hey check out now with your items in your cart so you can do that right there if you're still not getting any checkouts initiated then obviously you may have some other type of problems with your website but let's say that improves it right there your check your cart's easy to find you view it go through the checkout process yourself is it easy for people is there any pop-ups popping up before people check out that makes it look scammy on the checkout page itself is your check like your logo and stuff and maybe like a badge or something on your checkout page itself is on there i know like in shopify there's an option on the checkout page to add in your logo or use your just default text shopify name so you can add your nice professional logos on the checkout page you have your logo again showing up on the website your checkout has the same color scheme as your website you going into it further actually enter your information into your credit card number purchase the product you're selling ensuring people have no problems itself nine times on 10 if you're using shopify you shouldn't have any issues though one thing to add to this right here where you're getting a lot of ads of carts with no purchases is have you spent enough money testing on your ads itself let's say you spend 20 bucks you get a few ads of carts but no purchases that's not much testing for a brand new product but let's say you spent thousands of dollars you got tons of ads of carts and your purchase conversion it's still very low maybe your product itself has a longer buying cycle than your typical other products so what i mean by that is you just simply need to beef up your retargeting add in more testimonials add in more product demonstration videos add in more uh you know call to actions and stuff and uh basically bringing people greater awareness of why they need your product more pain point selling and stuff so you may just need to beef up the whole funnel to get those purchases but generally i never really have too much of an issue of getting a lot to add to carts no purchases uh for us and we usually see for clients is they're getting poor ads of carts uh and they're getting poor cost per landing page views so once you fix up that front of the funnel we generally see a really good return on the back end of the funnel and we'll rarely see people having some main like some major issues with getting checkouts and you know started but not complete it so i hope this helps i know it's kind of vague but it's a few different things that just about anyone can apply to their current facebook ads and help identify or help identify different bottlenecks in their funnel different bottlenecks in their website different bottlenecks in their facebook ads that will ultimately improve the aid of increasing conversions you increase your conversions your conversion percentage on your website you're nine
