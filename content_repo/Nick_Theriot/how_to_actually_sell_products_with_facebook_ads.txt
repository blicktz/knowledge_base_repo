marketing and sales those are the two activities that you can do and it can be applied to any niche it's like you don't learn marketing you learn consumer psychology that's where you really can start taking content to the next level and that's like a big part of what we do right there what are feelings and emotions people want to feel and showcasing that in the video or photo me and you both know like we both want to do less work and make more it's everyone's dream job right there and that's how you can go after that wealthy demographic it's like one of my favorite ways to go um when it comes down to like charging more it's where positioning comes in play sure how do you position your brand how do you how do you want people to perceive your brand you can position yourself to appeal to a certain demographic and then it's like what type of content do we need to create that's going to resonate with them around our product or service it's obviously a high leverage activity i think for local businesses i think the the biggest things that they're untapped in is creating content that people actually want to watch it all comes down to is like what do people want to feel that's interesting that's really good stuff everybody should think about those things what's up guys bo here with the one big head game podcast another episode today uh pretty excited uh i'm talking to somebody here across from me that i don't know i don't know much about him i know a little bit about him i've i've done a little digging on social media seems to be a very successful guy uh surrounding the social media uh not only influence space but marketing space um and he seems to be quite an expert on it i would say um so it's very valuable stuff if you're interested in in starting a youtube channel or um or just getting more visibility for your business on social media or just not sure how to get all this content out there just like i was before i started this podcast this would be a good guy to talk to it seems like and i'm pretty pumped because this is the stuff that i do and i don't really know what i'm doing most of the time i'm just kind of taking it one step at a time and uh and i'm i'm really looking forward to hearing what kind of gems what kind of uh good information he has for a guy like me in my space with a podcast and businesses i'm trying to promote online and for everybody else out there and i'm sure he's got a cool story along the way you know at the end of the day he's an entrepreneur too but he's got a lot of success recently on a lot of the online things that he uh has been pushing for years i would assume um so we're gonna get right into it this is nick terrio um nick intro yourself bro what's going on how you doing i think i'm more shocked that you said my last name correctly well hey i'm a louisiana boy man i'm not gonna mess i'm not gonna mess uh terrio it's always like yeah a theriot or theriot and you've been you've been hanging out with some northern people or those arizona people too much man hey you're back in louisiana all right absolutely a lot of people like to say the riot uh the riot my dad was in the uh state police academy and stuff like that and they would always call them the riot so ever since then it's kind of carried over from my dad to my me and my brother as well that's interesting the riot yeah that's interesting kind of like uh everybody beau at starbucks like b-e-a-u-x i'm like nah i'm not uh no x man i'm from louisiana but not that not that i'm not from lafayette not that louisiana that cajun yeah just on that borderline right there yeah yeah so uh so yeah tell us a little bit about what do you do for business right now you know what's your main uh source of income and what are you trying to do for business absolutely start with that and then we'll get into some other stuff yeah so i run facebook advertising so um you know when you after a long day of work you sit down and have a beer and you scroll through facebook and see those little sponsored posts sometimes can be a little aggravating but that's what i do yeah um and i've done a little over a hundred million dollars in revenue for uh my clients at my advertising agency uh purely by running those ads right there and i mean we've we've came into businesses and taken them from like a thousand dollars a day to 10 to 15 to 20 000 a day in revenue um so that's that's our specialty right there is growing brands online and yeah um more in the consumer psychology is where we kind of pride ourselves of you know kind of like we were talking about earlier in a second you know what do i have to say to get a reaction out of people um to where it's going to amplify our content to get us more customers more clicks more leads into our business yeah interesting and most most of your avenue is through facebook or is it other the other social media platform yeah so facebook itself that's what that's the mechanism the tool we use to generate our clients money um and then on top of that obviously i have to do my own marketing as well to get clients and you know we don't really i don't really do much like cold outreach and reaching out to people for you know to sell our agency yeah services what we typically do is have a youtube channel um i've been uploading now since 2020 yeah um this is like my third or fourth youtube channel i've actually had in my life really um yeah my first more about that my first youtube channel is actually at 12 years old um and that's when i started my first online business at 12 years old so wow interesting but yeah last four years i've been teaching people digital advertising principles consumer psychology how to run facebook ads and stuff on youtube and growing that from zero to now we're about to hit 30k we're at 27 000 subscribers and get roughly about 100 000 views i'm off on that so yeah and that's what i used to kind of promote my own business to get clients from agency sure yeah yeah i would assume and also you're not the type of business that needs 100 million customers right like you just need a few customers uh to to do good for you know you do good work for them and uh and ultimately word of mouth spreads very strongly in that space because there's a ton of people in that space trying to play around in many different ways right like marketing lead services you know uh cold email stuff from overseas i mean there's there's the idea of marketing as a as a niche or something there's so many different areas you can attack it right absolutely and yeah you actually bring up a really great point right there about like yeah we don't want a lot of customers i need them we we keep ourselves um i only keep it to where we only work with 10 clients at a time excellent i don't want to work with more than 10 clients at a time and you know my smallest client ever was 500 a month and then i guess the single client that paid me the most in a single month was 55 000 in a single month from one client wow um and i look at it kind of like from like a watch principle you know i see a nice watch as well i'm big into watches and everything like that so it's like you know if you look at the watches that you can get at like walmart target people sell for 25 30 bucks 50 bucks not even worth it not worth it but then you go look at like how many richard millies are made per year yeah like one and a half yeah yeah and a big part of that is because there's so few of them it drives the price up so i kind of apply the same principles right there for my agency i want to work with few clients which charge a lot so i can go really deep with you provide a high level of service to you yeah um and same thing for my students um you know i have 100 paid students a month that i mentor on a monthly basis and um about a year ago i was charging 50% less than i charge now simply just to increase the value for everyone yeah yeah outstanding man that's a such a fascinating space to me because you know i own a construction business um and uh and it's a new business you know i've done i've done a lot of different business in the past but getting eyeballs we were talking about it before we started this uh started this podcast you know he was asking me what my goal was with the podcast and i was like you know i it's it's harder to turn really it was it was personal you know it was many different things but really it was about keep keep continuing to grow and understand not only human psychology like you were talking about but how to elicit a response from people and uh so i can do it for myself long term you know every time that i do this every conversation i have with a guy like you i learn about it and that can't be taken away from me you know so um it's it's so it's fascinating yeah so so what does uh go ahead that's that's like my favorite thing about like advertising is consumer psychology because it's like you don't learn marketing you learn consumer psychology and then once you learn what grabs people's attentions what certain emotions to pull and certain emotions not to pull that's where you really can start taking content to the next level yeah fascinating man um are most of your clients that you work with on a very intimate basis i'll say are they online businesses they're selling products online yeah so all of our clients i'd say like 90% of our clients are online um selling like physical products e-commerce and stuff like that yeah yeah uh work with a lot of supplement brands and clothing brands um typically we kind of come in when they're doing about a hundred thousand dollars a month and we'll help them scale it's about three to five million dollars a month that's usually like our kind of like perfect client fit and what is the difference between a hundred thousand dollars and three million dollars a month so this is where it starts to get to like what's the difference in what that company is doing besides hiring you that's a really great question right there um big thing comes down to their content so usually when you start running facebook ads and stuff and start advertising a lot of business owners the first thing they do is start talking about their product hey i have this amazing product you know buy it it does all these cool things right the problem with that is that you really only kind of peel into the people that are actively looking for that product sure when you start to scale and you need to reach more people now you start shifting away from people that already actively know about that type of product and start looking at people's kind of like psychographics of hey like i really want to make more money yeah you know how do i make more money yeah i don't know what the product is i don't know what the mechanism or the tool that's going to make me more money yeah so i have to start off with hey look bo i know you want to make more money right now um and i know there's like a probably you saw right i saw a lot of courses online i think they're all scams and stuff like that um but i want to show you this really cool method that helps people you know three to four x their personal income by using some unique tool stuff like that yeah so like i start connecting with you based off what you want and showing you things based off what you want then i introduce my product yeah and that expands the amount of people that i can actively target because there's way more people that want to make more money versus the amount of people that know about forex trading courses for example yeah yeah so that's the biggest i would say lever we we pull and then we polish all that up so if you want to make more money what are all the different ways we can reinforce that desire that our product was going to make you the most money then we introduce the product yeah once we already got your attention based off what you want okay so but still the difference in the company the company is obviously creating this content or somebody is creating it for them you know i don't know if how how integral your process is in the creation of that content or whether you're deploying it in the right way you know i'm sure there's a mixture there um but what is the difference in the actual like are they just spending a lot more money to get that yeah yeah so there's a couple different factors um obviously you have to look at your fulfillment and customer service because when you start scaling from 100 000 a month to three to five million dollars a month you know you're gonna have problems 30xing your your 30x and you're like you're everything yeah the amount of products you're shipping on a daily basis customer service and stuff like that yeah um but from an advertising perspective obviously you're going after a larger audience more mass appeal audience and connecting with people and then spending more i mean that's that's yeah very obvious one yeah we're spending anywhere from you know 100k a month in revenue probably spending about 30k a month to achieve that yeah uh three to five million i mean you're spending you know 10 20 30k a day um and ad spend wow to that so you are spending significantly more um and then then there'll be also some other factors in terms of like client retention and stuff like that how does somebody get to the point are they the people that pay that okay you talk to a lot of people who are doing that 100k a month they probably have had marketers and ad guys help them to achieve that even right so they have experience in it when does someone jump in and say okay i'm about to just unload my capital on this one thing or this one methodology facebook is one uh one platform um how do people make i haven't made that decision you know i haven't put all my money on the line and and gone all in on on ads because i don't understand it enough you know it's very it's very complicated to me even and i understand eyeballs all this kind of stuff but and also have a different type of business it's a little bit less consistent as uh i sell this product i ship it and uh i make the net you know but like i'm just interested in the psychology not of like you uh uh getting the minds of people interested in your product but the psychology it takes to actually double down and pay that money uh in ad spend you know that's you ever do you ever discuss that with like that's a big deal yeah you're over you're you're overcoming that hurdle on every consultation that you you're you're on yeah that's a really great question right there so to a certain degree we actually never really come into this objection um it's a it's more so people that are just getting into facebook that's where we have to really kind of dig into this yeah um like me yeah and that's kind of i mean i've had facebook forever but like i haven't unloaded that kind of money you have to go into the ad side yeah the ads game so and this is where it kind of starts back in like my early journey like my first business ever was the detailing but well second third business ever is a detailing business service and i needed a way to grow that business fast and one of the ways was facebook and the reason why is because out of all the different like mechanisms of advertising tv commercials new paper newspapers and stuff like that the cool thing about facebook is you could start off literally as little as five dollars a day and there is no commitment to that like i could literally go open up a brand new facebook ad account today toss a five dollar bill at it and then turn it off tomorrow and that's it yeah so you're only really spending more as you see results yeah so these people that are spending 30k a month they didn't just go open up a facebook account toss 30 000 out of it yeah they started off at five dollars a day yeah then 10 then 30 and they kept growing it as they saw results that's that's also the beauty about facebook ads is yeah you only increase the spend if you're seeing results yeah yeah yeah that's uh that's that's that's the that's what i wanted to know because like that means that those people have incrementally increased that ad spend and that risk as they've grown and as they've grown their business um yeah which makes sense to me you know and i do that i mean i boost posts you know give a little boost every once in a while you know what i mean just just for fun yeah we're gonna get you off of that oh this one got a little bit more views you know yeah like it didn't make that much of a difference but but yeah i uh and i've played around with it a little bit myself you know in the past my wife has a very uh in my opinion a very sweet spot business where she can really capitalize because we've done some very mediocre uh type of uh advertising on facebook and it's been positive and so if i can do it you definitely know if you did it it would be very good you know um and it's a cleaner service a little different than what i offer um but that's very interesting so you started your your first business at 12 years old you said was it 12 yeah so i mean it was a youtube channel yeah it was a youtube channel 12 years old i was videoing myself playing call of duty all right and um that's interesting yeah i just discovered youtube back in like 2010 and then uh that was when i was 12 years old yeah were you shy about that when you were like obviously like why'd you do that uh because i saw people playing call of duty all day and making money from youtube adsense okay so you saw money and you did it for money yes i saw money and call of duty i was like why go to why not try yeah why to go like you know if i can just instead of getting a job just play call of duty all day and make money from youtube adsense like that's dream world because again at time 12 years old sixth grade like the only thing on my mind is video games yeah yeah yeah so discovered youtube discovered the adsense um i borrowed my parents camera and i literally just set the camera up on a tripod similar to this just at the screen and then i would just talk behind the camera so no one could even see me yeah they would hear my commentary yeah and yeah that's it and i started my first youtube channel um and the reason why i say it's kind of a business is because moving forward a little bit into that i started editing other people's videos so i had my own like little youtube like youtube video editing agency for a period of time yeah um and yeah so i was making like you know 50 per video that would take me a week to edit but again i'm seventh eighth grade making 50 bucks a video like yeah that's a that's a pretty good yeah for sure for sure absolutely at that age for sure too yeah that's so interesting you did that instinctively at that young of an age like i mean i was 12 years old a long time before you i would assume how old are you uh 27 27 yeah i'm 35 um but um but yeah i would have never thought about that like i just started you know kind of getting into the cameras and stuff like that but what's interesting too is like uh you did that then you know i was talking to you before the podcast of like kind of my fears with putting myself out there on screen on the internet stuff like that i mean that's something that was very real to me um even though i didn't talk about you know everybody has that until they till they do it right did you ever get to the point where like you did that but then it like came back and you're like wait a second now wait i'm an adult and you know perceptions matter and maybe i don't want to put my face on everything like what was that like for you i mean it's like there is pros and cons to growing a personal brand like one of the pros to it is obviously like the connections and stuff you meet people you also have a lot more business in inbound business and stuff like that that comes in from you because people enjoy your stuff yeah um i would say like literally the only con to it is now it's you have to watch your own image you know like if let's just say hypothetically i'm not this person but if i want to go get like drunk and at a bar and like sure you know be a bad person other people for example yeah like you would go viral online real quick and like you get canceled and stuff like that where like i know people that they could easily go do that and no one knows what they own or anything like that so there is a certain level of like people understand your you know your life a little bit more than other people so that's like the only con again i'm not that type of person is like i don't really care about it yeah um but as far as like yeah you you do like getting started beginning you will have that fears of putting yourself out there yep and you know i don't really know like the exact point of like oh like just tell you these magical affirmations to to like get over it i think for me was that i saw putting myself out there equal money yeah and at the time when i was money driven and wanted to grow my business i kept putting it off and that desire for money kept growing and growing and growing to the point where my desire for making more money overcame the fears i had of you know needing to put myself out there yeah to the point where i just didn't care i was just like whatever like you know i broke i don't have any money i need to get this business off the ground i'm gonna start creating content who cares what people think i am yeah yeah yeah i always like to ask people that especially people who are actually doing it you know a lot of a lot of my guests that i have on uh they're very successful people but um but some of them aren't doing that you you're doing it obviously i'm trying to do it as much as i can you know um and i definitely had to get over that too it is it is just uh just something that you have to there's many different reasons why people do it you know mine was similar to that it wasn't quite i don't think it was quite as much the money but it was like i want i want to live a life like this like xyz you know what i mean and uh and um that requires me to uh put myself out there be visible to people and be transparent with people and be vulnerable with people and you know for the longest time i hid that from people you know just like people do you know they you hide it from people and uh and i guess that's what stopped me and uh and eventually i was like you know something's got to give you know if i'm going to push brands if i'm going to do this stuff like there's no better way anyway to do it practically speaking there's nothing more high leverage than exactly what we're doing right now is videoing ourselves and you may not you may be the only one watching this but you know five weeks from now somebody's going to click on it too and i'm going to be doing something else and they're going to be watching us and getting value from it so it's obviously a high leverage activity yeah i had a youtube video like one of the like the first times like you speak about like high leverage and stuff like that like yeah yeah um you do too so yeah you've said leverage a lot in this it's so important as a business owner um but i had a youtube video that this is i'm on like third youtube channel now yeah and um i had a youtube video uploaded around like i was just playing around with you know here's how you can run your facebook ads and stuff like that here's how to scale your facebook ads and uh first ever video i made around facebook ads and i think it got like 100 200 views from it and then i got an email about probably like six months later after that it was uploaded wow and someone messaged me and said hey i need help i'm spending like 30 000 a month on facebook ads um i'm struggling with performance can we hop on a call tomorrow and you know help out yeah and i thought it was a scam at first because at that time like i was you didn't get a lot of those calls either correct probably if it was only 200 views the most i was ever spending at that time was 50 to 100 bucks a day so 30 000 was a large sum so i thought i was a scam at first yeah and got on the call that next day with them um and i closed them by the end of the day for a 5k a month for tanner and i was my first ever 5k a month client because at the time i was charging like 500 to 1500 a month yeah and that's when it made me realize the power of of social media and again i already knew it but it just reinforced the fact you finally felt that yeah i i in my journey thus far i felt it a few times like i'll have customers who you know my sales guy makes contact with them you know door knocking is a big thing and roofing i do a lot of roofing um and uh but they'll look me up they'll look up the business they'll see me on the business page and then they'll naturally go to my other personal brand pages then my personal page and they'll see it on instagram and they'll find out that i have a podcast then they'll watch some of that they're like you got you have a podcast and i'm like yeah yeah yeah but they get a kick out of it and they like it and uh and that's that's my thing i haven't like uh uh cracked the code on an ad or anything yet but i've i've seen that too and it's uh it's just it's fascinating how that works you can also look at it from this perspective right here it's like you can grow this podcast and you know um i know you've had a lot of people kind of local to lafayette right now that's come on it so you can grow it as like a lafayette podcast for example sure and you don't have to worry about trying to sell a product from it you don't have to worry about selling stuff a coaching or any type of products from it but what you can do is you can control the sponsors yeah and the sponsors of the podcast can be your businesses no one has to know that yeah so your sponsor could be your roofing company for example yeah yeah for you and we'll take a quick break for our uh sponsor uh color wheel llc it's a roofing and restoration company in lafayette louisiana uh and uh and back to our natural programming there you go there you go there you go so that way it's my first one that way you can grow your your brand and grow your organic reach and stuff yeah and that way no one has to feel sold on this podcast yeah yeah and that's cool too yeah and then when you promote too many products people also can kind of get kind of if yeah there's like a there's like a fatigue there in there i don't know maybe that's a term i don't know i just made it up but i get fatigue from it like i was i was listening to one that was an outstanding podcast that somebody shared with me today and it was just 15 minutes extremely clever extremely interesting i mean it it had everything it was good and it was just audio i didn't watch a video and uh but it was a lot of ads i was surprised that i kept watching it it was that good you know but it was a lot of ads and uh there is some fatigue going on there yeah so if you were telling me what i should do with my podcast let's just turn this into a quick consultation you know what would you do i want to my goal with the podcast is to share interesting stories captivating stories inspiring stories with the goal of helping people change their circumstance by using the power of their mind okay so it's called one big head game we've been talking about one big marketing thus far on this one but most of the time it's impactful stories about other people's journey to help people understand by the anecdotal evidence of another person's story how they can you know change their mind and ultimately you know change their life you know that's that's the goal and it's it's mindset it's mindset is what it is you know um so it's kind of a general niche you know uh but it's not lafayette based but my studio is in lafayette obviously so it's hard to get people to fly in for it with with the viewership i have right now so what do you think you know i love i love mindset i mean i'm a junkie for that right there for sure me too and also too i mean people love stories yeah like that's just a psychological thing yeah people love stories they love to see you know big wins they they love to see you know like people overcoming things yeah and i love that i think that's probably like also like one of my favorite things like podcasts as well as being able to to understand the internal dialogue people go through when they're going through something tough because that's how like i can apply that to different areas and different facets of like my life as well exactly so yeah i like that a lot that's what i like like uh we had uh we've had some really good ones man that the people who are either either working at a high level uh or they've overcome you know insurmountable obstacles um and uh and hearing those stories is just very powerful and i get a front row seat that's one that's one thing that i like about the podcast you know is that i get to hear those and i get to seek those stories out you know do you have you ever seen rudy rudy rudy rudy rudiger from notre dame no never seen that no a little bit too young maybe it's an older movie anyway it's a it's a story about a guy uh rudy rudiger who uh who's a small guy little guy you know but had dreams of playing football at notre dame you know but he's like no athletic ability you know just some little runt guy basically but it's a story about him and how he uh finally walked on to to notre dame and there's a lot of things that happened before that and he actually got on the team on the practice squad and worked his way up worked his way up and finally uh got in got into a game and played um and it's one of the most impactful stories i've heard but i have a uh you probably didn't see it but i have a uh i have a thing signed by him up there on my wall on the other in the other room that's amazing but uh but yeah that and i i dm'd rudy uh to be on the show but he hasn't responded if you see that if you see that message rudy you know my dog is named rudy okay you need to come on this podcast dude but uh but yeah that's the kind of stories that get me man that's what i grew up on and i walked on to uh mcneese uh you know in lake charles i walked on i mean i had a little bit of athletic ability you know i would say but uh but i did the same thing man i'm all about that and i just want to share those kind of stories because i i find them inspirational but i don't know if i need to tighten the niche into just lafayette or or anything like that i i don't know i feel like i can just do whatever i want basically yeah i mean you can do whatever you want like it's not necessarily you have to do a certain yeah demographic yeah you know in the beginning when you're starting off you're usually going after the people like you know friends family yeah i'm kind of exhausted that yeah so now you're starting to get into that like all right you know who do you refer and i'm guessing that's what you did with josh cory because i know he's the one that put me and you in touch he threw it out most of the times i don't ask uh and they just they just naturally happen like that nice yeah it's really really good like a lot of people that i've known about here but i haven't really connected with um a lot of guys especially jace lopez you know he's a really good guy around here and and he introduced me to some great people and uh i don't know every guest has somebody else they think would be good in that chair you know and they share it i i rarely ask for it they just they just share it but that's amazing how it goes that's what's been cool too you know outside of business or anything like that i'm constantly connecting with people and uh and i don't know it's fun yeah that's usually what you'll do you'll start from the beginning kind of locally and everything like that and then you know you might start getting to a point where like you might be start connecting with people outside of the city and then yeah some people might want you to go fly out there and do the podcast with them um eventually till you get to the point where it's like all right your podcast is big enough to where it's like yeah i'm willing to fly in to come yeah because of the ad because of the uh exposure correct yeah i mean you got to be pretty big you know the auvan style um but but no that's okay but uh but yeah back to you man uh let's see uh so 12 years old first youtube channel what was your second one about yeah so first youtube channel was kind of a little bit of everything i think in the beginning this is where like a lot of content creators are at they just posting around a lot of stuff yeah and then the second channel was just a little bit more i would say focused on one type of content and that was just me editing call of duty videos for people and people are paying me and stuff like that so okay um and then from there my third channel is my facebook ads channel i have now um but i pretty much yeah i did like the call of duty editing and gaming and stuff like that from like sixth grade to i think the last time i posted a video around that was like my senior year of high school um you know seeing going into high school and everything like that i was pretty set on just getting a mechanical engineering degree and open up a machine shop that was my goal yeah and then over time that changed uh my senior year of high school after i graduated pretty much going from like that summer into like freshman year of college i took an online course on how to do um like financial trading and stuff forex trading and all that good stuff right there and that opened my mind to entrepreneurship working for yourself mindset um all of these avenues of which like okay because i at first i thought only youtube channels was the way to make money online because that's all i had like the limited perspective at the time yeah and then that's when i was like all right i need a you know you don't know anything about like stock trading stuff you need money to make money you can't just go make money with stock trading if you have zero dollars in your bank account yeah so um opened up a detailing business um and serving lafayette and i pretty much ran that from like 2015 to i literally walked away from the partnership back in like it was like literally right when covet shut down everyone that's when i walked away um and i was cajun suds auto detailing cajun suds yeah so what what did that business look like as far as you know the amount of people helping you with that business or was it just you what was that like yeah so it was me i had a business partner 50 50 at the time um and we started together it was literally just doing mobile detailing out of my truck um yeah i did that for pretty much for like a year mobile detailing i dropped out of college end of my second or first semester yeah second semester of college yeah i just dropped out um there was a mentor around that i always tell people he he convinced me to drop out of college but he he more just kind of painted the picture for me whether or not i should keep going for college and then i made my own decision yeah that's good um you know you're dropping out yeah you've got potential you drop out now that wouldn't be a good mentor not that i'm a big proponent of college anymore i've been through all the college yeah but uh he just painted the picture because uh of where i was going i was like okay yeah it just doesn't make sense yeah and then uh so i did the detailing business with my uh buddy getting partnership and stuff like that we did mobile detailing for about two years just me and him and then we ended up starting higher like you know we'd have friends come help us so we could do like more vehicles per day doing the mobile detailing yeah um and pretty much like the last two years of it um we ended up getting a actual shop location physical location it's a big um where um you know people could drop their car off with detail that we're doing ceramic coating as well so that's something that was a bigger lever for us to have higher ticket deals to make more with higher less work yeah absolutely much higher yeah yeah so that's interesting that was a big thing for us and this whole time as mentioned like i started the business with five dollars a day in facebook ads to actually promote it and get the name and stuff like that out there is that where you first that's your that was your main uh avenue there that's when you first kind of started the ad space correct yeah and so you were just like the person that the hypothetical person that we were talking about earlier as far as dipping your toe in it getting the rewards and eventually getting to the point where you probably were spending a good amount of money yeah yeah and i mean like tom like i think i probably had like 150 dollars in my bank account at the time yeah you know five dollars a day oh that's no big deal at all well compared to 150 that's a lot but you're putting all your money that's a lot that's a big amount technically but also too what i liked about it again like i said like i could risk five dollars today sure nothing came cool i could turn that off yeah you know like there's no commitment to that long term so i'll start off with five dollars a day and i think i ran that for a week and then i think i got like four or five details from that so it's about 35 to get about four or five hundred dollars in revenue for the business yeah um and so yeah i just kept doing that and throughout the whole time running this business i fell in love with the marketing and advertising side because again high leverage if you know if i could focus on this one skill set and with an hour two hours of work bring in ten to twenty thousand dollars worth of vehicles in the shop that week to you know ceramic coat paint correct all that good stuff like that's a way higher leverage than me go knocking doors or me go and you know like bugging people calling cold calling and all that good stuff right there yeah for sure interesting so you walked away from that around covid you said you stopped doing that and so i'm assuming before covid you started getting more clients online and everything right that's that's why you felt confident getting away from that or giving up that source of income or whatever it was correct yeah i think i was working probably you know 40 hours a week with that business making like two thousand dollars a month yeah and then that's when i closed my first um i closed i worked with two three clients before i closed my first 5k a month client um and that first 5k a month client was about two three months before covid i was like hey i'm spending you know four hours a month on this client they're paying me 5k and i'm making them four to five x more on their return and i'm making two and a half times more than the detailing businesses for significantly less work so that's again when i started to understand leverage yeah of your time and everything like that so yeah yeah um closed like one more client before covid so i went to covid with two clients pay me 10k a month and that's all profit for eight hours a month of work yeah yeah wow let me think for a second okay so from there until now what has happened you know from there it's just been doubling down on everything yeah so you know committing number one committing to this business as your main everything right assisting people get more attention and get more clients online absolutely absolutely i think the biggest thing that you know once i started stepping into this business is not getting distracted so yeah you know in the beginning i was i was starting every business in the beginning you know i think around the time i started my detailing business i was also dabbling in like five to six other things you know i was like in two different mlm offers yeah i was um you know just kind of all over the place in the sense of just trying to test everything to see what i what i what i find passionate about and what do i like wouldn't you say that all those other things that you were adding in you were trying to add money to your situation weren't you absolutely that's the main thing that you were doing maybe that maybe it was a detailing right because that's the one you mentioned in this conversation um wasn't making you enough so you were grabbing right you were you were trying to grab to find whatever and you did find it you did find this right like your your marketing avenue digital marketing um but i just find that dynamic right there very interesting because i've been through it too and uh i feel like maybe people don't talk about it quite as much you know when you're first starting out and you're first starting as a business owner or a proprietor um if you don't get the results that you want you want to move on you want to find those other things and uh and sometimes that's a mistake you know sometimes it's not because then you find the other thing that you're more passionate about you can make more money and it's a higher leverage activity like you're talking about but um but a lot of the time uh it is just a distraction and uh you could probably say that a lot of those were distractions um or you could say you know mentally that those were all just things that i had to knock out before i realized what it was you know what i wanted to do there's so many different perspectives on that but i just wanted to highlight that that's going on and that happens with probably most everybody perfectly normal most people most people i mean most people are like that some people like find that one thing and the boom and they they get enough success to to where they they won't go down those rabbit holes you know and in a way i think this is more like a skill set that everyone learns in life yeah so like the few people that i know that's yeah they found that one thing and then boom but also too you don't see like like i look at the different types of personal characteristics someone needs to become yeah to be able to achieve that yeah and for me it's like yes maybe that person first try boom but you also don't understand or seeing the personal battles he's had or she's had with other things in life yeah that set them up for that success yeah that they fit that puzzle piece fits perfectly in there but their puzzle piece was created by many other things and it could be you know it could be personal losses it could be you know um bad things that happen in their life it could be good things that happen in their life it's many things for the the personality that changes that person so it's not just like you know like me i've jumped around into into in a lot of businesses you know and uh not a lot a good amount you know like like any entrepreneur who's trying to figure it out would you know but um and i've learned my my strengths and weaknesses certainly uh but it wasn't as much uh some people go through those extreme circumstances that molds them into the person that fits that puzzle um in that in that one business and it appears like oh they just tried out their first business and look how successful they are but you know everybody's got their own stuff yeah that's why i like you know i see two types of people i've seen like the most successful kind of like that first swing success yeah is always military people and people that are very physically fit yeah those are the two people that i've always see with like the highest probability of success right from the beginning yeah because what does military and physically fit people have in common discipline discipline yeah courageousness yeah um sacrifice willing to sacrifice things sacrifice understanding that growth and everything is a process and also understanding the the delayed gratification yeah so they and i mean look military you can go through boot camp you're getting just drilled in your mind for six months or three months whatever the time period is so like you're still going through those growing lessons you're just going through it a different mechanism than say starting a business a lot of people i see that struggle so much with starting a business is because they haven't learned these things and then the first time they have failure they immediately think oh this business is bad i need to move on they're bad they're bad yeah yeah i've i've been through that many times you know and it's 100 true it's like if you can't if you can't exude that discipline like right now like i feel personally like i don't feel physically fit i have been in the past you know and i feel like i have allowed myself in the starting of this new business that i started last year at least um to uh loosen up on those things um to focus so much because i'm i'm dealing with an onslaught of different things and this podcast everything like that so i'm just kind of holding on and maintaining and trying not to go over the edge you know but i know that that's holding me back you know because uh if i was roaring on all cylinders um i would be making better strides certainly but i'm also a human being and i'm not perfect you know and i have to forgive myself for that yeah and i think that's that's something people a lot of people struggle with is you know you expect to be perfect yeah yeah look quite frankly like i still have days where i fell down there's still some days where like it takes me an hour two hours longer to get started for the day just because like i'm tired or just like dealing with something yeah and it's like everyone feels that but the people that i see winning and the most successful they understand how to get through that faster than everyone else like i know people that they'll have one bad day and it turns into a whole bad week for them yeah i might have a bad hour and that's it by the end of the day i'm good like i i've learned and i think that's itself it's its own skill set that people can develop and improve on yeah that's interesting that's 100 true i know that from experience too and and yeah you can let those things if something bad happens in your world you know or if you just wake up and you feel bad or you know you're battling depression any anything like this um it is it is a skill understanding where you're at and understanding that in a very vivid way that it's temporary and that you're not going to be sitting there forever and you might as well take those steps forward and get on out of that um and i've had to learn that learn that over time it's all mental loops people when you when you go through a mental loop it's first off becoming aware if you're going through a mental loop and what do you need need to break that yeah you know a lot of people that get something stuck on their mind that again carries into the week carries into the month carries into the year yeah and it's because they've trained their mind just like a muscle to keep thinking like that so just like going to the gym you have to break that and you have to in its own way it's its own muscle that you have to work every day and it's not fun and it's you know it can be painful at times but when you do that that allows you to break through levels in life at a significantly faster rate yeah it's so funny that when you get when you are feeling that pain it's like you want to keep going through that pain feels good why that's so wild but i know exactly what it is like you just want to keep embellishing in that and like just keep feeling sorry for yourself it's like that when you get into that stage it's like more comfortable to stay there to then to push yourself out with that muscle that you're talking about so it's fascinating it's just it's easier it's easier to sit down and dwell on the pain it's easier to sit down and think about all your problems it's easier to you know oh my ex said this to me i'm this person blah blah blah cry on the couch yeah it's easier to do that yeah but it's not fun to break that and it's a lot harder and the gratification is a lot longer but when you do you realize that just how much more of an impact it'll have on your life yeah yeah it's so interesting man it's fascinating that's a very important piece of uh i'm glad we got down that because that's very much the kind of stuff that we're trying to talk about here you know i didn't send you any show notes but we're hitting it right right on the right on the sweet spot you know we're right right back there um okay so uh so yeah you got full-time in digital marketing you've obviously we'll talk about your success in a little bit but um uh were you scared uh when you stopped the other thing and you cut that income off you know did you have uh did you feel some type of way as you went up did you have imposter syndrome getting into the space of advising people on how to deal with facebook when i mean you're a young guy and you were younger then like what how did you feel about that absolutely i had imposter syndrome nice every everybody everyone has that yeah um you know i think for me it was like i had imposter syndrome when i closed my first client um and it's actually funny because like when i closed my first client like i you know i hired someone to plan on getting them to come on and take board to help me fulfill that and i actually just with my own skill set was able to get them good enough results we're like oh wait i can do this yeah you know oh so you were gonna kind of you were gonna lean on somebody else just to make sure you had what you needed to get them the results that they wanted because you were scared that you couldn't do it yeah i think an imposter syndrome like that's like one of the biggest things it's like if you have the right you know support group for example that you can trust it helps out with that imposter syndrome right there because you can always turn to them when like things go bad yeah um you know like i'm really big into like boxing and stuff like that and um you know i've hired a personal trainer like personal coach to do like lessons with me and stuff like that yeah um i don't plan on ever like fighting competitively or professionally or anything like that but you know if i were to go and just like step in the ring with no training at all no coach in my corner stuff like that like i would have a ton of fear and anxiety and stuff like that sure and i have a reason to because i just simply did not have the preparation i didn't have the support group or anything like that yeah but if i were hypothetically to go step in the ring i have a coach in the corner who's been there who's done it for me to where if i can encounter any problems i could easily turn to that person yeah and that's where like having a mentor is so important when you're achieving anything and you know i think at the time like that's another like something a lot of business owners struggle with is because they develop this ego that i need to do this all myself and you know if i could go tell myself back like one thing anything back in the day would be to hire a mentor faster yeah and that's simply because like a mentor you know there's it's cringy because a lot of them promote their stuff as like mentors having a real life cheat code yeah yeah and then they'll sell you their course right after they say that but right to be fair here they really are correct it's it's so nice being able to have that support group to where when you do take on something challenging or difficult either you know having a mentor or someone that's been there and done that to where if anything does go south you can immediately reach out to that person hey yeah you know i'm running ads my first client and you know they just sent me this this message and i don't really know how to answer it cool here just say this and then boom and they're good to go versus trying to figure it out themselves and they're just messing everything up yeah yeah yeah it's really interesting i uh we've talked about that a little bit like uh and i had that you know i i even said on one of these podcasts it's on film i was like uh man in the past you know like i uh i did want to do it all myself you know and i felt like i had to just put that cross on my back and and and go up the hill alone probably because my ego wanted to be the only one that it points to once it succeeds that it was all me you know and uh and once i started talking to people and really really realizing how helpful people can be anyway and how willing people are to help you in different situations i guess i was never open to it so i didn't see it as much in the past but now that i'm super open with it um it's a beautiful thing it's crazy everybody will help you you know and you yeah like paid ones paid mentorships paid training paid coaching like that's some valuable stuff too but there's also people that can just surround you in different areas of your life um that aren't interested in that they don't they don't need to get paid they can just guide you in different areas maybe not business business is a money-driven thing obviously so you know you're gonna you're gonna have coaches that uh that uh expect to be compensated yeah that was the biggest thing for me it's like you brought up ego and everything like that yeah you did too yeah you know like for for me like i had that ego in the beginning as well yeah and it was mostly from like kind of like i always kind of think back like why like what was the reason for the ego like you know because if i can understand human absolutely and it's like if i could understand why i had that ego at that time because you're if if that if you've never resolved that in your life you're going to make the same mistake again yeah so and like for me it was like at the time it was like i almost felt like i had a chip on my shoulder because i had so many people like complimented me how smart i am with like computers and stuff like that yeah so it just kind of made me feel like i had this ego and this extra chip that i could do this all myself and you know now that i think about it like it's like oh you know that could also kind of like damage you a little bit so that's why it's like it's good to surround yourself with people that positively uplift you and compliment you and everything but also too you need the people that kind of help you with um not saying knock you down or anything like that but challenge you as well yeah a hundred percent i've had similar experiences too man it's uh you know and when you're getting told you're doing the right thing all the time and that you're you know god's gift to computers or whatever like that it is very challenging to grow you better but you better have like some sort of crazy uh um mentality or something you know it's just like anything else and it's funny because you know like so like for me for example like going back to like the the boxing example like you know i've had a lot of success over the recent years and to the point where you know like my ego has been like raising and stuff like business and stuff like that and like i i keep a lot of people around me in business that one checks that ego and two allows me to kind of reframe that over and over to learn new things and challenge me and stuff like that um but picking up boxing in the last two years has been like the biggest thing that helped me out with that because now that i'm starting to see success i started a new activity that makes me go all the way back down to zero yeah i've never had boxing experience never even been in a fight anything like that and then i pick up boxing and it's like oh shit now i finally feel like what it feels like to go back to ground zero and boxing yeah and i got to experience all of those learning mistakes and all the different i would say like mindset things because like you know the beginning you don't even want to show up yeah because you don't want to look like a fool yeah you know you when you hire a coach and they start pointing out all your flaws you get aggravated and like you want to like that's a good sign punch your coast in the face almost that's a good sign that you're on you're doing the right thing that's exactly that's that's just a sign that says hey your ego was a little crazy you know or or you were uh driving a lot of your uh internal worth because of these things and these this success or whatever it is you know that's awesome that you did that that's a that's a great point to make for for the listeners of this podcast like that's a that's a trick that's a that's a cheat code you know if there ever was one you know like if you feel like you're the best at something uh you need to do something that you're the worst at you know or something that you at least start out at zero um that's a great thing to do just like this podcast for me like i uh i started at zero on this and you know it's checked my ego for sure you know the cool thing is like you know you've learned you learn the same characteristics that make you successful in one thing apply to everything yeah so you know like for me um i did a diet this is kind of when i first learned about characteristics and stuff like that so it's like you know inconsistency and everything yeah uh back in like 2000 i want to say like 17 or 18 i did a diet uh shredded down from like 180 to you know i'm sitting like 170 right now it's like 180 i shredded down like 140 single digit body fat all that stuff like that and at the time i didn't really realize what i learned but i learned consistency and i learned to stop focusing on the outcome and start focusing on my daily actions and when you focus on repeating the same daily actions every day for a long period of time that's what creates success yeah so when you look at people that may be quote unquote more successful than you or maybe in a place that you want to be at in life all they've done is just found those few key daily actions they need to focus on in every day and focused on that for a little bit longer than you yeah and when you realize that it's like okay what are the key daily actions that i need to do and you know for example is podcasts or you know growing a youtube channel or building a brand new business or you know finding a girlfriend or you know getting shredded for the summer coming up what are the few daily actions that i just need to stay consistent with and focus on a daily basis that's going to create that outcome that i want and then you actually end up getting that outcome way faster than just focusing on the outcome yeah yeah yeah i remember having an epiphany one time i was like uh i was uh i was sitting at my desk at my house and i was like uh and i was into a diet too you know and i've been successful with diets in the past too um but anyway i was sitting there and i was like you know i was like oh my gosh like i can do anything like you know all i have to do is decide what i want to do and then figure out what actions are necessary for that to come true and do those things and i didn't have that power until i realized i had power in the diet space and i've been failing for a long i go up and down sometimes you know so i don't succeed at that i haven't figured out how to do that lifelong okay myself personally but at that time and i still know it obviously um i had like an epiphany i was like i can literally do anything as long as i just give myself time you know um because it's 100 true you know like especially when it comes to fitness fitness is the perfect example because there's immediate results and there's a physical and obvious change in in in what you're doing as far as the ins and outs input and uh uh evidence of growth you know uh so that's the perfect example in a microcosm you know but but really anything else is like that the only thing that's it's different that you might not be able to manufacture exactly that kind of situation is because you don't understand the business and you don't understand you know how these things work you know i'm sure that once i have a conversation with you quick five minute conversation i'm gonna know everything about uh facebook ads right you know like i'm gonna know everything i'm gonna be the facebook ads guy the the guy and like uh and then i just gotta do it and then i'm gonna make millions of dollars right absolutely yeah yeah one of those few key leverage high activities and stuff like i hope that happens uh but no i'm sure it is like that too just with facebook ads its processes its programs and it's doing those actions and those actions take money and they take ads and they take the process and they take the lead capture and they take all those things but once you figure it out and you know those things and it's just a matter of doing those things in sequential order right to achieve the result yeah it's all about figuring out like what's the the main high leverage action and something that like i like to do is that like i'm fascinated with like athletes and stuff like that high level professional athletes right and i've kind of like skimmed down to about three daily actions that you can apply to any area in your life you want to improve and um same thing from like athletes coming from athletes and stuff like that and that is reviewing your game footage every day so like for example if you are uh trying to run facebook ads reviewing reviewing previous ads you've ran and learning what you can do to improve on it so review your game footage every day um it could be maybe building your business what's some recent things you did in your business did they have a positive impact or negative impact right there yeah then you have your daily training sessions every day so this might be spending 30 minutes reading a marketing psychology book if you're trying to get better at facebook ads um this might be literally just you're trying to improve your marriage you're reading a book on how to better cater towards your life or your wife and how to to better show her how you love her and stuff like that you might be reading a book on that yeah um so training every day you're reviewing your game footage every day um and then you're actively going ahead and applying it and stuff like that performing yeah so if you can if you can actively do that every single day you can drastically start going ahead and improving your um your whatever skill set you're trying to do and then also to like research that's also another one i like to call it so like research for me is like what are some top ads from like top brands right now why do they work so well what's the key things yeah so like if you know for example even if like you're an amateur athlete you're looking at top level athletes um you know maybe if you're in a marriage that you just started out and you're trying to see what's some of the most successful marriages because you really love this girl and you want to be with her for a long period of time what makes them so good what's the really key things they're doing on a daily basis so research review and then actual application you do that every day for whatever particular skill set you're trying to get better at and i can guarantee you if you stick with that every day and be disciplined and consistent with it you will see better results in that particular area of your life yeah in that that case the obscurity there's not any more room for the obscurity you know what i mean it's like the wide wide brim of everything you don't know just keeps keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller and to the point where you know you know you know what to do you know what you need to do but it never ends obviously but but like with business or the process just like you're researching you're researching ads you're looking at those top performing ads like um you learn a lot from it so the obscurity gets smaller you know really interesting so you do uh let's see back to your story a little bit um so you are where you are now what do you think the hardest thing about starting an online business or otherwise finding all your clients online and zoom meetings and uh facebook messenger and all this kind of what's the what's been the hardest thing for you as far as like you being a person who who does that what's the hardest part about that you know i would say my hardest thing besides just learning it was just systemizing i think that's the hardest thing yeah um you know if i look at like any time of like any business problems or struggles and stuff like that is systemization because yeah everything is quite easy yeah to do and it's more assuming you're patient for long term because like i was patient and i'm looking at five to ten year scale you know like i just started like investing heavily this year but i'm not i'm not looking at like oh how much money i make at the end of the year i'm looking at 10 to 20 year time frame right now for my investments yeah so i'm okay with the next 10 years not really making much from investments so for me with the facebook ad side was the same thing like i didn't really have a hey i need to have a million dollar business tomorrow right so i was patient with understanding that these actions that i'm doing on a daily basis is going to take a little time and then the hardest part though was the system side that was probably the biggest thing for me my biggest of just like like you know when i was one person handling six clients you know who's the person i need to hire to help me out with this how do i need to build this and everything and you know uh for me it was like i was trying to do it all myself still and then um i eventually hired someone and then i hired like two or three or other people as well just to mentor me uh around that and that's what really allowed me to really rapidly grow the business um to you know where it's at today yeah interesting man um let's see man uh do you think that most every business is uh do you think social media advertising is going to be pretty much the 80 80 to 90 percent of spend at some level in the next three to five years i would say it's already at that i don't know unless you're like uh you know a brand like pringles or something like that like right and you're super bold large brand yeah you're dominant facebook ads but they're still those brands are still dumping into you know so even if they're still tapping into regular television stuff all this guy you know whatever radio i guess which would be nuts i mean i look at that as nuts but i mean i guess some people still listen to the radio but um but yeah those big brands are still finding uh influencers they're finding different ways to advertise based upon eyeballs you know what people are focusing on so i i i just would like to hear from you you gotta look at it i mean it's like you know people rarely ever listen to the radio now i mean they're spotify pandora whatever they listen to podcasts like this now yeah so you know you're kind of cutting out radio advertising now um even like tv now i mean people watching netflix amazon prime they're watching you know content on youtube and stuff like that they're not really sitting down and watching a tv show people that are watching tv shows they have it pre-recorded to where they can fast forward through commercials now you know i think some some even pre-recorded like type of things even just get past the commercials so like commercials are getting less and less radio advertising is getting less and less what's the number one thing people are spending the most time on their day right now it's their phone media yeah you know facebook specifically social talk yeah instagram yeah they're on social media so and that's where it comes down to influencers content creators and an actual sponsored post like we do and everything um that's where we put our dominant focus at where do you think the the most untapped or unused um uh platform if you will for for advertising for small business you know what do you think facebook is a juggernaut right like that's that's the main because of all of the ways you can advertise right like i don't understand is that that right i don't i don't know um and because of the the dynamics of the viewership there it's everybody it's not just people who like instagram it's not just be you know a lot of younger kids maybe they're on those other platforms but they all have facebook too but they're not spending maybe as much as uh the people that are on facebook so is facebook the best place to do it facebook's the best facebook and instagram that's the best two places i think for local businesses i think the the biggest things that they're untapped in is creating content that people actually want to watch yeah you know for example like um i'm not really a big club person and stuff like that but you know i i've traveled to cities and i've pulled up clubs on like uh instagram and stuff that have just this phenomenal content feed they have like a videographer that goes create videos every night of people partying and stuff like that showing the environment showing they're they're showing off to people what people want it's kind of easy in that space yeah yeah of our ads and it's like when i look at bars and clubs around our area like no one's doing that yeah no one at all yeah and it's like that's such an easy thing and you can apply that to your business regardless what you're selling and you know in lafayette for example i'm calling that out right there yeah it's they're creating content to really articulate and showcase to people hey i know this is what you want a fun night so i'm going to show you a fun night every day on your instagram feed to where you're going to associate that feeling with coming to our place yeah and that's like a big part of what we do right there what are feelings and emotions people want to feel and showcasing that in the video or photo what about the cross emotional feel that's unrelated to the product or service that you offer like what if i go out there to a club and i video all that stuff and then i show it on my construction company page okay so so where does that end and is it it's just business specific i guess because if i'm out here and i and i catch people's attention in a very fun and creative way they would probably still have a a positive connection to my brand some way they'd be they'd be like look at these guys you know look at what they're doing um well may not it may not tell them anything about my product or service but it would probably elicit some sort of reaction so on the flip side of that right there yeah this is where you got to narrow down your construction business who's your ideal audience yeah so let me give you a great example really quick this is where positioning comes in play sure how do you position your brand how do you how do you want people to perceive your brand yeah so your construction business i'll give you a great example there's this guy on instagram he's an electrical engineer you know just like the regular people that you call that come to your house to run you know some lights and stuff like that at a breaker box and stuff like that yeah well this dude only creates content of installing electrical rooms on houses these are houses that are like two million dollars plus with a whole room dedicated to like your breaker box your server your hot water tanks all in one designated room yeah so he's positioned himself to only appeal to a wealthier demographic yeah and he's also able to charge significantly more to where he only needs a few deals a week and he hits that high higher ticket yeah so the reason the way he creates his content is he wants to showcase how like premium in depth he goes with every job yeah to have in that increased perceived value of what he does yeah and then he also only showcases these nice houses and that's going to appeal to someone who have a nice house you know if he's only showcasing like trailer park for example like they wouldn't really take him serious right there that's true so like where your construction content like construction is very broad you know what specifically can you niche down within construction and how can you appeal to the wealthier demographic that's going to allow you to charge more and make more per job and i mean me and you both know like we both want to do less work and make more that's everyone's dream job right there sure and that's how you can go after that wealthier demographic that's like one of my favorite ways to go um when it comes down to like charging more um give you a great example i just start off with a performance coach um that's what that's what he calls himself yeah all he is this is a all he is is someone that makes meal plans and you know does like your workout plans yeah that's it yeah but he's he called himself a performance coach he's able to charge sniffly more and he only works with entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs are willing to toss 4k to 10k to make a little bit more money by having uh increased performance in their business yeah so you can position yourself to appeal to a certain demographic and then it's like what type of content do we need to create that's going to resonate with them around our product or service yeah fascinating man i've thought about it you know in in my company it does do very specific things but um it's also we'll talk about it later you know what i mean but uh but it's interesting you know it's a different kind of thing uh but yeah anyway uh we'll talk about uh a little bit later um but yeah that that all makes perfect sense and everybody should think about those things right like not only should you be putting content out i i hope somebody who owns a bar uh in lafayette hears this because i didn't know that i mean i don't see that i don't follow that kind of stuff anyway but uh but that's a huge thing you know the proceed that that emotional response that you're getting from the uh from the content is uh is really where the action that's where people make decisions that's where people decide whether or not they like a brand or not right and it's it's all it all comes down to is like what do people want to feel you know and that's more focusing on like the the local like laugh at area and stuff like that so like if you own a nice restaurant what do people want to feel they want to feel catered to they want to feel cared for when they come to your restaurant for sure they want a delicious meal so you want to showcase people being catered for cared for and you want to showcase your delicious food and everything like that and that's like a big thing and then also too a little bit of an experience as well over there like what's that experience when they go for it to that place yeah if you just post a picture of your plate lunch every single day that you serve it's like okay you know yeah so and you're also making it only about that plate correct right like you're not showing anything else correct so everybody thinks they're just putting you then the people that are consumers who are potential buyers there are going to only look at plate versus plate you know maybe you have a outstanding atmosphere and that but somebody else's plate is better but you've put yourself in the plate versus plate situation right yeah and also to showcase like your chefs in the background showcase how much work goes into every plate yeah like you start to showcase a little bit more of that experience yeah and i think the the last thing that i see a lot of business owners make them make a mistake with with content creation is a they hire some just random person that just doesn't know what they're doing and they just start posting pictures of randomly every day and it's like you know come see us today yeah no one cares um yeah that's why i say that all the time i say that all the time and then the other thing is they focus more on um let's see i just lost my train of thought right there oh they focus more on giving away their industry secrets so hey i run facebook ads here's the life of running a facebook ads agency as a customer who needs facebook ads i do not care what you do as a facebook ads agency owner i care about what you can do for me yeah so if i own a restaurant in lafayette for example i'm not going to go out there and showcase here's here's what it's like owning a restaurant i do not care as your customer i want to know the experience you're going to provide for me when i go to your restaurant yeah um and then the last thing that you can i think that's super undervalued that a lot of businesses are doing is that they're not leveraging local influencers in the area that's a really big one because local influencers um people want to be like them at least for the most part you know you take any girl and for example like lafayette for example uh with like 20 30k followers in lafayette you know she's pretty popular and stuff like that you go put her at a particular spot and you say hey look i'll let you have a free meal every month whatever you want just for you though as long as you post about it every time you come then it's like oh where's she she eats this place i want to be like her i'm going there yeah yeah that's interesting that's really good stuff man this is uh this is a lot of great information man thanks for sharing all this stuff you're welcome man so what do you think uh what where are you going with all this stuff you know are you just going to continue going on getting better at your craft are you trying to be a specific person within this industry you know what do you you know as we're kind of wrapping it up we've been going for probably about an hour i don't know um um so where are you going with all this you know yeah i mean i just love it like yeah that's great i think long term i look at myself in a way as like the grant credon of marketing that's kind of what i've been trying to get a little bit more into and the reason why i say that is because it's like marketing and sales those are the two activities that you can do and it can be applied to any niche yeah like and marketing's been around since i think like you know copywriting in general has been around i think since like 1890s 18 i won't even say like maybe as low as like 1870s it's been around since humans have yeah i mean yeah like regardless of the paperwork so it's always going to present itself just in new mechanisms yeah radio advertising newspaper advertising all this but it's the same human psychology we're doing the same way we create sharts and tiktoks and reels and stuff like that is the exact same way people are getting attention in newspapers yeah it's just formatted differently instead of putting words down we're talking about it like this yeah posting videos so um for me i'm just something i'm passionate about i'm fascinated with so my my curiosity to get it just drives me to get better every day like yeah you know i look at people like um like a top copywriters like dan kennedy for example um and it's like you know how do i get to that level and what do i have to do to get there and how do i keep perfecting my craft from there and it's probably the one thing that i'm like if there's anything i could do for free and just enjoy it it's that thing yeah what i do daily now yeah so my drive to just get better at it and continue to help people um in multiple different facets so obviously i have like my youtube channel that gives all of this for free um i have my clients that come on board and we help them and do this for them um i have over 100 plus mentored students that i mentor on a monthly basis right now as well um and i recently just launched my own education program teaching people how to like marketing and all that good stuff now um i just want to continue to grow in this space and i mean to be fair like at the end of the day like i love to win you know just like anyone else so i just want to continue to dominate and grow in it that's that's that's my big thing you know awesome man awesome well as we wrap it up man i do something uh uh uh usually um you're a little bit different than a lot of guests that i have but uh but what i do is i ask the guest to uh look into the camera and assume that there's somebody out there it may not apply to you but it may um but i ask them you know to give their best advice to help that person get to that next level they feel like they don't have the tools necessary to succeed they're going through something very tragic very hard maybe and what would you say to that person to uh to to help them get over that scenario that they're dealing with you know so someone that's currently giving to the camera someone that's currently going through some deep stuff right now yeah yeah yeah yeah like uh if you had to tell somebody you really cared about um who needed your help you know or they felt like they could not get over this thing okay and this is an emotional question so we've been talking about marketing we didn't get super deep with the mind but but if you got something like that it could be like a new entrepreneur who feels like hey look i've taken a crack at this thing and uh and i just can't do this man you know like uh what would you tell that person you've obviously been successful you've got you've learned a lot of things give them some advice man man that's that's a tough question right there because there is a lot there is a lot that i could tell you someone right there um you know for me it's like who do i need to show up as a daily basis uh to become successful and if there's just one characteristic that i could just focus on and be the best at what is that thing uh for me it was consistency so i know for me like as far as i can remember i think it was like 2014 i started telling myself this quote and i still tell myself this quote every single day it's look up get up and never get up uh or never give up so basically what it means is hey like when you're down you've been hit with some shit stuff like that just say look up get your shit back together and just never get up give give one more swing at it you can quit tomorrow just not today yeah and anytime you feel like quitting you can quit tomorrow just not today and as long as you stay consistent every single day and just swing at it a little bit more then you're going to increase your chances of being successful so even though that you may feel bad and maybe feel down just go back to hey what do i need to do what's that one thing that i need to do get one step closer yes it sucks right now yes i'm going through a lot of shit right now but this is what's going to make me successful that's sitting down there and dwelling at that aspect right there and then obviously like i said having the right people around you having the support group and even people that may have been there and done that as well that helps a lot too um but you know sometimes you don't have that luxury and sometimes it may need to be literally just go and watch like some youtube videos and stuff like that of hearing other people's stories to understand that hey like as long as i stay consistent stay focused you will get there in the end yeah excellent man thank thank you so much you know it's funny you said don't give up man that's what rudy's thing says i'll show you on the on the way out it says uh uh to bow dream big and never quit rudy come on the podcast dude you've got a good story and i want to hear it in this chair okay but uh but we really enjoyed i really enjoyed speaking with you man it was a lot of great information i can't wait to have like a relationship with you going forward in business whatever it is uh because you're obviously a wealth of knowledge on that and i know that the people who are watching if they're business people they got a lot of information a lot of data a lot of a lot of everything from you so you're kind of like not you're not just marketing you're everything you have built yourself into marketing as well you know so i'm impressed with you and uh
