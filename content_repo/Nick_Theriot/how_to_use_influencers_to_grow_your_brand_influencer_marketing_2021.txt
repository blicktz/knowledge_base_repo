yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio and today I have a new video for you guys where we're gonna show you my exact strategy you can use to get started using influencers I know it's a little different took a little twist of detail to where I'm actually gonna show you guys how to get started with influencers and why they are so valuable at least for getting started with your brand so that being said make sure you hit the subscribe button and the like button below for new content every other day helping the Shopify business owner to succeed with e-commerce in 2021 that being said let's get started so why use influencers that's probably the biggest question on your mind first off content equals the new digital currency in 2021 it's probably one of the most underrated and most powerful pieces of your marketing that you're probably missing out on social proof is probably one of the most powerful cell psychology tools and that's probably where content from influencers comes so handy because just seeing your product in someone's hand that consumer idolizes is extremely powerful because they're like hey if that person has it I want it too I want everything that that person has because I look up to that person or have a strong relationship with this person so I believe whatever he said if he says to invest into GameStop I'm going to invest in GameStop as well I'm gonna throw my whole life savings in there so that's why influencers are powerful because a it gives you some really good content you can use for your marketing to because of the social proof side of this influencer telling people to go purchase your product that they love it so much and that you need it too so step number one how do you find influencers well first off you need to have a clear understanding of your niche and who buys your product so that's step number one but step number one finding influencers is you need to identify the leaders in your niche with followers who fit your ideal consumer profile so this is just the top dogs you look up to or your consumers look up to and then go find those people it's easier to find the bigger accounts before you start going down and deeper where it gets a little bit more wider and there's a lot more people to go through then what you want to do is you want to find micro accounts within those accounts so you find an account with a million followers and stuff and then you go try to find all the people that's just like them within 5,000 to 50,000 followers so just same people like them just smaller following sizes and you can do this on Instagram YouTube Facebook pages up to you Instagram and YouTube and TikTok are absolutely crushing it right now so this is where I would focus my attention at so find these accounts between 5,000 and 50 followers that match your bigger accounts so I'm using Christian Guzman as an example real quick if you follow his account you can actually click on this little down tab and see suggested and you can actually go through to suggested and find similar accounts to him which is smaller followings even if they have 100k followers go follow those people then find the smaller accounts of those people next thing what you want to do is actually audit these accounts you find that are micro accounts between 5,000 and 50,000 followers because now you actually want to see if they'd be a good fit to your brand so I know when a lot of people start with influencers they're focusing more off to shout outs and they're like hey you have 50,000 followers let me shout you out for 100 bucks sure and they don't do any due diligence of looking through that account and just get completely wasted in terms of the ROI so audit your accounts spend time on this because this is gonna be very key it's better to have 10 influencers that you do your detailing just really figure out they'd be a good fit with your brand before you actually just go ahead and do a massive blowout of a whole bunch of influencers and half of them are just completely trashed in terms that are following so look at their content first just right when you open up the page was the content tell you it's a full of memes or is it actually posting meaningful content next thing is what's the quality of their content again the meaningful is it meaningful is it actually provide value is it actually building relationship or is it just you know memes over and over or just some guy taking mirror pics constantly you know whatever next thing is do they post frequently if they their last post was last April a year ago then obviously you don't want to use them you want to use people that post at least one to two times a week which is a good ratio and you want to look at how many likes they're getting per post compared to their followers so if they have like 35,000 followers and getting 10 likes then obviously they have some fake followers you want to see about a one to three percent so they have 100 followers getting anywhere from one to three likes per photo scale that up times 100 you know for bigger profiles and stuff so you want to you want to compare the likes to the total number followers sometimes it might even be a little higher that's good now to completely verify if those are real people look at the comments what do the comments say or the comments full of just buy this you know join our team or is it actually people posting meaningful stuff in the comments that's actually supporting them maybe starting good conversations and stuff like that see what type of relationship they have do they actively go ahead and respond to those comments and say hey that's great it's amazing i'm proud of you blah blah blah you know are they actually communicating with their followers and then last thing do they post stories so you may have to follow them this for this and kind of vet them for a few days if they're actually posting stories and stuff but a lot of times you can just look at their highlights and stuff and maybe just click on their account should have a story active if they're posting pretty frequently on those stories and this is just another step to who is building that connection and the relationship versus the people that are just posting just random stuff on our page this is how you really vet an account and find the the accounts with serious people that would actually buy your products now reach out via email or dm so a lot of the business accounts on instagram you can just click on the email send them a dm and an email that's the best way to do it on youtube as well via on the youtube tiktok i'm sure it's a way as well it's where you can do their email maybe look them up on instagram and then do it on instagram so um you want to be extremely clear on what is it for them now don't have to be like a super long three paragraph email because likely they wouldn't read that but be very specific and very concise of what's in it for them what are you asking and what do you want them to do so hey we'll ship your clothes to you for free be clear on what you want them to do with those clothes make a page post on your instagram and leave it up for at least seven days wearing our clothes so be specific as how long you want it on your page and with them what you want them to do so post it up whatever time you would like i want you to post your typical gym mirror selfie every morning that you do and just wear our clothes in it and say how amazing these clothes fit again be clear on what you want them to say you can use whatever caption you would like but also include you know this and then also too i forgot to add how do you want them to go to and purchase so it could be click on my link in my bio and purchase it here or tap go to their page and then you know make your purchase over there so you want to be extremely clear i feel like there's a lot of people who try to use influencers maybe shout outs get burned because they're not being clear of what they want they don't get what they want and then they're like influencer marketing is trash so anything else you think you may want to add maybe even negotiate a deal if they say hey i'll do that for the clothes but also plus a fee negotiate a deal that works for them you can also toss in something like hey we'll give you 10 of all sales we get from you and you can do whatever percentage you would like now tracking is super important because you do not want to just be sending out all these influencers and sending out all these things and not being able to track it it's kind of like running facebook ads and never ever get to see what type of results facebook specifically is doing for you so you need to be able to incorporate some way you can track the performance of these influencers so what we like to do in the easiest way you can do it is just create a custom code so nickterio 20 and everyone who uses that code is a sell from that influencer gives the person off 20 off so it gives them a reason to hurry up and go purchase now and it's also a way for us to track there's also some paid apps for tracking and build influencer marketing campaigns for like affiliate deals so i highly recommend checking some of those out because that's some awesome ways to to where you don't have to use a discount code and you just give them a link and that's all they need which works really well now just like any paid advertising you need to be a smart business owner you need to pull back you need to analyze the effectiveness across all of the influencers say you launch a campaign work with 10 influencers now let's look back and let's see what's working what's not you notice maybe six out of the 10 influencers actually worked and maybe four of them didn't well we can cut those four out now how can we maximize and do more with those six influencers maybe some even bigger promotions with proven influencers so i know ghost lifestyle they did like a collab with like christian guzman to do a custom pre-workout behind him what kind of bigger promotions can you do and also to you might want to do this with the more bigger and proven influencers that you can really leverage and again longer term you know you might have to work with influencer for a few years before you finally decide to maybe do something like that and then the next thing is you want to keep testing more don't just run and you know do this and then do like six influencers find six that work and keep using them because their audiences are going to get burned out i like to see around a seven to ten you know post within a certain period of time because sometimes it takes a few times before someone purchases so they have to see that that repetition so after influencer you're working with you know does that then really start to analyze more the longer term work with that influencer and see okay look your first few promotions did really well but then you know your last one it's your last few are starting to fade out we need to figure out something out or we're going to work with other people but again keep testing more influencers keep building up that influencer circle you can literally build a multiple six-figure business per month just by using influencers and keep working your way up start off with micro accounts and keep working up you know then to 50 to 100,000 followers then from 100,000 to 200,000 100,000 to a million keep working your way up in size and keep growing that community of influencers that rep your brand and also too you want to start expanding into other niches that consist of people with similar demographics so if you sell to people that are in a relationship and right now you're targeting you know maybe people who are building homes then also target the people who relationship in the gaming niche and that's a horrible horrible example but just start to expand other niches that you wouldn't necessarily target but have the demographics that you are going after okay guys I hope y'all enjoyed this video on influencer marketing and this is pretty fun to make I get a lot of people that message me on a day-to-day basis as I recommend this to all brands literally doing from zero to 10k a month scale up with this strategy to around 25k a month then start doing all of your paid advertising because it's a lot cheaper because usually when you're reaching out to people with 5,000 to 50,000 followers literally all you need to do is send them the clothes for free and they'll be more than happy to work with you so and then as you grow you have to start you know paying on top of that but again it's just like paid advertising you start to understand what works and what doesn't and you can make more wiser decisions versus you're trying to like sort of influencer marketing go find a page with a million followers give you a shout out get you no return you're like I hate this so be smart about this be strategic and I hope you guys enjoy this video hope this helps cover that category if you're an e-com business owner and you're looking to spend $30,000 next
