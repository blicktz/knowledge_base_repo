I've done over 20 million in online sales with Facebook ads, and one of the main things that we focus on is product positioning when a client comes on board. Product positioning is how we position the product in the marketplace for success. There's five different ways to do it, and this was coined by Eugene Swartz in Breakthrough Advertising called the five stages of market sophistication.

For example, stage one is purely just stating the claim. This is when you have no competition, you're first in a market, and you can simply state the claim, lose ugly fat. Stage two is where there is some level of competition, and you go ahead and enlarge the claim and over-dramatize the performance results, all that good stuff.

So lose 47 pounds in four weeks, where you separate yourself by purely the results and the stuff that your clients get. Stage three is focusing more on the unique mechanism of which you separate your product from everyone else. The unique mechanism can be something like, first, wonder drug for losing weight, and this is only three stages.

There's a total of five, and I highly recommend you checking them out to better position your product in the marketplace.
