yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today I'm gonna go over exactly how we've been able to generate a 15x return on ad spend for one particular client for their launch a new launch they did it's a clothing brand client they did a launch they haven't done one in a little while so they need to warm people up properly and be able to really push their uh kind of like launch inventory and everything so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday so let's dive into it okay so if you're watching this video you're likely either about to do a launch maybe have done a launch in the past but haven't really done any crazy results and stuff and you really want to see how you can improve your results with Facebook ads doing a launch strategy keep in mind I don't really recommend launch strategies for brands because like there's some brands that that's all they do is they do launches every month or once every quarter and that's how they really build their revenue I'm more of a person that likes predictable revenue so I like to go with the evergreen route have a few evergreen products keep scaling those and drop new products to the collections and stuff but even with that I still use this strategy right here which allows us to build up a lot of hype for particular products and then on launch day have some crazy crazy returns so with this particular product those as a collection a clothing collection that this particular client was releasing and I'll go ahead and I'll put that screenshot up right now this is the total sales for the day 22,000 just absolutely crazy we literally did like $15,000 in an hour absolutely insane now this particular brand had a lot of customers already so essentially we did before that is we had to really reactivate them get those customers primed and ready because if we do a launch and you know we those people aren't aware we're about to do a launch then that returning customer rates me a lot lower because we have less and less customers that are aware that we're doing a launch so with this launch we kind of leveraged their following their email list we literally took an audit of all the assets this particular client had now for launch you don't go after cold advertising actually at all you do not touch cold advertising until the day after you launch your store but what you need to do is you need to do a lot of effective free marketing for your existing warm audiences existing customers and email list so if you're a brand new brand unless you do a massive influencer launch influencer marketing plan to where you work with a ton of influencers to build up a lot of hype around your brand and then have a launch day that works extremely well and that's a fact that's what we're about to do for one of our clients coming to come to soon clients which is gonna be massive and I'm excited to share with y'all very soon but for this particular client they had a good size following around 20 000 followers on their instagram and so we had a lot of room to work with for the warm audiences they already did a few launches in the past but they never used a proper strategy to really push it like this and this really made massive impact previous launches they did about 5k to 10k so we really need to do a big push to really hit those those new levels inside their business so what we did was is we set up a few campaigns so if we take a look at the ad account right here uh you can actually see we spent 1500 to make back about 22k obviously this does not you know they did some email marketing as well and they already had some of those they already had an sms list but because how like loosely facebook has been tracking lately we're probably around a 10 to 15 extra rush right here actually so because a lot of people that just saw the ad and got primed but didn't actually do anything so uh three days before the launch so we go right here the launch was on friday uh wednesday through thursday we actually ran ads to their warm audiences and you can see right here we did a customer's email one so these are all of our existing customers all of their customers spent greater than 10 and then purchases 180 days so we kind of primed the list and took apart that list to hit different people and we put them in a cbo put out a hundred dollars a day and because we were targeting very warm audiences already and audiences are already aware of the brand we actually ran a view content or not a few content a page view objective for this campaign because all we were doing is getting in front of existing customers and we're sending them to a landing page so there's nothing they could purchase so i didn't want to drive a purchase conversion to them and i want to reach as many people as possible and this is the only time i exception that i use a landing page objective so you can see right here we're able to do about uh 35 purchases from this campaign and because of delayed attribution these campaigns were at zero purchases up until friday afternoon so from wednesday to about friday afternoon they were at zero purchases until you know the everything went live you know we're spending 300 bucks a day you have to be able to spend without getting any purchases for a few days to really do a launch like this now hot right here just all of our website visitors and stuff i just did website visitors 90 days and then warm which actually was very surprisingly distant work and i think we could probably change this up a little bit more effectively we probably could have put just all of them in one ad set because we were definitely having some issues with this right here uh this was actually very surprisingly how poor this performed so you know we were having some issue where the algorithm was bugging out and for this particular campaign right here this warm one it was literally showing people a white image instead of our ad so even with the technical difficulties because this was going to be our bread and butter right here it's warm one because i have 20 000 followers but actually performed the worst so we definitely know some of those technical difficulties but anyway still we did a 2.17 their break evens around 1.4 1.5 they weren't running any discounts or promos or anything like this first launch so in order to do effective launch you have to run some type of paid advertising to your warm audiences existing customers existing lists existing purchases pixel everything everything under the sun that people are engaged with your brand in some level then we want to go ahead and target those for a launch and get those people primed and ready for the big day so we're going to do this for the ad copy in the ad we literally want to keep it straight to the point simple all we're doing is promoting a really cool image good headline that hey this collection launching this date ad copy this date launch super simple we're making it very easy just to get awareness out there that there's a launch happening some people are clicking on the ad some people are just viewing it some people are going to the website and signing up for the landing page and again it paid off very well now on launch day itself we needed to run some campaigns to let people know that everything was live so on launch day you're actually going to do a lot less for the launch day campaigns so these are all launch day campaigns right here and we did a lot less because these are the campaigns letting people know the collection was live but these are the campaigns right here that did all the heavy lifting so all the heavy lifting for a effective launch is the days before we recommend a week before we signed this client on two days before they actually did their launch so we this was not a you know ideal situation but we still want to make as most impact as we could with what we have available so we maximize our time together and on launch day we launched these campaigns that basically just same exact audiences but saying hey collection is live you better get it now so that's it it's simple as that really um you can see right here if we go digging deeper into this and you know some of our warm audiences really picked back up and we're targeting you know page fans that's people who like your facebook page ig engagement 180 day ig engagement 30 day 7 day i like to break them all apart and actually like to exclude them as well so in 180 day i was excluding 30 day and this is one downfall right here of using cbo campaign one particular one got all the spin and probably our seven day one was gonna get the best results and we can see right there 16 extra hours but again that's that's some side notes these people didn't have a crazy budget so i just kind of let facebook algorithm do its thing with the cpo and it actually kind of played us a little bit so that's one mistake on our end but hey still some amazing results i did exactly what we needed to do so going back over if you're planning to do a launch first off you have to understand if you're ready for a launch if you're just starting your brand out with no prior history or data or anything i would really go for a launch let's say if you do 10 to 25k a month you know you have a good size following good size customer list good size of website visitors maybe if you're doing 150 500k a million dollars a month when you have all that in place and actually have a lot of hype around your brain that is when you want to do a launch and you can still run your evergreen ads on the side of doing a launch because what we can do is we can simply have our tofu campaigns in here that's consistently still doing the evergreen and stuff and then we can still run some hype ads in the background because like i said for a launch it's all about a party so imagine a party we want to hype people up for the party so if we want to do this about 7 to 14 days out hype them up spend a ton of money you know we might spend a thousand dollars across that and you're gonna have zero sales with that so you have to be able to first off willing to risk that money because let's say if it doesn't go out as planned and you don't want to blow a bunch of money but you want to blow some money to be able to get that hype built up around the brand and then on lunch day all the heavy lifting is done before so that we on launch day it can really blow up and push out those sales so that's exactly how we did around 15x return on adsmen for their launch day now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through all their products we're gonna find the best performing products that sold the best and then we're gonna do this we're gonna create creatives individually for those and scale those up at tofu top of funnel kind of create our evergreen campaign with the new products and stuff so that's exactly how we're gonna carry this forward and keep moving it forward so if you guys enjoyed this
