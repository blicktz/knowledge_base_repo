i've done over 25 million dollars in online sales with facebook ads over the last two and a half years and i've documented all on this youtube channel and through that period of time i've got a lot of questions and comments about hey nick how'd you get started with facebook ads what's your journey what's your story yada yada yada and you know i have videos in the past it kind of goes over this but i thought it was time to make a 22 2022 updated version so with that being said guys today we'll be diving into a little bit the short story of you know my experience with facebook ads how i got started and stuff like that and you know why am i credible to even be teaching you guys this type of things right here so but yeah guys if you don't know who i am if you're new to channel and stuff like that my name is nick terrio obviously like i said i've done over 25 million dollars in online sales but facebook ads i don't have anything to sell you guys i don't do courses or anything like that my only offer is hey if you love the videos you've been crushing it i've gotten you to a certain point to where now you need to you know offload the task of media buying and running ads for your business then we come on board and we can run that for you in that perspective right there so that being said let's dive into the video so i've been um you know 25 years old you don't you know don't know if you never knew that fun fact and i've been self-employed now since uh i was 18 years old so roughly seven years in that perspective right there um long story short i always been entrepreneurial in that perspective right there and um you know all the way back to like 2012 running you know a gaming youtube channel making money editing people's videos to you know roughly around um 2000 i think it was like 18 19 no no 2015 yeah 2015 when i started my first business it was a auto detailing business where we go detail people's cars in that perspective right there and i did that for uh you know five years you know from 2015 to 2020 and then uh 2020 is when i exited and you know took off my agency in that side right there so um but growing that specific business um i fell in love with the growing side of the business and you know started up and everything like that start spending a you know a couple hundred dollars a month on facebook ads and taught myself purely just through watching youtube videos and things like that and i mean look first month one of this business i spent five hundred dollars on facebook ads made back five thousand dollars so 10x roe ass uh so it's pretty cool purely just local ads in that perspective right there nothing else you know it wasn't you know it wasn't running legion or anything like that i was honestly just running page post engagement purely just to get my name and number out and i showed off all the vehicles we detail on that in that side right there so um but yeah so absolutely crushed it with facebook ads and you know i was able to grow that business to uh you know multi six figures in that sense and you know i was able to exit that business my business partner at the time took over the business and i exited the perfect time it was 2020 um right at the beginning like january 2022 uh january of 2020 exit the business about six months before that is when i started my agency okay so i dibbled and dabbled with a few different types of businesses from like 2019 you know or throughout 2019 i dabbled with a few different types of businesses that was running ads for i remember my first first client outside of my detailing business was a car used car lot uh basically just got it from a referral like literally a family friend boom closed them it's like 500 a month was my first account ever 500 a month and we spent 500 on advertising so roughly a thousand dollars for that business cost um client paid all that spent all things like that i just simply came there and ran the ads and i remember you know sending these people dollar two dollar leads but this is my first realized my lesson number one with legion if they do not have a solid sales process and they don't know how to close a solid cold lead they will fail and this particular client has never had a cold lead before they were all family like referrals they built all they built their business up but use car lot on referrals and they crushing it okay we came in running legion for them and they could not close a single lead they'd call it once all right cool then answer boom throw that lead in trash okay um modern companies now that we work with that do legion they call and hammer lead for 30 days straight okay and they crush it all right so that was first client um my second client was actually another used car lot but we actually i actually ripped that contract mid-awake because it was just a pain in the ass client to deal with okay at the time i thought i was the one doing bad but now look back i'm like no not at all and then um had like a construction business did that for like a month as well um i was actually crushing it for that construction business and then one time um you know we uh we didn't run it wasn't that we didn't run an ad is that the person just didn't quite understand how we were running things this was a lack of communication on my side even though they were crushing it and they went in and deleted a campaign completely because they're trying to edit an ad and they got frustrated deleted it so i just walked away from that deal as soon as they started doing shit like that so but yeah so a lot of learning learning lessons here learning lessons learning lessons learning lessons so that's the key thing right here throughout this whole journey i've been consistently looking at how can i learn from each deal and do not make the same mistake again okay learn from each deal what went right what went wrong how could i improve myself yada yada yada and kept improving and during this time i was in courses like um you know the dm by jeremy haynes the fatc by kat halwell i was taking specific courses around this and consuming a lot of youtube videos so youtube videos fatc by kat halwell dm by jeremy haynes and just a lot of applying and consistently learning is the biggest thing and also too um i was getting clients purely just through like email and you know just blasting out like case studies and things like that so and a lot of referrals too as well just people know people yada yada yada okay move forward another few months and i actually went through like a three or four month period of time or didn't work with anyone okay and um you know worked i did consulting deal so like these were all like 500 a month clients and lost everything their consulting deal for 1500 and that's when i realized something okay because these smaller clients that were paying like five dollars a month local business clients they were a pain in the asses to work with okay and super needy all the stuff like that all right and also the results they weren't getting as good of results okay then i get a legion client and i charged up fifteen hundred dollars a month and we worked along the course of three months but it was a consulting deal okay and a consulting deal is different because i'm just doing a one hour call a week and telling what to do whereas you know my other clients they you know i was on full service i was working a lot like that first client i was working you know 10 hours 10 20 hours a week so that's 40 hours a month for 500 a month so i was roughly getting like 10 an hour and that's before tax as well so just to give you an idea all right this other client though 1500 a month works here for three months just purely consulting with them and i was able to help them reduce their cost per acquisition i think roughly 10 to 20 percent and that's not much but when you look at how much they're spending they're spending a couple hundred thousand dollars a month so if i just make their you know if i cut down their um advertising by 20 because we've been able to give them a better cost per acquisition that's roughly saving them 10 to 15 to 20 000 a month and ad spend just paid me fifteen hundred dollars a month okay um and i was just basically applying a lot of things i've learned like fatc back at how well which is more of a facebook ads tactics course on the demon by jeremy haynes that's more of like a business owner course so um so just to give you guys the mindset difference okay so i was using a lot of help from the ffacc by kenell to make sure that this client was crushing in that sense right there so go on um you know work with that client about three months and then just it ended because the job was done consulting those are usually shorter because you're just simply skill transfer and knowledge transfer into that person to the point where they can eventually go on their own whereas you know done for you service is more of an indefinite deal unless you you know can't provide farm in that sense right there so september um well not september um it was like january um so this all started in like 2018 not 2019 so 2018 this happens throughout 2018 um end of 2018 i close uh two new clients both info product clients um and same thing we crushed it on the facebook ad side but the offer wasn't there okay and i didn't know anything about building an offer i was just simply young hungry and if anyone shot me over and wanted to work with me as long as they had an offer and something to sell i was running facebook ads for it okay and that's where i made one of my mistakes what am i learning mistakes because just because you have something to sell does not mean it will sell and all of these clients i was working with they didn't have a proven offering and that's why we've switched over to only working with clients that are doing 50 to 100 km off for revenue um or more and also too they have been hitting that number consistently for a few months so i know they have consistent revenues at that point it's not just a quick little you know quick little like product that's trendy and so crushed right now but that's it okay so work with two info product clients um one i can't really say his name but uh one guy in the amazon automation and then another girl in the uh real estate um courses okay both really cool amazing people working for a few months but the problem was was hey nick i just built this offer i haven't tested or anything like that can we start pushing some ads to it and that's it so that was mistake number one because there was no proven credibility with that offer right there okay now now go work with those clients and then obviously those deals die out um mid 2019 and go another like three or four months no clients and then september of new of 19 2019 specifically september 18th of 2019 happens okay and what's cool about september 18 of 2019 is that i closed my first client all right not just first client my first high ticket clients these are all clients paying me anywhere from 500 1500 and a thousand dollars a month okay um so i eventually got to a point where i'm like all right i'm was questioning whether my skill set was the lack of these deals falling i was questioning whether it was the right type of clients so my new idea or idea that i was pushing was all right i'm gonna charge extremely high ticket so that way i can afford a really amazing person to run the ads and then from there i can um you know just profit on the back end all right so september of 18th september 18th of 2019 happens and what it basically is is i get an email all right get an email hey nick i saw some of your youtube videos and this time i had three youtube videos on this channel around facebook ads specifically okay um have these three videos and one of them is like big cat like 300 views okay teach people how to set up a bid cap right something i do not even do anymore at all all right and get this email and said hey nick saw your videos um i'm currently spending thirty thousand dollars a month um could we hop on a call and just see if there's any way you can help us out okay hop on this call you know they send us at like 11 o'clock at night i shoot the back an email at seven o'clock in the morning we get on a call at 10 a.m in the morning okay and we get on this call it's a women's clothing brand um or it's actually a women's jewelry brand at the time but they were just introducing clothing into the market and it was e-commerce brand that spent thirty thousand dollars with like twenty five thousand dollars in return okay very very new business and stuff like that but they had money they had a financial investment they could put into this business okay and it was an e-commerce business i've never worked with an e-commerce business at this time all right um we jump into this econ business and our well kind of future pacing a little bit so we you know i mean i say we just me um so get on the call from at 10 a.m and the sales process was completely different okay again this is the first lead i've gotten from youtube okay so they come on board and they're just like hey nick love all your stuff like can we work together i'm like what like what like there was no me selling the client the client was selling them to me uh selling them themselves to me which is where you want to be at in any sales process okay so basically basically um we have that call get to know a little bit about the business get to know a little bit about um you know what they are things like that where they want to go and then they you know kind of talked a little bit about what i do and i had no results to flex at all okay that's also something else i just want to key right here like yeah i've worked with a few clients variety of different niches that's it that's basically all i said it's been a couple hundred thousand with facebook ads and um and not not not a couple hundred thousand i think i said something roughly like you know i've spent close to six figures with facebook ads which six close to six figures ain't you know i spend that on my smallest accounts i'll be spending close to six figures in a month okay so looking at that um that call we had that call like 10 a.m and then like 3 p.m i get an email back saying hey we want to move forward and i pitched them five thousand dollars a month with the goal of finding a media buyer for twenty five hundred dollars a month and i take twenty five hundred on my profit and that's it um i ended up getting that deal got into the account everything like that and literally just watching some videos from a guy named sebastian um i don't know if it's sebastian or um oh i forgot who his name was and i just kind of set the rearranged their ad account specifically was in their top ads and that's it literally took them overnight from like a 0.8 roas to a 3x roas and we ended up scaling that business over the next 90 days to hitting their first 100k we spent thirty thousand dollars over 90 days made them back a hundred thousand dollars and ads you know just purely crush it for me they're paying us paying me 5k off and stuff like that um i took over the deal for two weeks then after two weeks i brought in a media buyer to run that's for me um and that media buyer i got from the fatc by cat how well just another person in the group i was just like hey boom let's share it um and we ended up just doing a 50 50 split of the contract i definitely wouldn't recommend that but at the time look hey it was 50 50 over 5k deal or me take the 5k deal at all or just by myself but you know get burned out immediately on that deal because i didn't really know what i was doing and working with that media buyer for a lot of experience gave me a lot of experience as well right out the gate because i was kind of like hey media buyer i'm learning from you but i'm also getting good results for the client and i'm also getting this media buyer job that perspective right there so we crush it um with that brand we go for about you know that was september december i closed my second e-com client which is a metal science brand um this particular guy came from a you know a local deal um someone i know local gave me the deal um closed my 5k and we got that client crush it over the next few months um so yeah so that's basically how it kicked off and then through from september of 2019 all the way to you know today's august 28th on a sunday um we're almost what three years in now that i've gone all done with the agency because um september 2019 uh still doing the detailing business and then january 2020 only three months later i exited that business completely so we're all in with my agency no other income streams just purely agency revenue and at the time that's also when i started doing the youtube content as well now if you don't know about the youtube content the youtube content is what gets me clients from agency i provide guys amazing knowledge amazing value here to where you know i can basically hey i'm giving you all of this that people put in courses because my goal is i want to help you guys all grow and crush it to where eventually you're at a point now where like hey nick helped me go from ten thousand dollars a month to 100k a month but now i'm too busy with the business i need to hand it to a marketing team and that's where me and my team come and play okay so that's that's my goal i mean you know i know it's an evil plan it's so horrendous all right you get free content and i'm taking advantage you because at 100k a month we're coming in i know it's terrible but that's the deal okay and we start picking up a few clients and um more e-commerce clients and i really started making my name for myself in the e-commerce side we started getting some really cool case studies and things like that and i've you know i've worked with a lot of different businesses um all the e-commerce space app clients as well legion clients and things like that and i do have to say that there is a 50 50 to each deal okay there's been some deals that you know i've had to refund four deals um since 2018 i first started working with a few clients all the way up to 2022 um over four years has refunded about four deals okay four deals um out of those four only one deal was purely due to the lack of my experience in knowledge at the time um which was i think like mid 2020 and this is where i had my first so we get these we start getting these econ clients we start crushing it for them um and what happens next is i'm starting to realize that our ad because i was purely focused on just the ad account structure and that's why i put so much emphasis in like you gotta fix this if you just focus on ad account structure because i focused purely on that and got burned every time and i was just burning wheels all 2020 because i just focused on account structure boom boom boom boom all right and it wasn't until i re-pivoted my thoughts and we're spending roughly 2020 we're spending roughly you know 50k to 100k a month at most on ads between two three clients all of 2020 um 2021 specifically um we started spending roughly around 250 to 500 000 a month um and in 2022 we've been spending 750 to a million dollars a month um in ad spend um with facebook ads specifically so so yeah so started spending a lot of money but i learned with every deal getting those four clients who had to refund only one was purely due to lack of knowledge and experience the other three were bad offers that we picked up okay um a lot of these bad offers were um hey you know came from youtube and it was like a product some drop shipper found they were successful with it for only 30 days and that's it and then they had you know other issues with things like that i can go deeper into another video if you guys want to know like you know how to really validate a product for an offering for a longer period of time but i've had like offers where it's like we're selling hoodies in going into the summer it's just like that's a bad offer right there all right with no other you know ways to to expand on revenue so things like that but you know i know i'm kind of jumping ship here but basically what happens from 2020 to what you see today 2020 june or august 28th is that you see me consistently keep uploading youtube videos i keep getting deals from youtube specifically and i'm constantly just investing in myself mentors really just a lot of mentors the facebook ad leaks ad leaks by tim bird helped me out for a period of time i don't recommend joining now because honestly what you see in ad leaks now is it's you can see the same stuff but 10 times better on twitter for free and at least like 100 bucks a month um and then i have like two mentors that you know i pay one fifteen hundred dollars a month and one a thousand dollars a month so roughly 2500 a month i spend on a monthly basis now just between those two mentors and then obviously other like just random things i'll pop up i'll see like maybe you know something i'm looking at right now it's like geek out by um nick shock referred in nashville which like a 3k investment or something like that so like there's other things i'm looking at investing in myself to build better knowledge um but also that and i can do that now um but you know during this period of time it's just being facebook groups youtube twitter reading a lot of books and stuff like that and realizing over this period of time that offer creative and copy the only things i can control because even with the most crazy and the best ad account structures i would crush it for one account it wouldn't crush it for the next account and i realized that it's not the facebook ads to like the tool there's very simple to keep the facebook ads tool very simple and then from there if you focus on what you control you can see your biggest impact and performance the amount you can spin all that good stuff right there so that's super super key and that's where we start leveraging a lot of our time now going into the team side as this goes mid 2020 i i you know fire my media buyer so i was down to literally no one um and um because one i just i built up enough knowledge and i started realizing like what she was doing it's just like okay cool like yeah i'm taking over now and that was the goal i wanted to take over because i knew what i wanted to grow into and towards the end of 2020 i get a huge rush of clients like five six clients our whole roster is like seven clients at this time period of time and um i bring on um a buddy of mine who is still working the agency now and um he hired him as a media buyer taught him everything and boom he helped me crush it um he's still working still to stay with me and you know he's actually local he's the only local person that works with me and i brought in a copywriter as well to help me out with you know just creative requests copywriting all that good stuff like that and we crashed and burned in q 2020 of um like november and december because we started to expand our team and as we expanded our team and our our client portfolio our systems is what lacked and that's the next biggest thing your systems will burn if you don't have those not dialed in so all of 2021 it started to become um a same thing we'd scale up burn scale up burn to where towards the end of 2021 i really got to lock in on my systems and at the end of 2021 i had a media buyer um or two media two media buyers a copywriter a strategist i saw a team of four people specifically oh and a visual creator so five people and the end of 2020 or beginning of 2000 um or yeah end of 2021 we also scaled up to 15 clients with any all of them paying me anywhere from 2500 a month to 5k a month okay so crushing it um and then you know going into january of 2022 again we kind of burned a little bit towards the end of december because like in our systems so all of 2022 has been really refining and building those systems and we also rebuilt the vision for the agency my original vision for the agency i wanted a large you know like a large agency with hundreds of clients but then i shifted to 10 client limit so we do not take on more than 10 clients at a time if i want to take on more than 10 clients at a time um like say for example we have 10 and i want to take on a client or fire another client to take on a better deal okay i'm very ruthless like that because um the the happiness of your clients um and like you know if you're working with nine clients that are amazing great people talk to yada yada and you have that one client that's just a pain in the ass it's better just to fire that client and put in another person that can you know be a better person because it's going to dictate the success of your team the success of your other clients and all like and stuff like that tremendously so it's very important so beginning of 2022 we jacked up our prices higher um you know roughly now we're gonna charge 75 a month just to run your ads 5k just for consulting and then we also charge a rev share now on our on our um fund for you service so so fired clients got down to 10 clients um and then now i just have a visual creator copywriter and a media buyer and i'm more of a strategist and we guys you know we're locked in um and we're approving on a monthly basis in that sense right there but we're in a tremendously better shape than we were um two years ago so and i really want to educate you guys on these crash and burns because every lesson is something to learn and my biggest thing from all of this is get your fulfillment down crush it on that side of the fulfillment side um really get that dialed into systems of process and stuff like that and then secondly just you know really hit a sell channel hard to acquire new clients if you are an agency owner um if you're you know running a business yourself then still just get your fulfillment locked down and really focusing on all your efforts on marketing and advertising your business so yeah guys hopefully this was kind of like a i know it's still like a 30 minute long video but at least digging into just my story and everything like that listen to
