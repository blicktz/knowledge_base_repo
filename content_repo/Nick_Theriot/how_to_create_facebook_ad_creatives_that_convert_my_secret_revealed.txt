yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio and today I have an exciting new video for you guys where I'm going to show you exactly how to create Facebook ads that convert literally showing you my process and system for creating creatives and exactly how to create high quality creatives it's no joke that are nothing new for you guys that I talk a lot about creatives and how important it is to have high quality creatives that convert for Facebook ads you know you can have the account structure you can have the systems in place to run the ads but you need to have a great creative to grab people's attention and today I'm going to show you exactly where I get my from and how you can replicate the same process so with that being said make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys so the first step of my creation process for my ads and stuff is first figuring out what works a lot of brands don't do this and the best way to look at what works is by looking at other brands of your competitors and stuff so let's for example let's just go to Facebook right here or before we do that let's just type in let's say for example we are a jewelry brand or maybe a makeup brand let's just type in top makeup brands 2021 and we can go right here and we'll see you know usually they'll have some stuff like five of the best 18 best makeup products and essentials of 2021 this is a really great way to find like just brands and you know like a bunch of different you know like I guess just say a source of agencies not agencies but econ business and stuff so we can look up right there um and I don't know if maybe makeup is the best route to go but let's just see so we got this I got NYX right here we got Kocheck Sephora collection we got Kiss My Crown Majestic you know we got these few different makeup brands and different makeup packages and stuff so we kind of got a general idea of just different brands and stuff so we can do is we now go on Facebook and go search Facebook and we can type in NYX there we go so we got our our store right here our Facebook page and now when you're actually on the Facebook page you know you find the Facebook page right there so it's maybe one of your competitors or stuff like that you can go on their Facebook page right here and you can go right here to page transparency right here at page transparency you can actually see something called this page is currently running ads so you want to find the pages that are running ads right now and you want to hit go to ad library and then you can start to see what ads these potential competitors or competitors are currently using now the reason why you do this is so that way you can get an idea of what creatives work so if I were a makeup brand I would want to look through all of these or if say if I'm running ads for a makeup brand I want to look through all these and get a general idea of what works so let's go ahead let's just click on one of these right here okay cool looks like some type of play-in thing okay cool cool so it's kind of showing off some other stuff all right cool so let's go ahead and let's just see let's just do another one uh let's just do this one right here this is just a Sephora collection right there so let's go back to Facebook I'm gonna leave that ad library on right there let's go right here let's just type in go check Sephora's collection all right so we can just click on either Sephora or coach for that particular one because it's a it's like a brand for up together but we go right here transparency and let's do let's see if they're running ads go to ad library I didn't even see it yeah page currently running ads so we can take a look and see what type of ads they're running for their makeup brand so you can start getting a general idea of what type of creatives work and you can see right here let's just say for example this is a creative we wanted to do I'm just gonna go ahead and I'm gonna screenshot that you can also look at the ad copy you can also look at the headline the button you know stuff like that shop now you know some of the call to actions they use some of the pain points the benefits and really how they position their products you know are they leading with testimonials are they reading we're leading reviews what are they leading with when it comes down to you know paid advertising how are they getting their success with it so once we get all this now it becomes a easy point we literally just take this and go create ads like this you know go ahead and go to your studio go send your product out to influencers send them examples of what you're looking for so for example if you don't have a studio or creative studio and you don't have a photographer for this an easy way to get creative is simply send it out to people for free on instagram facebook that's influencers with specific instructions on the type of content you want so show them examples of what you want send it to them they take the content for you they send it back to you and now you have pictures and stuff and content to use now there's two different ways routes you can go you can go with getting a team to do these creatives for you or you can get a you know free software or some software and try to do your best so I've actually done both you know when I was first starting my agency I knew photoshop I knew after effects and only had one or two clients so I could easily go ahead and create these creatives for me so you can use a service like canva you can literally just type in canva pro you know go to canva canva you can upgrade to a pro subscription it's like ten dollars a month and you can literally just choose some of their templates edit the text edit the colors and stuff like that and yeah works great for people at small scales but when you're an agency owner or you're a you know e-commerce business owner and you're spending a lot of money you're moving fast and you do not want to spend the time to do that you want to be able to simply tell someone hey I want this type of creative here's my product go ahead create have fun here's my folder of content on my instagram or my google drive folder to where you can go ahead and just replicate that you want people that can think for themselves and go out there and take action on it and people that do this on a day-to-day basis you do not want to be working with someone that's a graphic designer but specializes in you know photo green touch-ups and stuff like that you want someone that specializes in advertising graphic designing in advertising video design in order to have some really great ads so where can you find something like this you can obviously go to freelancer.com you can go to fiverr.com and you can purchase these little gigs but then you know the next process right there is you got to find which one works you know you got to find you you might work with different graphic designers on and off and the credibility and stuff like that is kind of all in it you know iffy and then you know two you have to pay per project now let me get this straight if you just have one project you get it done you're done with it but if you're someone like us that stresses creative and consistently pushing new creative out every week you really need to work with someone that can repeat over and over with and that is why we teamed up with no limit creatives for this exact process no limit creatives has been doing all of our creative design video and photo for all of our clients for the last nearly six months and it's been an absolute game changer for our agency i literally just get a consistent source of creative design video design i can use in my ads and stuff plus these people work with advertising they literally do advertising on a day-to-day basis that's all they work with is brands looking to outsource their their creative design their video design so they know what kind of pops out they can kind of touch things up because they have that advertising background so they make an absolutely incredible asset for my agency and especially you know for me not having to pay a you know a graphic designer or video designer wants to charge me three to five k a month there's just no budget for that inside my agency i want to keep costs down and they just they work amazing because they literally have unlimited creatives you know packages to where i literally just pay one fee per month pay a flat fee and i get an amazing consistent you know just stream of creative content for my clients to use my advertising campaigns it helps decrease you know cost per purchase because we are our click-through rates through the roof because these graphics just pop out they work really well and then you know at same times we get some really good cpms and all that stuff so just an absolutely incredible asset so i want to show you guys a little bit more about no limit creatives for this video and i've actually yeah i've teamed up with the right thing i'm gonna show them some some some some of the ways we can actually go through this so for example let's say you go ahead you got your creatives and stuff you took some screenshots and stuff like that you know what you want you got the text and written down of exactly what you want for your potential um advert and stuff you can go literally to no limit creatives right here sign up um you know there's there's different packages so there's a monthly 449 for just graphics 549 for just video 899 for graphics and video that is what i use for my agency because again we use all we do a lot of creative so because of this we need the bandwidth of literally just as much and i've actually teamed up with them to offer a discount code for you guys specifically for my youtube subscribers literally just type in n t 50 n t 50 and you'll literally get 50 off at checkout for any one of these packages for your first month so your first month gets 50 off then it goes back to your standard billing so i'll show you for example right here um like i said i do the graphics and video one amazing easy to set up and you just type in n t 50 and hit apply so there you go you get 50 off discount on your first month like i said first month purchase now what happens after this what do you do how do you work with them and everything and they actually make it super convenient with using asana i use asana for all of my team management so i use it for my client management and team management for you know separating tasks and stuff like that across different things but it also works really well because they integrate with asana so they use asana for their service and you literally just come in here and so for example this is your dashboard and like for example i just did this um this video request a few weeks ago and you know literally just i listed in what i wanted um i shot a loom video to instruct them of how i want the video done so you can use loom and just like literally do a quick little short two minute video of exactly the instructions to do with this video or this graphic and exit remember to do video and graphics and then give them instructions i sent them over the asset folder where everything is housed at and yeah so super simple with that um i submitted it over and they put one of their their video designers on it all of their graphic designers and video designers are well vetted um i actually know the guy personally the ceo or the owner and he's an amazing guy and he really does goes his way to really hire only the best of the best for his team and i mean his team is probably composed of well over 100 people designers and stuff like that again that's specialized with graphic and video design for paid advertising at scale so you got the right team and all that so yeah super cool let me show you a little bit more so let's say for example you want to see a little bit more of their portfolio and stuff maybe you want some examples and stuff they literally give you a google drive folder all kinds of different examples so they do anything pretty much that involves like various product like some advertising maybe even some t-shirts and merchandise social media ads illustrations infographics and they literally give you a full let's just say for example postcards give you a full portfolio of you know variety of just like different creatives they've all created in the past and i made some actually some super compelling flyers for my service so when i'm presenting to people on zoom call about what we do and how we help them i had like this little boring google doc set up and i was like you know i need to transform this i literally just send it over to one of our team members with just a little bit of direction and they transform this is really amazing masterpiece that just blows all my clients away or prospects away when i show them you know here's what we offer and have this really nice well-developed document for them so yeah this is just super super helpful this is proof this is literally all my graphics stuff these are all the graphics projects that i've done with them um this is all the video projects i've done with them so this is proof i'm not just trying to sell you guys short i love my subscribers very much and i'm very highly you know respect the trust and stuff i've built up with you guys and i would never want to position a service in front of you guys that i personally do not use um but i do get a lot of questions of how i do my creatives how i what's my process for it and stuff starts off first research and then figuring out exactly how you want to replicate that you know getting the content done and then all right are we going to do this in-house use a tool like canva which is free not really going to go into that because i didn't really do much of it but i i personally touched on it once or twice just to see how well i can create some graphics with it and it works super well it's just i'd rather spend my time on strategy crafting offers stuff that's gonna make my clients a lot of money versus going ahead and sitting there and trying to play in photoshop all day so highly recommend service for you guys like i said if you click the link below and type in n t 50 you literally get 50 off your first month try it for a month cancel if you don't like it so you literally it's uh there's no long-term contracts or anything like that you can try for 30 days you know you obviously got to pay for it's not a free trial or anything but um you can go 30 days with it don't like it you can cancel it but trust me it's been an absolute amazing part of my agency and the success we've generated paid advertising by having a great creative team that knows paid advertising creation and um it just flows really well for our team we're not trying to hire freelancers offline online and it works really well so highly recommend this guys if you do try it out please drop a comment below in the
