here are the facebook ads that you should avoid at all costs if you want to hit a million dollars a month with facebook ads we've helped multiple brands now scale to a million dollars plus them off with facebook ads and here are the exact ads that we avoid at all costs when we're trying to up client scale to these levels and the first one's always going to be ripped content we had a client one time come on board with us and they had ripped content to find their first winning ad and a lot of them scale pretty quickly now to be fair though they got shut down almost like a week after we got started with them why because the ripped content is kind of like a false hope you find a winner but as soon as you find a winner it's only a very short period of time before you get shut down and it's it's like why even build a foundation of finding a winning ad with ripped content if you're gonna get shut down quickly it just allows you to build a very weak foundation so i'm highly against ripped content i think it's unethical i think it also to build you a false hope of getting things started then getting shut down right away and it just goes against everything i believe in so i'm very against ripped content next thing is competitor ads a lot of people like literally like to go one-on-one copy their competitor ads because it's working for the competitor and then they launch and they figure out like why isn't nothing working well facebook's not going to prioritize you if you're running the exact same ads as your competitor because your competitor is just beating you in all the different auction placements and if your competitor ads also look better and already been running longer people have better trust with your competitor ads than you so your ads are just not going to work and likely you'll also see higher cpms because your competitors are beating you in all the ad placements so i am a fan of copying competitor ads but only if it's done correctly so let's say for example we sell an iphone case and your competitors sell an iphone case and all your competitors are highlighting the fact that hey our iphone case will survive a fall from like five foot ten feet something like that five to ten feet and they have a lot of videos dropping it from like a desk or like maybe a ladder well what i want to do is i want to go take it to the next level if they're dropping it from five to ten feet i want to go drop it from 50 to 100 feet i want to drop it off a building i'm gonna have a car roll over it i want to go extreme examples with it to where i beat the competitor in terms of visuals that's how i do it so i want to replicate what the competitor's doing but i want to show extreme examples that take it to the next level and that's how i beat a competitor's ads next thing is feature ads and this is where you literally take a product and you only showcase the features so here's a great example right here where like literally this ad right here only highlights features for this product but it doesn't highlight any benefits and yes we could argue well this is for a lower stage of the funnel but if we're trying to hit a million dollars a month we need ads that resonate with a large amount of people that really scale and take off and for something like that we need an ad like this where we highlight a benefit or a desire that people have and we kind of highlight those benefits from there that's something that works substantially better because we resonate with significantly more people and we actually understand what this product does now the next one is professional content i've seen so many people go spend like 20 30 40 000 dollars from his professional like video shoot on an ad and then like completely just get ripped off like i know this one particular person has been like 30 000 with like one of those high-end like professional ad agencies that shoot like tv commercials and stuff like that they spent like 30 000 on four video ads and none of them took off none of them worked nothing like that so i do not recommend professional content until you have a proven ad concept so you know spend some money on like ugc for example that's a great a great place to where it mitigates risk you can find some amazing winning ads with ugc and then from there once you find some solid ads that are scaling and spending a couple hundred thousand dollars then you can go take that that exact example and then go shoot content that's professionally great example is the sydney sweeney ad that i think dr squatch recently did where they already knew through like ugc content and some of their amateur content they shot they already know the exact things that their audience resonates with and the exact things they need to say that's going to get people to convert they found that through cheap content then they went to like sydney sweeney for example that probably charged a couple hundred thousand dollars for that shoot right there and then they just had her say the same thing because they knew that was the key things that worked and the only new thing they're adding to that ad is leveraging sydney sweeney now next one is iterations and i see so many people that will literally test their facebook ads like this here's our product and our tests are very basic red photo green photo should we do a video or should we do a photo and i just want to kick these people in the face to be fair we want to focus on big swings in our creative testing and this is where we take our product then we look at different desires problems or symptoms across the marketplace around this product then we map out the different customer avatars for each of these desires problems and symptoms then we go and map out the different things they've tried and fell that with each at customer avatar then we start mapping out the different hooks we can use for each one of those these are big swings from each other because we're testing very different positionings and things like that and this is where we can really start to find our winning positioning for a product and we do bigger swings with every test we do we do more positioning tests with every single one and this allows us to find winning ads for accounts extremely fast because we're not too focused like we're like too narrow this is how like people are testing we're like we're testing like from one side to the other side but it's it's it's different ways of how we're approaching the market which allows us to find a lot more winners because we're not too narrow and just doing the same thing over and over and over and that's usually where i find a lot of people lack and a lot of people fell out with their facebook advertising now if you want us to come
