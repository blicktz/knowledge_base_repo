to really see if a creative is worth continuing to pursue of testing and maybe even testing new variations and stuff so this will be exciting new video for you guys who who want to improve your row as

and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday so let's get started guys so how does creatives affect your row as and in fact it's actually probably one of the biggest key pieces so for example us our our agency we spend 80 of our time looking at marketing psychology how can we incorporate better marketing materials inside of our campaigns and only 20 of our time maybe even 10 of our time is actually spent in the ads manager you see the ads manager i'm only in there maybe 10 minutes a day and then the other percentage of my day is looking at new creatives we can create new marketing psychology we can implement refining our offer and a lot of that we also look at creative and how we can create better creatives because we know at our core creative is everything when it comes to facebook ads just like russell brunton has is you're one funnel away from you know making your first million you're one funnel away from quitting your job and starting an online business and selling digital products you're one funnel away from you know retiring you're one fun you're one creative away from drastically blowing up your results you're one creative away from improving your return on ads men you're one funnel one creative away from hitting your first six figures or even seven figures with shopify i've personally scaled up a store to seven figures where we literally used one creative if it wasn't for that one specific creative we would not be here right now so um it's pretty crazy of the importance of creative and a lot of people overlook it even for me i neglected it creative up until this day as i've realized what was the biggest key points of my advertising history it was always creative so i've built out now a team that specifically focused on this to repeat those successful action of new creative every single week we drop three new creatives every single week through my team so now we have a full dedicated powerhouse to consistently do this and i really want to show you guys just some key stats of how important new creative is and how important and how a creative piece can completely change in ad account so we flip over to my screen right here i got this little kind of numbers chart and this is literally can be replicated to over a hundred different pieces of creatives and exactly what we look at at every time we use a piece of creative so how a creative effects your return on ad spin and and just exactly the key numbers to look at so first off let's for we have two scenarios right here so this can be two different ads we add one add two add one's a bad performing creative add two's a good performing creative and which why does it a bad and why is it a good so first off let's say for example we need to look at the amount spent so if you're comparing two creatives or a creative to compare it to everything else we need to make sure it has some spin to it i recommend at least two extra average cost per purchase so if you're about to look at a creative and the performance of it don't look at it at five dollars spent look at it hey we average cost per purchase a twenty dollar cost per purchase so let's look at it at forty dollars spend so once you spend at least two extra average cost per purchase and you also too need to make sure that creative has been tested on a proven audience an audience that's already worked extremely well uh for your ad account because you don't want to test creatives with with bad audiences because then it could actually be the audience that's the problem so let's assume those variables right here these are two creatives they're both at the same amount spent and they've also been tested on the same exact audience so we know exactly what's going on here so two ads first one let's look at scenario one you spend a hundred bucks on this ad you reach 10 000 people and 0.5 percent of people click on your ad so this is that click through rate percent in the columns of facebook ads i like to look at unique outbound click the rate percent because that's the unique people clicking on your ad percentage of people clicking on your ad to go to your website this is clicking on the call to action button this is clicking on the link and that's what this percentage of people that's clicking on your ad is doing right here so we have 0.5 percent of people less than one percent of people out of the ten thousand people click on this ad this ad shown in front of ten thousand people point five percent actually click on your ad so that's roughly comes out to 50 people 50 people out this ten thousand people reach click on your ad so that means 50 people come to your website so out of that 50 people that come to your website let's just say you have a conversion rate of two percent on your shopify store so two percent of that 50 people that come to your store convert and that's one person one person converts on your website after spending a hundred dollars reaching ten thousand people point five percent click through rate percent 50 people come to your website two percent convert one person turns into a paying customer let's just say you have an average order value of a hundred dollars your revenue is a hundred bucks and your return on ad spend is one you spend a hundred bucks and you made a hundred bucks super simple the only key factor here is that point five percent of people that click on your ad so let's look at scenario two a good performing creative you spend a hundred bucks you reach ten thousand people same thing so this might be like eleven thousand people this might be like nine thousand people you know they're roughly in the same you know group of reach if you're comparing two creatives in your ad account and two percent of people so literally four times the amount of people that clicked on your first ad two percent of people click on this ad and we see this all the time we we have a creative right now that's performing at a six x percent a six percent of people are clicking through on this at a top of funnel insane we were doing point five point three percent of people clicking on the existing ads now we're at a six percent so we've almost 12 x their percentage of people that's click on their ad so it's very common that this happens and it's all about the right type of creative so two percent of people so ten thousand people we reach two percent of people click on it two hundred people come to your website now we've quadrupled the amount of people from the existing ad to come to your website now two percent people convert just like you've done before and now two percent of two hundred is four four people place an order on your website now literally all you do is change to creative that is it four people click on your uh place an order you have an average order value of a hundred dollars same as before now our revenue is four hundred dollars we spent a hundred bucks to make four hundred dollars our return on ad spend is four x so this is the importance of having good creatives literally the only thing we changed here is the creative and we had a bad performing creative of 0.5 and now we have a good performing creative of two and this is exactly how creative effects your return on ad spend and when you're running ads and testing ads you know like i said we have the same account structure we use for all of our e-commerce clients because it it like supports a creative testing strategy and it supports an audience testing strategy so that way we always have a group of best performing creatives we always have a group of best performing audiences and we keep testing new creative every single week every single week we test three new ads and then also too this could just be a different headline this could be a different piece of copy so that's why we test copy headline and creative all the time because these three key variables have a big play in it now just a word of advice 66 percent of the result increases we see is just by swapping out the creative the other 33 of result increases we see is by swapping out copy and headline so if your copy is pretty okay and your headline is pretty okay you can have amazing creative and perform exactly like this if you have a really bad creative amazing copy and amazing headline you're still going to convert like this creative is like the 80 20 roll 80 percent of facebook results come from creative the other 20 comes from copy and headline and that's assuming you have some okay copy some copy that speaks to your ideal audience a headline that grabs attention but you know that can be written pretty well but creative is the main play right there creative is really going to drive your results with this right here so this is just an example of how creative affects your return on adspin and if you are an e-commerce business owner if you're a shopify owner and you want to add an additional fifty thousand to
