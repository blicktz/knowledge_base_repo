I have done over a hundred million dollars in online revenue with Facebook ads for my clients and we create anywhere between 20 to 40 new ad creatives every single week with Facebook ads for over the last four years and I want to show you the exact strategy that we use to consistently create ads on a weekly basis even when we felt like we've exhausted all of the different ideas that we've used in the past so let's dive into the video so when you're producing a lot of ads on a weekly basis it obviously comes down to one the number of ideas you can produce and two not being boring and not being repetitive so this is the process we follow right here and let me just zoom this in a little bit more for you guys there we go so everything starts off with research and research can be going look at competitors ads going look at competitor reviews going look at competitors like reviews on their website but also to like YouTube video reviews TikToks things like that then the next thing is our brand our brand is going to be more like our Facebook ad comments our reviews and that's probably like the main two places that we get like research and like ideation from for example one account we've been able to scale them from 1k a day and now it's been to 10k a and that's been simply because we found a comment that said like on one of our ads we had a girl tag another girl and said girls night soon so we started creating some ads around girls night and it literally allowed us to scale from 1k a day to 10k a day because of how good that particular ad worked so that's another round right there then there's just content and the reason why i say content is because this is more of like for example i just got off a student call with one of my students and they were doing some research so like i literally just went on TikTok and you know they sell a particular gym supplement so i just went on TikTok and i literally just typed in gym and just consumed different types of gym content that gave me ideas of you know just kind of like what trends what do people desire what are some products people use who do people want to become all those good things right there and i do this literally as whole process every week for every client to come up with new ideas and new ways to create ad creatives for our clients so all of this happens and then we start to get ids i said ids oh my god ideas ideas once they're getting some ideas then from there we're just going to refine some of those so like as i'm doing my research i'm sitting down and i'm just writing i'm writing down different things that grab my attention different patterns i noticed different things that people say that grab my attention different hooks that are already working for other people i'm writing all this down to have a big list of stuff then i'll start getting a little bit clearer on who we're writing to so you know if i consume a lot of gym content and i just kind of notice that like hey like you know females 20 to 30 years old is who we want to write to what do they want they want to get a lean muscular physique in the gym and they want to feel empowered by it and then how does our product help them so like let's say for selling a pre-workout it allows you to push yourself harder in the gym it allows you to get those last extra couple reps in gives you a bigger pump gives you more energy going into a workout so those are the types of things i'm looking at then i'll start writing hooks so you know these is not really like any i would say like like there's no structure to this it's more just writing down different hooks that's going to grab the attention of these people right here so if we're going after females we want to lean muscular physique you know one of them could be like pov you stopped doing i don't know cardio and started doing strength training and now you have the lean muscular physique that you've always wanted again you're just writing down different hooks you want to write about 20 to 30 hooks and we'll use two two different i guess you could say like inspiration we'll look at like one just writing down the hooks but then two we'll look at like templates and previous winners as well so um you know like i have a i have a list of all of the previous winning ads that we've had for all of our different clients and i'll pull some hooks from those and then also templates these are just things that are like you know three reasons why v how to you know measure the size of the claim just different hook templates i have and i'm gonna use all this and we'll write about 20 to 30 different hooks minimum 20 max whatever you want but just minimum 20 and from here i'm gonna look at okay out of all these hooks i just wrote you know the first pre-workout for women who want to lean muscular physique that's one route right there girls here's how you can get the lean muscular physique you've always wanted because again that's what they want and then we're gonna educate them on their products how it does it then i want to pick three or four to just grab my attention so i'm going through that whole list of hooks and stuff like that and i'm gonna pick about three or four to just grab my attention and what i want to look at out of these three or four is i want to see which ones call up my ideal audience which one also make me curious to want to know more and which one implies a benefit so gym girlies who want a lean muscular physique you need to try this all right so i call them ideal audience that makes me curious to want to know more and it also implies a benefit that if i look at this ad it's going to show me how i get a lean muscular physique if your three or four does not have that then you need to rewrite them to make sure they fit these three i see a lot of people miss out on this one and imply to benefit this can be a couple different routes so like if they're dealing with a problem it could be implying that they watch this that the benefit is that problem being solved so just make sure we're aware of that right there and then it has to speak to our ideal audience so if we want to go after gym girlies i don't want to say something like you know smash a pr and get a gnarly pump into the gym because for the most part that's kind of more gym bro and at least from my perspective on the marketplace i haven't seen too many gym girlies talk about that talk like that so i want to make sure that it fits my audience tone of voice kind of how they speak i want to make sure that it makes them curious and also too it implies that they they gain something by looking at this ad so then i'll finally have a final hook i'm going to have one final hook all right this is going to be you know your hook and from here we're going to decide what type of ad do we want do you want it in photo or a video so you know girls who want a lean muscular physique you need to try this or gym girlies who want a lean muscular physique you need to try this so how do we want to do that type of that do we want to do a photo or do we want a video either one is technically correct it just depends what else we have so if i say like gym girlies who want a lean muscular physique you need to try this i could do a photo i could show a girl that's lean and muscular for example working out and then i could link them to like an avatorial for example and go long form avatorial and really showcase like take them through that sales process i can also do that through a video i can you know do a 20 30 second video of a girl saying that hook and then kind of going into like what they need to try to get that particular physique so either one's technically correct we just need to pick one because if i write a script it's going to be i'm writing it with the intentions of it being a video i'm writing it intentions of being a photo and this is also why like when we do a new ad test we only do three photos or three videos in a dct because when i write that ad script it only fits one and i can't stand people like well nick why don't you do a two photos in one video in the dct and i'm like because when i write it and have my team produce it it's structured and written to fit a photo or video i can't take a 30 freaking line script and put that in a photo so it's going to either be written for a video or it's going to be written for a photo pick one all right then after that we're going to look at our tone of voice so it's going to be more of a narrative to where like you know it's kind of almost like most typical commercials you see that where it's just someone talking over i'd say like 90% of ads like that or if it's first person point of view hey today i am trying celsius celsius has been amazing for my work blah blah blah and you're kind of doing like that first person point of view or is it narrative celsius the ultimate game changer of modern business this is the ultimate energy drink that fitness junkies love so again what's the tone of voice how do we want to write this then what i'll do is i'll start writing my rough draft so now that i have all right the hook which is you know gym girlies gym girlies who want to lean muscular physique you need to try this i want to do a video and i'll do i don't know first person point of view for example so now that i have a hook and i know it's gonna be a video it's gonna be a first person point of view so now i can start writing my rough draft the rough draft will look like shit and i want you to be okay with that i intentionally want your rough draft to look like shit that's perfectly okay because we're gonna be rewriting this like four or five times more and the rough draft is just simply to take what's in here and get it on paper even if it looks horrible and even though it looks like like it's just the most hideous thing you've ever seen in your life it's okay because it's a rough draft so i'm gonna go ahead and write my script out now gym girlies who want to look like lean who want lean and muscular physique you need to try this i've tried a lot of different supplements pre-workouts proteins and stuff like that but it's only made me bulky and uncomfortable and nothing really seemed to work that's when i discovered x factor which is a pre-workout that's all natural and leverages mushrooms to get you the most insane pumps in the gym you need to try x factor today here's the code all right cool i wrote down my rough draft and that was literally just me improvising on the spot right there that was all improv there so i wrote my rough draft now we're gonna do a strategic rewrite so you spent probably about 30 minutes to an hour writing your rough draft you spent probably about four hours on writing the hooks you probably spent about eight hours on research so just put that in perspective right there about eight hours for research i'd say probably about an hour to two hours for hooks and then about 30 minutes to an hour for the rough draft now we're gonna do the strategic rewrite which will the rest will probably take about three hours to do so we're gonna do a rewrite so take that whole script just wrote now we're gonna ask ourselves a couple questions does it convey a clear and concise message i've seen some ads before where it looks like abstract art there's so many things going on in the ad that there does not send off a clear message now again messaging is not the body copy or the headline in the facebook ad or even the script it's the message people receive in their head after looking at that ad if i look at a 30 second ad what is the takeaway that's gonna be sent to my head that's the message that we're trying to send to people with our ad now next thing does it show undeniable proof the desire is being satisfied so the desire is what people want people want a lean and muscular physique we want to showcase as many different ways as possible how our product helps them get a lean and muscular physique so one of them is just showing how it does it so how does this product help you next one is when does this product help you so you know do you take it before your workout do you take it after your workout you take in the morning at night when does this product help you achieve that desire next one is where where does this product help you achieve that desire so is it in the gym let's give you harder pumps in gym next one is like compare and contrast superiority so you know for example like if you know like there's other supplements around this particular supplement how is ours better to help them achieve that particular desire right there so you know give you an example like the desire for energy going into the gym you know a lot of people took pre-workouts and stuff like that but then like a lot of people started hating the the jitters and stuff like that so someone created a pre-workout without the jitters so our pre-workout we're going to showcase people working out without the jitters the other one is like testimonials of oh my god i took this product and i'm going to lean and muscular physique it's so amazing so again just showcasing all the different ways possible that this product helps people achieve that main desire of a lean muscular physique and we want to show as many different ways possible because this helps build undeniable proof that our product is the best on the marketplace next one is does it address any objections people have so if there's any objections that people have to this product we want to talk about in the strategic rewrite and the lastly is you want to add a little bit of logic if you make any big claims but don't make too much logic so you know if you make a big claim and you you feel like all right my audience has doesn't believe that or people question in the comments then we want to provide just a little bit of logic behind that so we'll do a full strategic rewrite we'll take that rough draft that terrible thing that hideous looking thing we just rewrote or we just wrote down and we're going to start molding it into something that's better all right so next one is we're going to rewrite it for style so we just did the strategic rewrite we added some more proof we made it clear and concise we addressed some objections we also added a little bit of logic there now we're going to rewrite for style style is where okay you started to clean it up you start to mold it into something now we're going to start cleaning it up a little bit more make it a little bit more presentable if that makes sense and here we're going to make sure it's easy to read it's not boring and we want to add in a couple descriptive big impact words so like this this pre-workout it'll help you get some amazing pumps in the gym so what's some other words besides amazing you know this pre-workout help you get some gnarly pumps in the gym this pre-workout will help you smash through your workouts this pre-workout will have your head exploding with the amount of energy you'll have again just making examples here so this is your next thing so now after you do this rewrite for style it should be easy to read it should not be boring and it should have a couple big impact descriptive words in there it helps increase that selling power right there now you want to rewrite for flow now flow is essentially just the way i'm talking and communicating to you guys on this video it's easy for me just to talk i'm not really kind of like stuttering on some things it's just it's flowing well this video and this is what you want to make your ad look like your ad should flow off it should seem natural it should seem like a conversation so that's what you want to do and then also do you want to cut any fat if you feel like there's a couple areas that just kind of get boring or just kind of long-winded that doesn't really make sense i'm going to cut that shit out now you'll have your final script and you want to go through this whole script and then you know you want to go and start adding visuals to go with each line so if like line one is uh gym girlies here's how you can get a lean muscular physique so that's line one what is a visual to articulate that so gym girlies here's how you can get a lean muscular physique what type of visuals could we go with that visually articulates that hook right there just think about it for a second if you had that hook what are different ways we could visually articulate that hook right there you take a couple comments and guess drop a guess in the comments below you know we're off the back we could showcase a girl working out that has a lean muscular physique we could showcase um maybe a girl that's out in the public and stuff like that walking around and like i don't know like a sportswear like maybe she's just leaving leaving the gym for example that's another way we could show maybe a case of close-up of a particular body part which i think might be illegal on facebook not not illegal but just like against facebook's thing so maybe just like a bicep pump i think that works better so you know there's certain things we can do with that so that's that's that's an example right there of a visual so i'll go through each line gym girlies here's how you get a lean muscular and physique i've tried literally every supplement under the sun okay then we can showcase a visual a couple visuals of her for that line right there i've tried every supplement under the sun i could try showcasing a couple different visuals of like her trying like different pre-workouts different green powders and stuff like that that's line two then line three but nothing ever seemed to work so maybe just her just on her desk just like eh so you see every line we break it up the script into every line and then we add a visual articulation how can we visually articulate that and then we make notes around that then we send it off to our visual creator and our visual creator is simply the person that takes that script takes those visual scenes and makes the final video they might send this to a person to film an as ugc they might take this and use stock footage that we already have or old ugc footage we already have and mold it all together they're the person that takes all this and makes that together but yeah so this is literally
