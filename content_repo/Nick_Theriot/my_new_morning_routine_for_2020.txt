I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's up guys? Currently right now setting my alarm It is, whew, it is 11 o'clock at night And guess what? There you go, 5.30am So, like I said, you need to tighten up the schedule So I want to take you guys tomorrow actually With me just throughout the day and stuff Me kind of working towards fine-tuning my schedule I know I have about an hour to two hours tomorrow That's going to be like a clusterfuck essentially But kind of vlog and document everything that goes on throughout the day So, let's see you guys in the morning Where we're going to go hit a nice little chest workout Look guys, we made it What is happening Time to go hit up a chest day Not going to lie, it was a little difficult to wake up this morning But, made it And let's head out to the gym guys Please don't hate me, please don't hate me Please don't hate me, please don't hate me There's nothing like taking pre-workouts at 6 o'clock in the morning Jamming and heading to the gym I'm not going to lie guys, it feels pretty good to get back into this early morning routine When I first got into entrepreneurship and stuff and dropped out of college It went all in essentially I would wake up at 4.15pm every day And stop that to get more sleep and stuff More rest, etc But, it feels good to dip back in for a little while I'm not going to say I'm going to do this forever Or at least for the next few months It's just right now I have a lot of work with my agency and everything And I need the extra time And I really enjoy it So, I'm going to see you guys at the gym I am extremely sore in my legs today So, I know even though I'm going to chest I feel like it's just going to be a pain And then we have 20 minutes of cardio after I'm on the Stairmaster And it should be a good little workout So, see you guys at the gym Alright guys Just leaving the gym now Finished up cardio 20 minutes of cardio I did do like a few other chest movements too That y'all didn't see But, I'm currently dead right now I don't know if y'all can see Sweat I am soaked I am drained I've been fasted for like 12 hours now But, we head home And, kind of get ready for the day Get some work started Quick update for you guys I remember I got the ceramic coating And, I have yet to clean it Since I got it It rained a few times on it And it looks absolutely amazing Alright guys, I am about to jump into a cold shower Yes, cold shower Let me just say I'm absolutely starving Right now, I am still currently like fasted But, before that But, before that we are going to jump into a A meditation The one that I am doing is the Dr.

Joe Dispenza It's on iTunes It's like 10 bucks Purchased it 6 months ago Absolutely love it Very powerful meditation Highly recommend it So, I am going to jump into that And, after that We will finally eat And, start getting to work Meditation for me is something that is very close to me It's something that I never thought in a million years I would do it Essentially, I always thought it was like for the hippies Birds, etc You know, it's just something that I never had an attraction to And never had any reason to do it But, now it's something super crucial to me My mental wellness You go to the gym to train your muscles and stuff Meditation is essentially going to the gym to train your mind Some major benefits of my life And, you know, including stress relief Deeper focus And, also a deeper sense of happiness When it's literally just Like, if I have nothing in my attention zone I'm just, I'm happy Like, you know It's something that's super close to me Especially if you find a meditation actually pretty cool You go through something that I highly recommend Everyone who watches this channel to start And, you will see some major differences in your life But, you have to do it for a long period of time I've been doing it for six months now My demons drive me down All the pressure keeps me in the ground If I can just get my words out I can kill them with every style So let's break down, now, with our voices Watch them all when we roll like thunder We are bound to the voiceless While I'm letting all my food cook I am downing my greens Gotta make sure you get your greens in everyday Your vitamins in, all that good stuff Especially everything I take It's kinda like for mental and overall Mental performance and overall health and focus So while I was getting your greens in and stuff It gives me a really good start to the day It gets me kinda waking back up After the gym will kinda crash a little bit Get me waking back up And then we are about to dive into some eggs And oatmeal for meal number one Alright, so here's meal number one Two packets of oatmeal Three eggs A glass of water I'm gonna consume this And then after I eat this I'll uh, we get some guys We get you guys updated on everything else With work And we also got a few errands to run this morning And I'm also kinda running behind a little bit today I'm running about 30 minutes behind I like to start work at 9 o'clock And the train out is 9.09 So I'm running about 30 minutes behind After I eat this and journal But I think that's also another thing with your routine You need to be able to not like let that kill your mood Oh look I'm behind Oh well fuck today It's it's you know it's a waste I'm behind on my schedule Fuck it You know whatever I just wanna play video and stress today Cause I wasn't good on my schedule I wasn't good on my schedule You need to be able to Okay look I'm running a little behind What's some tasks can I eliminate And do maybe tomorrow And focus on the main priorities today So But I made this And then uh We get back to work Start getting everything set up Do our journal And I said we have a few errands to go run So I'm gonna take you guys with me I'll do it in that Maybe not completely So I'm just I'm just gonna film stuff That's the goal I'm just gonna film You know I'm just gonna film the agency One day I might be at the gym And Then I kinda like got a little deeper with me And that's literally what I did for the past two months It was just that Just create content I got a little deeper So A few things that's happened with YouTube is One You know I'm really inspired by Christian Guzman I love his like summer shredding series And that's kind of where I got some of the inspiration So But I kinda looked at it I was like okay look I know I can provide value to people with working out But that's not my lane essentially You know My lane's the more online business itch So now I'm kind of creating a little bit more online content Around like business stuff I guess I'm trying to really reach the people that are in that age At 18, 23 year olds That are just starting to learn to make money online niche And try to you know Teach them Learn from my mistakes etc You know Help them kind of progress a little bit But also too Just promoting a good You know good work ethic Promoting good habits So really it's just Digging my mind Giving people I don't really have like a A completely tight audience yet So But yeah it's just fine tuning I know one thing that I'm doubling down on Is producing a little bit more of Is Facebook ads content And marketing content Because I have been getting a lot of leads from my agency From my YouTube videos Because essentially the YouTube video Put you as an authority So when you hop on a call with Miss the easiest freaking clothes ever So Alright guys Just finished up the podcast And I gotta say That was probably one of the best Podcasts I've ever done This is the guy His name is Ali Thorpe Sorry Ali if I'm saying your last name wrong But He has his channel and everything Gotta say You can definitely tell He was very good He had some very good questions and stuff I'm gonna see what I can do If I can upload That podcast To my YouTube channel Or not Or just let you guys know When it's up And I'll send you guys that way But Really amazing Had a really good time on it Now I need to actually eat my regular food Get a little break in I say a little break I'm gonna do like a reading break While my food Um Heats up and stuff And then Cause I need some food Food in me You know what I mean You know what I mean So But Yeah Usually what I'll do is I'll do a Work block Second work block Between 1-5 So first work block 9-12 Second one 1-5 And Purely working on the agency and stuff So Hope you guys Are like Taking notes and stuff And that gives me a full 8 hours a week Kinda like dedicated 7 hours a day So 35 hours a week Plus a little bit of work on the weekend About full 40 hours a weekend On the agency And another reason why I've been stressing that Is because I had like an epiphany You know about a week ago Where I was like look I'm only working on this agency like 2 hours a day You know I'm filming a video And I'm editing a video for 2 hours I'm working 4 hours total Editing a video for 2 hours Then Working on my agency for 2 hours And an hour and a half Out of that 2 hours On the ads manager And in 30 minutes I'm reaching out to like 1 or 2 people And not even doing that everyday So It's like you know what I need to double down I'm trying to get this to 100k a month This digital agency Working with clothing brands and stuff And in order to do that I need to double down On my successful habits and stuff And get focused So I need to eat now Let's uh Let's go cook up some chicken And we're gonna have meal number 3 So I've always had a big problem With wasting rice When meal prepping I would cook like a bunch And like Miss a meal Or like I substitute a meal With like a healthy option Eating out And then I would waste some rice And I'd throw it away Cause it gets all mildewing And my mom's probably shaking her head Right now Like Yes So Here's what I've done To kind of eliminate that issue Is Everyday I cook my rice now So here's my little rice cooker And I Found out exactly How much I need So I just need One cup And this is a 3 quarters cup So 3 quarter cup Uncooked rice Um That's how much I need for the whole day Uh To fill up my carbs and stuff So essentially what I do is I just cook my rice in the morning Or Technically in the afternoon now Before my first meal And And I'll just scoop out of here And don't weigh it Cause as long as I get this whole cup in a day It doesn't matter if I get 30 grams for meal 3 And like 100 grams for meal 4 If I want to be a little bit more conservative And And put it more on to another meal As long as I get the full one for a day I'm perfectly fine That's a really good tip for you guys Um I actually learned that trick From my good friend Jake Um He used to do that with chicken breast He would just fill up his container With chicken breast He knew exactly how much I weighed So as long as I get his whole chicken breast in for the day Um He knew it He knew that Hey look Uh I'm good So I do 3 protein sources a day Or 4 5 actually Um Eggs Uh Fish Steak Chicken And protein powder So I ended up doing my fish now Because I think I'm gonna swap Do something special with my chicken later But rice Spinach 3 meals like this a day So I'm one with chicken One with steak And one with fish Hey guys So it's been a little while now It's actually like 9.58 at night I am deep Bleed it Right now Like whole body Sore Tired Falling asleep Yeah you know But uh Yeah So hope you guys kinda enjoyed this video Kinda taking it through my day I know It's supposed to be like my whole routine New routine But to be honest It was more of I didn't really get a lot of work done today I feel like today It's kinda like Yeah my new routine But also too bad A lot of Just stuff that piled up That's not everyday But Today specifically Just had a lot of stuff going on Outside of work I take care of Tomorrow I'm gonna get a haircut in the morning So I'll probably get one good 4 hour work block in the afternoon But uh Yeah So Um But yeah So I took you through in the morning Kinda took you through some of my meals and stuff And Um Yeah Hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm super tired So I wanna bed Hope you enjoyed this video Make sure you drop a like If you enjoyed it And subscribe if you're
