I'm finally facing it all, fearless. Wednesday afternoon, just got a sales call and we just closed, we just had a new client to the roster and really excited to work with this brand because I literally just helped them out a little bit, got some good results, they have a really good brand. But, and they've already been spending a lot of money on Facebook ads and stuff, the problem is the previous agency just did not know what the fuck they were doing, basically fucked them over big time.

So then I came in, gave him a few tips, he was able to get some pretty good results, just my tips and he was doing the ads by himself. But he still had very limited knowledge of the Facebook ads thing of how it works and stuff. So, I basically just said, hey, let me run it for you, do a rev share deal.

So, cool thing about the rev share deal is it takes the risk off of them. Yes, I don't make any money up front, but that's why I only recommend doing rev share deals with key prospects. They are not perfect for everyone.

Make sure you do it with a business that, A, is already producing good content, already got a lot of their shit together. Two, they're already spending money on ads and you've already looked at the ads manager and see clear paths to revenue that you could do to make them money or improve what they're doing. And three, like I said, they're already making a bunch of sales and stuff.

With Facebook ads, you just need your expertise to increase the conversion rate, you know, just make the ads a little bit better, essentially. So, that's what I did with them. They want to hit 60K next month, very possible.

They're already spending, you know, a few hundred days, four or five hundred dollars a day. They want to hit 60K within the next 30 days and they're on route to doing about 20 to 40K right now because they're doing like a 1.5 ROAS and I'm going to jump that up to about 2.5 at 3X ROAS. I make them 60K, which I've already done multiple times for other clients.

10% of that, I get a $6,000 check. That simple. Very easy.

So, RevShare deal with this client, super happy, great little win to the week and also have this exact same deal going on with another client but they're also putting cash down at the beginning. So, it's going to be nice too and I got that next, not this Monday but next. I also have another prospect in the line.

That was that call you all saw kind of at the end of last vlog I uploaded. But just a little unsure about that one right now. Right now, I'm pretty much just going to take the rest of the day off and enjoy some time with my girlfriend.

Wanted to do date night tonight and honestly, I feel like, you know, we do a lot of little small dates today but like just one night we're just going to call it date night and make it special. So, what I did was, got a few things, picked up some roses this morning at Albertsons, candle, some wine, some glasses and I'm going to cook fettuccine tonight. Chicken fettuccine.

So, it should be out pretty good for our little Italian night. Don't let anyone find out what I'm about to do. I'm about to hop on some call of duty.

And it's been a while since I've played but I just wanted to, you know, fully test out the new couch and the setup and it's something I've just been wanting to do for a while now is hop on and play. So, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to play a little bit of call of duty until she gets here and then we're just going to chill, relax and try to finish this damn puzzle right here because this is something that we've been working on for a while now.

Alright, so, jumping into Italian night now. Let me show you guys the setup. So, I'm vlogging babe.

I am following a video on YouTube by Italian Joe from the best fettuccine. I've already did this once. It comes out amazing.

And I'm just following it again because it's been a while since I cooked it. Cooking it down. We got a little white wine in there.

Just got some garlic, onions and some butter cooking down. And about to toss in some heavy whipping cream. And yeah, we got some really good chicken from Whole Foods.

Got the wine. And this is our little date night setup. Got some flowers for Kennedy and candle.

Kind of set the tone, the mood. So, chilling. She's going to goofball out here.

Hello. Hey. Tiktok.

She's taking Tiktok. I'm not making them. I was, but now I'm watching them.

Now she's watching them. We were doing the puzzle. We got a lot done on the puzzle now.

I would say a good bit. We got the whole side done. But yeah, that's pretty much tonight.

Date night, is it you could say? Um, we're going to watch the movie after this. And we got a little bit of ice cream.

Cause you know you gotta have the ice cream. Check this out. Nice.

It starts Friday guys. What's going on guys? It's currently, I think Thursday.

And today I'm filming a pretty interesting video right now. And so I'm on my iPhone right now. And filming the video you guys will see Monday.

Pretty cool video. I'm not, it's big kinda. Uh, but really cool.

Y'all enjoy it. And filming that right now. And filming that right now.

And filming that last. Uh, let the quick sample. God be sam.

And Popeyes is secured. And you can't see it. But over there.

On the other side. In that turning lane. They have a, about 2013.

Uh, grabber blue Mustang GT. On frickin' slicks right now. Huge ass slicks.

And it's raining outside right now. So, I'ma say a special prayer for him. Because I hope he's not going far.

But I mean like straight up slicks in the back. With some very small donuts in the front. I don't know where this guy thinks he's heading on a day like this.

Back at home. Sippin' on my coffee. And just finished up filming some B-roll for this video I'm currently working on.

And we're about to hop into a quick little, I guess, talk about thing. Where I want to start setting up my plans for this diet in the upcoming weeks. Tomorrow is Friday.

You'll be watching this video on Friday. And I will be officially back at the gym. The gym is opening up tomorrow.

I'll be signing up to a completely new gym. And it'll be fun. So, I wanted to bring in, I wanted to bring you guys into this video.

My mindset right now. As I'm about to get back into the gym. A few things I will be doing.

My plans and stuff. I do want to go on a 30 day diet. Really intense.

Just to get my body right for the summer. Only going to go for 30 days. But I'm going to go hard as hell for 30 days.

And I wanted to show you guys exactly what I'll be doing. Like to set up and prepare for it. So, right now I weigh 158 pounds.

That was my morning weight this morning. And let's see. Let's find our maintenance calories real quick.

See, I'm just going to use bodybuilding.com. And use their like macro calculator thing. And basically just allows you to find your base macros.

23 years old. I am 5 foot. I always thought I was 5 foot 7 my whole life.

But my girlfriend is 5 foot 7. And I'm at least 2 inches taller than her. So, I'm going to give my hair 1 inch.

And I'm going to give my body 1 inch. So, I'll say I'm 5'8". Weight 158 pounds.

We want maintenance. We want to do intense exercise. But sedentary job.

Because all I do is sit right here. Make videos. And do Facebook ads.

So, I need 2,192 calories to maintain. My current body weight. Right now.

So, we need to break this up now. Into feasible calories. Or feasible macro goals.

Protein. Etc. So, I'm going to do a lean body mass.

For protein. So, because obviously. If you weigh 100 pounds.

And let's say 20% of your body is fat. Your fat cells do not need protein. You need just your lean body mass.

That's where you're going to have more of your muscular tissue. And stuff. Where it can actually take advantage of your protein in your body.

So, I'm going to go ahead and do 1 gram of protein. Per lean pound body mass. So, I've literally got my computer right here.

And all I'm going to do is go ahead and look up. Let's see. Fat percentage estimator.

Because I'm probably around 15% body fat. But I kind of want to just see a few examples of what each one looks like. 20%.

So, I'm looking at just a bunch of them. I'm just getting the overall of what they say. Your exact body fat may be kind of hard to determine.

And me personally. I understand that the only way to get your ideal body fat percentage. Is if you literally removed everything out of your body.

And just have the fat left. But yeah. I would say about 20% body fat.

That's where. So, what I'm going to do is. I'm going to do 20% of 158 pounds.

Let's see. 158 times .20. That's 31.6 pounds of fat on my body.

So, I'm going to do 158 minus 31.6. And that leaves me with 126 grams. Or 126 pounds as my lean body mass.

Now, I'm going to do 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass. So, that leaves me 126 grams of protein. And then for my fat.

I'm going to do 2,192 times .20. That's 438 calories that I can do for fat. So, I'm going to do 438 divided by 9.

Because it's 9 calories per gram of fat. So, that leaves me with 48 grams of fat. Now, to get carbs.

You pretty much subtract everything else from your total calories. So, 438 calories for fat. And we do 126 times .

Because there is 4 grams of . . .

Or, 4 calories per gram of protein. It's 504. So, we have 504 plus .

. . That's 942 calories for protein and fat.

Now, we're going to come there and do 2,192. Our maintenance calories. Minus 942.

That leaves us with 1250. And then we'll do 1250 divided by 4. That leaves us with 312 grams of carbs.

So, now I've got my macros. I'm going to go ahead and load them into my fitness pal. Now, going into the whole training split.

I'm going to go back to Jeff Nippers. It's like a 6 day split. Pull.

Or, legs, push, pull. Legs, push, pull. Or, legs, pull, push.

Something like that. It's a 6 day split that I got on my computer. It's an intermediate to advanced program.

That you track your weights every week. And then, overall, tracking your weights every week. And, you're consistently pushing yourself each week to do a little bit more weight.

I'm going to jump on this plan because I have seen the best results in my life in the gym following this plan. And, the biggest thing for me is the tracking of each week. And, having this very straight forward sets of, Hey, last week you did 4 sets of 10 at 100 pounds.

This week you did 4 sets of 10 of 110 pounds. The consistently doing a little bit more weight each week. Allowing me to progressively overload my muscles.

And, seeing the best muscle development I've ever seen before inside the gym. So, I will be going ahead and using that specific program. Now, in terms of my calories and stuff.

I am going to be eating maintenance calories for the first week. I will be jumping into 20 minutes of the StairMaster right off the bat. I'm going to increase this up to about 30 minutes towards the end of this diet.

This 30 day diet. But, I want to do 20 minutes starting off. Because, 20 minutes I want to be the bare minimum.

Even after this diet, I want to be doing 20 minutes of cardio every day. As I feel like the 20 minutes of cardio really does make a difference in my life. As I know when I just do weight lifting for a while.

My cardiovascular health goes really far down. And, when it is like that. It's like I will go outside and do something simple.

Like, carry up the groceries upstairs. And, I will be winded. And, I just feel like.

You know, I just feel out of breath. And, I do not want to be like that. As I feel like that of me empowering my health.

Then, I need to be able to be cardiovascular healthy as well. So, I want to start off straight off with 20 minutes on Stairmaster. Maintenance calories.

And, in week 2 we are going to take a very strong dive. We are going to go all the way up to 30 minutes on the Stairmaster. And, then we will pull those carbs down.

Week 3. Same thing. We will pull those carbs further down.

Stairmaster is the same. I do not want to go over 30 minutes on the Stairmaster. And, then week 4 depending on where I am at.

And, week 5. There may be a 5 and 6 week. Basically, what I am trying to do is we are going to the beach.

Sometime in July. I want to try to go on a really strong. You know, month.

It is actually about a month and a half. About 6 week. A 6 week cut here.

And, that will give us our full window. About 6 weeks actually. So, it will be 30 days.

It will be a little more long than 30 days. And, I am just trying to get ready for the summer. About July 1st.

I have a really good. I am not. I don't want to be shredded.

But, I want to be a really good physique. That looks healthy. Because, right now it looks like someone that has ate a lot of fast food.

And, bad food. Throughout the quarantine. And, that is exactly how I look right now.

So, I want to just transform my body a little bit. And, give it more of that muscular. More.

A more muscular look. With the same muscle. It is just shredding off the fat.

To give it that more athletic look. For the summer. And, that is what I am looking to do right now.

Well, ladies and gentlemen. It is actually a little bit later. Now.

In the night. Just kind of chilled. Had a little movie night.

And, guess what. I need a drink. So.

Let's give this a little something. Oh. Wait.

Wait. Wait. Let's see.

Fresh. Up. Fresh out of the dishwasher.

Do this later. Alright. This is something.

I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure.

I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure.

I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure.

But. This is some. Black label.

By. Is it Johnny? Johnny Walker.

Black label. Really good. Highly recommend it.

It. If you like whiskey. Highly recommend it.

It's very smoky. Really freaking good. I love it.

But. Right now. I am about to start editing this vlog.

And. Yeah. So.

Basically tomorrow. It's going to be the first day kind of back. From quarantine.

And. I want to. To.

Do my best to take. Responsibility. With this diet.

As. You know. Last.

Like the start. This whole series kind of failed. And.

Now. I kind of want to do. Catch up.

Basically. Think about it like this. You get a big assignment.

Due. For college. Now.

That's the first day. That's the first day. Kind of back.

From quarantine. And. I want to.

Do my best to take. Responsibility. With this diet.

As you know. Last. Like the start.

Of this whole series. Kind of failed. And.

Now. I kind of want to do. Catch up.

Basically. Think about it like this. You get a big assignment.

Due. And. Like.

Yeah. It's due. Next.

Friday. And. Basically.

The whole. Week. And.

Half. You slack off. Before.

It's due. Tomorrow. So.

I need to just. Bust ass. For the next.

Eight hours. Don't look at my phone. Take a bunch of Adderall.

Stay up all night. And. Not that I'm promoting.

The use of Adderall. At all. That's kind of.

If I go into the summer. Looking like this. I know that.

I'm not going to be happy with myself. And then also too. At the same.

Time. I know if I'm elevating. Practicing the habit of discipline.

And doing the things. I don't want to do. It's going to.

Essentially. Create all this momentum in my life. That I want.

And need. Right now. I've been on a lot of.

High lately. I guess you could say. With a lot of.

Consumer. Consuming a lot of stuff. In terms of food.

In terms of. Purchasing stuff. Buying stuff.

Alcohol. A lot of these things. That release these.

Endorphins. In you. To feel good emotions.

And stuff. And now. Once.

Kind of fast. From all that. And get focused.

And practice the art. Of discipline. Sacrificing things.

In your life. Doing things. You don't want to do.

Get down to the grit. And the dirt. And it's something that.

Makes me feel alive. Inside of me. It makes me feel.

How's it actually? It makes me feel. Of myself.

In the experience. Of if I get this. It makes me feel like.

And I'm not going. Not going to do. But I'm not going.

To the atmosphere. In the atmosphere. It's doing lots and lots of art.

It makes me feel, have a sense of purpose. My business elevates. My whole life elevates.

I do better. I become stronger. I grow.

I become a better person. And that's something that I'm looking forward to. But now it's time, starting tomorrow, to put the gas back on the pedal.

And take off the emergency brake and keep fucking pushing. Because this is not where I'm in a place I want to be right now. But I feel like I'm not living to my true potential.

Not pushing myself hard enough. And I need to work harder, double down, and continue to grow. So, cheers for tomorrow.

You guys will be seeing this video tomorrow, which is Friday. And Monday I got a special video planned for y'all. May release another vlog this weekend.
