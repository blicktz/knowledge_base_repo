what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys I'm literally going to show you all the seven and eight figure paid traffic funnel we run for clients and exactly something to look at for implementing into your business and how to so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday let's get started guys all right guys I'm about to show you all the same funnel we use for seven to growing e-commerce business to seven and eight figures the literally the paid traffic funnel show you the diagram and show you exactly what you need to do at each stage so let's hop into my computer all right guys this is the seven and eight figure paid traffic funnel to growing your e-commerce business Facebook ads etc so some of these key things are stuff that I've talked about before on this channel but now I'm literally going to show it to you in this video so starting off right here sure it's cold traffic this could be coming from Facebook ads Google ads TikTok ads Pinterest whatever you're using cold traffic maybe influencers even if you're using a lot of influencers to market your product so cold traffic they do not know who you are and they can care less about you you need to remember that so it's your job to disrupt their feed get in front of them grab their attention create desire for your product or brand and a reason to take action now so that's your job right there at that stage and then it's going to drive that traffic again it's going to go to their phones and they're going to do two things they're going to go to your website or they're just going to like it comment on it or watch the video if you're using a video ad and that puts them into two different buckets so let's take this route first so let's just say they don't go to your website they just engage or watch the video they're going to go into our middle of funnel campaign which we call mofu and these people are warm they're warm to your brand but you really still haven't appealed to them yet to the point where they can go to your website so they you know something spoke to them in the first campaign so now what we need to do is in middle of funnel is we really need to grab their attention again so we can look at it from right here of touching different buying motives we can leverage some social proof showing that the product works we can hit from different angles in which of which we promote the product testimonials you know unboxing videos reaction videos all that stuff works really good right there of really grabbing people's attention again and bringing them back to the website so there you can go to the website or additional stay right here and pretty much get booted out after they you know exit out the threshold of days that we use for this specific stage right here so that's what's gonna happen right there but now let's say if they go to your website go to your website you know love what you got they add your product to the cart they're thinking about purchasing so they're gonna do two things they're gonna not purchase exit off your website or two they'll make a purchase and if they do make a purchase we want to ask ourselves how can we get them to spend more how can we increase that average order value so we're gonna do upsells bundles free shipping on order 75 plus there's gonna be free shipping on pretty much whatever dollar amount that uh makes sense for you so 75 is just an example but let's just say you have an aov of 50 bucks i'll do 75 bucks if i'm an aov of 100 bucks i'll do like 150 it's always do a higher amount that i want to set a goal for them to do bolt-ons so for example i went to the store the other day i purchased a really nice mother's day gift from a mom and while i was there you know i got the the product and then they're like well do you need a box for mother's day like oh sure so got that got the package i'll let them package and everything so i'll just bolt on to the order worked really well slash upsells works super good so we want to ask ourselves those questions right there when they go through website so that way when they make that purchase we can get them to spend more so that's super key right there now let's say they don't purchase let's just say they don't purchase they're going to go into our bottom of traffic campaign so these specific is blue orange red just have it you know ticked in your mind yet this is all going to be your your facebook advertising campaigns so your bottom of funnel traffic has visited your website looked at your product added to cart but haven't made a purchase yet they haven't converted over into a buyer and at bottom of funnel traffic the reason they don't make a purchase with you is because they don't trust your brand they don't trust your product maybe your product they don't really see they have some objection to your product or they don't trust you so we need to start creating content that handles objections to the consumer so that they can purchase they've seen all the amazing stuff you do they've seen all the amazing reviews you have on your page but now let's share them and show them more objection handling content of why they should purchase from your brand this is super key right here so common questions you get in your inbox common questions you get on your ads addressing different you know what's the unanswered questions that we can address in this campaign to really convey people over to purchase your product a lot of people believe i gotta run a discount code to get them a purchase and that's very false you know sometimes the discount works but a lot of times the objection handling content you can offer whatever percent of discount code people simply just not want to hand you over their credit card information that's perfectly fine so we're gonna build up more trust with them we'll hand their objections to your product we'll you know answer questions make a more educated consumer it's more likely to say yes than an uneducated one if they're confused confused mind always says no so we're gonna better educate the consumer on your product and that's gonna lead to sales we'll see like a six to seven extra turn on ad spend on this campaign we'll see a three to four x and then we'll see a two to three x at our top of funnel campaign our prospecting campaign and again if people don't make that purchase they'll stay in here and up until the threshold of days that we're targeting and they'll just be booted out and they won't be in our campaign anymore and again in fact once they get booted out they're done they're out the funnel and now we're only left with buyers and when buyer happens make a sell you obviously make money everyone's happy but then they go to our past buyers campaign so we actually have a past buyers campaign and this past buyers campaign right here we need to ask ourselves the next question how can we get them to purchase more how can you increase that lifetime value and with that lifetime value we want to do new releases of new products that's targeting specifically past buyers upsells can we turn a product into a subscription product how can we give them a purchase more or even if there's a referral program to where they can make us more money in return um and we want to ask those questions and then we want to get them a buy again or make us more money and it's just going to keep turning and turning and turning and turning the flywheel effect right here and this is going to probably do you a 10 to 20 extra turn on ads right here but also to look at your email list your sms list vip facebook groups all of that type of stuff right there that can not just your facebook ad campaign for that specific campaign right there so this is the seven and eight figure paid traffic funnel
