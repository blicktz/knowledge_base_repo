What's up guys welcome back to the channel Nick here and today we'll be trying to bring you a special video or something that's been highly talked about lately in the community so many people have been freaking out over Facebook ads and paid advertising the cost of it has been rising with so much more competition in the market you know all the talk about Facebook changes and everything and a lot of people have been kind of scared and stuff of what they're gonna do to continue making money through paid advertising say for Facebook Google AdWords not necessarily too much but mostly just Facebook itself and what people are gonna be doing to change it up well look to be honest a lot of people are still doing Facebook ads wrong and the people who know how to properly run Facebook ads and build a campaign and have a specific strategy through it are gonna continue to stay on the top while the people at the bottom who have little to no experience at all and have no specific strategy or anything like that are gonna completely pretty much fail and it's gonna be cost way too much to acquire a customer in the long run to stay profitable as a business so I'm gonna jump into my computer we're gonna show you exactly kind of everything I'm talking about exactly why your Facebook ads are failing you and what you can do to drastically improve that and stay profitable in the long run and be able to spend a hell lot more as a choir a customer versus your competition and still stay profitable alrighty guys we're in my computer and I want to jump just straight to the point with this again I'm no Picasso so if anyone has any good courses on like handwriting and stuff specifically with like a mouse and stuff please let me know so you know I'm really gonna be hurt if I have to rerecord this and like have to kind of like redraw some of this stuff so but anyway first thing I want to kind of talk about this the evolution of basically a Facebook Ads definitely what's been kind of the trends whereas the big businesses have already been implementing this and has been no like no brainer at all to redo you know they've been doing this already with regular advertising on TV and any other paid advertising but kind of the big trends going on with small businesses small little entrepreneurs selling you know basic products and stuff Shopify store stuff like that kind of the typical of what Facebook Ads is and what you know it's been going on so jumping straight into it kind of the very first trend that we've been noticing art that kind of started when Facebook popped open which is running straight Facebook cold traffic to a cool product or service they'll post a picture of their products that service maybe before and after pictures finished completed product of the service that you know product of the service and are just a product they're selling and they literally take cold Facebook traffic I mean obviously be targeted you know broken down but we're not talking about targeting right now and they'll run this targeted traffic to just literally just post and you know they have the link in the bio or a link in the you know post to click to where you can get that service or call today or you know buy that product online so that's kind of the very first thing but then you know ad costs started rising there's more competition started getting in and you know just wasn't working you need to be a little bit more specific so that kind of just got up the you know got out and you know there's a few few people still doing this and you know it works for some people but it's definitely not the overall trend or it's definitely not the overall most profitable thing to do with Facebook ads so next thing we started getting is a little bit more of the retargeting so people literally doing the same thing they're running cold Facebook traffic to the cool product or service low posts and they could you know every time someone would view the website they could implement retargeting right here and with the Facebook pixel and they'll retarget the people who viewed that post or viewed that product on the website and retarget people with another a little ad a little bit more you know kind of salesy you know last chance to buy blah blah blah and it's very you know it's much better to do it like this because basically you know people are viewing this product service you know on typically on average someone needs to see a product or service about five or seven times before they purchase so they view it and then this allows you to basically scrape all the money off the table are you leaving a lot of money off the table this allows you to scrape the rest off because you're basically retargeting people who showed interest but didn't purchase and keep them in the loop until they do and then you basically just retargeting with another ad this is working amazing too but again once everyone's are doing it you know it just kind of got out of line of all the other ads so that just I mean you can still get results with it but it's still again it starts falling off of the profitability so next things next is really just run cold Facebook traffic but instead of running it straight to your product or service it's just creating brand awareness first which a lot of people miss out on they literally just take their cool product service and they push it out to the public with no specific you know with no previous history and imagine a stranger walk up to you and said a complete stranger he had no chance of you know selling selling them pre-selling them with anything you literally they just walked up to you and asked you for $100 for their product or service you have no chance of googling it or anything like that first you literally just hand walk up to you you're not gonna purchase it you have no idea who they are blah blah that's literally what Facebook ads are you're literally sending cold traffic to people and telling people you know while they're scrolling through Facebook asking them for X amount of money right then and there you know no one's gonna do it so the very first thing is to create brand awareness first and so you know putting out some of a video something like that you know putting out some content and you know kind of similar to me I'm putting out content right now I talk about Facebook's or digital marketing in general building that relationship and allowing people to build a relationship with me and eventually purchase one of my services but so the first thing we do is create some brand awareness get people to like you you people like your brand and stuff and then you come there and retarget them right here with your cool product or service again you can retarget people based on how long they watch the video and stuff like that retarget them with your cool products or service so that's also another thing now this is this is where it gets kind of more in-depth and you're right on the track but you you're like right there but not there you're 99% you know profitable there's one more thing you can do to increase your profitability with Facebook ads and allows you to spend more than your competition so this like I said it's almost there it's ninety nine percent there but it's not there yet there's still more you can do and there's more to increase your profitability and therefore you know the new the new way I guess the revised way are you know the the thing you should have been doing since day one the new way so which seems like the new way which really it's not so the thing you should have been doing since they hit one so I'm gonna show you see day number let's just do one of what you should have been doing so I'm not gonna write that out because that's just take forever so you still want to do your cold traffic with Facebook okay you want to take your cold traffic and now this can apply to any business okay this is not limited to you know say Shopify store or you know a big brand that you know sell stuff online you know this can be any business this is not specific to anything it's be product or service related and product doesn't have to be physical or tangible you know you can be like an info product or something so let's see there we go I absolutely hate trying to type stuff right stuff out so your products are so you're gonna take your cold traffic and instead of your your you know well you're gonna take your cold traffic and you want to run straight to you know your brand awareness you still want to create brand awareness you know you need to educate and inform people who you are and then the next thing you want to do is you want to send that traffic so you can create brand awareness for your brand and then you want to retarget those people with some type of let's see hold up before I get too far ahead of myself so you want to retarget people with some type of that's not necessarily offer you know like a coupon offer but you need to retarget people with something they can opt into hint opt-in we want to collect their information so we into a collect information you need to get something from them you know you need to give them something in exchange for their information so this could be a you know entry-level product at no charge coupon let's say another popular one is kind of like a guide a p like a PDF they can download with steps so say if you're a financial coach and you're trying to build you know your brand and stuff you create some awareness for your brand then you take that guide like maybe a guide or like a PDF that quickly says you know five tips or download my limits my limited guide on how to you know start saving money today you know five tips start saving money so but you have to be able to get people some type of results of whatever free you have to give them something something that basically establishes that trust so it can't be any type of shit thing it needs to be something good enough to where it gives them some type of results some type of you know feeling of satisfaction but not something that's too crazy to where it's gonna cost you you know don't don't give give out your $200 product unless you're selling like $100,000 product or something like that you know and you know your numbers but you know give out something that establishes that satisfaction something that you're giving to them that they're take away from it versus something like free video or something unless it's like amazing videos so PDF download works amazing for a local business coupon works amazing and you know or like an entry-level service I know charge our product so so basically what you're doing is you're giving them this in exchange for their email so we want their email and once we get their email if they don't purchase right then and there that's no big deal we're not we're not worried about them purchasing right then and there because once we get their email we can basically you know remarket to them over and over and over and over and and it costs us absolutely zero dollars and why because email you actually own that you know data once you get it so literally all you're paying is your monthly subscription fee a subscription fee for your email marketing service and you can remarket to them over and over and you can upsell them you know so let's say it costs you you know like five dollars to acquire you know this email so of course you're like five dollars in Facebook ads to acquire this email that's five dollars that's all you're gonna pay you're never gonna pay more to market to this to this user that makes sense so you know you spend a little bit money spend maybe average five dollars per email to acquire that email and then you can upsell them over and over and over until they unsubscribe so you can promote your hundred dollar product you know thousand dollar service you know over and over and that email I'm a purchase from you immediately but say you know they purchase your hundred dollar product then you can upsell them again on your next product etc you can send out daily content every day you know you can market to them over and over send out content every day to your email list and over time you know you're you're an average a lot more by having these email addresses you can promote to over and over versus you know every time you want to come there and and say say every time you want to make a sale or something like that or promote something you know you would have to go and just boost the post way up here and you'll be spending a lot more say if it cost you you know a hundred dollars to see make one product sale on a super product or service that's about a thousand dollars versus you generate a whole bunch of leads and you can literally just send out an email broadcast here's my awesome product or service and because you've been sending out content been sending out you know I don't mean like every day send out something to sell people but because you've also been putting out constant stuff and building that trust and stuff and keeping people open up that email you know say if you have a list of you know a hundred people and you just release a thousand dollar product and let's just say ten percent of those people opt in that's ten thousand dollars right there boom so that just shows you the power of email and what a lot of people are failing to do because they run these you know cold Facebook traffic to a cool product or service and there's no way no way to follow up no way to follow up or well yeah follow up so there's no way to follow up and due to that there's you know that's it you know basically just pushing into their face and you're you know walking up to a stranger asking about the school product service get them interested and they say no and then they immediately just go to the next person good salespeople are constantly persistent going over and over and this is kind of what the sales process is you're running cold Facebook traffic you create brand awareness for your brand you're building that initial amount of trust then you're gonna retarget those people with some type of free make sure I put that right there you know free you know entry-level product coupon some type of guide something that gets some results quickly at limited you know to no expenses at all on urine and then you can remarket those people over and over with email you know send out daily content and then you know maybe once or twice a week you know promote something really big that you can get sales on right then there because again emails once you acquire them there's no additional charge and you can remarket those people over and over email marketing is not dead and then there's a lot of advanced you know email marketing software so you can even put people in automated sequences so you're not even really doing anything so that's automatically sending you emails to them automatically making sales and getting you money so guys hope this helped you out a little bit with your Facebook guys and everything it's kind of like my first video where I kind of like explain everything like this so I'm definitely gets more practice you know especially if you don't send me some books and stuff on you know handwriting and stuff specifically with the mouse because you know this is just got awful but uh this is how kind of it all works kind of the new way to do you know Facebook ads and stuff and why if someone just tries to come up to you and sell to you just Facebook ads this is just just extremely unprofitable no don't do it whereas you know why I'm shifting all my services specifically doing stuff like this building the whole sales funnel cycle because this is gonna make client money in the long term versus just doing this so guys thank you all for watching hope you have a nice day
