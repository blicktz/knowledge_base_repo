yeah that's him right there youtube what is going on nick terrio here and we are literally three hours away three hours away from picking up our lamborghini urus and this is gonna be my very first lamborghini i've never owned the lamborghini before first off say thank you to literally everyone who has liked the video commented on the video hit that subscribe button has watched the video even like past 10 seconds whatever because all of this is thank you to you guys a decade a decade of work i put into to be able to afford this and today's finally happening yep that's him right there that is so cool let's go back in this trailer we got your mortgage i mean think about it like he just came from like san diego he probably he has to go to atlanta wow that is so cool there it is i love the green challenge yeah how many people it takes to get into this parking lot we got one two three there we go let's go those are the smallest brake lights so i just got it delivered and it's absolutely pouring right now all right guys we just made it home i'm just gonna pick this up tomorrow morning because it's dark outside we'll pull this out in the sun and give you guys a full tour obviously we still kept the vet so it's gonna be a fun little garage now we're gonna be a good morning youtube we are here today with uh zach zach is getting some content for the vehicle uh to do the instagram reveal so it's all the hard work i do for you guys to put some a plus content here oh yeah you guys will walk around in a second that's looking good zach's on this thing oh my god man them green calipers just oh my god something else i don't know if you guys can see but look at that gap right there that is like i'm very surprised of how slow this thing sits for complete stock i was definitely concerned about it looking like a four-wheel drive truck zach just finished shooting constant so let's actually do an official walk around of the car so as mentioned we did go with the gray color this was mostly just due to the fact that i wanted something that i can use as a daily driver for the next couple years and also too if i don't like it i can always just wrap it but the goal was white black or gray for more low profile that stealth kind of look is what i wanted to go with um but it did like i said they did have the green calipers on it with the massive ceramic uh brakes on it first time ever having ceramic brakes this is pretty cool um obviously like i said all gray looks really good just do kind of a walk around massive 23 inch i think it's 23 inch rims on there with the the forelli and also too with first i'm owning a urus um there's special urus tires from ferrari that you have to order that it's gonna just be a bitch i know it now when i have to ever like replace the tire or something like that so um also something cool to point out is that all of this is color matched whereas some urs it's not color matched at all and uh yeah so that was interesting go in the back right here this bumper was the only thing that almost made me not get this car because i really wanted the color match bumper and they just simply didn't have any um that were available within like the spec i was looking for with a color match bumper um exhaust is stock but it's in the corso mode right now which is like the louder version so just give you a heads up on that and then let's pull up the uh liftgate real quick so i already put in the weather tech um last night so i thought that was cool um that was like my first official mod to be fair and then next thing this is also pretty cool right here this lowers and raises the rear of the car so like if you come in after like load up some stuff in the car you literally can just lower and raise it right here which is really cool so and then this just kind of goes like right here uh to like separate but i will be putting my dogs back here so that's why i got the weather tech and i would probably just take this out and store it somewhere i don't know where to put this right now but it's just like that second little cargo cover that you put inside keep going around take a look at the back also cool uh thing about the gas cap check this out you got this nice urus urus gas cap um i've never seen a gas cap like that before now to be fair the only thing i didn't like about it is that you actually have to manually twist it off uh first i'm owning a car in a while that actually have to manually twist off a gas cap go in the rear we already got some dirt and stuff like that from friends last night but we got this beautiful green stitching on all of the seats really nice and then you also got this really cool gauge cluster back here uh for like your seats and your power outlets all those good things so really cool um definitely not like what i would say like super spacious back here but we were able to comfortably put three different people in here last night for test drives and stuff uh they loved it and then also too you have this amazing sound system by bang and offsen i don't know if i'm saying that correctly this thing sounds amazing um i don't quote me if i'm wrong but i think i want to say it's like 10 grand just for the sound system in this car just absolutely nuts now we keep going around um we go passenger side real quick zach has this stuff in the car right now we're shooting some content and everything but definitely very cool up here you got the uh lamborghini headrest pretty much all the address up the lamborghini getting the green stitching you got the uh nice little lamborghini in the front right here um pretty damn spacious up here and then we'll kind of go more into the driver's side all right so let's check this out this is the inside um let me sit down all right let's take a look at this so right now it is in corso mode this is the loudest mode in terms of the exhaust it also has the um like stiffens up the suspension it changes the gear shifting all that so it's just more of like your your track focused uh mode right here uh you have your you know your what i would say um like your heating cooling all that right here this is your infotainment and everything really nice really cool and cup holders well we do have cup holders we just found out this morning you cannot fit two coffees in there um but yeah this is pretty sick so i'll give you a little bit of driving clips in a second but this is the overall the vehicle right here so and also cool thing about this is there is no drive mode on this thing so regardless of what mode it is in whether it's with reverse park or neutral the only way to put it in drive is literally just pulling the paddle shifter and that's how you go into drive oh god bump the burbles yeah i can't get over that here won't be super but oh oh holy shit damn all right so we just got back home and i want to actually pull back the curtains now and actually show you guys everything that goes into buying a lamborghini the financing the how much money you need to make per month and all of those good things so let's open up my computer and i'm gonna show you all that in a breakdown all right now that i'm on my computer we're gonna break down the costs and go through all the costs of the car um and a couple other things now before i actually go through this i want to just make it very clear here um i am not trying to flex or you know technically show off these things but i'm simply trying to do this from an educational perspective uh you know me buying this car i went through a lot of talk to a lot of people i went through a lot of videos and stuff and really no one was showing these things so i was like you know what fuck it let's actually show you guys everything that kind of went into buying this car so that way you guys uh can also learn from this so first things first is if you're looking to buy a lamborghini or any type of car realistically um don't be one of those people that uh make a bunch of money in a month and then all sudden think because like for example um you know you're making like 10k all year per month and then all of a sudden one month you do 100k don't be one of those dudes who like oh fuck i just made a bunch of money in a single month let me go buy a bunch of shit don't be that person so um this particular car right here uh i needed to make roughly around a hundred thousand dollars a month to be able to afford this car and i've achieved that over the last 12 months i've been consistently able to do a hundred thousand dollars a month on my average income if i take the last 12 months take the total i made and i averaged it out by 12 my average gross income that's before taxes was a hundred thousand dollars a month so we're going to type in one hundred thousand dollars right there and you can already see some stuff populating and we're going to talk about that in a second the next thing is you know buying a car like this is very irresponsible financially like there's just a fuckload of costs when it comes down to like you know the rent the tires for example when i need new tires it's four thousand dollars just for the tire and that's not even including like the actual cost of the labor to put it in and stuff like that and that's roughly around probably another five six hundred dollars so it'd be about five thousand dollars just to change the tires on this and they recommend doing it every five to ten thousand miles that's roughly every year i get to replace the tires on this thing so you know it's a very time and money pit in a sense right there to where you know it just doesn't make sense to invest in these things unless you already have achieved a certain level of investment inside of the market or you know whatever you personally prefer so my rule of thumb is that whatever i want to buy i need to have um like basically that invested times 10. so for example this is a rolex batgirl and this is roughly about 18 20 000 i paid for this particular rolex right here um i did not buy this until i achieved 200k invested so for me to buy a lamborghini i knew i was going to put about 60 000 down so for me to comfortably put 60 000 down i wanted at least 600 000 invested right so here we go put that boom so this means i could technically once i have this done i could comfortably be able to put 60 grand down so the five percent rule the 10 rule the five percent rule is you do not exceed um a card note more than five percent of your income i personally know people 20 to 30 percent their income goes to a card note and there's different stages of your life to be fair like you know when i was a brokie um i think i was had like i was making a thousand dollars a month and i think two three hundred bucks a month was going to my card at the time um now that i've been able to achieve a little bit of success then now i can um have a better like basically like financial smarts um i try to keep that below five percent five percent of my income can go to cars right and that's the key thing here so five percent rule i can spend no more than five thousand dollars a month on car payments um i'll get into the car payment in a second with this car and the car payment that i pay on my uh car event as well because i kept that um but it basically averages out right at 5k then the next rule of thumb is the 10 rule meaning whatever i have invested in the market times 10 10 is the most i can put down on a car a watch whatever you guys are into so i have 600k invested right now um that's between a ton of different things i have like four or five different life insurance policies mutual funds 401ks iras a bunch of other stuff my life insurance policy has um or like my financial advisor has um you know s p 500 i'm very weighted in the s p 500 so i have a lot of investments right um there's a lot of people on money twitter and like all these other places where it's like bro they're buying a lamborghini or something like that they have three months cash in the bank and that's it they have nothing invested and uh just i simply don't want to be put in a position where i feel like i'm stressed to make the payment on either one of these vehicles and that's going to limit my creativity that's going to limit my ability to make decisions um as a business owner so i want to make sure that i'm very well put together because that's actually going to make me feel a lot better driving this vehicle because now i can drive it stress-free you know someone hits me someone scratches one of the rims i curb a rim on accident or something like that cool whatever no big deal 5k but if i'm like barely making 10k a month and have to pay for this vehicle i'm even stressed as fuck because one like little accident could happen could destroy me financially so five percent rule ten percent rule learn those um next thing car price so the car was two hundred and nineteen thousand dollars um it has um sixteen thousand miles on it and tax title license on it's about twenty one thousand nine hundred dollars roughly ten percent of whatever the car price is um and that put us at two hundred and forty thousand dollars um that uh you know basically i owed that sense and i put sixty thousand thousand down um that basically brings the car back to about uh like the total i need a finance about 180 000 now i'm gonna give you guys another little uh i wish i knew before i purchased this thing so for for what i learned was you can you cannot get a loan more than double what your last loan was so for example for me my first ever uh or technically my uh third ever car loan was for 49 000 that's how much i financed and i was the uh the red ford mustang if you go back to my youtube channel after me buying my ford mustang um that was 49 000 and that was my technically highest loan at the time and when i got the c8 carvette the highest amount i could get approved for was 98 000 because my highest loan prior was 49 000 dollars so it doubles each time and um you know for the uh lambo the highest i could get for it was going to be about uh right around like 180 one night because it was to double my last loan so i tried getting approved for a loan for 260 uh about a year ago for a hurricane before i you know kind of bossed up got a little smarter by my finances and they were gonna charge me like 20 30 interest rate insane but it's because i didn't have the proper history um or i was gonna put down like 50 of the vehicle price because of the loan history right so i thought this was just something that you know was a false um kind of like myth going in the air but i learned the hard way um i didn't believe any of my mentors that told me that multiple times i refused to believe them and i tried to get proof and approved and approved and i just kept getting shot down and you know to be fair i kind of fucked my credit up a little bit because i kept having all these hard inquiries on it and stuff like that so you need to keep kind of leveling up right so for me that's kind of why i bought the c8 to drive it for a couple months to build my loan history up show i can pay off a higher payment loan and then that's why i bought this vehicle this vehicle about 219 finance about 180 i'll be able to get my next approval for about 360 next and i'm not really sure yet what i want to get next but i definitely want to get like an event store next and it was running about 400 000 i'll probably have to put about 100 grand down on that and that should give me right my loan range to get my next approval uh for the vehicles i really want next um next thing is you're gonna need to put about 20 to 30 percent down um i put 60 000 down which is gonna be roughly 20 percent 25 of the vehicle price uh and that's a good sizable chunk so i can build some equity in the vehicle um you know i was always a big person that's like i can afford the monthly payments but uh you know i don't want to put a lot of money down because i'd rather just simply have that money in the bank because if i can't pay a note or something like that i have that cash reserve i'll learn you're either going to bite the the uh cash down in the beginning or at the end so either you put a lot of money down so that way you can walk away from the vehicle if you ever have to sell it with equity built into it or you can put no money down and then you can walk away from the vehicle but to walk away from that vehicle you have to put a lot of money down then um so you have two options me personally i just think it feels a lot better to put a lot of money down in a vehicle um it gives you just a certain level of like yeah right you know you're able to put that down you're able to drive that vehicle with a little bit of equity feels good owning the vehicle then just hey nothing down sign your name here's the keys i didn't really feel like you really you know it's like if someone just walked up to you give you a free rolex you don't really have to do anything to get it right but if you have to put like 10 20k down first before they give you the rolex you'll be more a little inclined to treat it seriously so that's just a little myth a little thought process around that uh next thing is interest i'm paying like 9.5 interest not the greatest but also too i'm financing this in september of 2024 which has just been terrible in interest rate all year i'm doing it for 72 months and my monthly note comes out to 3 400 a month now insurance um i am paying 420 a month on insurance and gas will probably be about 120 a month so the total monthly cost for this car comes out to uh 3 940 and if we look at my total income that comes out below five percent of my income and then um basically my monthly note on this car is 3 400 my monthly note on my car vets 1600 so those two together comes out to right at five thousand dollars this way i can technically drive both these vehicles and i'm never having to worry about cash um you know being tied or anything like that and uh you know just to be clear here right you know if you're not in a position where you can afford to put five percent of your um income to a car like you know maybe you're throwing 20 30 of your income to a car right now and like money's tight and you know you're not driving anything like crazy right like you're driving maybe like a oh two oh three honda core just because you're trying to make ends meet like look no blame on you on that like you're literally doing the best you can um i'm putting this five percent rule more for people who are making good amounts of money and they want to reward themselves but they don't really have a rule of thumb of which uh they should reward themselves and i talked to a lot of rich people and they all told me about the same thing which is five percent of your income can go to the toys the fun money um so that's that's what these are these are both toys even though i drive them every day they're both toys to me so this is exactly how um how much the car was cost of everything like that and kind of some of my rules and ideologies um about purchasing this and feeling good about purchasing it right that's the biggest thing here hope you guys enjoyed that and thank you all so much for the support on this video thank you again so
