hey what's going on guys I'm excited to bring you a new tool I've been working on it's called the relationship analyzer this tools me very powerful with changing your life and removing toxic people and figuring out first to remove those toxic people you need to figure out who the toxic people are what's the toxic values they bring to the table and how you know stuff you're not becoming aware of and this tools allow you become aware of these toxic people the values that's your life or things that's your life that is toxic and how to remove them so this would be a very powerful tool and not

for those people and you'll be able to develop a more deeper and meaningful relationship with those people and elevate that and it's been very powerful and you become a lot happier a lot more positive you're going to notice a lot less negativity in your life the reason why I made this tool is because I'm personally I've been a very good person at looking at the toxic benefits of people and being able to remove those people in my life people who don't add any value to me who offers a lot of negativity who does a lot of negative things of and remove those people and keep only good people around me and I live a lot less stress of a life compared to some people who when I look at their circle is just full of negativity they got a lot of stuff going on around them that isn't too hot and they have no clue why and really all they need to do is change their friends change their circle and you know it's gonna be a step in the right direction this is what this tool allows you to do and I'll be warning you right now that it's going to be very painful it's going to be emotional you're gonna really break these things down and be you're gonna have a few aha moments but also some of you hurt and it's it's it's you know it's like pouring um salt on a scar it's it's not gonna be fun at all uh it's gonna be a little painful but once you get through this you're gonna become very aware of the people in your life and you're gonna have specific actions to take uh to minimize energy and time that's allocated to those people and you're gonna change your life uh using this tool so before we get started go right here to file or click the link in the description then go to file uh make a copy and uh you know rename it and then save it to your google drive so that way you can actually use this yourself so just a quick overview of it um there's four different steps you're gonna take to do this tool uh let's take probably about an hour it's about two hours the first time you do this um you know you can kind of half-ass do it the first time but uh if you're really get deep into it take about an hour to two hours to do so just a little heads up but there's four different steps right here to do um you got your step one which is identifying the relationships then you want to identify the positive injections from these people the negative injections from these people and then final is the scoreboard which allows you to figure out people who offer positivity in your life negative more negativity in your life and how to elevate the positive relationships and how to move yourself away from the negative relationships um and specific actions that take to maybe even change those relationships first before you have to completely cut that person off so let's get started guys um is it very simple to use and really takes it doesn't have to be a genius to use this so um i've already kind of listed a few people but um this is where you begin uh list all the names here it's basically just like a white space so you can come there and uh you know type up people's names and stuff i think it has about what like 16 48 spots to type people and you basically want to write down everyone in the past 30 days that you had two or three conversations with um maybe more and uh really dig deep into these people so these can be friends it's gonna be family it's gonna be work associates these can be people that you talk to at the gym people you talk to while going to other stuff um these are people you talk to on social media okay you know these are people you're gonna talk to you know frequently too you don't want to just talk to you don't just list a guy the ups driver who you talked to once the last month or last in the past 30 days when he said sign here and you maybe had a very quick short conversation but these will be people that's me occasionally or uh consistently popping back up into your life frequently popping back up into your life and you want to list these people you won't be listing the great uncle or the uncle that you talk to maybe once a year or the aunt you talk to maybe twice a year um but you will be listing the family members that you talk to once a week maybe twice a week and um you know especially your mom dad um you you want to list these type of people in your life so i kind of listed a few people right here my mom my dad um sadie beautiful girlfriend jake one of my best friends uh fitness guru um but i listed all these people right here very very these are probably you know very deep people in my life and then also jack he's just a random guy um and then i'm gonna show you right quick i'm just gonna type a name this is me miranda i don't know miranda in my life so uh hopefully there's not a miranda watching this um but these are gonna people right here this is just simply showing you how to type in people right here you get your name and then it actually if you identify them what this means by is is once you type all their names up you want to identify the type of relationship you have with them there's five levels of relationships you have with people and um it's all right here so level one this is basically your very small talk people is your people that um say if you go to the gym when you scan your tag there's gonna be a person at the desk and you might you know say a few words to them every single day more more than just how's it going you know maybe maybe say a few things like hey how's it going you know i saw the news last night weather blah blah you know you have you have some small talk with them um then you have your level two people which is uh your people that you're having small talk with but you go a little deeper into conversation you're talking about other people about big issues that are going on you lay out some opinions some ideas um but um you know you still you still have that guard up where you don't let anything out that they might they can judge you for then level three is where you're going to contest the waters you're going to try to say some stuff to get the other person to react to it you know you can offer your ideas your deeper ideas where people will really will judge you for your dreams your goals um and just try to see what they say uh then you have a level four communication this is your i mean relationship isn't people that you're completely comfortable with you're not afraid of being judged at all um you share your deep emotions your passions and stuff um these are going to be your your your close friends then you have your level five this is going to be your people that you've been around with for years who have been very you know your best friend your you know your girlfriend of a long period of time your partner of a long period of time your your mom your dad these are people you talk to literally almost daily you have a very strong spiritual connection with them uh these people are very important in your life so the first thing you want to do is just identify those relationships right now and um it's fairly easy to do so um you know your mom uh my mom me and her have a very good connection some put you know mom dad um then uh sadie jake so these people mean a lot to me um you know we have some very strong connections and stuff and um you know time doesn't really matter but you know very good connections then then there's jack jack's the guy that i don't go to college but um jack's the guy that for some of you are probably watching do go to college he's the guy that uh you know you maybe study with one two three times a week at school and that's about it and then on weekends he's always trying to get you to go downtown drink party have fun so i'll put jack and uh you know you kind of test his water she don't really completely you know you know he's not like a super close best friend or close friend but uh you know you don't go partying you just go in there just because you know he's there that's it you know he's a friend acquaintance no big deal then there's miranda miranda is your work partner um that uh you know you just have small talk with every time you go to work and that's about it so um that's just makeup people me use for this video but once you identify these people you can just check off their name soon as you type their name go ahead and check it off right here boom boom so you can go through the whole list you don't have to use every single one of these cells um but if you do that's cool if you don't that's cool too these could be literally all the people in your life and you could be perfectly fine with that so next thing is to go to the positive injection so we want to figure out what type of positive injections these people put into our life you know what type of positive energy they're injecting into our life positive knowledge you know there's three there's seven different areas right here uh health could be you know going to gym wealth could be just money managing habits and stuff wisdom you know just be someone that you could empty your soul out into talk to they make you feel good they give some really good advice um business uh this might not really concern everyone for this specific category but someone could give you some really good business advice um family and relationships uh people who help you strengthen your relationships with your family and your friends um you know your social leadership some of you guys not going to really have this this is people who have big like instagram followings youtube followings facebook followings uh people who lead a lot of people uh this would be something right here and then there's spiritual spiritual is be like going to church and stuff um you know praying and you know people encouraging you to do those habits so uh let's go right here let's start breaking these people down right here um i'm not really gonna do my mom and dad but i'll do let's see sadie she has a lot of good benefits and positive injections in my life but uh just one to keep everything unique uh she inject yeah she you know encourages me to go to church every sunday and and goes to church with me boom um um let's see and then uh she also has let's see she encourages fast food and this and this is like a double right here so uh something else she likes to encourage me about is uh just uh not spending all my money on fast food because i tend to do that a lot um but uh also it's a double so you know she encourages me not to spend all my money on fast food it's a double because i'm saving money but also i'm being healthy and you know i'm not eating you know very horrible american food uh full of calories and stuff so fast food um saving my health from some do that cool but you can do all this for your friends um jake he's a really good fitness person he helps me a lot with workouts and stuff diet tips and stuff so i've got tips workout and diet tips boom um he also teaches me a lot about staying humble and stuff or levels me out humble humble humble um business he's always there to listen basically with all my business business ideas he's very supportive i was gonna put that for city cool so i don't really want to go like completely into like my personal life but just kind of breaking things down of how i see it um because you really want to go into really deep with all this um so let's do cool so we got jake satie down uh let's do jack jack is the guy that um you know you go to college with you study with them two or three times a week but also likes to party uh so let's do wisdom mental this could also be like your education thing so jack um helps study boom you can also do if you're passing your tests and stuff um if you're passing your tests and stuff at school because you have someone to help you study there's more likely a chance you're going to pass college and if you pass college you're gonna have a greater chance of getting a good job or the job you want so therefore he's contributing to your success and the wealth of getting a good job so he's not necessarily directly helping me get a good job but it's basically showing that the addition he's adding to my life boom so you see how this works so you're just going to break it all down um and really go into these different categories of life and uh how these people are helping you in you know go deep dig dig really deep break things down and really level everything out you know just kind of like how i did like right here with sadie when you know she encourages me not spend all my money on fast food i'm also saving money and then also i am saving my health you know i'm being healthy i'm doing healthy decisions so you know that's two occurrences right there but you really want to break everything down um the positive category and you know really dig deep for all these people that you listed in your circle so next thing you want to do is go into the negatives so all of these people they have positives but every person has some negatives it's it's not you know it's bound to happen um i know uh you know not i don't really want to get personal with this one but i'm gonna go right here and let's say jack the guy that you're going to college with and stuff you know is like studying stuff but also he likes to party on the weekends he's always hitting up your phone hey dude come hang out with me let's drink let's go party let's let's go downtown and stuff you know he's always encouraging you and majority of time you say no but there's sometimes you go and it's just bad experience you know um but he he's injecting a few negatives in your life you know uh one your health jack um you know consume a lot of alcohol i know i just i just spelled alcohol wrong but uh you go downtown you drink you consume a lot of alcohol you also go eat fast food after again and this is all because of him and this is not just to sit there and blame everyone about things in your life because you need to take responsibility and control these specific things um but these are all like things that goes on when you go out with these people uh wealth um i spend all my money at downs another one i could add is sleep so jack makes me sleep deprived i eat a lot of fast food i eat unhealthy i consume a lot of alcohol i spend all my money so yeah he helps me two three times during a week but also damn like you know this is really hurting my health and wealth of my you know category and stuff right here so you want to just basically break down all your circle again figure out all of the negatives that people add to your life and you know some of these right here like really not completely negative but you know if if it's something that if it's a person that's in your life that you're allowing in your life and you can't take the responsibility to not go do these things with them you just need to cut them out cut them out your life stop hanging out with them stop saying yes and stuff because it's getting you into these situations right here so you want to break everyone down break all their negative injections down then you can go to finally the last step um this is where you want to list all the people again um that you listed in your circle you want to list all these people right here you want to go step four i'm just going to list jack for this one uh just because it's kind of hard um i didn't really list all the negatives for all these other people this is positives for but what you want to do is you want to break these people down um so the first thing you want to do is is positive points points right here uh this is basically is the total of positive occurrences number of positive occurrences of people right here so total amount of times jack's name comes up times whatever level he is so he's a level three so i'm gonna do let's see he pops up what once twice two times in my positive injections so i'm gonna multiply that by his level he's a level three so i'm gonna do jack times level three and it's gonna give me six so he has a total of six positive points boom so he has a you know pretty positive impact in my life but now what i need to do is i need to go do the positive negative impact he has in my life so he has one two three four he has four occurrences of negative injections in my life so again he's a level three so i'm gonna do four times three is 12 boom so he basically actually has like a negative 60 percent impact in my life i know you can have a negative 60 uh percentage um but you know you get the point he has a very strong impact in my life negatively uh you know for every positive point he has two negative points basically um so i need to make a change in that life because what you want to do is you want to come there in anything that's red any any person that is red you want to come there and you want to decrease that relationship you want to minimize uh time and energy allocated to that specific person so you want to move yourself away from that relationship um so what can i do with jack so again the situation he helps me study learn a week but he's also always blowing up my phones this weekend uh on the weekend to go talent downtown it stresses me out if i don't go um oh that's also something else i could add to you know if i don't go downtown with them um it's actually perfect with the mental he stresses me out out because he plays um let's see what's the word for it he stresses me out because he complains i didn't go down town with him them so um basically that's another just negative injection right there so um you know i either go downtown with them you know have fun with them and stuff but also have all these other injections negatively that affect me um then i mean you could put a positive you know he i get out with them but still it's not going to level out um but you know he's stressing me out plans i didn't go downtown with them so then you know if i don't go with them he adds a negative injection my life of stress from complaining and stuff that i didn't go downtown with them and stuff and that's just time energy i don't need in my life um so again he was a level three so i'm just do that again because i added another one so um he's going to have a total of 15 15 negative points so i mean he has a very strong negative impact in my life so i want to what's what's the action i'm gonna take to move myself away from this relationship so i want an action not just a plan i know i need to move myself away but what's the specific action i'm gonna take tomorrow um or today to move myself away from this relationship well so the only benefit the only reason why i keep him around is because he helps me study then and he has all his negative on the energy on the weekend i can maybe talk to him him to stop inviting me downtown or find a new downtown okay so you can either talk to him tell him to stop inviting me downtown if that doesn't work um find a new uh study partner boom so um yeah so he has a very negative impact my life so i need to move myself away so i can either talk to him tell him to stop inviting me downtown and he does not respect that i can just find a new study partner and stop studying with them and push myself away from that specific person so um let's just grab another one see us do jake jake uh so he is a level five uh relationship within my life uh so i can do right here go to the positives uh jake one two three um three occurrences of his name in the positive and like i'm not gonna go to the negatives or anything like that um so he's a level five he has three so he has 15 positive points um that's where i would add his negative points if he had any and then i would go to okay what can i do to elevate this is this is obviously a very good relationship for me to keep around a lot more positive than negatives what can i do to elevate that relationship and um you know not necessarily take it further but i just i need to maintain that relationship keep make sure it's in good standing uh because obviously he's a very good person there's a lot of positive energy around him um and coming from him on paper so what can i do to elevate it you know keep maintaining it you know keep it good uh well you know let me take a look at my life i noticed that i don't uh you know hang out with him enough you know maybe maybe i could do lunch with them every friday so um i can do so the specific action i can take to elevate that relationship is uh have lunch um or you know maybe because then that might contradict something else like you know maybe that's a negative now that you know gotta spend money with every friday on lunch so maybe uh something simple i mean obviously don't go too far into it because you know if you look at some of the positive some stuff could eventually turn to a negative um but you know if we can both afford lunch every friday and have the money he has the money and it's not a hurt on either of us then it's not a negative injection so um have lunch every friday spend some time get out there boom so uh you basically want to just evaluate your whole life uh or all these people and evaluate the in the positive and negative injections uh figure out whether they have a positive or negative impact in your life and then you want to create specific actions either elevate that or move yourself away from that relationship and that's it you know now you have actions to take and you go out and act on this and then what trust me do this thing in another 30 days you don't have to use the same people but reevaluate your circle again in 30 days figure out what names have dropped off because you realize oh this jack person so 30 days from now you realize you have no more contact with jack your life is feeling better you know his name doesn't even pop up because you don't talk so much you might have a new person you might have that new study partner um you can you can just break down your list you do this every 30 days uh you're gonna realize the people in your life you know you'll be aware of their pros and cons basically the negative energy that ends your life the positive energy and whether they add more negative than positive and you're really be able to um just be happier you're gonna notice a lot more positive flow and energy in your life and it's be very powerful so i want to hear what you guys have to say about this tool drop a comment below and you know come back in 30 days after you do this let me know again if if you're not going to take these actions though specifically then you're not going to elevate your life if you just do this become aware and then don't take any action with the data you've received in your life you're going to be in the exact same spot you are so really take some time do this good you maybe do it two or three times in a row the very first time uh maybe over time you know improve some of these but i recommend you just every 30 days and really evaluate your life so thank you guys for watching i hope this helps out with your life and uh have a good day
