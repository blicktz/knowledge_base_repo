Yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel and right now I'm currently editing yesterday's video I guess all but we have a very heavy intense day these videos are rendering my whole laptop is basically useless I'm gonna go sit outside actually get some reading in get some vitamin D and wait for this finish record hope you guys appreciate this natural nice natural light coming in take this off so I can actually hear myself think and what I just finished doing right now it's been a few hours is actually doing my personal wealth map my personal wealth map I do this on the first of every month this is something that's been truly game-changing if you take anything away from this vlog is to start implementing this in your monthly routine basically my personal wealth map is like a report card I give myself every month in terms of where my financial status is at right now I am simply taking an audit of all of my financials so to start off the first thing I do is take my monthly income I write down my monthly income this may be different for everyone some people are accustomed to getting two checks a month boom you may be a contractor you may get paid multiple times a month whatever however you get paid take all the money you've earned for that month write it down next thing you want to do is take all your monthly expenses how much money did you spend this month was it a thousand dollars two thousand dollars etc write down all of your current monthly expenses next thing which will do is you want to take a check of your liquidity how much money do you have available to you at hand right now I'm not talking about stocks bonds etc I'm talking about cash in the bank maybe cash you have in a safe or something how much cash do you have access to at this current moment so you want to write that down right there if you have a savings account checking account you want to take all of the money you have together excluding your tax account if you have account suicide specifically first taxes anyone write that down so now what you're going to do is you want to come there and take your total liquidity right now that's in the bank and you want to divide it by your monthly expenses so let's say you have five thousand dollars in the bank right now you want to divide that by your monthly expenses let's say if your monthly expenses is one thousand dollars that means five thousand divided by a thousand is five you have five months you can survive of the cash you have in the bank right now so after that that's your basically you want to write down that number right there so months that you can survive it's called prosperity so you know my prosperity is a few months your prosperity may be different it may be a few weeks maybe a few days even for some people who live paycheck to paycheck next thing what you want to do is you want to write down your net worth so this is if you own a house whatever the current market value of is your have your house whatever if you have a car any loans out like that or anything assets you own that's big like that obviously don't go around house to like own a TV for 200 bucks you know go over your big substantial size purchases also any stocks bonds any other investments you may have what are those current value debt and that's kind of like your net worth and then also to you will come there and take any of your liabilities now your net worth and your liabilities you're actually gonna kind of like subtract the two so if you have a forty five thousand dollar car and you owe forty thousand on it your net worth is five thousand dollars that makes sense so then you want to do is you come there and take all your liabilities and that is all of it debt you owe so if you owe forty thousand dollars on a car if you owe three hundred dollars on credit cards whatever it may be anything you owe that you want to add that up as well and basically what you want to do is you want to do this every single month the first I use a Google sheet and I basically have the dates for the rows and the columns is each one of these that's monthly income monthly expenses total liquidity monthly expenses muster survive on current liquidity net worth and liabilities and I track that on the first of every month and I basically able to track over the months and years how my income either grows or how it goes gets worse etc and it's really cool and something I strongly recommend doing you don't need to be a business person at all to do this you can be a college student working a part-time job it's simply just getting in the habit of understanding your finances and the more energy you kind of focus on optimizing and stuff the better more control you'll be with your finances and the more power you'll have in that area of your life which will mean you won't be that typical person that's always struggling their finances always broke with finances it's like playing planting a tree the best time to do it is now plant that seed let it grow over time just to show you guys some more stuff inside google calendar you can literally like book stuff to repeat every month so I have a lot of this stuff already all books for the first every month and obviously there's a few other things financially I do and just to show you guys right there let's see if I can get it to focus on where it says like does not repeat I simply go right there click on it and it gives you a full bunch of options so if like when you want this event to repeat so you just call it like hey you know complete personal off map and then repeat annually on April 1st weekly monthly on the first Wednesday or give you a custom and you can like add in stuff to repeat I schedule a whole bunch of stuff in my google calendar that it's just day-to-day operations even or even like you know weekly stuff I know for my agency there's a bunch of tasks that I have for weekly every week that are back to repeats I have different payments going out and stuff like that that just said in a google calendar to remind me I have stuff monthly quarterly and even annually inside my google calendar so I can make sure I get all that taken care of I just made probably one of the biggest mistakes I just realized that my road video mic has been plugged into my microphone or a headphone jack in my camera last vlog and all of today's videos until now so now the mic is finally working and I never even realized that whoa currently sitting outside right now really I think it's probably one of the best things to do when like you're working from home is switching up your environment and not just consistently sitting in one area another reason why I absolutely love my laptop and invest it in a really good laptop but again to add to your structure and your personal finances and stuff one of the biggest things I've ever done was go to the bank and I opened up three savings accounts so you have your regular personal account and then open up three savings accounts and at this time I did not have a savings account so I literally just had one checking account at a bank besides my one business checking account and what I did was I went to the bank and I opened up three savings accounts these three savings accounts are one is your investing account this is 10% of all your income number two is your education account again this is 10% of all your income and number three this is only going to apply to the contractors out there 1099 workers business owners people who are self-employed people who have to save up money to pay taxes and in the year and that's just a taxes account so if you're watching this you're a college student maybe or maybe you work a regular job then you do not need to open up a taxes account so let's say because I know I have a mixture of people what you want to do is switch your education account that's 10% of all your income and you use this account to grow and expand your mind I know back when I was more broke just kind of living job to job basically because that's when I immediately took the risk going self-employed and I literally counted on every single job we could get into the shop or every vehicle we could detail and there was a lot of times I wanted to invest money in a course or invest money in a book to expand my mindset to help with my existing skill set to grow my business further and you can't do that if you don't have the liquidity to actually invest into these educational resources so open up an education account and you save 10% of all your income that account and when you see an opportunity to say get a course that just dropped that you really want maybe your mentor offers to get you a few consulting sessions at a you know certain rate boom maybe if you're just a typical person a typical college student maybe this is your college savings account for books and resources throughout the year so you save the money now so the end of the year or when school starts next semester you have that money saved up as your educational fund now that 10% remains at all times there's you never change that 10% for the educational fund now your investing account this is your like your savings account so if you already have a savings account you want to move that money into this account or just use that savings account initial savings account as your investing account and your investing account you want to keep 10% of all your money in there or 10% of any money that comes in and what you do is every quarter you increase that by that 10% by 10% so if it's you know saving 10% starting out next quarter it's 11% then the next quarter it's like 12.1% then the next quarter it's 13.3% something like that percent you want to do increase 10% of that 10% every quarter and once you now note your investing account once you have three months or three months or three months is ideal some people do six months but at least three months expenses saved up in that account all the excess let's say you know you spend a thousand dollars a month expenses once you get three months of expenses saved up into that account and this is your lifestyle expenses it's not your your bills you pay now so if you spend let's say five hundred dollars a month on bills another five hundred dollars going out gas etc that's what you want your total lifestyle expenses so it's a thousand dollars a month you want three thousand dollars in that account once you hit three thousand dollars into that account you want to stop depositing in that account and then start depositing into a mutual fund into a различor anything on your community responds셔t into a formalized trust fund into that account you have if that's not easy yet where the custodian management of the future has started to settle so you can't start the trust that you have a nursing withdrawal offer Medicaid dedicated to save money and yourfront fee if that's not appropriate but that's always an ideal asset they have notaa financial entity like that and then you can help be an FYI fit Noahumbel my �in. If next call it is real estate for investment I know I know when I first started this a while back in that workshop so my me is quitting was about 1.4lic finances while back, I literally had like a few hundred dollars in my checking account and both savings accounts I opened, the investing and education one, and even the tax account. I literally just start off the absolute minimum deposit I needed, but over time it grows and becomes a nest egg for you.

And through this time right now with this pandemic going on, I am zero stressed because I know I have liquidity in the bank to last for almost a year of expenses saved up with my current lifestyle conditions and even restaurants and a lot of stuff has closed. So even my expenses have been kind of capped down a little bit too. So this is something that you want to start now.

You can even start it right now with this pandemic going on, go to your bank, get it set up, you'll be good to go and highly recommend it. And just like I said, every time you get your money in, you want to have, I use a Google Sheets to track it, but every time you get your money in, it flows into your account or however you do it, direct deposit, maybe you go deposit it in the bank, then you want to take those expenses. So again, if you're a self-employed person, you want to put like 30% in your tax account.

If you're not, if you still have a regular job that takes taxes out of your account already, you want to just deposit your money into your checking account and then take the percentages out of that check, um, deposit into your education account and your investing account. I'll put you in my vlog. That's so sweet of you.

Look at that. Ooh, look how cute she is, guys. Alrighty, guys.
