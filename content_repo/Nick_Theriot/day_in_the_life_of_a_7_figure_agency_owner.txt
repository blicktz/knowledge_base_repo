finally you guys get it here's a day in the life of nick terrio i don't know why you guys are interested when i do on a daily basis but um this is the day in the life so currently right now it's 5 15 in the morning uh i'm not your typical guru that's saying you have to get up at like five o'clock in the morning or anything like that i just simply get up at this time because it just works the best for my schedule uh we're about to go get a boxing session in right now so yeah so we're gonna go ahead go to the gym now and i'm gonna take you guys with me all right guys we are officially at the gym as mentioned today is boxing day i do boxing three days of the week and then i do kind of like push pull legs the other opposite three days a week plus cardio so we'll take you guys with me let's go get a session in all right guys just finished up nice boxing session with my coach rock rock you want to say anything kick ass take the day we've been working together now for about two years uh if anyone's in the lafayette area make sure you hit them up you do what just mostly boxing or boxing a little more talk boxing sweet man yeah bro well look i know you got to go so take care sure appreciate it see you next week all right we just finished up our boxing session and uh this is probably my favorite part about the gym i go to is that the breakfast is fire over here so uh usually after we finish working out grab a session eggs baking the toast all the good stuff low protein shake uh currently right now i'm kind of maintaining and i do a lot of like calorie counting and stuff like that so we're gonna eat and then we're gonna jump into uh meetings for the day so we'll see you guys back at the house all right guys we're finally at my desk now it is currently 8 0 2 a.m 8 0 2 a.m so this is basically the kind of time i set up my desk uh from like eight o'clock to like nine o'clock this is where i'm gonna do kind of like content posting twitter instagram reels tick tock all that good stuff uh i'm also going to reply to messages i just opened my slack right now i currently have 13 messages to reply to uh so that's about to be fun so usually i i spend about 30 minutes replying to messages stuff like that um also i'm gonna write down just various things while i'm working on like you know just things that are popping up add that to do list but uh yeah um kind of talking to zach guy that's filming this video right now behind the camera and uh you know a lot of people talk about like morning routines and everything like that i'm kind of like anti-morning routine i don't know i just i think you just wake up get get work done uh right now i'm currently going to the gym in the morning before i work out or before i actually start working and that's just purely because that's the time my boxing coach can work with me so i kind of just have to do that time but for the most part i'm just kind of hey do whatever works for you get up get some done and that's exactly what i'm gonna start doing now yeah let's build this house so we'll see what this guy looks uh i mean you're already looking really good going into black friday here though like i'll show you an example from last year no problem at all but i want to make sure that if you need to go like spend 30 to 50k a day we can't all right so we just finished up uh all the calls for today uh like three hours of calls not terrible but uh it's meetings so mixture of meetings did some with my students uh then we also have a few clients that are prepping for black friday so let me tell you guys we got a couple brands next week that are projected to do like seven figures just next week so i am super stoked with black friday next week um but yeah mixture client calls uh some student calls and now we're gonna grab some lunch before we uh start filming youtube content today because that's the next role for today welcome to behind the scenes of what you guys see on a weekly basis uh if you watch the house video you know i was gonna turn this into the studio this particular room and this is pretty much it uh we got the lights everything uh we got the new sure smb mic which has been sounding phenomenal in all the videos um you know i did an okay job at just quickly throwing some wallpaper on the wall uh not really the best you know job it could have been but hey guess what you can't see it in the video so that's all that matters um but yeah so i'm gonna film some videos now got like three or four videos planned out for today i typically film every thursday between 1 and 3 p.m so i do all my filming for the youtube channel uh film three videos and that's it but yeah so we're gonna have some fun after this so i'm gonna jump right into this i'm gonna take this screen share put it give me my good amount of ideas uh to kind of like for you guys um but you can have your own you can literally just go in another way it's like a slideshow you get the rough trap over everything else becomes this is not your typical everyday thing but when you just bought a new house this has been come an everyday thing um got some new artwork from iconic and honestly i forgot what i ordered i know it's boxing something uh to go the little breezeway by my bedroom so we're gonna figure this out let's see what this looks like oh it's actually not as wide as i thought it was gonna be oh yeah that's actually pretty sick you guys get that wait hold up let me flip this around so if you know you know but one of my favorite movies ever is creed i know you have like the rocky fans well creed is the modern day rocky um so i got this one remember the name so you know when you're waking up in the morning see the shit make people know when you working to remember the name what are you freaking out for dude you remember the name um but yeah we're not gonna hang it up today just because of uh don't have the hardware but yeah so i'm gonna shoot some guns now so we're gonna load up the car and we'll see you guys at the gun range you know weird weird all right so we just finished up shooting and everything um at one of my favorite spots for sushi right now about a tear up some nigiri so we're about to show you guys how to do sushi right in a second it looks so good on the camera the absolute best what are you doing dude oh you want to play i know what time it is for you so it's like i don't know 7 a.m now or 7 p.m now when you wake up at 4 45 a.m you kind of just everything's a.m but uh yeah guys hope you all enjoyed today this is uh i would say uh i wouldn't say it's like a super everyday thing but it's it's pretty damn like at least once to two to three times a week um this is how things go obviously i wake up every morning um at 4 45 a.m but uh you know i don't go shoot guns every day or anything like that so um but hope you all enjoyed today's video uh usually i end up the night i go to bed like 8 30 every night and uh you know from like 7 30 8 30 i'll just
