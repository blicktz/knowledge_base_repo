yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today we're gonna be talking about a t-shirt brand that we recently took on and basically we took them for about 25 30k months doing their first 70 000 a month or maybe second and third 70 000 a month but basically long story short took about 20 30 000 a month we helped them you know cheap about 70 000 plus um keeping the ad account simple broad all that fun stuff right there i'm gonna show you all that in a second so really cool case study we're gonna dive into before we get started make sure that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and let's hop into it so t-shirt brand does seventy thousand dollars plus just to show you guys uh this is from april 1st april 30th and you know show you guys the shopify screen dashboard whatever uh for all those people say oh that's fake yada yada yada whatever cool i mean here showing you everything if you're thinking it's fake hop on a call with me um if you meet the minimum criteria at least 50 km off hop on a call with me and i'll show you all of these um on our strategy session together so shopify facebook ads so the facebook ads account simply what we did was we hopped in the account and we simplified the hell out of it this is literally the only three campaigns we created uh they did have some other campaigns in there that they had ran before we get started so these are not the only three campaigns in the account but the three that we created uh has holds and container where we keep all of our our ad mock-ups essentially uh things we create before we go into creative testing uh our creative testing campaign and then our main scaling campaign so you see right there we only spent about sixteen thousand dollars um so yeah i mean it's for close to five x return on ad spend for the month granted there's a few things to note here uh they did do a few email blasts this month as well they're only spending on facebook and they did get a lot of repeat buyers this month so um this facebook ads portion is probably rough about forty five thousand dollars um anywhere from up yeah i'll say thirty five forty five thousand dollars in revenue the facebook side drove and you know i got something else to talk to you guys about regarding like triple well better tracking on that outside right there but long story short they absolutely crushed it what we essentially did came in the account create our campaigns went in there um our scaling campaign literally there's just one ad set in it broad and then we went through the account and we looked at all of their prehistoric top performing ads so got in the account looked back at the last year we found all of their top performing ads we put them in our broad camp our broad ad sets and we just turned it on let it go and essentially the reason why from this is because they never use broad yet uh use a lot of look likes and interest which we all know now limits your potential to grow and scale your business and spend more money to make more so we did that and then also to just to try to see you know what returning on some these ads are off about a month or two if we get those to re-spark again and we did i mean that's essentially what we did for the first half of the month and then through creative testing we're able to find some new winners we tested some new copy iterations we tested some new um like kind of creatives that they already had on the file and that allowed us to also help there's a few in here it's like some of our new stuff as well that we put inside of there now next thing is we got them on triple well but it wasn't until the end of them towards the end of the month we actually got the full like everything set up properly april is our first month using triple well completely some of our clients got on in the beginning of month some of our clients last week but it wasn't towards the end of the month that we actually were able to properly use the tracking capabilities just due to the lack of knowledge and how to properly use it but we now that we have that in play all of our clients are pretty much using triple well we know how to properly use the tracking all that good stuff and i highly recommend it i will have a video very soon on this probably being out in about two weeks for the triple well side now other actions that we did we didn't just come inside that account create an ad set put all their ads together and boom that's it we did some audience research we scripted out a few ads for them to film so actually go out there and film based off things that um you know we kind of see fit and then obviously we did some copy testing plus some editing of new videos to test so that's it like we kept it very easy very simple and is why we did really good numbers again just you know restate they did kind of do a restock as well so between that restock um the facebook ads being good and then the just email accumulation of everything they were able to crush this month um a little over five extra hours i said four four four four point five five five five something like that i'm just doing mental math in my head so yeah absolutely crushed it and i guess there is a few things that you guys likely have questions of when it came down to the main top of funnel broad campaign as we found ads not working anymore uh we did turn them off so i do get that question a lot on our channel hey you obviously test a lot of ads you put them inside your main top funnel campaign but how don't you have like 50 ads running well that's because what we do is we turn off ads as they stop performing and as you can see right here there's a few in here that were turned off and basically it's ads that just weren't performing anymore now triple l once we start using triple l towards the last week for this particular account we didn't notice a lot of over reporting there's a few ads inside the ads manager showing like a 3x triple l was showing like a 1x and a few ads in there i was showing like a 1.1 1.2x and seeing about 3 to 4x with triple l so there was definitely some data discrepancy between triple l and facebook ads and obviously we're gonna go with the triple l data not the facebook ads data so that is starting to help us across all of our accounts yes it makes the ads look less the ads robust and stuff like that look less sexy in the ads manager but profit at the end of the day what matters uh for the business now for the creative testing side too um other questions y'all might likely have again what we did was with our first round of like just copy testing we basically took our one or two top performing ads from here we took one top performing ad from here and we basically went inside and created like batch one two um and we tested some new copy against that ad or actually it was batch four and five um batch one two and three these were some ads that essentially we did was is they they've had a lot of creatives this client had a lot of creatives already ready to go when we came on board uh so we started testing those creatives that he had sent us over to us so between that and then obviously four and five assessing new copy we created about 10 different pieces of copy um when this client came on and actually one of them was able to like revive the kind of performance for a particular ad so that's just a few things right there also to note but yeah t-shirt brand seventy thousand dollars a month uh it's the first month they're working with this so you know our goal is to scale this business to i think like six hundred thousand dollars in a few months so uh it's be pretty crazy um but yeah happy to show you guys in terms of the t-shirts itself like they're pretty basic t-shirts just they're very like they're ultra refined and everything like that if you think like built and cuts and stuff like that um so a big problem or not necessarily a problem a big objective with this project right here is with a lot of the ads and stuff is how do we create them unique and how do we consistently resell the concept of a t-shirt that's well fitted looks good and everything like that so coming up with lots of new angles around this lots of new copy ideas lots of new creative ideas and things like that that's going to help propel this business forward uh keep it fresh keep it relevant um so like those are all different obstacles that we're working with with this particular project but really fun when you have really great product like their product is really that good so really great product you compare that with really good customer service paired up really good shipping and you pair that with really good ads you have a business that can do multiple six figures a month in revenue so really hope you guys enjoyed this um there's definitely some more videos in
