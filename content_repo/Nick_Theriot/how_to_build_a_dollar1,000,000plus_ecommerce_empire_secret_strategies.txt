I'm going to show you some numbers and run you through a few simulations of what your brand and some different key things to improve because a lot of people believe it's all about the acquisition it's all about the Facebook ads fix my Facebook ads and I can get some more sales and look I'm going to show you something that no one's probably ever shown you before on YouTube and actually run you through some simulations with your business that can drastically impact the results you will receive with your e-commerce brand so with that being said before we get started make sure that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday just like this one so let's get started guys okay how to grow a massive e-commerce empire how to hit your first seven figures how to take your six-figure business and really blow it up so you likely probably had six figures by just running some Facebook ads you're getting some sales and stuff but now you really want to increase your sales your revenue hit that seven figures and you're likely even getting capped out the more you scale with your Facebook ads you're seeing a drop in performance in terms of return on ads and you're really getting bummed out and you're really trying to struggle to figure out how to get more sales how you really grow the business because just simply spending more you see profits decrease and you're willing to fix this and here's exactly how you can do that so I'm gonna run you through a few simulations of some data some key points to really focus on when growing your business and all of these come together to really make a mega powerhouse of a brand as you go grow it over the next few years so in front of me right here I have a few different key things it's you know a few different sales and scenarios and acquisition costs repeat customer rate average order value lifetime value and that's because right here what's in front of me this is what the big dogs focus on this is what these big seven figure empires look at right now you're probably focused on just this right here it's all you're looking at on a day-to-day basis and you're so focused on this you're not focusing on the everything else and all this everything else right here is what really generates some massive impacts in your brand so let's take a look at this right here scenario number one right here your acquisition cost you spend twenty dollars to acquire a customer you spend twenty bucks on facebook ads tick-tock ads google ads influencer whatever you spend twenty bucks to acquire one customer now that customer spends forty bucks so your average order value for that particular order right there was forty bucks so you spend twenty bucks to acquire forty bucks you probably about what two extra turn on ad spend and that's it that's likely where a lot of you guys are at right now where you're with your shopify business you're in that range you're spending you get an order and that's it now repeat customer rate this is something that a lot of you guys probably haven't looked at or you don't focus on it you probably look at it maybe once every while oh I have a 16 repeat customer rate how can I improve that and then you think about it for two seconds and that's it and you keep going and looking at acquisition costs oh if I can only cut down my acquisition costs I'll have a better ROAS so repeat customer rate is something super important how often are your customers repeat like purchasing again and again and then if you look at the lifetime value over one year because this customer never purchased again your customer lifetime value over one year is forty bucks because they only placed that one order now that's over just one year so again this can change for some brands they might you know some brands look at over a 10 year the longer you can look at it the long the more you can understand how much you're gonna spend to acquire one customer so with that being said look let's look at scenario number two this particular person right here this e-commerce brand owner knows a little bit more about hey why are they only purchasing forty dollars of items how can we get them to purchase sixty dollars of items how can we get them to purchase more so you spend the same amount to acquire customer and then they purchase more they get upsold on something maybe you just raise your prices maybe you created a bundle of your best selling products maybe it's spend fifty bucks to get you know free shipping what is it what did we do you know how can we raise that amount they spend per order now I would like to say this is the more intermediate a little bit more the person that's taking some time some investment into marketing and stuff and learning a little bit more about marketing and understanding the importance of how average order value affects it so I would say this is probably the year one to two Shopify owner this is probably the year one Shopify owner or this person's a little bit more knowledgeable about all these key KPIs that really drive revenue but still their repeat customer rate they don't have systems put in place not really doing anything right here and this customer lifetime value is around 60 bucks because again they just never purchased again and you know the customer spends 60 bucks you spend 20 bucks to acquire a customer you know spend 60 bucks your ROAS is 3x they have a 3x return on ads but that's pretty freaking good and and again you you'll actually see these you know happen in the ads manager as well because they're spending more on that average order value so let's look at the more sophisticated Shopify owner the person that we strive to be to really help our brands grow lots and the things we do to help e-commerce brands grow add additional 50 to 300k a month in revenue to their business this is the person that's thinking long term that's the person that's been doing this thing for about a year to you know two to three years now they've been really pushing and growing their business and they understand the importance of all KPIs they understand the importance of app acquisition costs they understand of how how we can spend the most on acquisition against many customers as possible squeeze as much profit and revenue out of each one for the average order value and then also how can we keep them coming back how we can consistently keep giving to come back and purchase so let's look at this let's say we've done some work on our creatives we've really improved our ads and everything and we spend 15 dollars to acquire customers so we cut down that acquisition cost from 20 to 15 dollars so that's that's really good and let's just say we're still doing the same average order value you know we really pushed up as much as we can but hey you know that's about as much we can go that's cool that's cool but look at our repeat customer rate we're going from the person the customer that never purchased again to now the customer purchased four times a year and likely the mindset that went from this to this is this hey uh you know the person already purchased from me he's not gonna purchase again or maybe it's well he already spent 60 bucks my store he won't purchase another 60 bucks again or i don't want to bombard my customers you know i i don't want to spam them anymore i i hit them enough ads i just i just i don't want to do that to them anymore or maybe the oh i i don't know if my customers like my brand they haven't been coming back and purchased from me and it's likely because there's all simple limiting beliefs in your advertising limiting beliefs of running your store and if you really want to see numbers like this it's all about simply running some more email marketing campaigns to your existing customers i have a client of mine that literally sends a new email out to her existing customers every single day and she's getting a ton like 50 of her revenue comes from her existing customers her repeat customer rate is seven to ten times what a typical e-commerce business is it's amazing and again it's it's the nature of the business too because like for example i worked with a client that's selling high-end gaming chairs there's no way in hell we can keep pushing you know gaming chairs to someone that purchased one last week now clothing with a whole bunch of different skews new styles and everything like that we can do that we can afford to do that so definitely afford you know depends on the nature of your product and then also too there is strategies for both of them so for example high-end gaming chairs we can focus on referrals affiliates from our existing customers and clothing can be both referrals from affiliates and as well repeat higher repeat customer rate but we really need to milk those existing customers they purchase from your brand they love your brand they had an amazing experience now let's get them to talk more about your brand let's get them to share your brand and then lastly let's get them to purchase more i recommend for all of you guys watching this video grab a pen grab a notebook like this and sit down for an hour and actually self this question if i had to turn off everything my paid advertising my that and i can just use my email list of existing customers or i can only run paid ads to my existing customers i can only use my existing customers right now that's it i have i can use whatever tool i want but i can only use my existing customers so whether that's targeting facebook ads to your existing customer whether that's sending sms to your existing customers whether that's sending email flows to your existing customers but i can only use my existing customers right now to 10x my business next year how can i do it ask yourself those questions is it run more affiliate codes is it create new products that complement the products my existing customers purchase that works extremely well you know we uh i i was on a podcast i was listening to podcasts and they said they they had this like really nice like jewelry set that ton of people were purchasing those their evergreen product acquired a ton of customers from it and they then they took one particular piece of item like something simple like the chain just the chain that's it out of that pack and resold it to our existing customers and their existing customers were tearing it up so can i leverage a new product to my existing customers how can i get my existing customers to go out there and share more knowledge you know about my product and referrals and stuff like that affiliate codes and stuff like that for my existing customers so all stuff to look at but back to like what i was talking about right here this person this customer now purchases four times a year so they're coming back and their customer lifetime value now is 240 over one year now we spent 15 bucks to acquire customers spending that's going to purchase 240 worth for our product per year that's a 16 extra turn on ad spend and i know that's not up front you won't see that on day one this is day 365 when we compare our 15 to our 240 so this is just some really good stuff really good insight and so keep doing what you want your facebook ads but stop focusing so much on like the perfect account structure the perfect ads etc also look at your average order value how can we get them to purchase more also look at your repeat customer rate what am i doing right now to leverage my existing customers and how am i getting them to purchase more share my business more affiliates referrals all that good stuff that's going to massively impact my business now let's say right here this was one year let's say the typical customer sticks with me for three to four years that 240 times four is 960 we acquired one customer for 15 bucks and we're gonna make the net customers gonna spend 960 with us over the next four years so if we look at the big corporations like your grocery store i didn't know for one particular grocery store i go to we call it super one which is kind of like your typical grocery store down in louisiana uh for usa that's where i'm at right now if anyone ever knew you know they'll offer like a hundred dollars free of gas and you sign off their credit card to give you a hundred dollars free of gas and guess what that credit card also gets you more points for using their store when you swipe at their store and you can think about it like wow they're literally giving people away a hundred dollars of free gas just finding signing up their credit card literally nope nope it takes nothing to sign up their credit card just go sign up here boom you got their credit card and you know it's attracting a lot of people saying with that free gas 300 bucks of gas i mean that's that's pretty cool but think about like this when that 100 bucks free gas that's their acquisition cost plus a little bit of the promotions and touch commercials and stuff to get them people but think about it like this i go every week i spend 50 bucks 100 bucks a week let's just say i spend 75 bucks every week i go to the store 75 times save 75 times 52 52 weeks a year that's 3 900 i'll be giving to them in revenue now i've been using this store since i was 12 years old i'm 24 right now so let's just do this 3 900 bucks times 12. let's just say over a 12 year cycle i've spent nearly 50 000 with this particular store now granted this is not like the perfect perfect thing because i'm not spending 75 bucks every week you know i was younger i was probably spending five dollars ten dollars and i was just you know me throwing stuff in my mom's basket but still my parents parents pass it on to me i go there now too just like them etc so think about it like that look at the bigger picture sometimes and look at the average order value look at the repeat customer rate and for you smaller brands i don't need you to go do a massive thing like that you know you can't really afford to go spend you know let's say that was 50 that's 46 000 so i can literally spend ten thousand dollars to acquire one customer i'll spend 46 dollars with me over the next 12 years i mean not saying like something like that but you know keep up with your current acquisition systems but how can we get them to spend more let's just do one thing in place let's just literally just do free shipping for an order 50 plus boom perfect average order value just rose 10 20 okay repeat customer rate let's just make it a priority to send one email every single week to our existing customers to either promote a new product and then maybe send another email so two emails per week and the other one be more of a referral program let's launch a referral program and get our repeat our customers get them to refer us points and stuff so now we just did two things that's gonna help out this right here and it's gonna put you more in this place versus this right here so hope that helps you out guys this is a really great video to discuss i think this is super super key for a lot of key points a lot of brands that just do not focus on these things right here and actually running the numbers i know i've talked about this on the channel before but actually running those numbers and showing you what those things look like now if you're an e-commerce business and you're doing at least 25k a month in revenue and would like to add an additional 50 000 to 300 000 a month to your store and revenue then make sure you click the link below to book a demo call with me where i'm gonna show you exactly how we've taken multiple businesses to seven figures from six to seven figures using our strategies and implementing key things like this so click the link below to book that demo call if you're doing less than 25k a month don't worry i have an offer for you stick around keep watching my youtube videos as i will be releasing a course very soon and this course right here will literally give you all the systems and strategies we need to get you up to that 25k a month mark where we can start working with you because literally the reason why shopify owners work with us is because one they understand how to delegate properly so once you get up to a certain level it just doesn't make sense for you
