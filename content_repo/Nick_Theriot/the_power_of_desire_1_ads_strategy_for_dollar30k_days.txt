so back in the day i was running ads for this brand called metal address sign selling this little metal wall art and stuff like that and we were probably i don't know doing anywhere between 500 to a thousand dollars today really nothing major right not not nothing crazy at all so to really be like happy about and we were just kind of stuck there for like first two or three months and i just really couldn't like like to be fair like this was back in 2020 and i was still getting to get started with ads and stuff so like i didn't really know what i didn't know at the time and i didn't know about this thing called desire and essentially what desire is desire is basically like what you call out in an ad that people care about and then when you call that out and put that hey if you buy this product basically you can achieve that thing it creates a substantial impact in our ads and i basically went ahead and i tested this desire thing where you know instead of me just saying hey this is gonna look good on your wall and stuff like that i went ahead and basically created an ad that shows a husband buying this we got some videos and stuff like that filmed of the husband giving it to the wife the wife acting all excited emotional and all those good things right there and then basically just called out how like hey this is the perfect gift for your sweetheart now when we launched that ad it completely changed its trajectory of our business we went from just hey just a little good on your wall to hey this is the perfect gift for your sweetheart with visuals that resonate with that and then basically we went from a thousand dollars a day to be able to go over to 10k a day in revenue all by just simply channeling the desire of the marketplace onto that product and now actively calling out what people give a fuck about and then using that to say hey this product will help you achieve that now we didn't just do that for that client we've done this for multiple other clients over the past couple years these are literally just three random accounts so like you know this ad right here that spent over 106 000 like we actively called out a desire people cared about whereas like this ad right here on 106 we called out a desire no one gave a fuck about and we could tell by spin cost per purchase all of those good things here's another example right here this ad spent 185 000 whereas like this ad spent 107 what's the difference this ad actually called out what people gave a fuck about now this ad right here spent 53 000 this ad right here spent 396 dollars why because this ad right here actually called out what people gave a fuck about so when i look at people complaining about ads not getting spin that's the first thing i always look at like are you actually calling out something that people give a fuck about and then are you like saying it in a way that actually is going to resonate with them because that's going to create a substantially big impact and performance right there now like i said desire essentially what people give a fuck about that's the easiest way to say what is actively on people's mind right now that they give a fuck about find interesting find curious things like that so a lot of people like i was in that example right there with the metal signs it's just hey product hey my product is awesome buy my product my product does this my product is five feet long my product is amazing bye bye bye bye and you look fucking retarded so here we're swapping it and we're basically calling out hey do you want to scale facebook ads hey are you trying to hit million dollars a month at your shop five store then saying here's how you can get there by doing xyz or here's how xyz product can get you there and look how amazing your life will be once you get there so you're calling out what people care about then you're showing them your product and all that good things so again people gonna stop the scroll when you call it what they give a fuck about long story short so desire equals sort of starts off in the hook that's going to be the visual and that's going to be the text when i called out the you know like the perfect gift for your sweetheart right like i started off with the first three seconds of the man giving it to his wife his wife like being emotional and stuff and then the text hook said the perfect gift for your sweetheart i'm showing the visual of the desire i'm also showing the text of the desire as well to really capture their attention now if you have the wrong desire like in my case or like technically i wasn't even selling a desire like i mean yeah like i could technically say i was going after desire for people that are looking for something good to put on their wall but let's be real here how many people are actively just like who i want to look something good on my wall it's like small group of people very hard to scale that's why we're doing like 500 to a thousand dollars today but just the desire we had was just like not to where we needed to be so the right desire is going to allow you to scale faster and at a more profitable rate it's the big thing you need to know every desire is also going to have different sizes so like there'll be some desires that will scale well in the beginning but will be capped at and we have to go find a new desire because like we're just essentially maxed out on the current desire we have now so here's a good example right here this is like literally just a percentage of people that like certain colors and like there's certain people that you know like blue for example is 42 percent most popular whereas like gray for example is 2 so like if i wanted to sell to the desire for blue like i have a 42 percent more likely to be able to scale higher and all those good things and like if i want to sell to the desire of like people like gray for example but at two percent right so substantially lower in terms of scalability and stuff like that this is also pretty cool right here i like to use google trends a lot when i'm searching up different problems desires things like that so how to lose weight versus how to get abs for example like how to get abs substantially less people in that marketplace whereas how to lose weight has substantially more people as well also key note here notice how it trends at different times of year most desires are going to be evergreen but there will be certain desires that trend so like for example i think it's like let me let me just literally pull this up in google trends i want to say it's like kids gifts or like gifting for kids let's just say kids gifts there we go and then let's do past five years yeah so kids gifts like pretty much from january or like end of december all the way up until end of september right end of september or mid september it starts to trend up right so back in 2000 and i think it was 2023 was going this brand that sells like soccer balls and stuff these soccer balls were very unique right they you know they like lit up and stuff like that and this particular brand they did thirty thousand dollars a month all year long and then we started with them in august august 30k a month september 30k a month like none of our ads were taking off or anything like that october like right when they started catching this little upwards trend they went from 30k a month to 300 000 in october then in november they did 3.5 million dollars and then basically towards the end literally on the dot december 15th from december 1st to december 15th they did 2.5 million dollars and then like literally from january 1st to january 31st they did like 10k in revenue so imagine when multiple seven figures a month then all of a sudden boom you're back down to 10 to 20k a month you see the thing here is that we were scaling with the desire all of our ads were focused around the desire to gift for kids because that's when dominant kids gifts are bought is during that period of time right there so i would be stupid to be on the internet if like oh we just did 3.5 million 2.5 million december and then complaining about january february and march being 10 to 20k a month because i'd be completely ignorant to the fact that the desire has shifted in the marketplace and that we can't keep pushing to that desire we have to find a completely new desire to channel onto our product right there and that's a big thing there's been plenty of times we're working with econ brands and like their product only appeals to this particular desire right here and then like all of a sudden desire shifts in the marketplace their business crashes and they're like we need new creatives it's like no no no no we need a new desire we don't need new creatives we need a new desire and that's why i'm always preaching intention over quality or intention over quantity because if we're just focusing on quantity we would not be smart enough to actually go ahead and change the desire right there so that's why i'm big on research and all those other key things so let's just kind of keep going through this i love starting with benefits right so like the benefits of this celsius is energy focus fat burning metabolism endurance sugar-free healthy flavor like all of this right here right and if i like like look up some of these benefits right they have different sizes as well so like for energy for example substantially more on the search term whereas focus is substantially low and like fat burning is completely less right here right so like if i wanted to go and market this product obviously i would want to go to energy or focus before fat burning almost every person i know who drinks celsius what's the two main things they talk about energy and focus right i don't talk about anyone saying oh i love it because it's sugar-free yeah that's secondary benefits right but like it's not the main thing oh it's convenient right i don't know a single person who drinks a celsius is like i need convenience let me go grab a celsius it's like no it's like i need energy or i need focus and it's domino always energy out of those two so like your product will always always have like main two benefits that you can turn into desires right there so how is this applied to ads right how do you actually apply desire to ads so i got about i don't know 15 maybe even 20 uh creatives here that we're just simply going to review and these are creatives that my team or me did not make full disclosure these are just ones i found them foreplay download it saved it here half of these i don't even think i like uh but just to show you guys more what we're calling out here so say no to inflammation with hydrogen water so what we're doing here is we're saying no to inflammation people who struggle with the problem of inflammation we're basically calling that out and just highlighting the fact that this product helps get rid of inflammation but nick i thought we're talking about desires not problems look yes we are talking about desires here but i also like to look at desires just to keep it brain dead simple what do people give a fuck about okay in this particular case people give a fuck about getting rid of inflammation i think we're about to break a new record of how many fucks we said in the video right there but yeah so long story short here we're simply calling out what people care about what people give a fuck about you know what i'm saying and that's inflammation so we're calling that out and then we're introducing this new mechanism here i give this like a seven a seven right why because states know it's inflammation of hydrogen water i'm not sure if this this video be posted before my new mechanism video be posted but like we're introducing a new mechanism here but what's the benefit what makes this mechanism better than all the other mechanisms on the marketplace for inflammation that's what i want to know this may make this is like probably means that there's really no major reasons why this is a stronger mechanism for inflammation so that way they're simply just not highlighting that right there now stop chronic inflammation in just 14 days okay hold up here ftc we're about to call you because this is uh this is not that compliant i will say all right why am i saying this is not compliant because okay stop inflammation in just 14 days let's just be real here you're saying that i have chronic inflammation if you don't know what chronic means chronic just means like you've tried everything you've gone to the doctor dozens of times and they're just like yo bro like your body's just fucked like you're just gonna have inflammation the rest of your life and you're saying that i can drink hydrogen water and in 14 days out of all the peels and all of these expensive treatments and tests of them by the doctor like that 14 days hydrogen water out of everything it's just gonna magically fix it and not not reduce it stop it so this is a great example right here what's called uh an ftc claim an ftc claim it just happens where like the ftc can come in and literally literally sue you for every dollar your business made in revenue not profit so if you made 10 million dollars in revenue with your business and only profited a million dollars the ftc can literally come in and sue you for all 10 million and even though you only have 500k in your bank account they'll still sue you for 10 million you'll be liable to pay him back that whole 10 million and usually what happens is people who get sued by the ftc they just go to a new country that's why a lot of gurus you see online they just kind of like magically vanish and go somewhere else and you just never hear from them again long story short this is a great example right here of a completely uh uncompliant claim here now how could we make this compliant well first off i would say reduce reduce means that it's not stopping it stopping it just means it's gone in a way that's how consumers take it whereas reduce which essentially mean right here is that we're reducing these the reducing chronic inflammation now the cool thing about reducing is that reducing if you reduce it by 0.00001 you're still technically compliant so you don't even have to like really even have like a huge difference but just even a small difference for the average consumer you're still compliant there now the cool thing is is that if we're going after reduce we can also be even stronger on this claim right here of just 14 days like if people start to notice a reduction inflammation within the first 48 hours we could literally say reduces chronic inflammation in just 48 hours why can i be more aggressive when i say reduce because it's the minute people start noticing the benefits of the reduction of the inflammation right there that's the only thing i would have right here so that's my little analysis right here for this but again what do people give a f**k about inflammation they want to get rid of it we're calling that out and boom we're highlighting that right there i give this one a five out of ten just because this headline is completely uncompliant right here i went from puffy and bloated to a lean and defined face all right i went from puffy and bloated to a lean and defined face what do people desire a lean and defined face and we're calling that out now this is interesting right here because i love the visual right the visual looks good we're showing a puffy and bloated face here now i would love to do a split test on this where we also show a very like like face people want so something recently with our acne client i've noticed that every picture or video we show someone with acne or a before and after we get worse results but the pictures and videos we showcase of people with perfect skin that look absolutely amazing those get substantially better results right there so yeah long story short i would love to like actually try and showcase a lean and defined face here again i didn't make this ad so you know just giving you all that context happy man if you're watching this video all right cool signs of cron disease you shouldn't ignore but most people do take a look all right great example here what do people desire well they don't desire anything we're also too not even really like at a problem where a market right here this is what's called a hidden fear now again we're still calling out something people give a fuck about which is a hidden fear people are scared of cron's disease crone's disease here now in this case right here it's a certain certain portion of the market right that has crones and scared of crones not everyone is scared of crones so likelihood right here you might already be kind of experiencing some stomach pains at this moment and you're you're kind of seeing this guy lean over and stuff like that you're like oh shit you know he's leaning over i've been leaning over all day i've heard of crones it's nasty wonder if i should have it boom look at it so we're still calling out something people give a fuck about it's just a small portion of market of people in your dog's itching backed by science all right in your dog's itching what do people give a fuck about they're tired of seeing their dog itching you know they literally just want to see the dog like be happy and holds good things like that so in your dog's itching backed by science is just basically kind of like what makes this mechanism unique right here we're just kind of highlighting the fact that like this is also backed by science i wouldn't say this is a strong claim though in your dog's itching in 14 days reduces your dog's itching overnight things like that that's a little bit better more in your dog's itching for under 50 for example oh our favorite ones good old obvi always uh popular community and stuff uh burn stubborn fat very direct what do people give a fuck about they're tired of seeing this fat on their body it's been difficult they tried other things it just won't go away it's stubborn burn stubborn fat cool and we're also kind of highlighting a desired state right here good job on this now your pup in broader what what do people give a fuck about here i like yeah they care about their dog but yeah no it's just there's nothing going on here now let me emphasize this real quick imagine if we did a gifting ad i find that custom products does horrible when you do it like this like no one wants to put their pup's face on their like shirt or jacket or stuff like that but if people do it for them and as a gift it's a different story there's some type of like just i don't know like weird thing about customizing your own stuff besides like maybe like when you're in school and you're putting like your name on like your pin box and stuff so same thing here i just find this like just doesn't really give any emotion so it's just like scroll and that's what we're gonna do right here as well all right new year same you but stronger so this is more of like uh this was probably ran during like january new year same you but stronger basically just calling out the fact like girls who want to get stronger because obviously this is more like feminine in terms of branding and stuff like that introducing a new mechanism really highlighting the fact that you know it's only a dollar 74 um and then we're kind of showing that chocolate and stuff like that pretty decent i just think there could be better right here or like a girl who's actually like like i don't know what strong looks like from research because i didn't do the research for this brand but i would be curious here what does strong look like like is strong like a bodybuilding woman who's 180 pounds two percent body fat about to step on stage or is strong like a girl who has some light muscle tone and like sipping on this so two different perspectives of strong so i would be curious on that because if i can paint and show that desired stage and showcase someone actually drinking this that's going to increase the what i call um just the people that resonate with it to be fair skip the pills keep the hair so this is a more sophisticated headline and why do i say sophisticated because we're not just saying like keep the hair or regrow your hair and stuff like that uh we're calling out the fact that like people are tired of taking pills so we're calling out a pain point or a problem which is all the fucking pills i gotta take and then we're highlighting the fact that they'll keep the hair so the same thing is applied here keep the pills or skip the pills keep there calling out the fact that you know they want to get rid of the pills while also they want the pair and then boom boom boom so i like it best hangover supplements i don't like this at all i just think like for someone who desires like to get over hangover they're gonna be that it used to be like best way to get over a hangover fast how to get over a hangover like let's just go to google how to um oh wait let's go back to google trends let's see bum a bum how to get over a hangover boom how to get over a hangover fast boom oh actually no one really searches that quick way to end hangover you know like i feel like people would be searching these types of things right here but how to get over a hangover actually just works best right there so i would search those things like how to get over a hangover fast how to get a hangover for under 50 bucks 60 bucks things like that like actually something people care about that's what i'll be looking for right there same thing here all right for stronger hair growth throughout menopause it's what's inside that count so for stronger hair growth throughout menopause stronger hair growth this people would today desire strong hair growth throughout menopause so we're also kind of hitting on a sub identity like this is not people who just want stronger hair growth this is people who want stronger hair growth who also struggle who was who was also like going through menopause and stuff like that so all right next one wash and wear 100 plus times five star period underwear oh we're about to see now what's called a very very sophisticated ad right here now sophisticated means it's a very saturated market here this means that this person's already tried a variety of different period underwears so the protection of like you know like leaking through and stuff like that that's no longer the desire now it's like they want a period underwear that lasts and we're showing that by one by simply calling the fact period underwear but then the second thing wash and wear 100 plus times the fact that we're calling out wash and wear 100 plus times it's also the same thing here we're calling out what people want so very solid eliminate bed bugs fast discover how this is also like this is kind of how i was going about the um the hangover right eliminate a hangover fast right because people who have a hangover it's just like get it off my body fast boom this is kind of how i was going for now we're not showing what people desire but we're calling out what they're struggling with right now uh visually and then just calling out the fact that like hey this is we're offering some type of solution how i stop peeing my pants every time i sneezed uh what do people desire escape from embarrassment escape from dealing with this problem and things like that so we're calling out what people give a fuck about like yo i'm struggling with this problem let's call out that problem and then from there you know just basically offering it less cravings more energy and the weight just faded away again going through weight loss and stuff like that people who are struggling with weight loss it's like they're always hungry they always want to eat food and stuff so we're calling the fact what they want which is less cravings more energy and the weight just faded away if you overweight and stuff like that naturally you just have less energy and like the more you're always eating the more you're just like like fucks up with your your glucose system and stuff like that's where you just have more cravings so like yeah this is really good i like this slimmer now at 49 that i was in college here it's like i'm not saying it's bad i think it's just a clever way to showcase showcase the desired result which is getting slimmer minnow bone minnow belly gone naturally in 21 days or less all right this is completely false and the reason why i say it's false is because one is that like okay again fdc compliant here this means that every single person that takes this product whether they're a slight little bit of a minnow belly or 50 60 pounds of minnow belly everyone has to get it done within 21 days taking this product or it's completely uncompliant so in this case right here again in compliant because we're calling the fact that it's completely gone right and that's false so again it opens yourself up to ftc compliance all right next one 13 years of hormonal weight just disappeared now this is technically ftc compliance why because we're not saying how much we're not saying 50 pounds 60 pounds or anything like that like she could have had like maybe a pound of hormonal weight you know we don't have a technical like before and after here so eliminates menopausal symptoms up to 85 suppresses weight storing minimizes hot flashes promotes deep uninterrupted sleep shrinks middle belly by day 21 again shrinks we're not saying gets rid of we're not saying middle belly gone shrinks so good i like this absorbs 2000 better than powder terminic this one it's again very sophisticated very saturated market of people who are looking who literally struggle with the current product now and they desire a terminic that just absorbs better again still weird still you know just like very saturated not a huge uh desire so how do you actually do this now for video we talked about photos a lot of photos and stuff uh what about video so video we're simply going to call it the desire just like any of these things right here then we're going to show desire talk a little bit about the desire and stuff like that so how to scale facebook ads
