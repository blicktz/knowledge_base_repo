2.1 million dollars in 30 days with facebook ads what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick sari today i have an exciting new video for you guys we'll be going over a recent case study we did for a legion client we did 2.1 million dollars in 30 days but there is a catch not gonna lie for you guys and i will go over what that catch is specifically but before we get started if you're new to the channel you don't know who i am i run a facebook ads agency and i basically make this channel to give you free valuable content that you can deploy across your business to basically be able to grow your business and look the only catch is that one day i've been taking and consuming all this content you'll be able to be at a high enough revenue to work with me and my agency and we'll come on board and help your business scale seven figures from off so that being said let's dive into the video so 2 million 142 000 in 30 days with facebook ads and again there is a catch and i will show you that in a second just want to show you guys the ad account specifically we spent somewhere around like 450 000 i want to say total spend for the month and this was july 1st to july 31st 2022 and yeah this is a few campaigns we ran i will come back to and explain this account structure in a little bit but we basically just had each this this is an insurance product so because it's an insurance product we had to split some states apart so that's why you see like florida wyoming and then there was our testing campaign and we also are testing lead farm specifically we're doing a legion campaign where it's driving traffic to a landing page and pulling leads from that but you know we're also testing lead farms as well but so far we're noticing pretty poor quality on conversions as well on that side and that's another thing we did where we tested initiate checkout objective that's just something we wanted to test that's something i don't really you know keep track of from that perspective right there so um and we had two different forms we tested as well uh for the lead farm so long story short let's start jumping into everything to better explain this to you guys so you completely understand this step number one is know your numbers so we know the lifetime value of each customer is 2.5 000 2500 and this business has been around for over 20 years so we knew for a fact that this was true um this is through a lot of research digging into all of their customers and stuff like that so we knew 2500 lifetime value of their customer and also this is an insurance product so in that sense right there like this is all profit there's nothing to have a feel unless there's a claim or something like that due to the insurance side so we had to aim for a target cpa of 400 or less to be profitable and because it's a legion client that means that a 400 or less that that also is dictated not by the cpl that's dictated by the post um you know sales rep calling these leads and converting them which had to be 400 or less okay and anything over 500 was like hey like that's bad severe red flags we had to make sure that was taken care of as well so target cpl we needed to aim for was 35 as the goal 42 as long as you know we're not above 42 we can still keep spending anything about 42 we have to start turning down and then we just work our ass every day pretty much to keep that cpl as low as possible okay going into um that specific month of july we did 857 sales so if we do 857 times our 2500 our ltv um this is where the catch is at we did 2.14 million dollars in revenue for the specific client right here okay so that's how i got that that's how i pulled that 2.14 million dollars and we spent like four 457 000 so you can see you know you can do the math right there let's just do 450 let's do 2 1 4 2 divided by 450 almost a 5x return on ad spend okay so after we know your numbers you need to start diving into the market research okay so the main driving factor of what's causing them to buy insurance a lot of it is the main desire is to feel protected to feel peace of mind to feel um know they're safe if anything happens and that's kind of like the main desire we pushed and this is where it comes down to market awareness so your desires feel protected peace of mind at the end of the day but we have to uncover that desire in our marketing we couldn't just straight up and be like hey feel peace of mind feel protected because this particular insurance product had a very unaware market awareness okay again market awareness is where do we pick up the conversation at okay so where do we start the talk in our ads because no one is aware about this problem we can't hit problem aware market we can't hit solution aware market we can't hit product or even aware market we have to hit the unaware market so the way we hit the unaware market is by we use a hidden desire people have um and we use that and we out through curiosity and education content to strike up that conversation and then lead that into the problem so we exposed a specific problem in a certain industry and really hit the fear really hard so we're using the fear and the shock factor in that sense to grab attention hook people in and then what we did was is then after we made them problem aware we started selling my product and look this is one ad that'll take them from unaware to educate about the problem to the different solutions to why we're the best fit to here's how to take action now okay you don't need five different ads it's one ad that does amazing work with all this so again i have a lot of videos on market awareness on my specific channel so definitely check those out now the next one is market sophistication and there's also a beauty about this product is that we're in a stage one market sophistication which is very rare a lot of brands are in a stage four to five now which is constantly selling new mechanisms because of that this particular product we could literally just state the claim which is beautiful because we just have to state the claim of what we sell and boom people are into it so you know lose ugly body weight fast and so or lose ugly fat fast something like that now that we get all that done the strategies which is me hands it off to my copywriter which is my copywriter digs into actually pulling and creating ad concepts around this initial brief okay copywriter go ahead and you know write the body copy for the facebook ad the headline of the facebook ad the creative copy to use in photos or videos and things like that so like all of this right here is being used to um build start building the ad so it all starts off the copywriter um cover also put down some ideas and stuff like that for the actual creative side now step number four this is where my visual creator receives the copy they receive the brief for the ad concept and they start to build out um the creatives we need so we do we do one body copy one headline um and then we do three ad concepts around that specific or three creatives around that specific ad concept and we'll test three to four new ad concepts a week for this particular account three to four new ad concepts a week because we're spending roughly fifteen thousand dollars per day but some accounts will test as little as one or two um per week just because we're spending less now step number five is my media buyer takes those ads and we launch this new ads in the ad account um this is just simply inside of a testing campaign you can see each ad sets at a hundred dollars a day we're only using broad targeting here that is it we're not using anything else and then the second thing to point out at um for all those who are questioning how i build my return my testing campaign things like that go watch videos five six and seven of my seven part series on how to run facebook ads in 2022 i'm gonna also have a video as well that's a condensed version of that right you're over the shoulder of me creating these campaigns and it's called um how to build a facebook ads campaign from scratch and once we do that we start to analyze the ads um and we have different just formulas we look at if we had an ad that spent a lot of money plus a really good cpa it was a solid winning ads move into our scaling campaign and then if it didn't get a good spin it didn't get a good cpa and it wasn't a winning ad why and we start questioning ourselves why weren't these ads good and we try to look and see was these concepts just lacking engagement or they lacking conversions um and what can we do to build better ads better versions of that okay and again engagement just means that we have an ad that people want to see in their timeline okay um if people don't want to see your ad the likelihood of you having good performance um will be low you need a good ad it's a lot of engagement a lot of good attention um and for conversion side you also need an ad that sells people on your product if no one knows about your product or what you're clearly selling here um but it gets a lot of engagement you're gonna get a lot of good spin but terrible cpa so that's good to know this and then when you review this and you understand this you start to figure out okay well this ad had really good engagement let's apply that same factors for our next ad but let's also build a better sell side on the back side of that ad so if it's a 30 second video we'll build a better last 15 or 10 seconds selling the product to where people better understand what the product is now step number seven is we took these ads right here and we launched them in our prospecting campaign so um i will let you guys know on a full transparency we have started um testing both ways of of creative testing both you know secondary campaign and you know running the dynamic creative test so um hdb7 is our primary ad set we put all of our winning ads and you can see last month just this one ad set spent 350 000 this ad set specifically has been running for a long period of time this is not something that you need to you know like create a new ad set or something you find new winning ads now these other assets this is running the dynamic creative test um this is coming from charlie disruptor we did a podcast together and it's something that we've been testing i'm testing both ways and so far i don't have an official like hey which way i want to go with so i'm just letting you guys know that's why there's these other ad sets in here okay basically once we found winning ads in these we just put them in our hdb07 and turn that off and call it a day now just wanted to show you guys what it also looks like with all the ads in that ad set you can see last month um we had one ad spent seventy thousand dollars one spent 56 one sent forty five thousand yeah and pretty straightforward with that so um you will also notice that the cpl is quite higher than the target that we need to hit and the reason why is because we're not only seeing roughly 70 percent of this the leads coming through um from facebook so that's why we also look at a google sheet each day with all the leads in the back end and all that spin per day to get an overall cpl based off spin and what's in the back end if you look at the ads manager you it's just gonna mess you up okay because you're like well i'm gonna 47 cpl but it matters what's overall because at the end of the day that's what's in the bank account so that's really important right there to understand now step number nine um this usually comes down to like budget management everything like that so for us the particular problem with this or a specific scenario but this account was um this account is a corporate account okay and with corporate accounts they have massive massive budgets okay so they were like hey we're deploying 450 000 this month and we don't want to hear any if-ins or buts about spending less or more like literally we're gonna spend 450 exactly so for us it was very um crucial for us hey we cannot touch budget the only thing we can control is better ads better copy better creatives okay so we anytime performance starts to dip or we want to reach a better cpl we have to just go hard on testing new ads like literally if we need to test one a new like a new ad concept every single day that's what we had to do to improve performance okay um and we've been working this account now for almost a year i think it's gonna be um 10 months um going september 1st that we've been working with this particular particular account and we've been spending roughly 300 000 a month 450 000 a month um all of 2022 so we've been spending a lot and this has been the strategy to keep up performance with that not everyone gets this like i guess you could say opportunity where it's like hey we have a massive budget we're gonna spend regardless and that's when you have to do more of like what i've done in my other case studies where it's like look at the last three days if you're hitting target roe ass scale up look at the last three days if you're below target or a scale down easy so and step number 10 go back to step number two and keep performing this because look um people are like well why do you get testing out on a weekly basis because if you if look if you're hitting your your seven figures i'm off are you hitting your goal cool like just keep running the same ads um and likelihood you'll eventually burn those out and then you'll be like hey i need new ads keep testing new ads each week with the intentions of building better ads with the intentions of growing your revenue okay create ads with meaning and create ads with the objective of building better ads that's going to take your business to the moon okay um the ads that we ran for this account at a thousand dollars today were different than three thousand dollars today five thousand dollars today and then at fifteen thousand dollars they completely different as well so we run different ads at different revenue ranges because or different ad levels because their ads honestly are better they're more um you know specific like i'm not gonna say they're more tailored there's better ads they've been built better um they have their really amazing engagement side really good conversion side um they just speak to our audience better and we can spend substantially more in revenue so but yeah guys that's pretty much just a quick little case study for you guys i wanted to share with you guys i'm also taking a different perspective on it as well um but honestly at the end of the day the same marketing fundamentals we use for e-com info products app installs legion are all the same comes down to creative copy and offer and making sure you have an offer people want make sure you're really hitting your creative that really digs deep into people and resonates with people a copy and then
