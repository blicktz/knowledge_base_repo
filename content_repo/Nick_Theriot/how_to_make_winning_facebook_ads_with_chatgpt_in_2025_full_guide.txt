So about a week ago, I uploaded a ChatGPT training with AI and had to take it down about 24 hours later just due to me leaking some stuff about a client that are in the A and got in a big, big storm. So today we're going to be revisiting that video, but I'm actually going to be doing it live with you guys, my YouTube lovely fans. And today we're actually going to be picking a product and writing ad scripts for this particular product, writing photo ads, video ads, all with ChatGPT and it's going to be so good.

You won't even be able to tell it's AI. And that's the whole goal with today's video. We're going through ChatGPT, the research process, all of those good things for y'all today.

So with that being said, let's dive into the video. So I actually don't even have a product to do. So we're just going to ask ChatGPT, hey, I want to be a millionaire.

What products should I sell on my Shopify store in 2025? Please give me exact products. Oh, that's actually interesting right there.

Smart posture correctors for remote workers. I'm just going to do a search real quick and see if they have anyone uprightpose.com. Whole goal here is just to simply find someone that's selling something like this so I can actually go ahead and do this.

Cool. So I'm going to use this just to get this started. View uprightpose.com.

If you watch the YouTube channel, that's awesome. So all I'm going to do is click open a new ChatGPT. I'm going to make a ton of ChatGPTs today.

So I'm just going to give that to y'all. I'm going to click on search. I'm also using 4.0.

And I'm basically just going to say, here is the link to my product. Please analyze the page and give me features, benefits, description of my product, how it works, what it does, and all the good reviews of the product. Also, please describe to me the product as if I'm blind.

You guys are going to see here in a second. Just trust me. What we're first on now is we're just simply going ahead and building a product doc that we can consistently give to ChatGPT to basically go ahead.

And anytime we're going to reference this product, we're going to go ahead and build a document around it. I say build a document around it. We're going to have one document we can just keep giving it.

So I'm just going to open up a new basically page. I'm just going to call this product info. We go ahead and paste that in there.

I'm just going to go over this. Upright 2.0 is compact verbal devices. Sign up users, improve their future through their future.

Good Lord. Posture. By gently vibrating when it escapes out.

Features. I'm going to delete this. I hate when it does this.

Benefits, improve posture, enhance confidence, increased focus, and productivity. Awesome. Description upper as a sleek whiteboard design attached to your upper back using hypo.

Genetic adhesive. Optimal. Cool.

So I'm going to bring this to another page. How it works. Awesome.

User reviews. And I'm just going to do visual description of the product. I don't want to call it.

I don't want to say that it's for like a blind person. The reason why I say that is because I want to try to accurately describe to ChatGPT what this product is. All right.

Awesome. This is pretty good. I'm just going to ask it.

Please list me more reviews for my product. I just want to get a couple more reviews. All right.

We'll do that. Copy that. We're going to come back in here.

So now that we have product features, benefits, description, how it works, user reviews, and like even someone who's literally blind, here's how the product works. We have a good description of our product. Now what we want to do is actually go ahead and start the market research side.

So the whole goal here is once we have the product info, then we're going to be able to give that to ChatGPT plus the market research. And then what's going to happen from there, that's going to dictate basically all of the copy and like ad scripts, photo ads, and all that stuff we write moving forward. So because this product is a lot on posture, what I'm going to do is go to site, S-I-T-E.

I'm going to go ahead and press, I don't know what these are called right here. And then I'm just going to hit site, reddit.com. Then I'm just going to search something like posture.

What's going to happen here is that this is going to give me a long list of basically a bunch of different threads of people talking about posture, complaining about posture, different personas, et cetera. I'm going to get a lot of information about people, long story short, that this product could be promoted towards. Now, the reason why I like to use reddit and recently switched over to this, and I have to thank one of my buddies, Nicholas Virgil, on this because with reddit, it's substantially more people that are vulnerable and talking about deeper level things.

And there's way less ads in the sense of TikTok, someone could be, someone could be paid to say certain things. Whereas reddit, I've been finding a lot more people that dig deeper into their feelings and their emotions and honestly complain a lot more on reddit. And actually those things are really good for me to actually use in my creatives.

So lately I've been using reddit for all of my research. I've been finding my ad creatives are substantially better in terms of the copy part due to the fact that I know people from a different perspective than just kind of like what they're saying on TikTok and stuff. So I'll type in things like posture and I'll go through all of these different articles.

I typically like to look at ones with the most comments. So like this one right here, how to consistently improve my posture versus this one with 60 comments. This one has 40 comments.

This one, I mean, this is just a thing with followers. So I typically like to go to the ones with the most basically comments, and I'll just basically go ahead and open that into a new tab. And I might like pull up a couple of these.

Another thing is I might do is go ahead and test different things. So like that one right there went directly at posture. Something else I might do is work from home back pain.

And you see right here, there's barely any comments on these. That means to me that it's not like a huge problem or it's that particular thing I searched. It's just not a relevant thing to my audience of what they're feeling.

So here's a good one right here. How do you guys take your spine during work from home? That's a good one right there.

Back from work. Let's see. Another one might be hump back.

Hump neck, neck hump be fixed. Can you actually fix so I'll just hop. Anyone here says got rid of the...

All right. So that's interesting. It's a different one.

Hunch back. It's another example. And this is where I still do things manually.

I was experimenting with using AI do this for me. But to be honest, I still wasn't getting good copy from it. This is the manual side.

This is the only thing you stop through manually and read through all of these different articles. Now from here, everything else will just be pretty much automated. And this is where that aspect of just like human element really comes in play.

So here, how to fix this posture. I'm a beginner. I have no idea how to start.

I'm actually going to type that in. I'm going to go to my market research. And I'm just going to start pasting this stuff in.

For the market research side, I'm just pasting in stuff that I like. And then I'm just going forward. I'm just going to type in something right here.

This person has a big hunched back. Now, what am I looking for? For me first, the first thing I'm looking for, number one, any headlines that pop out to me.

So like example, that was a great headline that popped out to me. Other things I'm looking for are different types of people that are buying. So people that just work from home, people who, you know, in this particular case, like might be a girl that like dances or does some type of thing.

I'm looking for different desires of my audience. So like, for example, right here, they desire better posture. And the reason why, how to fix this posture, meaning the inverse of that, which is like, Hey, I want better posture.

So what they're really saying. And then the next thing I'm looking at is what solutions people are recommending. What do people hate about those solutions right there?

So this one talking about extensions, you need to start exercise, open up and stretch chest. Those muscles are likely pulling your shoulders around the posture. So shoulder flossing is a great way.

So like, that's a great example of a solution right there. I won't say the exact, like what thing they do, but different type of workouts to improve posture. Then just to kind of go through, you want to just switch over your upper back, band pulls, the five workouts to strengthen upper back to improve posture.

Also some stretches as well. Basically, I'm a stretch to chest muscles, put your wards down, you need to strengthen your posterior chain. Oh, this is a good one right here.

So this is basically, this person just talks about how you need to strengthen your posterior chain. I find that a lot of my problems were centered around my hips, weak external rotation, tight minor muscles cause nerve pain, weak major muscles like glutes, hamstring, that's got my hips right. I found that the rest of my problems are my upper back.

Ploture has nothing to do with muscles, tight and strength. You can have good posture, but a super tight chest right back. It's, it's unconscious.

You need to force the posture you want concisely and you will start using it unconsciously. Okay. This is a really good one.

Honestly, I like this whole one right here. There we go. Now, as far as what am I doing with this market research, I'm copying some things as a whole that I like, and then other things I may just copy a word or two.

And then other things I might just write notes down based off what I'm learning from these people right here. All right. I'm going to move on to the next one, just so I can go ahead and try to get a couple of different documents in here.

Also going to copy the headline. I do like copying these headlines just because, uh, it also gives me more data too, as well. All right.

I'm going to go and put this in just because a couple of things here, we're have audience persona. And then we're also talking about the problem here that's going on. Ooh, that's a big one right there.

When people sit up, let's see, sit up properly. It's not as comfortable. Also another key thing here, posture is a conscious choice and need to train the unconscious mind.

A lot of people talking about different stretches. Also want to look at that. Okay.

There's no comments on that. There we go. This is a good one right here.

Basically going over another thing they're using. All right, I'm going to move on to the next one. How do you guys take care of your spine during work from home?

Future. I'm just also going to do something in here. Future or reference.

WH equals work from home. I'm actually going to copy this whole thing because it really goes deep into someone who's struggling and then kind of what are they're questioning during that time. So this one talks about chairs as well.

And people seem to be struggling to find good chairs for like locally. So that's like another key thing I'd be looking at. One more just from this.

This is one here. Six. We got rid of the Newogers hump on their neck.

Yes. Good Lord. There we go.

So put that in there as well. Oh, that's a big one. Looking at the phones.

I was going to look a little deeper into this. That's a good one right there. Oh, this is another really good one.

So what makes this good right here is for this one right here, because this one right here is someone who's actively looking at basically like potentially solving this with a solution. And then this one right here is sitting in a position isn't really the issue. It's locking into one position for hours.

So this one's also going a little bit further into the actual issue itself and like further explaining like what's going on. So that's what makes that one really good. So it's going around the belief around the problem right there.

And then we're going to actually toss that in there as well. I'm also going to add some notes to this one. Limiting screen time can be hard hard if you have to work from home on the computer.

Can't just afford to quit my job and not get any work done. Also, another thing I'm going to note down in this is that a lot of people are recommending different workouts plus stretching routines, but due to a busy schedule, this can be quite challenging to stick to and doesn't build up a good habit. Habit will be a big issue for people trying to fix their posture as if they are not reminded about it.

They will forget and keep sitting in a bad posture for hours before realizing it. All right, cool. So this is actually a pretty good research doc to start off with.

Now I've have research docs sometimes with one to two pages like this. I've also had research docs where I had 30 pages before. Long story short, this is a pretty good solid amount right here.

And if I was doing this not on a video, I would spend anywhere between two to three hours on the research side. Again, keep in mind, I'd spend two to three hours going through all those Reddit oracles and stuff like that. What that's going to do is it's going to give you a solid amount of data.

That's also going to help you out over say the next month of writing ads, because we'll continue to reuse this document over and over and over as we create new ads. Now that we have our research doc put together, I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going to simply download this research doc. And then I'm also going to research or download my product information doc.

And then I'm just going to make another doc and we'll call this add ideas. Now we're going to go back to ChatGPT. I'm just going to click open a new chat.

I'm going to go ahead and upload these two documents to my computer. And then I'm basically just going to tell ChatGPT that, hey, or I'm going to actually say, hey, these are two documents I've built for my business. One document includes all the research and the other document includes all of my product info.

I want you to only reference these docs moving forward. You are not allowed to use any other information from other sources, prior knowledge, or online content for the remainder of this chat. Please restate the instructions I've given you.

Now the next thing I want to do is basically just ask it very simple question as a high level marketing manager with the goal of growing revenue for the business, please list me the highest to lowest likely to convert based off research doc ad angles we can use to scale and grow the business. Now, simply from here, now we're starting to have our different like basically ad angles we can use from our research. And then from here, this is where I'll start going ahead and literally doing this exact thing.

Now, let's go ahead and start mapping out the briefs and stuff. So what I like to do here is then I like to go ahead and start pulling some of these out. So we're gonna start off with number one from number one.

What I'm basically going to look at is I want to tell it I'll use a female for this one as a viral female Instagram influencer. Notice I'll say as is versus pretend as it creates a better connection with like chat to PT of how it actually states that prompt. So as a viral female Instagram influencer, please let's see fire Instagram influencer, please create me a hook ad angle number one.

And then there we go. Now, this is also another big one right here. I used to do stuff like as Dan Kennedy, which is a well known copywriter, or as I don't know, something else, like another type of copywriter.

And what I find is actually telling it to pretend to be the exact people that you want to be actually creating that content. It is worked so much better with the output. Now I could go even deeper in here.

So I'm going to say as a viral female Instagram influencer, like a guy who has who's in the tech niche with 1 million followers, please create me hooks for adding on the one. I just simply gave it a little bit more context that she's like a tech savvy. So like, Hey, this guy doesn't just have 1 million followers.

He's also swole. He's a bodybuilder. He's Joey swole.

And then here, basically, it's just using that adding on number one. Now, what my goal here is to look at that add angle, which is basically back frame from working from home, long hours sitting. So basically, I want to look at that pain point.

And I want to basically just select whatever hook around that pain point people are experiencing, and then make sure I pick a hook that resembles that because I don't want to just pick like, I don't want to pick this hook because it doesn't even like go after the pain point. So I'm going to even say, please eliminate any hooks that don't reflect the pain point of adding number one. And like, you see like that right there, that still doesn't work.

This is why it's important to also understand your shit. So I want to really focus on the pain part, pain part, eight hours at a desk ruined my back. This brought it back.

This tiny device, this tiny piece of tech fixed with eight hours of sitting ruined. I actually do like this one a little bit better because if we look at it from a posture perspective, people who are sitting down for hours, they've likely been pitched other things. We've already seen other things being pitched.

So I'm actually going to use this one right here using hook number one, please write me a, I'm going to do a 30 seconds sales letter using a blend of ethos, pathos and logos language. Chat CPT just freaked out on me. All right.

So this is where I'll start the manual process. This tiny piece of tech fixed with eight hours of sitting ruined. I'm not even kidding.

I used to end every workday with a aching lower back, stiff shoulders and zero energy working from home wrecked my posture and no stretching wasn't cutting it. I'm just going to say and stretching wasn't cutting it. I'm also going to remove zero energy because that's just not what we're focusing on.

I used to end every workday with an aching lower back and stiff shoulders working from wrecked my posture and stretching wasn't cutting it. Then I found this it's called the upright to go. It literally sticks to your back, syncs with an app and gently vibrates every time you slouch.

It retrained your posture in real time, like a physical therapist that fits in your palm. I talk a lot about it, a lot of tech, but this one game changer. My back feels stronger.

I sit taller. I don't dread my desk more if you don't work from home. All right, cool.

This tiny piece of tech fixed with eight hours of sitting ruined. I'm not even kidding. I used to end every workday with an aching lower back and stiff shoulders working from home wrecked my posture and stretching wasn't cutting it.

Then I found this it's called the upright to go. It literally sticks to your back, syncs with an app and gently vibrates every time you slouch. It retrains your posture in real time, like a physical therapist that fits in your palm.

I talk about a lot of tech, but this one game changer. My back feels stronger. I sit taller and I don't dread my desk anymore.

If you work from home and your body's paying the price, this is your fix. All right, this is good. This is really good.

So now what I would simply do for this is I would literally just below is my cells letter. Please add a B roll idea for each line. Now what I'm gonna do is basically just get a B roll idea, which is basically just like a piece of content you would want to film on each sentence.

And then what I'll do is then I'll just copy this and then go over to like incense.pro, hire a creator and send them this to be tested right there. There you go. And that's it.

And like, this gives you all the examples of like what you would do for each one of those. Now, what I want to do next is I do want to go ahead and show you guys how I would also do this. I don't know.

Let's just say you want to do some photo ads. For example, I'm literally, I'm not even going to copy that. I'm just going to go and select another angle.

All right. Using add angle number two as an, I'm just going to recopy this one again. As a viral female Instagram influencers and a technician woman, a million followers, please use add angle idea number two and give me a list of headlines, headlines you would put on an Instagram story photo.

All right. So this is doing overlay on a mirror selfie with subtle, subtle slouch. My posture made me look tired.

I don't even know what, what number two looks. Number two, number two, number two. Let's go all the way back up.

Number two hits on the pain point of self consciousness about slouch, hunched appearance. All right. So this is really focusing on the hunched appearance.

So basically anything that has the hunched appearance, this is where I'm going to go and start looking at that thing. So like, I didn't realize how bad it looked until I saw my reflection. That's a really good one right there.

So we can really see that before and afters are always solid. This tiny device helped me go unslouch my whole life. So this would be a really cool one to do right here and then send people to like an advertorial or listicle promoting this product.

Once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it side profile punch shoulders, circle or highlight it subtly. I really like this one. So using hook number one, obviously this is where it's pretty easy just to put this on a photo.

I do want to also show you all another thing that's really cool that I like to do. So like, for example, like I don't really need to show you all like this is it. Like basically take a photo, take this exact photo right here.

Boom, boom. And then I'll select, I'll send that to people to an avatar or a listicle. I do want to show you all another like thing I like to do, which is using hook number, using hook number one, please exaggerate.

Now exaggeration just takes it and expands it on it and makes it even more crazy. I don't think it actually did it correctly. So let me just do it like this.

Stop. There we go. These are just a little bit of exaggerated claims.

These just help out a little bit more in a more sophisticated marketplace. And also to like from a testing side, what can we further go upon? One photo, maybe delete 30 others.

That's a really good one. Oh, that's a good one right there. Yeah.

So like, these are some other photos right here. And then like, all I would do is just take that put it on an image and then do like three key benefits or put that on an image, do a cool image with it. And then I'd send people to like an avatar or a listicle landing page right there.

But yeah, I mean, look, long story short, I could spend all day just kind of going through some of this and stuff, but this is a really good thing to start leveraging to help you guys out with writing better copy. And obviously, like I said, this would be my video script of what the person says in the ad or what this AI say in the ad, if I'm doing like an AI voiceover, this would literally be my photo ad, the headline that's on the photo ad, not the Facebook headline, but literally the headline that's on the actual image itself. This is all those key things right there.

And then another thing is, is that this is not even including all the high level marketing fundamentals like desire, market awareness, market sophistication. Those are the things that I teach on this channel that help take this to a whole new level. And we didn't really cover that in this video, but I will be doing another video soon on the advanced Facebook ads guide for 2025, where I'll be diving to all of those things and also applying that into chat GPT.

So hopefully this helps you out, pump out some better angles and better copy for your creatives and everything like that.
