what's going on guys welcome back to the channel today a special video i received a package from vacay swimwear the summer's around the corner and i needed to up the game on the swimsuits so i just found this website and probably one of the top swimsuits i've seen so far it's kind of browse online the designs and everything really appealed to me uh so decided to purchase it i'll take like a week to ship only to get here and everything so pretty quick on shipping and i'm really excited to show you guys what i got so let's see we got one two three three different pairs and i got a little something cool oh sweet you have a custom thank you from one of their head guys jordan over there uh really awesome but i'm gonna go ahead and show you guys i forgot the exact name of what i got uh this is a pair medium size show you guys some of these designs and stuff overall this is the type of stuff i'll look at when i'm purchasing these higher tier brands um the packaging i'm not really to worry about the packaging but i really like these custom labels and stuff actually shows it's a real brand got their social media hashtags everything on here and that's actually a pretty damn high quality like actual stream touching that so um overall swimsuit itself feels high quality so i'm going to go ahead and i'll show you guys each pair now on all right so this is the first pair to be honest guys i really can't pronounce the name properly uh but it's like the canis kines and it has this nice yellow stripe around which is really pretty dominant it really makes it swim shark swim shorts pop uh and they do fit perfectly i'm a size medium which is around a 30 32 and they fit perfectly with still a little bit of like stretchiness to it uh i know for me personally i don't really like wearing skin tight swimsuits and yeah they fit good um they're breathable the material is definitely like a thicker higher quality uh the true test though with all these is going to be once you know actually swimming uh after a few times of use i guess and it actually kind of dry up a little bit because i know like some swimsuit that have like dry rot pretty damn easily uh so that's gonna be the biggest test but overall really impressed high quality uh they got this nice little like clip thing right here i guess like for hanging up the swimsuit itself um overall you got your back pockets or at least one back pocket right here all again branded and yeah feels good so this is the first pair and we'll go over to the next pair so this is the next pair this is called the miami and again it's dominant pink with the similar to the ones with striped down white and the black uh which really kind of gives it that more i guess you could say manlier vibe for a pink it's not your typical just bright pink um i really dig them though and another thing too that i've noticed even with the other pair and this pair they both fit exactly the same but also two at the same time they're not long past the knee because i know that's something i cannot stand with swimsuits is when they go past the knee and they're wet it's very difficult to walk in after also too uh i know i didn't point out in the last one but this is a velcro pocket and they got plenty overall like little clips or places to get strap stuff clip on whatever around the whole baby too they got another one back here um so that's pretty cool touch and again it fits really good i really like how it's looser at the waist so like it fits it you know it fits true to size pretty much but also too it tightens up a little bit more towards the bottom so it's that taper uh feel to it kind of like some joggers so yeah let's go ahead and go to the next pair now all right so this is the last pair right here this is called the hamptons uh it's pretty straightforward again similar to the other ones with strike going down except this one's only a two-tone with like a grayish black and yeah i mean overall at the triangle three of them all and they all fit exactly the same have the exact same you know like little key accessories and stuff like that uh they all have like the netting inside whether you're a netting fan or not i know a lot of people like just cut them out but to be honest i don't even notice it at all and whereas some swimsuits it's really really tight around the legs and i don't know it's just disproportionate uh this one fits really good so overall i mean i give the fit 10 out of 10. i can't really completely test them out right now just due to this whole quarantine stuff and the pool being closed uh but i will give you guys another follow-up video on how well they perform throughout the summer but overall very pleased with my purchase um jordan and the whole team of vacay swimwear are doing an amazing job with the product quality fulfillment side the whole purchase even with them being located in australia i got it within a week and i'm in the us so even during this whole quarantine thing uh so definitely a plus to you guys and if you want to check out vacay swimwear and check out some of the swimsuits uh they got i'll put the links below to these three are probably my
