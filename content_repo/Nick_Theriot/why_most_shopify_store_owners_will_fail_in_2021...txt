going to go over three key points that most shopify owners that i get on the consulting calls with completely fail at and i'm going to show you these three critical points that you need to improve inside your business if you want to succeed in 2021 with your e-commerce business so before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one so that being said let's get started okay guys let's just say first off let's give a thumbs up because we're a completely new kind of setup right here and this is something i'm experimenting with so before i take it on drop a comment below if you'd like this style of kind of teaching tutorials inside of your youtube videos so with most shopify owners that i get on calls with i mean i order their business go through their ads manager go through their account and stuff and there's three things that most of them just completely fell at and before i go over those three things that these shopify owners fell at you need to understand what's the theory behind them so there's three ways to increase revenue for a business there's three ways to grow profits and three ways really just to grow overall sales number one is client acquisition so how many customers can you get you know your customers your clients and stuff client acquisition you can go out there and you can acquire more customers so that's one way to increase your revenue just go acquire more customers get more people to buy stuff and you'll have you know client acquisition right there now the second thing is called aov average order value so after you acquire a client how much are they going to spend simple way to increase your revenue is focus on aov and go ahead and get people to spend more when they purchase so if you can acquire a customer at 20 and right now your aov is 60 bucks that's probably three extra turn on ad spend but let's say you throw an upsell in there and go from a 20 cost per acquisition and a 60 aov from a six dollar aov to about 80 aov now you all sudden you have a four extra turn on ad spend so number two is aov increase your average order value now number three is order frequency that's probably a horrible cue but look order frequency guys and if you get customers come in there you're acquiring customers at 20 a pop you increase your aov so you go ahead and you go from a six dollar aov to a 80 aov with a 20 client acquisition you're at a four extra turn on ad spend now let's say right now you're getting customers to purchase one product you have one product on your website and all of a sudden you start launching new products let's get these people to purchase more let's increase that order frequency now all of a sudden we're acquiring clients we're acquiring customers at 20 a pop and 80 aov and not only are they purchasing once they're coming back every time you drop a new product so to increase your order frequency you need more products for them to buy and this could be not necessarily this that's straight up product you're thinking this can be an upsell so for example you know um right now we're doing uh for one of our clients they have this sign that sells amazing in the love niche you know wedding engagement niche so i have this one client recently just signed them on and stuff and you know they're in this one particular niche where they're on these personalized products that's all i can really say without going into into too much detail you know due to you know nda and stuff but all that they sell these personalized products and one product is completely personalized so customer comes on they personalize it and they purchase it so we've been doing extremely well with them but now it's like okay we have all these customers they come and they purchase it once because you don't really need multiple of this particular product but instead of a personalized product what if we start making themed versions so for example a military one a first responders one a football one going after general themes and stuff and then now they have more people coming back and purchasing more of that product but in just different styles essentially so if you own a clothing brand this is extremely important right here because every time you launch a new style onto your website your existing customers are the perfect ones to come back and purchase more so again increasing that order frequency now we go over we went over how to increase order frequency that's the easiest way to increase revenue for a business and you see most shopify owners do not focus on this stuff they don't look at it like this they're still they're still focused right here in client acquisition you know roas that's all they focus on which is okay to focus on the beginning you know you you need to have a good row as to be able to scale but the problem is here is when you're so focused on this you're not focusing on these two which are a lot easier than doing client acquisition so you need to focus on how can you increase your aov right after you have this video you can simply go ahead and you know probably do a few little things to increase your aov you know and we'll go over in a second of how to increase that in our frequency you know what new products can you drop you know what was the last time you blasted your existing customers for a few other products on your website that you know let's say you lead with your best seller and everyone's purchasing this product how can we position these other products in front of existing customers so that's how we increase our frequency easiest one to do aov aov is pretty simple too you just want to upsell them so at the checkout they're purchasing a product and stuff and let's just say hey would you also like to try this would you also like to get you know let's say for example for this personalized product i'm selling right here i will upsell them one you know it's a personalized metal sign so what about a personalized metal knife or a personalized wallet so other personalized goods that go with that particular sign that we're selling so that's how we increase the aov and then also too you can do stuff like you know free shipping over orders you know over let's say 100 plus different things like that just to increase the average order value how can we get them to spend more we already got them to the checkout you know honestly five ten more dollars at the last second won't be that big of an issue so how can we increase that aov so we increased our frequency we increased the aov two very simple things you can do to go squeeze more profit out of it and when you're not doing these things right here let's say you don't focus on this you're so focused on roas you're going to happen is you're going to dry up your back in revenue and stuff you know these are two pools of revenue you can immediately go out and pull out almost immediately but because you're so focused on roas and one particular product and client acquisition upfront of the facebook ad side you're not focusing on increasing your v our frequency you end up just gonna you know you're not gonna be able to scale and if you're not gonna be able to scale then you're gonna be stuck at these lower revenues and likely your business is gonna die out due to rising ad costs whereas if you focus on constantly putting out new products to your existing customers you're increasing your aov so you're getting customers to purchase more you're gonna make more revenue and you're gonna be able to withstand higher ad costs so that's the next thing is client acquisition you know when you focus on that first product so let's say you're a one product store you don't have any back-end upsells you're you know your client acquisition is super important for you because a low client acquisition equals more profit more roas all that good stuff but if you're not getting a good cost you know per client acquisition then you're gonna have an issue with going ahead and being able to scale so then you're stuck but if you if you can break even literally on their first sale and you have more stuff in the back end you know you're you're upselling people and you're increasing your aov you can withstand those rising ad costs and if you can do all of this you can be able to grow a really good business in 2021 don't do this stuff and you're completely focused on roas and you're selling one particular product and you're not focusing on the other routes of which you can promote your roas you're still focused on trying to increase you know your cpc or something like that or decrease your cpc and maybe increase your roas and trying to see you know split test ad sets and stuff while you have something that works really well you have something that works really consistent if you squeeze out everything you can you test it all and it's working really well but you still can't get your costs down then focus on these stuff right here these things that are going to help you out with you know larger transaction sizes and more products for people to buy you're going to build a very strong customer data you know database that's going to consistently come back to your business and purchase from you from time to time again which is allowing you to build a longer term business so this is all super critical things and not doing this type of stuff is going to be detrimental to your business in 2021 so if you watch this video and like what you see and you know you're a shopify
