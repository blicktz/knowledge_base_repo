Yes.

Alright. Thank you. Um, put Chick-fil-a sauce in the bag.

Thank you so much. You too. Alright y'all.

I'm missing a caller. Nick's girlfriend for right now. Oh thanks.

I don't want all y'all stalking her social media. I got her something though. Very special.

Very special. French fries. Mmm.

I'm excited. This is the second time we're filming this. Part two.

Let me show you guys what I got. Cause I got a load of food for our workout later. And right now I'm kind of on the spree of, hey I still got 20 more days for walking so I'm eating every day right now.

So, 12 count of nuggets. Fries. Regular coke.

Not a diet coke. Airheads. And then, I said I wanted a spicy deluxe sandwich and they gave me just, I don't know, I guess a spicy non-deluxe sandwich.

But, we'll still go with it. And then that extra fry in the bag. And then a whole bunch of Chick-fil-a sauce.

So, I'm going to gobble all this down. Then get some work done. And, we'll see you guys after that.

So, this is the only problem I have with eating fast food. While like working and stuff. Or like big food.

It's like I love to diet is. You just get this afternoon crash. And it makes the wind work so much harder.

I eat a bunch of fried food. So, I am like thirsty right now. I'm like thirsty right now.

I'm like thirsty right now. I'm like thirsty right now. I'm like thirsty right now.

I'm like thirsty. I'm like thirsty. I'm like thirsty right now.

I'm like downing water like crazy. So, but I'm currently working on right now. Some assets for my digital agency.

One thing right now is being like a pricing sheet. People believe what they see. Not what they hear.

So, even if I tell people it's $5,000 a month. Or $1,500 a month. Or $10,000 a month for my services.

They won't really believe it until they see it. So, create a simple price sheet. And it's also as well works good for my sales rep.

So, he has something to go off of. And I'm also creating an asset for my agency. That can be used over and over and over.

As it continues to grow and scale. So, I just got to the gym. And I am so excited.

Because today we were doing chest day. Obviously. So, we got to be excited for that day.

And we are finally getting to have a scoop. Of the Ghost Purple. The Welsh's Grape Pre-Workout.

Now, let's just say. I just opened it up. I just put me a scoop in my shaker cup.

About like 6 to 8 ounces of water. But, but. It's been literally a year since I've had this great flavor.

And I am beyond excited. Because, I don't know. It brings like just opening it and smelling it.

Brought so much throwback to like my last prep and stuff. Kind of like brought back some old memories. And I don't know man.

I didn't think I was going to like this flavor at all. Then once I had it. Like I was just like.

Oh, you know Welsh's Grape. That's cool. I thought it was going to taste like a grape dum dum.

Or something like that. A grape tootsie pop. I don't know.

I just. I didn't know what to expect. Then I got it.

Received it. And actually had it. And I don't know.

This is by. Beyond my favorite. Favorite flavor.

Yeah. Cannot talk today. By.

Goes. For pre-workout. So, if you like grape.

It's not like a. Heavy. Like.

I don't know. It's a definitely. A very distinct.

Grape. It's Welsh's Grape guys. You'll love it.

So, if you ever wanted to try like a flavor by ghosts. Definitely try Welsh's Grape. Alrighty guys.

So, we are. In. The gym.

Today. We are doing a chest workout. And.

I wanted to end this video. Kind of like with a. Or.

Close to ending this video. With a little commentary. Just kind of like over.

The workout footage. And also. Some more thoughts and stuff.

On the car. Because. I know this video is kind of mostly.

Focused around the car. First oil change. Everything.

So. First off. Quick note about the training footage.

Today. We did chest. Me and Jake.

And we started off with. Bench. Then we moved over to like.

Decline bench. And a few other things. So.

I'm going to kind of show mostly. Just like regular flat bench. And.

Basically. The way we've been training lately. Is we kind of work ups.

Like. We're going to do more. We go.

Heavier. So like. We're kind of working our way up.

To like a weight. Where we can only do five reps max of. And then we go back down.

To like 10 reps. Then 15 reps. Of lighter weights.

And it really been. Like. Working really well.

At least for me. It's something I'm enjoying doing. Because I get a little both.

Um. I get a little bit better of a pump. And I kind of get like a.

Good. Like both of. Best worlds.

I guess you could say. Best both. Best worlds.

Something like that. Anyway. Enjoyed the training footage.

And. Yeah. So.

The car. I've been having it for. Three months now.

I put around. 4800 miles on it. And honestly.

I absolutely love this thing. I. Just kind of like.

Bring you guys back. To where I started off with. I started off with.

Trailblazer. A truck. Then I finally got my.

EcoBoost. Which the. EcoBoost.

To me. Going from a truck. Was just.

Absolutely amazing. I'm just going to laugh for a second. Like my legs.

Shaking in this video. Right here. Finishing up that last set of.

Bench. And that was honestly. Just 135.

But anyway. Back to the car. Yeah.

The EcoBoost. And then finally got this. Five oh.

And the five oh. Has always been my dream. And I absolutely.

Love this car. So. Honestly.

A little bit of. Like. Theleavening of it.

All the two. In terms of. Hey.

This is like. You know. My overall thoughts.

Three things I love. Three things I hate. Etc.

So. But yeah. Overall.

Love the car. Enjoying it. Taking it day by day.

And I'm going to make some more. Content around it. Right now.

With this whole channel. I'm just kind of. Focusing around.

Cars. Fitness. Money.

Speaking of that, you're about to see something really cool. In fact, this commentary is coming in, but the next clip, I'm actually working out and get this really cool text message that I landed a digital agency client, or at least one that is in the pipeline and about to sign on. So, let's check that out now.

Alright guys, that is the end of this workout. I need to go home now, shower and change. This is a pretty good chest workout today.

I'm out of breath. But let me show you guys something really cool. So I normally leave my phone, my bag, gym, and I had a few missed calls, a few missed texts.

Check out this. One of my cell drips just texted me. Let's see.

I'm about to crop it out, but basically we're in the process right now. Process right now, following up with a client that we've been trying to get on and basically just got to go ahead, got to go ahead to move forward to add another client on the agency roster. So, pretty freaking epic end to the day.

So, I really hope you guys enjoyed today's video. I'm about to head out right now, go have dinner with my girlfriend and her family. But, today's video was pretty cool to make.

It was very interesting to go like vlog at like the dealership and stuff. And, I just want to say I got some lot of really interesting content coming, planned for the next few days. So, stick around for the daily vlogs.

Doing my best. We'll get there. We'll slowly improve.

And, also, in the next few days, I have a really big announcement coming and a lot of other cool stuff. There's a lot of stuff playing. So, we'll see where we go.

It's really just kind of taking it day by day and slowly going after the overall vision, which I'll share to you guys soon. If you enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a like. Drop a comment below of what you enjoyed about the video.

What can I improve on? What would you like to see more of? I'm slowly starting to incorporate more business stuff as well, which is planned.

And, yeah. Thanks for watching guys.
