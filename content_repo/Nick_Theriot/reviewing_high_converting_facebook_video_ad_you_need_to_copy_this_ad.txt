yo what is going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio today i have an exciting new video for you guys today we'll be going through an ad creative review something i don't think we have done in at least two or three weeks so i'm really excited to bring this video to you guys as it's something i think really inspires a lot of people from a creative perspective of what to create for their facebook ads so that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and let's dive into it guys so this particular creative right here uh i got from a brand called craft it london they sell men's jewelry but with a twist so let's just watch the creative first because as an effective creative you should be able to get a good idea of what the brand is just from that one creative so let me hit play so that was the creative and obviously there's a lot going on in here um so let's actually start to break that down so there's a few things we can tell from this one creative a few key pieces of information so one it's targeted to people who have a problem with green necks and if you don't really know what that problem is uh this ad ain't for you that's good uh two if you do know what it is it's basically where uh gold jewelry if you wear it it and you start to sweat it'll give this green line on your neck from like the i don't know if it's fake gold or just gold rubbing off i don't know like the exact like chemical view perspective on it but it happens so that's the pain point they call out immediately and notice how they call one very big bold pain point that a lot of people it's relative it's relatable and it's something that um it aggravates people it's something that's like oh i hate this hate when this shit happens so that's the first thing and we hit play on that sick of green necks so they could have did a good job at maybe even showcasing it but i feel like if they would have showcased that problem in terms of like a visual standpoint of taking away a little bit from the theme from this video but with that being said i still think that's something they could do like a split test one right there so sick of green necks and you'll notice that okay it's a lot of up close visualization of the product jewelry tends to work better with a lot of up close perspectives with a the theme and the stuff around it to tell the story as well so here's this jewelry okay boom you can kind of see who it's far as they chose a guy if it's tatted so they definitely went through with some more rugged jewelry and it also can kind of call out the identity of the person that is um using this stuff or wearing it so that's the first thing going through um the guy obviously looks a little bit more muscular so like you know he's likely wearing this when he's working out which is a big problem you're sweating the jewelry is again rubbing the green stuff on you they also do a very good job at showing off the collection so they show off one product right here two products right here and then they showcase uh the wrists and then boom they're going straight into this part where he's running and he looks a little sweaty so again if i'm selling sweat proof jewelry i want to illustrate someone sweating in it if i just say it's sweat proof and never showcase that then it's just like how it's hard to picture myself wearing that in the gym if i can't see someone wearing it so that's a big thing right there and you can also see the vibe they're establishing it's kind of dark a little bit darker of a tone and the color correction stuff like that so it's really hitting a specific vibe as well and just a and how they're projecting everything uh next thing okay sweat proof so sick of green next boom sweat proof and look at the text choice it's very easy to read and there's not 50 different things on the screen you got 20 seconds less than 30 seconds to showcase all the benefits of this product and they're keeping very sharp punchy shard and punchy over like does amazing compared to long like like strike you know board it out essentially expand it again okay they're showing a guy working out showing a guy with a muscle t on again if it's sweat proof they're illustrating the aspect of it being sweat proof that guys are working out in it you can wear it to the gym and then they're actually showing a guy sweating in it they're not just showing a guy's working out not sweating again also too look at the character the the model they chose to again establish i'm sure a lot of people who also wear this jewelry is also a little bit more rugged has a little more tattoos and stuff like that on them so they're kind of also calling out their their brand identity as well of who their core customer avatar may look like getting some really good shots of him sweating in it um there's a way to do it where you literally just like spray a bunch of water on you like it's it's like if you're doing this exact same thing it's as easy ways to mimic this sweat you don't actually have to do a full workout to get that sweaty so cool and look a lot of close-up angles but you can still tell what's going on it's a close-up angle but you still know what's going on um through just contextual um elements okay now we're going to the sauna again just more um are showing off the heat proof aspect so i'm not aware of the heat proof aspect for some jewelry um i figured that wouldn't really matter but i guess there's some jewelry that heat can damage it so it's showing off the heat damage aspect which is really good you could be out in the heat stuff like that working and you don't want to mess it up other places besides the sauna but again you can see exactly how they're showcasing that aspect right there heat proof all right now they're showing a guy in the water again further getting waterproof but also what you're starting to understand is that they're telling this story of it's a sub a very subconscious story they're telling or speaking to your subconscious and that is it's it's rug it's not rugged it's strong look all the cool environments it was in and blasted perfectly it's waterproof sweat proof heat proof and look look how like aggressive they're being within the workouts and swimming and stuff like that they're not like just sitting down and looking good so and that's probably where a lot of people would take this approach they'd probably show a model sitting down dressed nice and on side of it heat proof waterproof but they're visually showcasing these elements in the ad and to look at how simplistic the benefits they're going after heat proof waterproof like very simplistic stuff you can sit there and focus on 18 karat gold that was personally mine by hand in south carolina south carolina like some random stuff like that but no they're just showing off the basic benefits of it but they're illustrating in a very good way very compelling way more water crafted to last so again that's that's their branding identity is that this was crafted to last and they're showcasing that very well through all of the different visual elements six green necks boom sweat proof yada yada yada so just kind of going through this again again look at the color choices they chose look how minimalistic the texas but it speaks volume with each word they use in that case right there crap that's the last very simple ad but trust me i don't know the performance of this ad it looks like it's been running a really long time based because i have to dig deep into their ads library and it showed us launched very early of 2021 and i know when i got hit with it i stopped and was like whoa what's this so i'm also judging that ability right there now is this something you could replicate easy get you a buddy that knows videography go to the gym film a bunch of close-ups of them working out and then get an editor i can edit all together this is nothing fancy right here nothing that's like oh my god there's no way i can do that it's not like it's a very big detail 3d animation this is something that easily could have been made in a day easy editing and everything so the problem people have is that they would go sit down and create an ad and they're gonna show up to the shoot with okay uh i don't know what to shoot the planning is the key here before they shot this ad i'm bet you money that people sat down okay what are we trying to show off what are we trying to illustrate to people what is the messaging message that we're trying to spread to people and then what are the key scenes and what are the things we need to show off in our ad to enhance that message there's one thing i say it's waterproof and sweat proof but there's another thing to actually visually showcase that um in an ad that makes a big difference so really great ad i love it i'm a big fan of it i definitely think it's one of those that you kind of tuck in your library and review um but also to understand of what are you currently doing right now in your creatives to or what can you do to take something that and amplify that message so if you're selling jewelry that's heat proof waterproof sweat proof and right now you're just posting pictures of guys boom looking good how can you also amplify that message further how can you increase that that wow to it like it really is waterproof by showing it versus just saying it people believe what they see not what they hear and you have to understand that right there so really cool ad review let me know in the comments below what's your biggest takeaway from this if you learned anything from a creative perspective what did you learn from this video i'm very
