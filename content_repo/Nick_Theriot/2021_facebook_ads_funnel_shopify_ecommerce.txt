strategy for your ad account this particular strategy has allowed us to take literary and e-commerce business from point four five row ass to over three extra turn on ad spend within 30 days by just applying a proper strategy into which our account is structured and the ways we target our audiences so I'm actually gonna show you guys what a top of funnel bomb a funnel middle funnel looks like and how it's like in terms of like the psychology from a selling standpoint at each level of what content to put out so before we start this video make sure the like button and hit that subscribe button for more Facebook ads videos I promise you guys you might be disappointed uh my mission is to drive as much value and um you know help to e-commerce business owners to where they can scale their businesses and let's you know scale to the moon in 2021. okay guys so um showing you really quick um going back to the video I produced the other day uh this was an ad account right here where we literally spent uh you know 27 or they spent $2,700 in the month October 2020 made back nine sales $310 cost per acquisition extremely unprofitable average order value is $140 so they had like a 0.45 row ass for this account not profitable not fun then from November 25th to January 4th 2021 uh we've taken our account from um yeah literally 0.45 row ass to 2.98 um actually to update you guys since I'm logged into that account um you know refresh all that stuff y'all need to know that I don't play no games around here this is raw results this is the truth the actual you know stuff you got the good stuff here so if we look from the 25th November we took over um or actually launched our ads to January 8th we spent $11,000 and made back $37,000 at 3.28 row ass um taking this one can't like a few campaigns we scaleded them up we applied a proper top funnel middle funnel setup and I want to show you guys today how you can do this so um I'm not going to give you guys the exact like audiences and stuff to target like hey view content for a day whatever because while that stuff matters the stuff that really matters and truly matters is the psychology is the content is the type of things you're putting in front of these people at these stages to where it can give them the information they need to make the sale make the purchase become a customer purchase your product with trust and ease so with that being said this is what the top funnel middle funnel bottom funnel and I call it pps but past purchases look like the reason why this one's blue this one's kind of an orange this one's a red because this one's cold this one's warm this one's hot each stage of this funnel requires different content to get people to the next stage that's all we're trying to do trying to get people from here to here then from here to here then from here to here that's the ultimate goal but to get from here to here you just got to you know constantly provide the right pieces of content the right things they need to you know in their minds pull it all together and like hey I'm ready to make a purchase you know we've got the proper information I need to make a purchase with this brand so um you're blue this is your cold audiences this is your interest your look likes that you're targeting and simply what you want to do with the cold uh your top of funnel is when you introduce people to your big idea what is the big idea your brand is behind you know um I sell teeth whitening kits my big idea is shiny teeth at a fraction of the cost with my teeth whitening kit so that's what I'm introducing people to I'm trying to get as many cold people who've never heard of my brand not aware of my brand nothing completely new people to my brand in the top of funnel this is gonna have the biggest budget you know we'll probably have like a thousand dollars a day right here and we'll have a ten thousand dollars a day right here so we have a huge budget because we're gonna reach a lot of cold people a lot of new people are completely aware unaware of our brand we're gonna get some sales we're gonna get a lot of website visitors and we get a ton of engagement so we're gonna get a ton of engagement a lot of website visitors and a few sales where's goal is to break even right here in terms of ROAS whatever you break your ROAS is hit break even right here now I'm just gonna say this every brand I've worked with and every brand I'm currently working with we profit at top of funnel not plugging myself at all but I'm just saying profiting at top funnel is definitely doable but there's a lot of brands that just break even at top funnel because they understand they're they're in here for the long game and they realize that they get as many people as possible introduced to their brand then they have some massive warm and hot audiences that they can retarget and remarket to so your warm audiences now look I'll be honest with you guys middle of funnel it's a pain in the butt it's probably the hardest part of this whole funnel it's middle funnel because if we get them from cold to hot we can do this in one step we put an ad in front of someone they go straight to hot you know they're gonna do they're gonna go through all these steps in one step and purchase immediately so they don't necessarily have to go through all these steps they can go from cold to customers in one ad that's it so just making you guys aware of that because I know that's something I struggle with at first so let's go to hot let's just say if they view our ad our cold ad introducing them to our teeth whitening kit you know teeth whitening at a fraction of the cost you know Nick's teeth whitening kit Nick's amazing teeth whitening kit and we take them straight to the website they look at the teeth whitening kit they look at the specs on it the shipping on it they're like wow this is super cool but you know they're not completely sold yet so what we do is because they're hot they've been to the website they looked at the website they looked at everything on the website they're hot they're introduced to a brand showed them our products and stuff but they didn't purchase they're hot they're in the market they were within you know they did this within the last 14 days or 28 days what do we need to provide them so they can comfortably purchase from us so honestly guys a few things that work really well that's very broad for us is testimonials testimonials at mof and buf work extremely well um but bomb a funnel okay completely into the brand okay let's build some more trust with them let's provide some social proof some other people with shiny white teeth now thanks to using us um let's show maybe us packaging orders so that way they know that we're not a drop shipping brand um if do we have any dentist articles like you know maybe some dentists endorsing this particular product that'd be really great i mean because if i'm in the market for teeth whitening i would only want to use something my dentist would recommend okay um and then maybe just some common objections or maybe some common questions people may have you know do i need to use this every day so i'm feeding them the proper content they need at bottom of funnel to overcome the objections they may have that's preventing them from getting here so i'm i'm thinking of possible objections they might have providing it to them in copywriting and content and i'm targeting them and those type of audience i'm a target are people who view content last say 14 days and add to cart last 28 days that's the audience i'm a target and i'm gonna use catalog sales for this for this particular campaign i use website conversions i'll do a mixture of photo video carousel ads just different variations to provide people the necessary content to overcome objections that's preventing them from purchasing that's it that's all i'm doing right there so i'm a cold audience campaign you know sending people to my hot campaign um you know website visitors essentially and i'm going to follow up with those people with objections i think they may have through audience research market research product research all that stuff like that and give them the information they need to make the sale then the next question is okay that's cool that's understandable now what about middle of funnel now middle of funnel is different because middle funnel i've been able to just copy that from bottom funnel put a post in a middle funnel and that's worked really well um but i have two audience primarily with middle funnel that i like to target i like to do a 30 day website visitor um instagram and facebook engagement all together and then i exclude people who viewed content in the last 30 days so a view content audience is completely different than a website visitor audience i think this is this is something i learned and it blew my mind of how long it took me just to learn this a website visitor is someone who visits the home page maybe looks at the about section maybe who views your collections but does not click on a product view content people are people who actively view a product on your website so imagine going to a website look in the collections and everything just never clicking on a product view content people have viewed a particular product on your website and also guys when i look at the numbers i'll have like 6 000 website visitors and 5 500 view content people so it's like literally only like 500 people that's actively getting into this audience because i'm excluding i'm targeting website visitors 30 days and excluding view content 30 days so it's like only like 500 people that target so it's a very small amount but it's it's some people um and then instagram engagement just people engage with instagram page engage with an instagram post facebook engagement literally the same shit so what i want to do here is i split them up into a 30 day and then a 30 to 180 day so 30 to 180 day is people that literally know the name of our brand and that's it they've most likely forgot about us um honestly i like to do is just test new product drops um test new cold audience ads to that because honestly between 30 to 180 days depending on what's like your business model um they they forgot about your brand so just new cold audience ads work well um a 30 day window for this website visitors instagram and facebook engagement more testimonials maybe some more endorsements and stuff and then if you post a lot on your instagram page your facebook page like say once a day um your best performing organic posts works super well and all we're trying to do is get them to the website we're trying to get them to the next stage of the funnel try to get them to the website view some products so that way they're officially bottom of funnel people now middle funnel like i said it's a little bit more difficult it's it's only difficult because there's no like straight one way to do this and i've i've seen different ways to work but honestly one key one that's worked really well for me it's just a lot of testimonials and user-generated content now customers um what do you do with a customer now so something that works extremely well for us is a thank you video raf they purchase upselling them and cross selling my new products that you've dropped so like let's say for example my tea fighting kit and then like i'll launch a tea whitening toothpaste now i want to upsell my customers who purchased the tea fighting kit to the toothpaste so hey we know you love this love shining your teeth and you want to take your tea fighting to next level here you can do it with our tea fighting toothpaste so and again this would be our lowest budget so we might be at a thousand dollars a day on our cold audience 500 they are warm and you know 200 dollars a day on bottom of funnel and then like 10 dollars they own customers so obviously i have specific ratios i use inside our agency that we follow for all of our ad accounts we have a certain percentage for each of these but it's you're literally going to be like you know a freaking triangle right here top of funnel spending a ton of money then going all the way down to pps your past customers because you're gonna have less people way down here and millions of people up here and as you go down the funnel you're gonna need to spend a lot less and i think people blow about their budgets when doing this so but yeah so that's how you set up a top funnel middle funnel bottom of funnel um kind of like the psychology set up sam for um point for it if you guys would love for me to create a video um actively setting this up inside of ads manager let me know it'd be fun but i think a lot of people get it it's just i don't think people understand the proper way to set up the psychology the content all that type of stuff and that's what this covers a lot so hope you guys enjoy this um if you did make
