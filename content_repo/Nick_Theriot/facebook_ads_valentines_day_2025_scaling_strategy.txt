valentine's day is fast approaching and if you run a e-com business this is going to be one of the most lucrative holidays outside of black friday and today i want to show you step by step our game plan when it comes down to running an e-com business and being able to maximize facebook ads during this period of time to help you make some extra money that's the biggest part right here this is a quick cash grab for what i would say about 80 of e-com businesses and i'm gonna show you exactly what you need to be doing during this period of time so this is one of our clients that we helped do roughly around nine hundred thousand dollars about a year or two ago with facebook ads and valentine's day specifically and you can see we launched these valentine's day ads somewhere around i would say the 15th which would be right here and then we saw around the 20th really start to take some spin and then it absolutely goes crazy up until about january february 7th and then february 8th it falls hard like a rock and i want to show y'all what you can do during this period of time right here uh this video will probably be posted for that first week of february and what you can do to maximize the sales so here's my v-day guide i january 15th through february 7th this is the time to make money i do see people post about launching their valentine's day ads somewhere around like december like 27th january 1st personally i've never seen valentine's day ads work during that period of time that's usually where we're milking all of our new year's angles and everything but for the most part usually around january 15th is when we launch our valentine's day ads and we see things start to take off around january 20th to 25th now february 8th performance will fall hard i've seen this every single year especially like in this case right here like we were doing roughly like 75 50k a day for a couple of days february 8th came around i don't even think this is exactly february april somewhere around that and i mean we fell all the way below 15k a day and that's totally normal so just expect that to happen and be prepared to cut spin when that happens all you'll typically see is that your your current like level of spin won't maintain the results that you're trying to go for and that's usually when you have to pull back on that spin and typically we'll see results start to pick up between february 17th and february 20th so almost three to five days after valentine's day this year which is february 14th why because people just spend a bunch of money for valentine's day people go on a hangover and we see performance across the board for a lot of different industries just drop really hard during that time now there's a couple different personas that we want to market to for valentine's day and that's going to be men buying for women hey this is the perfect gift for your sweetheart does valentine's day women buying for kids a lot of women typically try to buy for their kids and then single people buying for themselves hey you owe yourself a gift this valentine's day you've done great so far this year you owe yourself something special this year and i got a few creatives just to kind of show y'all that i pulled together you know just things that we've seen these aren't our creatives specifically for our clients but these are just things that's working for other brands and i'm just simply laying all those out for y'all it's basically kind of go over so let's just kind of go through some of these let's see if there's a better way i can sort this this is a pretty decent image ad right here gift set for valentine's day like if you keep anything or like if you take any action from this video literally just take your best performing creatives you already have right now and throw a valentine's day banner on it it's some of the easiest things that you can do if you haven't treated yourself for valentine's day yet me and lottie have and i think this one's actually going to go if you haven't treated yourself so this is a great example of valentine's day for single people treating themselves if you haven't treated yourself this fall for valentine's day yet here's a great example and then they're basically just going and covering and talking about that product itself or more three reasons why big blankets make the best valentine's day gift idea pretty straightforward it's just simply calling using a hook hey valentine's day gift idea why does this get a valentine's day gift idea this is also one of my favorites right here she melted when she got this for valentine's day so talking about how that person will react when they get this gift i think it's paint my life they do a phenomenal job at that where they showcase a lot of people authentically crying in tears when they receive their gift valentine ball it's coming soon now this one i really like is because it's a lot more doesn't seem like you know something fake or scripted like maybe something like this right here let's see if we can find a couple other more for y'all very easy simple one this one's a cool one because it's basically just simply acknowledging a product is in restock but yeah so some pretty cool stuff that you can leverage for valentine's day and like i said if you do nothing from this training and like you want to just take one easy action literally all you have to do is go take your best performing creatives you can duplicate them just add a banner to them in post-production and then upload them as a new ad and just simply have like valentine's day 20 off you know change your hook to the perfect valentine's day gift very simple that you can do for just some quick easy things if you don't have the time necessarily to go film fresh new content for valentine's day now during this time i do recommend doing 20 increases that's my go-to there's a handful of times a year like maybe five percent of the time of the year that i'll do 100 increases and valentine's day is one of those times because i have a hard roadblock like february 7th when i knew a performance is going to start to drop or like our last good day of sales i know only have like 10 days for example like time of this video right here i got about yeah roughly 10 days that i can scale up to and then i know that day it's going to be a hard drop so only about 10 more days to actually milk what i can from valentine's day momentum so i'll do 100 increases once a day so basically just go watch my how to scale facebook ads in 2025 video and inside that video instead of doing 20 increases i'll do 100 increases on my budget now i do recommend 20 throughout the year when you don't have a hard date set i do not recommend doing more than 20 it just doesn't make sense at all 20 for me is literally what i've done last three years and i've had the most success with it now as far as do you need to create a separate campaign for valentine's day or can you keep ads in the same evergreen campaign yes and no so let's say our main audience let's just say we sell to women all year long and that campaign's optimized towards women my women specific valentine's day creatives like hey women buying for their kids women buying for themselves those will be in that evergreen campaign because it's already dominantly been working well for women now if i'm a women's brand and that campaign's optimized for women and we've never marketed towards men then i'll go create a separate campaign specifically for men only targeting men still all broad targeting and then i'll have my men specific creatives where there's creatives calling out guys to gift this for their woman for valentine's day so that's the only differences right there and then vice versa if i have a men's only brand and we've domino been focusing on men then i'll create a separate campaign for female now if i have a like business or brand that serves both let's say i i serve like i create unisex t-shirts for example then simply i can just keep everything in that same campaign have some men specific angles women specific angles and both angles specifically for like buying for themselves as well all that same campaign i don't need to create new campaigns or anything like that as far as like when do i turn off those valentine's day ads specifically just whenever they stop performing they should stop performing around february 7th february 8th if they start tanking really hard i'll just simply turn them off that next day now for your email and sms strategy you really want to stress urgency during this period of time especially like when you start getting to like february 1st february 2nd or 3rd really start sending out maybe a one email a day or one sms a day that's doing the countdown of how many days people can order and get it in before valentine's day and then and then speaking of that guaranteed delivery day also works phenomenal so if you want to like seriously level up like your conversion rate and stuff like that just simply put a banner on your website that if you order by x date it will be guaranteed delivery for valentine's day so this is going to like pretty much throw all the drop shippers out the window that can't actually get their items in before then so this is why like for us we can run ads up until february 7th because we work with like real brands that has ethical shipping times whereas drop shippers with a 30-day delivery time they're going to get slaughtered for valentine's day because they can't promote a guaranteed delivery day and if they do they get a load of refunds uh to the point where it actually ruins their business so uh this is where ethical brands can actually be very what i would say really help them out in this particular time period right here but yeah that's everything that we do for you know valentine's day i think the only thing else we didn't mention was for your website make sure you update the home page with like valentine's day theme for your home page and then also too you can update maybe your like if you have like a main best-selling product that you're pushing for valentine's day you could also at this time like put like maybe a banner on the product image itself literally just download the product image add a banner in photoshop upload it back and there you go you got your banner on the product just to kind of like get the theme of the website as well relate it to valentine's day but yeah thank you all so much for watching everyone hopefully y'all
