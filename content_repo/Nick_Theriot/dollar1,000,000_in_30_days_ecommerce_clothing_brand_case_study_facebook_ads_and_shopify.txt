yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today we're going to be showcasing a case study where we did a 1 million dollars in 30 days for a men's clothing brand so really excited to dive into this and show you guys everything that's gone into it we kind of broaden your perspective of scaling and all that fun stuff so with that being said before we get started make sure that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday let's dive into it guys so like i said super excited to dive into this uh for you before we get started by the way just need you to check this out um i'm sipping on some glitch or energy right now i don't know if you guys have heard of this but highly recommend it because without that this results and black friday have not been possible because i was absolutely swamped all black friday and um truly some awesome stuff you gotta check out glitch energy by the way so 1 million dollars in 30 days and here's just a little screenshot um granted this was during black friday so obviously this may not be a typical month for a brand like this uh so you do need to understand that these type of results i'm gonna show you did happen during black friday was there some level of black friday that attributed to the success of hitting the seven figure mark in one month yes like i'd be dumb to say no there is a high amount of black friday stuff that contributes to this but then also too there's a lot of strategy and stuff like that that i'm excited to share with you guys and again just some more screenshots showing you guys um it's our mer report we basically do this every day where we're tracking spin across all platforms shopify sales all that good stuff and lastly an ad account just to show you we've actually used three ad accounts for this particular month um two of them just had one campaign each set up uh just for some extra spin but you can literally go and count up all the spin if you want on this and you know let's get the total amount and i'll show that all to that as well the end of the month all right in this video so just a little overview of like key points um this brand was hovering about 250 to 300 000 per month in revenue so it's not like this brand had 10 000 month in sales it already had a 250 300k a month kind of hovering range of what they did every month so for black friday months i like you to just pinpoint where you're at right now in terms of your revenue and multiply that by two to three x and that's realistically what you'll do for black friday or november just as a whole that month specifically so if you're doing 50 000 in a month standard then you'll probably do 100 to 150 000 that month of black friday so you just you need to be aware of that right there a particular brand it's a men's clothing and underline specifically they have a amazing product people love their product they have a lot lots of good reviews they have amazing customer service they're constantly out there and just paving the way in their market essentially if i can say that uh the key objectives they wanted a million dollars this month of november and that's why they basically reached out to work with us worked with them for about all of october all november and you know we're still working with them till this day in december um and their first thing was just like nick we want to hit a million dollars in a month like that's our goal and we're looking for people who can help us can you help us do that like yes yes we can so that was the first objective second objective is one to maintain a 3x robust or higher so it's cool to hit a million dollars a month but if you've got a million and you've spent a million like obviously that's pointless you lost a ton of money so we understood looking at all their metrics costs of goods fulfillment everything like that they need a 3x or higher to maintain profitability um at a very high level and then obviously want to capitalize on bfcm to hit q4 goals so this is their big goal for q4 hit a million dollars in november and we leveraged black friday summer funday to be able to give us that um extra like amp up so october we mapped out their content calendar so we basically took a look at november and i was like okay cool like hey have you ever done a content calendar you're like no okay well great like we mapped out their whole content calendar so that way we knew very specifically of what needed to happen what emails needs to go out what ads needs to go live on certain days etc etc etc so we mapped out that whole month of november for them and then we planned out specific pieces of content we will need so like there's a variety of different content you need when you're scaling specifically for black friday as well uh so we mapped that out to make sure we had all that put in place we looked at the offer they want to run for black friday made you know provide some tweaks and feedback on that um and then we also implemented mer tracking which again mer tracking is this right here which is basically just every day recording your facebook snapchat google and shopify um and then you get your total overall robust total overall spend and total overall revenue so this is very important every single econ brand right now needs this implemented in their business this is how we basically get past ios 14.5 and keep it very easy now content strategy give me talks a little bit about the content everything like that we had about 20 different creative assets that were actually created by the client they had an amazing content team so we just leveraged their team instead of our team we got about 20 different creative assets mix of photo video and photo different sizes four by five videos 16 or nine by 16 story formats um so mixture of those things as well and then we did three specific types we did just a solid like flat graphic with like black friday then we had some new iterations of our best performing videos and then we had our existing best performing ads with black friday cyber monday kind of copying all that stuff on it now the first plan of action inside their ad accounts actually started in october but just to kind of show you what it looked like in november was that they had a lot of lot a lot of different campaigns all over the place and everything was kind of scattered across the ad account so when we dived into this ad account we took all their campaigns consolidated into two campaigns pretty much our three you're retargeting you're scaling and your creative testing campaign as well and like we literally went from like 20 campaigns to three campaigns and this allowed us to do a few things one get out of learning limited and learning and go into active and i kid you not this main scaling best sellers it's been 115 000 last month in november uh with one ad set in there one big ad set that's it you don't need 50 ad sets to scale like that's a very big myth inside of facebook advertising now one ad set and we had a few ads that performed amazing and we focused on clothing the big problem with clothing is that a lot of people try to scale every single product and that's another false belief not every product is set for scale for clothing some designs people love some designs just your existing customers love and you need to find those best sellers that are evergreen year-round and we put those on top of funnel campaign to keep acquiring new customers and keep acquiring um and because those are easiest sales essentially so we scale the hell out of that right there i think we got up to like 8k a day 9k a day uh which is not one specific campaign and obviously since we've kind of pulled back uh just due to inventory issues retargeting uh so again we did a lot of uh find a lot of dpas work really well which is dynamic product ads um only for clothing brands with a lot of different skews so if you have a lot of different skews dpas work really well that's just a carousel that basically shows you exactly what you added to your cart and then our creative testing campaign right here um we actually didn't set up this great testing campaign until december so right now just it shows zero spend but it's creative testing campaign is very straight forward it's one campaign one ad set and then we just toss in new ads we kill them after a certain amount of spend so basically after we consolidate account simplify the account structure we see an immediate increase in ROAS and stuff because now we're actually working with the system working with the algorithm and now we need to start building up a list for black friday separate fund day so again list building is where we're basically just running lead generation ads and we're hitting warm audiences so again key here warm audiences past purchases engagement video viewers website visitors anywhere from seven days to 365 days we're trying to find those people that are warm to the brand and we're trying to gather their email addresses so that way we can leverage that uh for black friday for our email marketing campaigns our goal kpi was a dollar per lead and we basically hit that dollar 17 um it's actually euros so excuse me for just saying dollars for everything it's it's euros but just there you go so we actually generated like 7 000 leads 4 300 came from facebook another 3 000 came from their existing email subscribers and we put them all the one separate list of clavio and just that one list right there and i'll show you in a second did like 75 or no hundreds 100 something thousand dollars in a single day and i'll show that to you on a second now days leading up to black friday separate monday looking at the mer report right here you can see about that week before so the 16th to 17th so we start seeing a performance drop it's about 10 days out from black friday separate monday you can start to see performance starts to drop down ROAS is breaking going down and we're actually getting to a point where anything below 1.6 becomes unprofitable um for the client uh or 1.4 1.5 something like that uh starts getting below it starts it starts actually becoming unprofitable for the client now this is when the client was like yo hey pull back like we're losing money and this is where experienced advertisers will say the complete opposite and that is hey no we need to spend more i know we're losing money but we need to spend more trust me so the logic behind this is i'm spending nine ten thousand dollars a day for eight to nine thousand dollars a day with the objective to continue to get people to the website continue to get people to watch our video content and continue to get exposed to the brand what happens is we're building up our warm audiences and like i preach every single video for black friday it comes down to a lot of hey you need a lot of warm audiences to do a really big black friday cold audiences don't perform nearly as well and that's basically the objective here was to continue to build up those audience audiences we're going to sacrifice profits right now but we're going to make all those back up for black friday and again this is a very more kind of prestigious move or you know like hey it's a risky move but you have to understand what you're doing and you also need to understand the brand as well start at low levels before you start doing this before you start moving to higher levels so early launch we did a 24 hour early launch for this brand that was basically our gimmick to get p bar offer to get people sign up for our email list hey sign for email list you get 24 hour early access we're going to sell very quickly we don't have much in stock we're going to sell it very quickly sign up to the 24 hour early access and we basically locked the site and basically just gave out this list of 7 000 people a code to enter the site and just these 7 000 people had the code to the website and if you look in the 22nd we did our early access we spent nine thousand dollars made back a hundred and eleven thousand dollars in revenue for 11.84 ROAS now again i also spent about four thousand dollars on list building too as well to lead up to this so it's not just this day you also got to look at the spend i'll spent before so realistically it was more around a five to six x ROAS when you accumulate that extra spin we also added into there and again our campaigns performed okay that day because again the site was completely locked so a lot of this was just attribution from people on our email list purchasing who received the coupon code um and we did 47 000 45 000 in one hour which is insane i think we had like 9 000 people or not 9 000 people like 900 people on the website like at once which is just insane um to purchase so like it was really cool so you can see the shopify graph right here so after we did this 24 hour launch then from the 23rd to 29th 23rd to tuesday all the way up to the cyber monday that next week 23rd to 29th we moved into just our public offer essentially hey here's public offer like come get it um and we start launching all of our black friday cyber monday campaigns inside of here um you can see right here tofu mofu like all the stuff we're gonna get to this in a second um and we actually ended up using three ad accounts so let me let me get you to run down our ad account got limited at ten thousand dollars a day in spin so we had a second ad account that got us up to four thousand another four thousand dollars we had fourteen thousand dollars a day in spin and then we finally got a third ad account that had around a twenty thousand dollar limit and basically what we did was is we took those other two ad accounts and we we put basically uh like all of our top of funnel one account and then all of our bottom like middle funnel bottom funnel another account so that way we're kind of splitting up the campaign structure across multiple accounts all the pixels shared across those accounts and stuff like that again that's not something you're going to likely run into but just with an account that leads to spin a lot like that's something that you have to kind of get resourceful if we're going back over here you can see this is the mer report for those specific days and you can see right here facebook limited at 10 10 000 10 000 10 000 as that day we got that third second ad account 14 000 um and then we've seen another like 10 to 12 000 increase um right here and that's where we had that third ad account stuff like that so as you can see we kind of hovered around that we had a day where it kind of went down for the third ad account and then kind of chilled around um once we get it back up that next day so yeah and again those those that is contributing all of those ad accounts that's not just focused on one i see overall spend overall row as overall revenue again our kpi we're shooting for so 3x or higher um for this particular sale now digging further here's our ad account structure that we're leveraging for this period of time a lot of cbo top funnel middle funnel um and we're basically running the exact same ads across all of them we have about nine ads total that we're specifically using for black friday separate monday and those nine ads were just duplicated across these three campaigns again i'm just trying to communicate to our message we're having a huge sale to everyone i'm not really trying to convey anyone to purchase like about our brand because a lot of people already know about our brand and stuff like that top of funnel structure we basically just tossed in our three best performing ad sets broad street fashion la one percent third day purchases tossing our three best performing ad sets um for top of our three best performing audiences for top of funnel tossed them in quickly figured out which one was working killed it there's was some delayed attributions at the time these were performing way worse bottom of funnel we wanted to target everyone 30 days 60 days 90 days 180 days again we're using cbo here so it allows the algorithm just kind of distribute that spin across these ad sets depending on how performance is made our life of managing this so so so much easier now here you can just kind of see the ads a little bit they have to crop some stuff again just because client confidentiality confidentiality all that fun stuff um you can just kind of see like all the different ads and stuff we're running during this period of time and yeah like i said mer was our narf star and a lot of people i talk to they're like oh well how do you get facebook specific track and how you get snapchat specific track google like etc like specific tracking honestly we've been using mer which is marketing efficiency ratio and tracking that on a daily basis every single agency i talk to now like this is what they're have gone to and it's very cool because what happens is if you you can clearly see different correlations and stuff so like let's say for example i spend ten thousand dollars on facebook every single day and also i start increasing that budget then what's revenue doing and then as we increase in budget on this or increasing anything else okay well we see google popping up a little bit but snapchat and these billboards relatively equal google okay that's increasing too so as we increase our google and our facebook we're seeing revenue increase like we know hey we don't need to know exactly what ad or exactly what ad set this is contributing we just know that facebook has overall spend it's as it improves as it grows our revenue grows so like that's just how we look at it and then we're also looking at roas and another thing too is why we like to keep a very simplified ad account top of funnel one or two ad sets all of our ads retargeting one ad set all of our ads because it makes things it pulls back the amount of different things that can be um in the middle of this specific like not necessarily like this specific but like it pulls back things that may be other factors in why like we have crazy results so it keeps things very simple very easy to manage and it's a lot closer to the mer if that makes sense now ad account management like we followed our pretty basic strategy if like mer is good over the last 20 72 hours bump budget on all campaigns by 20 percent um if it's bad draw budgets by 20 percent now this is what we followed all the way up until the day before our early access launch but during our black friday separate monday week what we did was is pretty much if if we were like shooting for a 3x mer or 3x roas that um and we had started they off like five or six x we were just going to double in budgets like that that easy like we were trying to push them in crazy i wasn't really worried about this oh if you increase something more than 20 percent in 24 hour period goes back into learning like i don't care because we're just we're trying to spend as much as humanly possible in a very very very short period of time so um the only way you can do this is if you have a great product a great offer and a great brand that's it and obviously great ads so if you don't have any of that place like it becomes very difficult to do that just tell you that now now lastly overview of everything um so i converted euros to dollars just to make things a little bit more easier for you guys to um and also easier for me to articulate to you guys uh we did 1,222,849 and we did we spent 377 000 for a 3.24 roas break-even rest for this particular brand is like a 1.47 and then once we add it in the uh because again like your break-even rest before sales can be different and then when you're running a sale your break-even roas is lower because you're offering a discount and that discount of profit so you have to make sure you keep that in mind when you're running a sale your break-even roas can be completely different um and that was like a 2.0 so yeah so client was definitely very profitable client was extremely ecstatic um huge milestone for the client um and also to our first seven figure month as well so that was pretty cool so there's lots and lots of really cool stuff that's happened with this specific account um over that period of time and i i think too like as an agency we can deliver these amazing results and stuff like that but like we're only 20% responsible we came in we helped the client put the strategy together we guided the client exactly when it to be done but at the end of the day like this is still a bigger win for the client than us because this is like i like to look at it from this perspective of hey the client still wanted to call these risks client took the risk on us um the clients uh helped out with some of the content and everything like that like we basically just went in there and helped scale the shit out of things and guided the strategy and stuff like that so um again this is our done for you service but there's still a lot more um i don't know i i feel like some agencies flashing screenshots like that they built this brand themselves when like realistically you know it's so much more of like the client everything like that that's built everything and the agency just comes in and helps them reach that next level and that's simply what we did for this particular client we just came in helped them reach the next level inside their business um and got them there so uh i want to thank you guys so much for watching this video pretty cool case study if you have any questions drop them below i'll do my best uh respond back to any of
