right i know i know i know it's september why are we talking about black friday guys it is time to officially start prepping for black friday of 2022 and looking at q4 as a whole yes i know it's september but trust me it's time now because quite frankly waiting till november 1st is way too late and i've this is my fourth black friday last year i started prepping in october year before i started prepping november my first week of november and the year before i literally wait till a week before black friday and let me tell you now if you want to have a successful black friday q4 in general you need to start preparing now because even october is too late so if you start the conversation on september 1st you are in a perfectly good time frame if you're waiting to november 1st trust me you will be way way way too late and this video i may literally go over the the key things you need to start thinking about to start preparing okay i'm not really gonna talk about actions or strategies stuff like that i'm talking more about how to start preparing from a brand owner's perspective for black friday and look if you're new to the channel and you don't know me my name is nick terrio i run an ads agency we work with brands um you know help them scale to seven figures a month and we um we manage roughly seven or 750k a month to a million dollars more of a month of adsmen specifically for facebook ads so um again i don't have anything to sell you guys um i don't have a course or anything like that um my ultimate goal at the end of the day is give you guys a lot of value on the channel the videos to help you get to one to one day be able to work with my agency if you choose and yeah that's it so let's hop into the video and get this started so black friday cyber monday 2022 preparation there's three core parts of black friday cyber monday that you need to start looking at you have the list building which is basically going to be from now um till black friday cyber monday you have the teasing part which is 14 days out from black friday cyber monday which again that's me something that we talk about in another video that's be kind of a few core part of this series right here um then obviously you have the black friday cyber monday actual official launch day so what you need to prepare for q4 is a four key things number one is the goal okay what do you want to make in q4 q4 in general specifically um the offers you need um you know like what do you need to run to help you hit those goals um that's offers in all areas between new products between discounts and specials all the way to restocks like it's all different types of offers not just 10% off nick you know shit like that inventory you know how much inventory you have in stock you even have enough inventory to hit your goal and then obviously the execution side which we'll talk a little bit about but that's me more in another specific video which like the actual like ad account structure and like campaigns and emails and stuff like that so number one is the goal how much money do you want to make in q4 this is the biggest aspect right here okay you need to understand what you want to make in q4 so let's say for example you want to make a hundred thousand dollars or you may want to make a million dollars or you may want to make three million dollars again q4 no um it's october november december you want to make three million dollars okay cool you need first you have to determine the goal now secondly you need to determine inventory all right what would three million dollars worth of inventory look like all right in retail retail value not you know inventory value all right cool what's up offers do we need to run how much ad spend do we need you know for example we want to do three million dollars at a 3x roos then we need at least have a million dollars um ready to deploy for ad spend all right if we want to deploy that much how do we get that you know do we have enough money to be able to spend up to 10k a day um profitably in that aspect when you open a credit card so we need to increase our spending limits on our bank accounts like things like that that's something you need to look at okay so first thing you have to look at is just your overall goal for q4 and it might look like something like this you know um 150k in october 300k or 450k in november and like 150k in december 200k in december okay so just keep in mind that november is always twice as good as october just from my previous experiences so it's two to three x better sometimes and december you only have roughly about two weeks before it's you know drops down severely so just want to keep you guys in mind that you know it's not just gonna be a straight up like 100k 100k november or october 200k november and 300k in december give you guys realistic expectations here all right now offers okay what offers do you need to run to hit your overall goal so again there's about five key offers that you want to look at to help out with q4 performance okay so first thing you have is halloween october 31st that's kind of like if you won uh like half our brands run specials on that day other halves for i don't so like no big deal if you don't do this one that's that's kind of like a lower priority one but then your next ones are really key so black friday falls on november 25th this year and cyber monday falls to 28th so we want to run bfcm ads between friday all the way through and of monday night then what we want to do is tuesday november 29th we want to drop a new product new collection new release okay now here's why um the only thing that's giving us the highest conversion rate coming off a sale is by running a new drop okay it's the only way we've been able to get people who just bought from us from a sale to buy again so this could be a new drop this could be a restock restocks work really well too if it's a really really really hot item do a restock right after on that tuesday 29th is the only way to get people who just bought this weekend to purchase again from us okay and that's gonna help keep momentum up because otherwise tuesday the 29th is gonna be dead okay usually it happens um you know you have a really amazing friday through monday then literally from like tuesday all the way to the next monday it's fucking sucks okay and being bluntly honest with you guys because i want you guys to expect this all right so unless you counter for some type of a new drop okay and it has to be a new product new drop not just under sale because no one gives a fuck about that all right then you have your christmas offer okay this will start monday december 5th and will run up until like when like ship before christmas like get before christmas ends um all the way up to christmas all right so we run this for a long period of time that's totally okay this is your christmas offer 20 off save 20 off for christmas okay whatever all right and exactly the same thing as black friday we want to do another new year drop all right but this will be our new year drop specifically new year new me whatever people want to call it things like that um it's the same psychology why um people bought a bunch of stuff for christmas all right let's release a whole new product new collection whatever and we're gonna get people to come back and purchase again for this new hot item all right so why we're talking about this now so you have time to place orders for all this inventory it's also another reason why we're talking about this now all right second thing for offers is bad offers are complicated this is your buy one or buy two get one free buy three get a four you know two free type of shit like that you know buy this item get this item for free buy this item though and you get this item free plus this like all that crap right there um and discount codes do not use fucking discount codes it's horrible and i'm gonna explain why all right discount codes you know people input them wrong um it's a very fast-paced environment on black friday so you don't use the discount code when people are getting jammed with discount codes you'll make it super super easy for them to purchase if it's easy for them to purchase then you're gonna get more sales okay so a good offer simple 20 off a free t-shirt with every purchase things like that very simple one specific call to action 20 off or free shipping or get a free or you know get a free shirt with every purchase so one of those three or it doesn't have to be a free shirt just like a bonus item things like that all right if you're already running a discount automatically discount code your whole site um you can use a app like sales and discount manager and it literally allows you to just input like 20 off across the whole site boom boom or you can um you know mark down certain products like collect products in this collection 20 off products in this collection 30 off products in this collection 50 off and make sure it's irresistible if you're running a discount code or like a discount on the site make sure it's something you've never ran all year if if all year you ran 30 off don't run 20 off or 30 off you need to run 60 off things like that something really aggressive okay that's going to really make sure it converts well now number three is inventory like i said let's say for example you want to do 200 000 in revenue on black friday weekend then you need to have make sure you have at least um 400 000 of retail value if you want to do a 50 off offer okay so you have to make sure you keep that in mind and then also too you need to look at um your best sellers typically best sellers can make up up to 80 of sales now execution like i said i didn't really want to get into too much of this but um this is will be in later videos but i said right now you need to really focus on list building and obviously we'll talk about things like teasing offers our launch structure um and just heads up like black friday cyber monday weekend we do seven batches of ads which each batch having three to four ads now list building again this is what i want to focus on now list building right now it's more important than ever to speak spending as much as you possibly can because whatever you acquire whatever customers you acquire between now and the day before black friday are going to be people that'll be purchasing for black friday so you want to try to go as aggressive as possible if you're happy with a three extra s you want to try to shoot for like a 2.5x if it's more closer like if like you want to find that like kind of a yellow area where it's like we're still profitable but it's not as profitable as like 4x for us right go for a little bit lower row ass if it means to acquire more customers and you really want to focus on customer acquisition also building facebook groups um discords telegram things like that other groups of people that you own um and then organic followings really focus on increasing your tick tock following your instagram following um and also like your sms and email list building so um customer acquisition you know you could run something like hey let's say for example a lower ticket product that we can scale really high the break even email and sms lip building you can do something like you know like a first time purchase discount code for email and sms pop-ups things like that just pay shipping on low-cost products you can do a gift card giveaway like every week we're giving away a gift card on social media just tag three friends and you also must be following us things like that so just a few key actions right there that you can take to help out the list building side but again these are all people that will be purchasing from us in black friday 7 or monday so it's very important that we acquire those people now and put them into our ecosystem so guys i really hope you all enjoyed this video so i'm going to give you guys kind of the lay of the land of what to start to prepare and expect for black friday cyber monday this year again yes it's early it feels early to have this conversation but trust me it's better be early than be late for black friday cyber monday because it is a hell show when it comes down to that time so it's important to start the preparation
