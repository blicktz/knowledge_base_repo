How to do market research, one of the most undervalued skills that's not talked about in the online space that provides the highest impact in the success of your ads because it allows you to understand your consumer to a point to where basically you can whatever you say they resonate with and actually at the end of the day buy your product. So today I'm going through kind of my simple guide to market research, a few places to do market research, why it's important, a few things to look for, and also to just like how often to do market research as well. If you're asking yourself, why am I credible to be teaching this type of things?

I run a Facebook ads advertising agency, spent over $50 million in online revenue specifically from Facebook ads for my clients. And I also coach a few students. So if you're interested in either me running your Facebook ads or coaching, click links below.

I have one that says, have Nickterio run your ads. And then another one that says have Nickterio mentor you. Before we get started, hit that like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

And let's dive into the video. So how to do market research. First off, the goal is to persuade someone, to motivate someone, to sell someone.

You really need to understand that person. You need to be able to understand people to a point of, hey, I literally can like, listen to your thoughts right now. Okay.

You need to, you need to have the same conversations as a marketer, as they're having conversations in their head. You need to be able to understand someone better than they understand themselves. Now, why are you, what are you looking to understand?

That's a key thing right there. These are a few things that we like to look into, and that's their belief system. Basically, what beliefs do they have that they leverage to make decisions down the road?

What are their main desires? You know, do you have a desire to get rich, desire to get healthy, desire to get a six pack, desire to get a beautiful girlfriend? Like what are their specific desires?

What's their identity? You know, who they are right now and who are they looking to become? It's another big thing right there.

Have they tried other products before yours? What are similar products being marketed to them? So, you know, let's say for example, similar products would be like Facebook ads, e-com, or not e-com, Google ads, email marketing.

Have they tried products, other products before yours? Maybe they worked with other Facebook ad agencies before they work with mine. Okay.

Just using my like service as a example. So desires, what motivates your prospect? What is the main motivator that that's, you know, moving them to purchase your product or just in general, what is that main motivator that we can use to position your product in front of them?

Okay. Your objective is to understand your consumer and desires they have. These are a few examples, the desire to be rich, desire to be well-spoken, desire to have a six pack, desire to get a girl's attention, you know, desire to have a bigger house, desire to get bigger, better, um, better with Facebook ads, desire to get ripped in the gym, uh, desire to be, you know, you know, for me right now, I have a desire to be a better boxer right now as I've been in boxing enough about a year and a half and I've been really loving it.

So just a little bit about me, like those are things, desires right there that motivate people. When I had a desire to start getting into boxing, guess what? I switched gyms to a gym that has boxing.

Then when I had, then I had a new desire and I was a desire to get better at boxing. Okay. And what I do, I hired a coach.

Okay. So like you have different desires and your objective is to learn those desires from your consumer. Now beliefs.

Okay. This is a really advanced topic right here. I'm not going to lie.

Belief system is really important to understand because, but it is high level. Okay. And basically is how your prospect makes decisions based on beliefs they already have.

Okay. And obviously your objective center, stay in your consumer and the beliefs that they have around your product or industry. Okay.

I'll give you guys two examples really quick. So one of our clients, um, we're selling ambulance insurance. That's basically all I can say.

Okay. We're selling ambulance insurance. Okay.

You call an ambulance, you have this insurance, you don't pay a dime. Okay. Well, when we tell people that their first belief is, and I'm, we're, I'm talking about the USA because other countries have different healthcare systems.

So this, it won't be the same, but in the USA, you have about a 50% chance that that ambulance bill, you're going to have to pay. And this could be anywhere from a thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars. Okay.

Huge ass bill. Okay. So in this particular case, you have a 50% chance that you have to pay or your health, um, health insurance will pay it.

Okay. For us, we identified that majority of people did not know that their health insurance wouldn't cover it. Okay.

So when we just say, Hey, you call an ambulance, you don't pay a dime on our watch. Now, the problem with this is that a lot of the consumers were like, well, my health insurance will cover it. They're providing an objection and also a belief right there.

Okay. So we're understanding that their belief, the health, health, uh, insurance will cover it. So what we had to do is we had to first acknowledge that in the ad before we presented the problem, Hey, this is a huge problem in health insurance.

They don't cover ambulances then. And we provided proof on that. So that way people could actually validate for themselves.

Then we articulated the problem and the solution around ambulance insurance. So we had to overcome a specific belief they had already. Another one.

It's your whole life. Your parents have been telling you that getting rich and like rich people are evil and stuff like that. But now you, us, you have a belief system that rich people are evil.

It's bad to have money. So then when you get a course that helps you make money position in front of you, now, all of a sudden you have a new belief system that, Hey, that's bad. And you have to overcome that specific belief or maybe develop, develop the belief where a lot of people, you know, have gotten scammed by courses.

And now you have a belief system that all courses are scams. Okay. So now you have to overcome that belief.

That's very important to understand beliefs of your consumer because sometimes you might not believe sometimes it's not, I'm not saying every product will have this, but sometimes there's beliefs that you have to overcome and beliefs you have to manage when you are advertising. Now identity identity is more of who your customer currently is and who do they want to become. Okay.

So this is really just understanding the identity of your consumer. And it's really important to understand this because like, I'm going to give you a very, before I even really go into this, I'm going to give you a very basic understanding of this. Okay.

When you create the ads, okay. When you create the ads and you put a person in the ad, when you film it in a specific location, the words you use, okay. You know, the slang in that case, all of that comes back down to identity.

Okay. And a problem we used to have on my team was that my visual creators from Poland. Okay.

So my, my person who, who actively, you know, edits the video content for ads is from Poland. And he was taking his view perspective of Poland scenery and adding it to our ads, which made all of our ads look like they were from out of country. Cause we probably dominantly advertise in the USA for a lot of our brands.

So we had to train them up on how to identify identity and all that good stuff to where now he more focuses on. Okay. What are the locations that this particular consumer is used to?

You know, what are the, what are the locations that our consumer is going to resonate with environment, things like that? What are the people, you know, is it a 21 year old who looks like he's been power lifting his whole life? Is a 21 year old who looks like he's just read books his whole life?

Is it a 21 year old who is, looks very successful and happy. Is it a 21 year old who works a nine to five? You know, who, like, what is the, the visual, you know, kind of character that we need to place in that ad that's really important right there.

Okay. So that's something right there. You have to look at it.

It's just looking at an identity from a very just easy perspective. Okay. Then it digs a little bit deeper into what is the identity we're selling to the consumer and what is that new identity?

What are the emotions that new identity feels? Okay. So for example, you know, right now with me and the entrepreneur space, okay, I used to resonate with a lot of these very successful people.

It's like, Hey, if only, if only I could get there, you know, they work a couple hours a day, they travel the world, they're successful, they're super happy. They feel all these amazing emotions. I want to be like them.

So I was, when ads sold me that specific identity, I resonate more with them than others. So it's very important to look at identity of who do they want to become? That's the more important thing than who they are now.

It's still very important to understand who they are now, but you have to understand that an ad that sells a product or a service also sells a new, a transformation, a new identity to the consumer. So it's also very interesting. It's very important to understand that identity they want to become now other products they've tried before yours.

Okay. Something super important here because this will allow you to one, it also allows you to see what they resonated before, but also to, it allows you to see why were they were dissatisfied and those other products to improve your product. Okay.

So let's say for example, last five Facebook ad agencies they've worked with, they were super frustrated because of lack of communication, no real attention or detail to their account. Okay. Well, when we sell them, our agency, we directly call out the fact that we have 24 seven communication that we spent extra time on their account for, you know, for this specific reason, yada, yada, yada.

Okay. So it's important to understand with other products that they've tried before yours and fell that it's important to understand why they failed. It's very important to understand why they were dissatisfied.

And it's important for you to improve your product to not have those same things, or it's going to limit your potential with growing. Now, what are similar products that are being marketed to them? Okay.

So let's say for example, um, obviously I run Facebook ads for people in this particular case. So what are similar products that are being sold to them that also have the specific outcome of business growth? Okay.

Well, you have Google ads, you have email marketing, tick tock, CRO doesn't actually have to be paid advertising. It's all specific, just services that help with increasing business growth and business revenue inside of the business. Now, how to find this info?

Very important right here. Okay. First off you have your own data.

Okay. This is your own data that you have on your website. Go look at your website reviews.

Go look at what people are saying about your product. Look at the good and the bad, the badge really important because if you are not improving your business based off bad reviews, you're being unethical as a business owner. And it's very important to understand that bad reviews simply shows you what you need to refine on.

It's not calling out your business. It's not saying bad things about your business. You know, a lot of people take these bad reviews as pure ego and they try to delete them and like that.

And they try to ignore them, take those bad reviews in and use that to improve your business as a whole. And you're going to go substantially further. Facebook ad comments.

Look at the comments that's on your ads. If you're already running ads, look at the comments on your ads, social media comments. I highly recommend everyone be posting daily on their Facebook and their Instagram already organic because it does help out with overall Facebook performance.

Now, when I say that, that's like five, maybe 5% in terms of Facebook performance. So it's not like it's something that's going to make the difference between the 2X and 3X for us. It's like something that's gonna make the difference between a 3X and like a 3.1X for us.

That's it. Customer support questions and feedback. Things you get on customer support really big.

You can take a survey. You can use something like JotForm or Google. Blast out a survey to all your existing customers and ask them questions.

Hey, why did you buy? What made you buy? What other products did you look at?

What could you do? Like, you know, if we basically said, you know, we launched a new product, for example, what would you want to see? What could we improve?

Like just question them. Don't make it super long. Just two, three questions.

Make it easy for them to fill out and you get a higher response rate. And also to literally call customers and ask questions. Okay.

Christian Guzman with Alphalete. He would, every time he would see a YouTube video review of his product, because again, this is like a $100 million brand. Every time he would see a video review of his brand, he would literally set up a time and call with that specific YouTuber and thoroughly go through their experience with the product so he could better understand the consumer.

Now, competitors, another super big place websites, product reviews, Facebook ads library, really look at their beliefs. They might be overcoming the identity that they're selling people, the desires they're going after. Look at their Facebook ads library, social media, post post comments.

This is also another really big one. Go to their Instagram, go look at their Instagram tagged photos and see what competitors like their customers are saying about them. What they look like, how do they talk, all good things to look at now, YouTube, Reddit, and Google going more after the forums and that perspective right there, watch YouTube video reviews of competitor products.

If you do can, if you can find some YouTube video reviews of your product, look up that as well, search questions related to the problem they're experiencing. So, you know, start like the very basic marketer is just going to say, Hey competitor X product reviews. And you'll find a lot just from, just from looking at the consumer, the comments and stuff like that, you'll find a lot, but then the next level marketer is actually going to try to position themselves in the buying process of that consumer buying that product.

And they're going to start searching questions related to that consumer, that buying, you know, journey. Again, make sure you review the comments, make sure you look at how that specific YouTuber is talking about your product. And if there's no problem, just examine people and really start to build ideas off their desires, beliefs and identity.

Okay. So for example, right now we have one brand where there is no problem. It's a clothing brand and there's no problem at all.

They don't bring any functional fashion to it, which functional fashion is basically like problem solved fashion. They just a pure fashion brand. So I'm just having to really study people and really try to figure out what do they want to feel?

What's that identity that they really want to be, you know, have in their life. And now I'm positioning the brand with the identity they want to feel. And I'm solving the problem of a specific identity that they want to feel.

Okay. Amazon, super big place. Highly recommend Amazon.

Go look up, you know, your product, go look up your competitor products. Also look at products that are similar to yours that solve the same problem. Look at the product images, look at the customer reviews, look at the product description, all those specific things right there.

Okay. Very important. And lastly, another really good one is just simply use the product.

I know some people who just, they literally just in it for the money and they don't care about their product at all. And I've also seen a lot of people who are very successful in our business who are passionate about their product, become more passionate about your product, use your product on a daily basis, just using your product on a daily basis. We'll give you a shitload more ad ideas specifically, but use your product on a daily basis, or maybe it's just not for you, but you know, someone that the products for make sure that particular person uses the product on a daily basis and consistently keep having conversations with that specific person.

Now, here's a few things for you guys for advanced customer research, give you guys some free game here. Review an ad that doesn't work. Okay.

So let's say for example, you run an ad already and it doesn't work at all. Okay. Well, what you want to do, you want to take that ad and you want to look at that ad and you want to ask yourself, what are the objections?

What are the fears? What are the doubts and what are the excuses that people are making to not buy from this ad? Okay.

And you're going to stem ideas off of this. Okay. Now this is advanced level marketer.

Just letting you know now, stem ideas off of these of why they might not be buying for these couple of reasons, or why they're not like buying from this out for these specific reasons. Then I want you to go ahead and research these ideas with the goal to solve them. Okay.

And it's very, very basic right here. I'm saying this because it's very hard without like actually like, you know, going through a few ads. Okay.

Now where to store this data. Okay. So you start gathering all this data in on your consumer.

Keep it simple. Okay. Every time you do a research session, just take a pen and paper and just start writing down ideas.

Okay. Based off what you're researching. Okay.

Then what you can do is you can keep a Google sheet or a Google document file, nothing sexy about it. We have, um, like a Google sheet, nothing sexy at all. Like literally, there's no template or anything like that because again, it's, it's literally just a plain Google sheet where I'm just pasting in it.

That says research. That's it. Okay.

And then you can take all those key points and add them onto the file. Okay. Now how often should you research?

This is also something super big right here. Um, I make myself and my team members, which I've a team of three. So a total team of four together, counting me, we each do 20 minutes of research a day.

So each day, cause again, I run an agency. So a lot of you guys are more brand owners each day, each team member picks a specific client. And then we spend 20 minutes a day researching.

Okay. So Monday I'll pick client one Tuesday, I pick client two Wednesday, pick client three, yada, yada, yada. And that gives us a total of 400 minutes a week.

I highly recommend if you are a brand owner and you're only focusing on your own brand, 30 minutes a day is absolute a must. And lastly, super big warning is that many business owners have an ego, which prevents them from essentially, you know, doing customer research because they think they know it all. Okay.

I know my product. I don't need to do any of this. And what happens here is that they understand their consumer only one half of it, but they don't understand their consumer to be able to connect to them.

Cause the whole goal of being a good marketer is being able to connect to people. Okay. So they understand how to sell their product, but they do not understand how to connect to their consumer.

Okay. I have a specific client right now, super big on this. They have a super big ego and they're like, I know my product, blah, blah, blah.

Just look at the customer reviews. You don't need to do any of this customer research. Just look at your customer reviews.

Okay. Your customer reviews are a good place to look at, but the customer reviews does not tell you how how to connect to future customers. Okay.

Customer reviews is just telling you what customers like about your product. Okay. But to connect to future customers, you need to really understand their situation, really understand where they're at right now and be able to reach into that and pull them in.

Okay. So that's the big key thing now. So really hope you guys enjoyed this video.
