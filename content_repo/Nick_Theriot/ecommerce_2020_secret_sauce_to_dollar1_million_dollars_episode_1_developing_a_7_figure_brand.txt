Let's go into that. So first off, let me just show you guys some results real quick This is one ad account right here. This is a total spent we spent in 2020 And it's the total revenue I've generated them again These are both clients so I can't actually go inside the ads manager to show you guys everything I just try to keep some of that secret private due to you know client How much they allow me to actually share with you guys?

But we generate at 1.6 million dollars to say women's clothing brand and then this account right here We've generated we spent three hundred eighty five thousand dollars It's it's right at nine hundred seventy four thousand dollars, but inside the Shopify it's one point zero 1 million fifty nine thousand dollars in actual revenue and that's a 2.5 to RASP or actually a little bit more Speaking that so but look if you think this is fake and you're making more than ten thousand dollars per month What's your business click below to book a call with me and I'll gladly show you these things on a call? I just Not gonna show it to you on a YouTube video and I actually go through the ad account and all that good stuff. So, um That's just what I have to say about that for anyone who wants to comment.

Oh my god. Those results are fake. Yeah, but it could be Photoshop I'll gladly hop on a zoom call with you just I want to respect my time So, please make sure you're making at least more than ten thousand dollars per month with your business and We can I'll show you all those ad accounts and show you the proof and process of how that works So with that being said When you want to scale a brand to over a million dollars Just within however much time first off you need a great product.

I know too many people try to sell a Product with like some amazing advertising but a shitty product and you can't sell shit So if you're starting to sell shit Regardless of how amazing advertising can be it's not gonna work good at least at scale as well Because when you're scaling you got to reach really got to really have everything really fine-tuned to really scale a product so You really need to have a great product and I like to put it as this you need to have a product that people look forward to buying So this is a product that when positioned in front of them They cannot wait to toss you their money. They're like hey, I need that product. When can I get it?

I love it. I need it That's what's up a product you need you need something that people get excited about something that people are gonna be like Oh my god, this is gonna be absolutely amazing. Let me get it So that's number one you need to have a great product and to do that you have to do product research So you need to dig deep how does this product add value to the market?

So if you're in a clothing because I have a lot of people that follow me for clothing e-com stores What does your product do better than all the other clothing brands is your t-shirt more or softer? Is your t-shirt just your whole business and how you handle people 10 times more better than how your customer service on your or the customer service your competitor handles their clients What do you do better? What does your product do better?

that's going to give you that leg up and over the competition and Reason why people choose you over everyone else So you really need to dig deep into the pain points people are having with other products are similar to yours because nine times out of ten Majority of the people watching this is gonna be a product. That's a variation or product already on the market It's rare that people are just completely come up with a product No one has had and honestly if you do create that You're probably more focused on doing large things of fundraising as we generate you a lot of You know publicity and stuff and that you know regardless all that nine times out of ten majority people in here or actually Have a product that's just a better improvisation of Another product. So if you skip this step, you're gonna lose ton of money because you're gonna be trying to sell a product No one wants and what you want to do is too many people try to They find a product and they immediately start testing it into like paid ads and stuff What I highly recommend is actually talking to your social circle Reaching out to some influencers maybe sending them the product and not seeing what they think Start like testing, you know big companies.

They do this They do these little small controlled groups of like product testers This is what you want to do with a product you want to test and see if people really actually want this and also to what type of Like constructive criticism you can get from these small people within like your circle and i'll say this if you cannot sell it Organically, you will not be able to sell it with paid traffic going into like the whole pricing aspect Make sure you have a 60% profit margin at least ideal is 70 to 75 sometimes 80% I know a lot of people I talked to that like a 20% profit margin on their product. So it's cost of goods Subtracted by the you know, the sell price and whatever price you're selling at if you only like 20% profit of that You're not gonna go you're not gonna be able to build a big business build bigger businesses have bigger profit margins because they have a lot more overhead So if you're trying to scale with ads and you have a 20% profit margin You need like an insane like, you know 10x return on ad spend to Be profitable so for example, I have like one client that has like a 2.5 extra break-even return on ad spend And it's really hard to scale their ads because typically facebook ads is anywhere from a 3 to 4x is the average um roa's uh for like facebook ads just at industry-wide so Um, you really want to make sure you have that 60 to 70% profit margin Um, you can alter this already if you already have a brand that's working really well And you just want to kind of fix a few things increase those prices up and that's going to make a big difference In overall profit, which allow you to spend more make more So now once you actually have a product you need to break down the ideal consumer for that product You should have this in mind already as you tailored a product to the consumer So like you should already kind of know What your ideal audience looks like? um, but Persona breaking down breaking down your ideal persona is really we're gonna really go dig deeper Uh, so for example, uh, let's target women uh, from 18 or No, not 18 21 to 25 Uh, it's their first baby So we're gonna target, you know, they're they're new mothers Um, what type of stuff they're looking at that there's different like blogs and magazines they're looking at for new expecting Uh, what what do they do for a living?

You know, they're mostly um, hairdressers Uh, they're mostly nail stylists Uh, they're mostly secretaries Uh, maybe some of them are doctors like figure out exactly dig deep into what they do What kind of vehicles they drive? What kind of money they have? All of that stuff because what essentially that's going to do is going to allow you to really understand who this ideal audience is And then you want to even dig deeper and you want to know what are their pain points right now?

What pains are they're experiencing? Again, you should know this already because you tailored your product to those pain points But you also want to know their desires and their wants And this should this is kind of the benefits of your product. So like your product Solves those pain points and get some of those desires and wants But again, you want to have all these down You really want to understand who you're targeting What your product does to them how it helps them and all that Because this doesn't allow you to tailor all of your marketing all your content marketing To that specific audience now branding Uh branding is your next step.

So you you have your audience you have your persona Now you need the branding to like like wrap it all together Uh, make that complete package So once you have a great product with proven selling potential a persona of who you want to target It's your job to reach that persona through well calculated branding Now I want to run this real quick by you Um, think about any brands under armor, nike, uh, coca-cola Um, think about Just when you say those names Um, what is the first thing you think of about that brand? Maybe not an experience you have but like the actual like branding aspect You know, I think about under armor, uh, the first thing that pops up to me is sports So with branding All these big brands they've properly Like planned all of this to For you to have that thought in your mind as soon as their name is mentioned And that's the key with branding What is the first thought that pops up in your mind? When you think of a big brand?

So I know that's that's it's a lot but um, that's what you're going to do with your branding And you the way you establish that thought in people's mind Is creating content? Um, and really digging deep on like your core values and representing them through content um, clearly establishing the Benefits of your brand what your brand is about How your brand helps people and you do that through content marketing and branding? Um, I don't really like to go too deep into branding, but essentially you like to consider You like to have a consistent theme across all your content of What that message you're trying to come across with?

So let's for example, let's uh, go back to kind of like the brand I was just kind of a personal breakdown. I was talking about like, you know pregnant women between you know, their first mothers 21 to Why is that 24 25? Um, we want to create branding that's all about um for new moms So, you know X brand right here The first thing they want to think about is new mothers and how this product helps new mothers So all of the content is going to be around Helping new mothers and what you do is you portray your product To where that product is being shown helping new mothers every single content piece And this is going to help you establish your branding So for me when I think of underarmor the first thing I think of sports The reason why is because every sports or at least at the time when it was really big on the armor Um, it's it was constantly being shown in sports All these athletes wearing on the armor all these uniforms on the armor All a lot of their commercials and stuff was all about baseball football stuff like that So the first thing I think is boom sports Your brand, what does it say for our example brand new mothers So that's that's calculated branding right there And having that strong brand that allows people to Really separate your company across all the others So and obviously that's where the core values also coming through and how you portray those Let's say our core value is really amazing customer service So we're gonna we're gonna consistently have Amazing customer service to where everyone's talking about our amazing customer service.

So Copywriting copywriting is super important because this is a way you portray This branding you portray a product and everything and how you get your idea across to the consumer for them to understand So you'll be needing copywriting for every product on your website Just random website pages social media bios email marketing daily social media posts and ads So copywriting is crazy of how much will be going into this Um, and you want to make sure your copywriting speaks directly to your ideal audience So if you're creating a brand for new mothers women 21 to 24 Uh, you want to make sure your copywriting has the same lingo Verbiage and stuff like that that they're going ahead and using and for anyone on here who uses tick tock Um, there's been a lot of brands recently that started getting on tick tock advertising And what they're doing is they're going ahead and finding the viral tick tocks that we're all aware of and they're Recreating those as ads for their brand and the reason why they're doing this is because it's speaking To their ideal audience in the way they know and that's through these um tick tocks And these uh, I guess you say memes that was created from these tick tocks So that's just an example, but that's that's for like tick tock, but for copywriting is the same thing You want to use the same language the same Uh, you know how they talk to each other how they talk to their friends and stuff like that How the influencers the best way to go is find the influencers in that space that you're targeting. So for me new mothers 21 24 Women i'm gonna go find all the influencers the women who um Push constant out that these new mothers follow And then i'm just gonna kind of pull some of their language and their verbiage they used so I can start laying that through sprinkling it on my ad copy seasoning the ad copy with like salt and pepper to spice it up for people to make it more um, so they can It just it feels like you're talking to them when you feel like you're talking to them to increase your branding it's going to really establish your product And it's just gonna really really really position you Into their mind and it's like all the little green indicators are tick off in their mind like I love this brand That's what your goal is and that's one way to do it
