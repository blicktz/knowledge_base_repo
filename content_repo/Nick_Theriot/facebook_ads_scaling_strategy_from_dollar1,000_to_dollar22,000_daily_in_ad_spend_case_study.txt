being profitable before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day helping the shopify ecom business owner scale their business in 2021 let's get started okay so now that we're inside this ad account i want to show you all really quick we started this promotion on january 14th of 2021 and we've been running it all the way up until today which is february 3rd 2021 you can see we started off with a thousand dollars in ad spend per day and if we look back to today's results you can see we spent 22 000 in a day and we did a little over three extra turn for this particular ad account now we have been getting limited over the last say three four days i think our first limitation was saturday so if i go back and scroll through you can see last four days we've been hitting a three extra turn on ad spend and we've been hitting a 22 000 daily limit so just to showcase to y'all that this is actually real um i can go ahead and refresh the page whatever it takes this is real this is for one of our clients we've been scaling pushing pretty hard so before we actually show you exactly how we can scale that aggressively we need to understand a few key things so when you're scaling facebook ads a lot of people think hey you get one or two you know sales we can start pushing and spending more aggressively on it and it's going to just work while that is kind of true it doesn't entirely work once you start crossing over the hundred thousand dollar ten thousand dollar a day range and in fact once you start pushing harder and harder you need to ensure that these three key concepts are perfect so in order to spend more you need to make sure you have proven creatives creatives that are working from time to time again you need to make sure you have a proven offer something that a lot of people want and you need some very large proven audiences so we've worked with like a gaming chair company before where you know it was really hard to scale past like the five hundred dollar a day to a thousand dollar a day in ad spin because there's only certain amount of buyers in the market actively ready for a gaming chair so in order first to scale past that we had to use some few other techniques that were completely different that's a whole nother video but for this particular ad account we could scale very aggressively because we had a very good offer we had some very large audiences we were going completely broad open with our top funnel audiences and our creatives just worked really well so if we dig deeper further into this um we want at least like six proven creatives to you know start off with when you start to scale these are creatives that work and your offer needs to be big so for this particular ad account literally anyone that is in a relationship or has a daughter or son that's in a relationship or maybe friend that's in a relationship they want to just be nice just anyone that knows someone or is in a relationship and has a significant other this particular product they would love so we had a very very very wide offer that we could present to a lot of people it wasn't that narrow now our audiences were huge our proven audiences was literally broad completely open US market so that allowed us to spend a lot and allow us to really see what we're doing and allow us to really scale very quickly if you have a very narrow offer maybe not the greatest creatives very small audiences it's going to be very very hard to scale say past a thousand dollars a day in ad spend so let me show you guys exactly what strategy we used to actively scale this so first things first is you need to test creatives and audiences you need to make sure you're getting your creatives and your audiences tested before you start to scale because if you try to start scaling unproven audiences and unproven creatives what happens is you start to throw spin at something you don't know works and you're going to blow a lot of money whereas for us we do low budget testing and what works we gradually start to increase the spin on it from you know five to ten dollars a day per creative all the way up to a few thousand dollars a day in creatives once we start to scaling so we set up an abo campaign so ad set budget optimization with whatever proven audiences we know work right now we test those creatives and then we start to expand on some more audiences do another abo campaign except this time we're just testing audiences with the proven creatives from the first campaign then what we do is we take all the ad sets that work and all the creatives that work mix them all up together and we do a cbo campaign so we'll have five proven audiences say have you know three or four proven creatives per ad set and then you have a cbo campaign a hundred dollars a day with everything we know that works and then you can start increasing this by 20 daily if kpis are being met now nick what do you do how do you scale aggressively at a hundred dollars a day with a 20 daily increase because to be honest that's pretty damn slow so what can you do to further increase the effectiveness of this how can you scale this harder and that's the question we've we've ran into plenty of times so we started to just simply duplicate that cbo campaign with a higher budget so we start off at a hundred dollars a day if that's working well something at a hundred dollars a day it's not going to work better or at a thousand dollars a day so if you're getting a five extra turn on ad spend at a hundred dollars a day for the cbo campaign when you duplicate it at say a thousand dollars a day you'll probably see like a three to four extra turn on ad spend and so on as you start to scale it's just the way the system works because facebook has to really really really dig further and further into people that are not really ready to buy yet so it takes a little more ad impressions to really get someone to convey over so the more you scale the worse your results are going to get so you need to make sure you're converting really well at a hundred dollars per day because nothing's gonna get better once you duplicate and scale higher so if your hundred dollar a day is working good and let's say you need to scale very quickly like hey i need to spend a hundred thousand dollars the next 30 days quickly then what you want to do is duplicate that campaign and do the two to ten x budget so you can duplicate it um i did mine at a thousand dollars a day i tested a thousand dollar a day efficiency and we passed and i was like okay great this is exactly when we need it so if we go back i'm actually going to go back inside the ads manager and show you all this so what i did was right here is i created this particular campaign one thousand dollars daily and you can't really see the results right here so let me go down into the ad set and you can see right here we did somewhere around like a 2.7 if i had to guess off the back for this particular campaign and it worked well it it proved to us that this is scalable and we knew this offer worked really well just from previous history and also testing new creatives so we knew this was going to work so we need to scale further so how can you further scale that well first thing is you want to keep continuing testing audiences so that way when these burn out you have more that are going in here which can be duplicated into higher campaigns so you want to keep testing audiences in the background while you're scaling your bigger campaigns but the next step and this is the third step right here is where you want to go ahead and take the ad set that's been working really well in your scaling number one campaign and you want to duplicate that ad set into its own cbo campaign so let's say if it's a purchase seven day audience purchase seven day lla lookalike audience you want to duplicate that ad set inside a cbo campaign and you want to duplicate that ad set four times so you have five total ad sets all targeting the same audience and with all proven creatives and then you want to set the budget to like a thousand dollars a day so that way you have a high budget again something that you're probably already doing right now so your campaign will look something like this we have five different ad sets in here with that were proven in prior campaigns so it's all it is is a completely broad open audience and it's been proven it worked really well for us so we just put it in here duplicated five times and we just kept scaling this particular campaign so i'm gonna look at the lifetime real quick we spent almost a hundred thousand dollars on this particular campaign or amongst these five ad sets we generated back two hundred and seventy nine thousand dollars and we literally did that in almost seven days so we pivoted pretty hard with this particular campaign right here and we start pushing it really hard once we found out these work we start off on the 26th with this particular campaign and at around probably like a thousand dollars a day scaled it up a little bit and then literally by friday we were spending fourteen thousand dollars in a day upwards to today where we spent around twelve thousand we've been hovering around ten to twelve thousand dollars just for this particular campaign and we still have multiple other ones that are currently running right now so that's what we did and what i recommend doing is just keep taking audiences that are working put them in a smaller cbo and the ones that are working really well these duplicating them into higher cbo's or single cbo's single ad set cbo's that are just duplicated a few times to where you have five ad sets in one cbo and just keep scaling it up again increase the budget by either doubling the budget if you're trying to scale really really really hard but if you're not trying to scale hard just do a 20 increase and the reason why i recommend trying both is because if you don't need to scale fast like you want to scale fast but you don't have to like for us for this particular ad account we had to scale extremely fast this is a limited offer it's very hot every year so we need to spend as much as we possibly could so we were in some time constraints if you don't need to scale fast don't really do it and the reason why is because when you scale fast you risk your risk of losing money is a lot higher but also to you running the risk of losing the optimization and stuff and when you lose optimization stuff your results start to drop really hard and it just becomes a mess so gradual 20 increases duplicate a cbo at a higher budget and if you do need to spend fast just start duplicating that budget every single day to where you literally start off at 100 a day 200 400 800 1600 3200 6400 i mean it goes very quickly over a few days so that's the second strategy right there so i really
