yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I want to discuss with you guys something new that I recommend every single one of you guys that's running Facebook ads maybe if you're a Shopify business owner and you have an ad account and stuff like that basically if you have a Facebook ads account and you're running and spending money on paid advertising or planning on to you need to make sure to do this and that is Facebook identification verification so basically what you do is you submit some documents to Facebook and allows you to verify your identity with Facebook prove you're a real person and also helps out with ad account shutdowns so before I show you how to do that in this video make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day similar to this one so let's get started guys so Facebook ID verification essentially what you're doing is you're telling Facebook and showing Facebook you're a real person it's very simple to do you just need a driver's license and you literally just need a mailing address that Facebook can send you a letter in the mail you type in some code and it proves that hey you're a real person at this address here's your license here's your your identity has been confirmed by Facebook that you're a real person now the reason why this is important is because when you're running and spending money on ad accounts and stuff we all have seen it before at 10 to 10 we have problems where if ad accounts get shut down randomly you know you you'll still like cross a boundary with Facebook in terms of like disrupting a rule and stuff but you have a higher chance of getting your advertising access restricted and maybe the ad account getting completely banned versus just a slap on the wrist saying this ad account isn't approved or this ad isn't approved now when you verify your identity with Facebook you're showing your real person and you're increasing your trust factor with Facebook showing them that you're a real person and all that so super simple to do it's something you're not really going to see any results from but maybe it's going to help you with a potential shutdown in the future and it's something I recommend doing when you're running Facebook ads in 2021 and something I recommend to start doing now so that way you do it today you get the letter in the mail about a week ago a week from now and you know you'll have less of a chance in the future of getting your ad account shut down so let's get started of how to actually do that so what you need to do is simply go to your Facebook go to your personal profile page and then up in the top corner right here you can see some stuff and you want to click on settings and privacy and then you want to click on settings now when you get to settings you should see something about identity confirmation and it'd be like confirm your identity to do things like run ads about social issues elections or politics now again we're not running any of those particular campaigns but we're still going to do it anyway to prove to Facebook that we're real we're a real person so you simply click view and when you click view it should ask you for something like your password something like that I just did it so didn't have to do it but you're going to get right here it'll be confirm your identity you might be asked to provide proof of your identity if you want to do things like run ads about social issues elections or politics this is to help us ensure Facebook is a safe place for our whole community so again just proving your real person proving to Facebook you know they can trust you you're not just some random person who you know has like fake identity running in a Facebook page and stuff spending a bunch of money and purchasing these ads and stuff you know it just again increasing that trust factor so but so if we click on this one right here running ads about social issues or politics you simply like said I just completed it and stuff like that so you know two-factor authorization super simple it just confirm your phone number someone logs in your Facebook they request your phone number first before they can access any of your stuff so super simple to do primary country location so this is where they're going to do like you know you give Facebook your mailing address and everything they're going to send you a letter in the mail literally just going to have a number on it you type it in so very easy to do and then your personal ID so your driver's license I think you need front and back you submit it to Facebook and they're going to verify your information so again easy to do this is literally just something that you can do really quick let's take five minutes to do and it'll help you out in the future you're going to increase in that trust factors and help you out in the future with you know ad account shutdowns and stuff I don't want you to watch this video and think you're gonna be unstoppable after like I'm never gonna get an ad account shut down again because that's far from the truth if you're clearly violating Facebook's terms of policy you're going to get shut down regardless but this is going to help out with getting a slap on the risk of an ad of disapproval and the machine just randomly shutting down your account thinking hey they're running some bad ad their ID isn't even confirms the person that's running it so maybe it's a hacker or something like that that's just spending a bunch of money spreading some false information out there so they're gonna herping quickly ban your account to prevent anything like that oh where verifying your identity they're like oh well this is Nick you know he's a good person he's trusted with us he's going through all the process we know it's a real person and stuff so let's just disapprove that ad make him get it re-approved and stuff so again you won't see a clear result clear tangible result to this like you know simple as simple as increasing your creative which gets you a better cpc and all that good stuff but it's something that it's just gonna be better prepared for you it's just something that's taking a safety precaution to ensure you have a great time with Facebook down the line because trust me you don't want to get on their bad end or it's a pain in the ass so quick just final words recommend do this get it done super simple get it set up you're gonna regret in the future again if you're an e-com
