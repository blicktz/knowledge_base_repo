What's up guys welcome back to the channel today we'll be talking about probably one of the most important things a marketer slash Facebook Ads person could do to be successful in their marketing career that is split testing it's probably something that a lot of people get lazy at a lot of people just don't feel like doing they love an ad and then they immediately just push punch money into it about split testing it and figuring out which one's more profitable not saying everyone doesn't do it but there's still a lot of people that do not do it and it can really massively change the results you're getting in your business show up my computer talk a little about it and how to do it and implement it in your plan right all right guys so we made it to a ww and if you don't know what that means that means you're about to laugh a lot while I attempt to draw on a virtual whiteboard so what is split testing split testing is probably one of the most important factors or something that you should be implementing as running Facebook Ads Google Ads any type of ads paid advertising this is something you need to be running so what is it well first off let me just show you what pretty much everyone is doing right now so you know they go to Facebook Ads you know they create their ad right here ad it'll literally just be you know your copy copy and then you'll have your creative and they'll create one version of it so it'll just be this one right here and they'll come there and they'll take this little ad and they're super happy with it they love it like oh my god it's the best ad ever and they'll start pushing traffic to it you know maybe five dollars a day ten dollars a day there we go so I start pushing traffic at it five dollars a day just one ad about three four days ago by they'll get maybe if low results and all of a sudden you know they're like oh my god it's not working so what would they do this is when people will normally increase the budget so you know they'll come there and increase it a little bit so maybe you know now they're at ten dollars a day and they'll run it for a little bit longer still get no results and the leader do two things increase or they'll come there and just call it a day and like quit so but let's go back for a second so they have this one ad right here they created and everything they're running traffic to it this is paid ads so you know Facebook ads Google ads and five dollars a day or something like that they'll run that for a few days they get little to no results so they increase it a little bit and they'll either increase them more or they'll quit and they'll say you know Facebook ads do not work that's attempt to do you know a big ol boom so that's kind of what happens that's like the cycle with like Facebook ads and stuff so what could you do to fix this so you see what paid advertising you're coming there and I mean you're taking literally an idea from your head putting it down and then you know you're kind of going off that but what if there was a way to test say nine different variations of this and you know different complete different variations would you think you would have a winner from there and that's kind of what split testing is is testing multiple different variations of let's see so you have multiple different variations of offers so maybe if it's like a 25% off coupon or you know maybe like a get a free quote like just something to where people can take action so that offer to take action you know what's the action then the next thing is to audience so whether you're retargeting website visitors whether you're doing you know say if you're trying to target entrepreneurs you can maybe target like one of them being small business owners that's an audience using Facebook's interest options maybe another ones like targeting people who follow Gary Vee Tai Lopez Greg Redone maybe another one could be there's literally an entrepreneur interest so you can target like a few different ones and you can see what audience converts better so you know you can create what I recommend three audiences so that's three different ads right there now the next thing you need to be testing is so you have your offer you have your audience the next thing you need to be testing now is a few just like the different variations the ads so you know with Facebook ads you can make a bunch of different stuff you can do you know video video photos and then you can do like carousel ads and then there is that's pretty much the main two or main three there's single video ads single photo ads and then there's also a lot of characters a lot and this is specifically for Facebook ads each platform is when I have its own native advertising that's gonna perform better than other platforms so just remember that but you know for this video we're just gonna stick to video and photo for the main part so and then now that's that's your creative right there as video and photo so trim of that any type of like image or video is your creative so let me just come to that creative so that's your creative and then the next thing is your copy so what your copy is is all your text and when the copy you can do two different variations that'll either be long or short so in a Facebook post that's all the text in the post besides the headline so they'll be like you know there's sometimes I'll be scrolling through Facebook I get a simple ad that just says by now some I get like a medium live you know that's something that takes a few seconds to read but no big deal and then there's some that I literally just I can scroll and it's like a whole book I'm sure you've gotten those before so and as advertisers you're like how the hell that converts but it does so if you're a really good storyteller that's where it comes at hand and the last one we got a test is your headlines so for instance like on a Facebook ad you have that one little headline area I'm just searching around on Facebook ad so your headline is right here sales and marketing success that's your headline right there so if y'all can see that a big text so you want to test these different variables because these are all ways to get to people so this is and what people don't do is they don't test this and I mean look how many variables right here so what I recommend doing how like how do I actually implement how do I personally actually implement this into my regimen well first off I don't really test the offer too much this is just my personal thing I might come there and test the offer I kind of test the offer when I do all of this so I'll first start off with like copy and stuff or actually after my offer I'll start off like the copy so I'll open up like Google Docs and I'll write like a few different variations of the copy you know do like a long one a short one and then kind of like a medium so that gives me like three different let's do medium so I'll come there and I'll start off with a copy first and then so let's see see if I can do like a little checklist for y'all so copy first that's key so what am I trying to promote now that's actually after after I already have my offer figured out so make sure you have that ready to go so copy and I do three different variations and I did all in like Google Docs and then I come there and I either two things I either have all my creative my video my photos ready to go just by like pulling on from the Facebook page or two I'll come there and have to go like design something if it's like an econ product I want to do like one of those cool like plain white backgrounds throw some t-shirts on it three I'll go and use like Facebook has free stock photos that you can use in the ads manager and now they did that too so that's where I get my creatives from and I'll do six different variations of the creative I don't do too much like testing whether video or photo works and I know that's something as a marketer I need to work on better but um I generally do like so I have three different variations of the copy and I'll plug a I'll plug two different photos with each variation because you can do six different sub ads in in the business manager so I'll do like a long copy with a photo in a video a medium copy with a photo in a video and a short copy with a photo in a video or either all photos and just different variations of the photos so that's kind of where I go for the creative right there and so that leaves six different creatives so now we have basically six different variations of ads and then three will be your audience down and this is kind of backwards but you know I kind of do the planning before I actually go into ads manager so I kind of already kind of look at like what that creative someone to use already have my copy down and then I'll start actually building that I'll pick up my audiences and I mean you should have your audience research done already but you can I do three different audiences so what I do is I build up like the ad set and stuff so I'll go ahead and I'll do like the ad set load my creatives or my six ads and then I'll come there and I'll duplicate this times two so I have two more ad sets off three ads that's total running and I'll duplicate that by two and I'll change the I'll alter audience so like I said if I wanted to target entrepreneurs or business people you know and I'll do three different audiences so one may be targeting literally entrepreneurs just using the Facebook broad interest another one targeting small business owners another one targeting maybe like the audiences of big influencers in entrepreneurship Gary Vee Grant Cardone Tai Lopez now this is all can be completely debatable so that's just three to pop them in my head so that leaves me so if we go back over now we'll have how our Facebook audience will look like or our Facebook business manager will look like we'll come there we'll have one campaign so we'll have one campaign overall so whether this is a PPE a conversion campaign a lead generation campaign or or whatnot so about one campaign do whatever you want if you're trying to get post engagements if you're trying to get leads and stuff you know do whatever you need you don't the trick Facebook so you have one campaign and then you'll have three let's see better way to do this so you have one campaign and then you'll have one one two three ad sets and these will all be running at five dollars a day ten dollars a day you know scale which whatever one works best again they all have the key is they each have a different demographic audience you're targeting so that way you can you know figure out your audience so and then each on their campaign you know you'll have one two three four five six you know I have six different ads like with creative different creative different copy this where you testing your creative copy you know headlines so you should have let's see what is that that's you know basically six times three you know that's about 18 18 different ways you're testing I mean obviously each ad sets not the same creatives or same ads within it so but you're basically tech testing you know the 18 different ways to reach people you know so you might have let's say you might have a creative in one set that really appeals to this audience and then a different ad set might have a creative that pills better so but now the question is what do you do now so what I recommend is probably testing this for about you know 48 to 72 hours if you have a high ticket product high ticket service you know you might need to do about a week you know one week and I mean of course with your budget too if you can't afford running 15 a day on ad set on ad sets then you know I totally understand that so but before to 48 72 hours or about a week I'd recommend testing and then what you do is you basically you know you kill kill the two ad sets that are poorly performing and you know what you need in terms of you know how do you know which ones to kill well you just want to kill everything that's not performing or you want to kill the two ad sets that are doing good so kill I don't know why I put kill let me just put shut down so two ad sets you want to shut down the two ad sets that are perform performing bad again I don't know what your goals is if it's PPE and you have one ad set with a creative in it that's just blowing up then kill everything else just leave that one running if you're running purchase campaign and trying to get purchases and one ad sets getting you a bunch of purchases and the other two aren't then kill the other two like there's no you know oh well what about this one you know just plain and simple so you shut down those two ad sets now one thing else let's say if you have an ad set with not a lot of conversions but a stupid low conversion rate or stupid low like in price that's something else to look at but you basically want to shut down those two ad sets and then you want to shut down the five out of six sub ads so you have one winning one win ad set and that ad set will have six sub ads and you want to shut down because obviously there's me a winner out of that ad set there's going to be a winner so you want to shut down the other five that are losers that makes sense so what you have at the end you have one camp one ad set then one one create or one sub ad so that's kind of how it works and then what you can do from here uh you know if you want to further your split test and continue to see if you can get better results um now what you could do is you could test the you know headlines headlines um now you also know what copy works so you can maybe uh alter the copy a little bit and basically what you would do is um just duplicate that ad set and you'll come there and make all your changes in that new ad sex you don't want to touch this winning you know you don't want to touch no touch so you don't want to touch your winning ad set so you just duplicate it and then alter the that same creative in another ad set um to make your changes and stuff or to make further split tests so and that's just going to decrease costs even more uh you might find a ways i mean you know you might have a winning you know ad set that's getting you know 30 cpas um cost cracks costs per acquisition customer and then you might duplicate it change up the creative a little bit change headline and get 50 just because you changed up the headline so many different ways to split test but hopefully this wasn't too confusing pretty easy um but again so create your one campaign you know or create your uh your copy and you create it first get all that planned out first just open up i like using google docs um and i literally just type up all my copy and stuff in there i'll kind of do some research on what you know what kind of headlines or what kind of pictures get to people you know um then i'll come there and start loading that up i'll kind of do like my first one of my ad sets always kind of a little bland kind of broad and then i'll go ahead and duplicate those two ad sets i'm already filled up with the you know six different variations of the creative the copy and headlines um sub ads basically and i'll come there duplicate those two audiences and further uh branch down on those audience go a little bit more specific or a little bit more broader you know just depends on what i'm trying to go for um so that we have three different ads that's running each with six different ads in it all under one campaign and that's kind of how basically you split test so um also with this winner right here uh once you find your winner this is when you can start to scale um and start throwing more money at it so it's also another big thing but guys thank you all for watching hopefully this helped to y'all i'm definitely trying to get better with this you know whole whiteboard drawing and everything like that uh really appreciate y'all watching y'all have a good day
