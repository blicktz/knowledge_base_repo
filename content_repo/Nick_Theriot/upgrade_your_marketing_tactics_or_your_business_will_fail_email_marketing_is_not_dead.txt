Welcome back to the channel today I want to talk about email marketing specifically how most local businesses are failing to utilize it within their marketing plan I see a lot more you know bigger businesses people who kind of like go worldwide or countrywide big e-commerce source and stuff they utilize it and do amazing with it but a lot of local businesses still struggle to implement it in their current marketing plan they struggle to build up the list of emails and I come on to show you guys real quick the potential of email marketing and how it could be huge for your business so just jump into my computer alright guys so we made it to my computer and have some amazing news for you I'm trying to attempt to this whole drawing board thing online so it's probably gonna be really funny and you're probably gonna see me like you know for instance this this is marketing so you know good luck trying to understand some of mine writing one here so you get to be kind of watching me struggle and speak at the same time but it's a it's good it's good for you because you get to kind of laugh at me and you know clearly understand no big deal but let's jump right into it we talk a little bit about a little bit about email marketing kind of break down a few little topics or a few little ideas that I just want to represent to you so first off the biggest thing with email marketing people felt understand is you know email marketing once you pay so wait we come there we have a list about 795 people this is for the detailing business I run on the side of this and less about 795 people the cool thing about email marketing those 795 people is yes we paid to get them on that list but we own that basically the traffic now that list of people and we can send them you know almost daily or daily emails or you know every hour emails if we wanted to and it's no extra cost for us from the time that we acquired them so once we paid up three four dollars it took us to get that email on that list we own that list of people and we can market to it over and over and it will not cost us a thing besides the software fee every month which is like 45 dollars so that's what's amazing about email marketing and that list is going to stay there forever until someone unsubscribes so you know I might get someone that might get on the list January 1st and won't buy anything till like October towards the end of the year and you know it cost me really anything you know they basically made that money up of how much it cost me to acquire them so but um that's just what's cool thing about email marketing so what I see a lot of local businesses doing is you know they they don't really do too much email marketing they don't really focus on it enough and you know they saw that old mindset of hey you know we just we operate off referrals or you know we run a Facebook ad here and there um or you know we might just put up a special post on social media or something like that which is great but you know you're missing out a huge opportunity in your business so um instead of having to pay for your ads here and there if i could change my color real quick um you know imagine what happens when you know economy kind of goes to bad you do a bad month and you don't really have the money to spend on ads so you just gotta kind of cross that out because you don't have that money so you make some social media posts that's it but imagine having a list of people that you could email when you want when things get bad and you can send out daily emails reaching about a few hundred people a day of people that are higher um they they already kind of have a little bit more trust with you because yes they're struggling your email list they've been opening up your emails you know maybe daily if you email your list daily they built up a little bit more trust with you um they don't mind buying from you so you have a higher conversion rate oh look look at that so which is great and that's what we want golly done this that's conversion um so they have a little more trust with you and you'll get you a higher conversion rate versus say making a social media post or facebook post or instagram post which i think you still should be doing but this just adds you know if you don't have the money for paid ads you can make facebook posts and email marketing posts um and it kind of just gives you a whole nother i i guess route to go when you know things get bad or you know you're trying to boost business up it's just another form of marketing so how do we i guess acquire how do you acquire emails so basically what we do is we take like facebook ads um social media posts let's see social media posts and we send traffic or we use that traffic to to send it to a landing page for some type of offer and this offer may be a coupon um coupon a some type of like free quotes a you know like a special that they could get by opting in so something um and exchange for their email so they give us their email and then we give them that offer coupon quote special so um and once they go on their list probably only maybe a quarter you know actually even take advantage of this right there so that's no not too bad for us right there so we're not really losing too much money uh from that but at the same time we're building a new relationship which is key and you know it allows you to build these relationships which in terms provide you with a long you know customer a long-term relationship with this customer doesn't consistently buy from you and you know maybe it costs you know five dollars to get them on that list but the customer might be worth you know maybe a hundred dollars two hundred dollars even a thousand dollars you know to you which doesn't be different for every business so for instance let's say if you have a restaurant you know you run a coupon code for like 25 off your i don't know either maybe a entree or uh maybe buy one get two like special for like a drink or something like that you run that people opt in that you collect the emails and then every day you know you can maybe send out an email with your you know lunch special or your dinner special or that special of the day which in turns is going to get people to open it up they're gonna go you know and maybe a quarter of them will even go in and actually check out what you got or go buy from you so but uh i kind of want to break it kind of down a little bit further um and talking about the probability of email marketing um and how like you know you can start off with acquiring a customer maybe three four dollars and then go all the way up so let's say for instance you sell a thousand dollar product um yeah thousand dollar product and you have a list of maybe i don't know i need and you have a list of about a thousand people so you sell a thousand dollar product you have a list about thousand people so let's see a thousand dollar product it's also going to be a service you know product service because i know i have people in the service industry that follows my videos um so you sell a thousand dollar product or service and let me actually scratch this out because it's not really too much what we're talking about let's just talk about the numbers because it's really emails all the numbers game so um and you have a list about a thousand people just to make the numbers easier so that's what you have and so you basically you email this list daily and if you email the list daily you know you're probably gonna have i guess some you know pretty industry average um conversion rates conversion rates and what is that what's industry average uh you know pretty much 33 percent um people open so about a third open and click and maybe like 10 that looks yeah um um and 10 will probably buy from you so about 33 of people will open the email and then the 33 of those people will click it and then probably 10 people actually buy whatever you're selling so um where we go from here so you come there and you send out an email to those you know thousand people let's switch my pen color so you send out an email to that thousand people um and then you know 33 percent open it which gives you about 333 people open up that email now we get my calculator out here because i'm not perfect um 333 people open it and 33 of those people click the email so let's just run that up to 110 or 109 so be conservative for people so 33 33 people open up that email um which is 110 people so follow me put some cool stuff so open 333 people um and then you know maybe 110 people click 333 people click told you guys this would be a comedy show of my handwriting but um so about 110 people actually click whatever offer you are selling and then this is where cool thing comes so out of 110 people um you know maybe 110 times let's say 10 percent of people buy whatever your promoting which comes out to what was that that's uh 11 people 11 people buy see it's all about the numbers game and you know you're gonna this is not guaranteed results right here um this is just kind of average of what i see which is about 33 percent open rate 33 click rate 10 percent buy you might be in a you know super heavy brand with amazing brand awareness people absolutely love you you you might be an amazing email copywriter and you might get a 50 percent open rate on all your emails get up you know near 75 click through and maybe a offer something amazing and 50 people buy this is just kind of kind of conservative um you know 10 is kind of higher on buying but you know even let's just say if one person bought so but anyway um so again back to pulling everything together so we have 11 people that buy and we come there and promote a thousand dollar product which equals 11 000 dollars there you go that's your sales i'm just puts i was gonna put profit sales from one email so again you're trying to sell a thousand dollar products on service now again you you might have a few things already you know you might have already kind of put them down a you know nurture sequence getting them kind of aware of the product or service so it's not like a complete random thing you know they're already aware of what you're going to sell them um you send it out to about a thousand people so a thousand people uh 33 of those people open the email which is about 333 people out of those 333 um 110 of them actually view what you're promoting and you have a really good offer for the product or service and 10 of those people buy which is 11 people and those 11 people buy that thousand dollar product that's 11 000 right there from one email so that's what's really cool and the cool thing is um that 11 000 let's say i don't know let's just say you're you know you're getting leads at uh let's say five dollars five dollars is kind of like an average in the industry five dollars a lead that's a five in case you didn't know five so let's say you're getting leads at five dollars um that list you know took about five thousand dollars to build up um so even if you know even if you didn't make your five thousand dollars back initially from that list you know just as one email right here would have made that all back but you can also remarket to these people over and over so let's say this listed eleven thousand dollars one month and then what about these other you know people who didn't open that email maybe use a different subject line and another let's say a different 333 people open and you you can make this money back over and over i mean technically this list is where you know if everyone if this is a perfect world and everyone bought from this list if a thousand people bought a thousand dollar product um you would have a lot of money but it's not a perfect world so but you know you can send this email you know multiple emails out a day and you might make a you know that eleven thousand dollars you know off of this product and then you might promote other products and stuff and you know you're going to continue making sales over and over and over and the cool thing about it like i said it's free traffic so you can send out a daily email and you know if literally you had a super amazing list and you're promoting a new thousand dollar product every day i mean you can make literally eleven thousand dollars a day so but again saying in a perfect world this is just estimates and kind of like going over industry averages so of what i see and stuff like that in the marketing world but um that's just one huge key of having an email list and again you know if you build up like let's say a thousand dollar people thousand people over a year constantly promoting it to them and everything um you know this is not like a five thousand dollars on once so you might spend like maybe five hundred dollars a month and facebook ads or something like that to get these people on this list you might do blog posts all kinds of other stuff too to get them on that list um and then over time you know you might make this amount back um but again it's a huge help and especially if you're like a local business and stuff like that um it's amazing we do a lot of offers for the detailing business that you know run on the side and do the marketing for and it's a tremendous help so this kind of breaks everything now with email marketing if you're not doing it already in your business highly recommend to do it i'll drop links below i'm also going to do another video kind of like what to do for daily emails which really not that hard i just entertain your audience
