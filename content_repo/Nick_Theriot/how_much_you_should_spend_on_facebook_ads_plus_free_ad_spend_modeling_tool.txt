yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i'll be covering a free new tool that i'm giving you guys as a gift uh just a little q4 gift for you guys i was also going to release this in elegant ecom but as now that i'm not releasing that course i'm like said i'm giving you guys a lot of free content a lot of free value so i hope this new tool helps you guys out it's gonna be an ad spend modeling tool but nothing like you've seen before we've seen different roas calculators before pretty simple pretty easy and stuff like that but this is something that uh takes a lot more into account and specifically tailored to ecom businesses so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and apologize for the look today look it's really early in the morning i typically film later during the day but we're working with over 15 or close to 15 brands this black friday of running a team six seven people and we are hands down right now for black friday and i just barely had a little bit of time to film so putting together this video for you guys so make sure you hit that double like button for that right there let's get started guys okay so this is the free tool i'll be giving you guys and you can simply just click the link in the description it'll open it up like this and make sure you go to file make a copy um i believe that's what it is make a copy and you know save it to your drive um do not you know ask for permissions or anything like that because it doesn't do anything uh file make a copy and save it to your drive very easy and once you get it uh becomes you know it's a lot going on right here but it becomes pretty easy once you uh kind of watch this video to understand how to actually use the tool so a big problem with econ businesses they focus purely just on roas and they don't focus on volume um that's a huge issue across all the clients that we you know kind of scout before we bring them on um when we audit their business everything like i want a 5x roas whoa i'm like okay cool and then they're like but i want to say like 33 grand a month or you know i want i want a 5x roas and then also do three four hundred thousand dollars a muffin that's unrealistic sometimes so sometimes you actually have to show them uh what what a modeling tool of exactly what that might look like in different various ways so with that being said this tool right here takes account your roas your ad spend and stuff but it also takes in account your gross margins it takes in account your cogs and shipping and handling which is big right there so a lot of brain a lot of these calculators they don't take in account your cogs and your shipping and handling so that is really big right there day one profit your aov your cpa but the cool thing about those tools that you can actually edit your aov to get various different like essentially like revenue numbers as well in here uh then another one that's huge that never see ever is your 12 month ltv how much is a customer worth to over a period of 12 months so a lot of calculators they just show roas ad spend revenue and some of them may even show aov and cpa if you get good about that but one that we never see is ltv and the reason why we focus so much on ltv is because as an e-com brain grows you know you need to be able to accept the lower roas on the front end maybe a 1.82x on the front end but you're spending three four hundred grand a month on facebook ads and then your ltv is so high you make up those additional profits throughout the year so let's take a look at this tool and start playing around uh first things first is the yellow cells or edible edible that's i don't think that's right editable um that's your input cells right here so you go ahead and just input whatever numbers you want so let's just say for example scenario number two and again you can you can do a few different scenarios as well uh to whether to just kind of look at a few different numbers maybe what which like your target one your break-even one like what does it look like at a break-even return on ad spend so let's say your break-even roas is 1.7 1.48 let's do 1 1 divided by 70 1.42 boom okay cool let's say you do a hundred thousand dollars in ad spend boom your gross margin is 70 okay uh day one profit so actually you lost a little bit money say our aovs around 80 bucks okay so obviously you lost running up front right there uh but let's just keep working it so you hit your break-even or us on your ad spend and then what is your 12 month ltv so let's say for example you're breaking even on an offer up front your aov was 80 bucks but let's say customers come back and purchase from you two to three times again after purely from your email marketing your sms and stuff like that and let's just say yeah let's say two to three times let's just say two and a half times uh realistically you can't do that but let's just be you know kind of conservatives on that end right there so um that'd be about 200 and oh yeah 200 bucks two and a half times of 80 and then all of a sudden your profit completely changes so you can see right here your profit is much different and that's because all these customers these 1775 customers required come back and purchase over that year spend about 200 bucks with you so you have your 80 bucks right there so they spend about 120 bucks which you 120 times 1775 that's 213 000 so that's perfect that's right on the money cool so that's what it looks like at break-even return on ad spend and i highly recommend you look at what it looks like at break-even or us where it looks like as your target or us and what it looks like at maybe the raw as you're getting now so it's big right there um and if you want to know your 12 month customer ltv i do have a video on the channel for lifetime value and how to calculate that as that's really important to understand for scenarios like this because you might be breaking even up front but then all of a sudden you see that you do over 12 month period about 248 thousand dollars in profit for that particular um for a lot of those so you actually are still profitable in the 12 month term you're just not profitable right now but let's just say hey you know you can't come in you start improving things you're eating a three extra or let's just say a two and a half extra or you're spending 100 grand a month let's just say more or less let's say 25 000 per month uh gross margin 70 percent um aov is i don't know let's just say it's 45 dollars very very small you can see right there your day one profits 18 750 dollars um that is including excluding shipping and handling so like this is already taken out shipping and handling and ad spend to get your day one profit right there so that's not um you know just ad spend minus your revenue or just cogs and shipping handling that's ad spend and cogs to be get you this day one profit right here you can see right here you have an aov 45 again you can change this so let's say if we add in a booster aov booster that completely changes right there let's drop that now let's say for example your ltv let's just say it's 60 bucks uh your 12 month ltv so you see right there you'll still profit some more on that end so that 62 000 right there in revenue is actually gonna look at about 83 000 over the course of 12 months and that profit margin obviously be a little bit higher right there that's really important to understand of what these look like these different scenarios and let's just say let's just do one that's more crazy uh so forex let's say you do a forex for us at 60 i don't know let's just say even at 200 grand spent boom your gross margin is let's just say 50 something a little bit lower aov 100 12 month customer ltv is around 180 bucks so again this is something looking at a little bit bigger numbers and stuff of what that may look like uh with profit margins and everything like that um and you have to understand this 12 month customer revenue with this ltv this ltv does take account at first order so let's just go say you spend another you spend 100 bucks with the brand at first order then this ltv is only the other 80 bucks they spend if that makes sense i don't know if that's makes sense or not but it's basically this ltv does include that first order um so this profit margin it's not like you're going to make another 720 000 profit on top of this it's just going to be um you're going to make a little bit more um your total customer profit for that month or for that year is going to include this this and also or actually no it's going to include this and this uh this profit is not based off ads as well taking account i believe so anyway this is a really great tool for you to kind of look at your numbers in different scenarios and also to play with it play with different aovs so again i really hope y'all enjoy this tool right here uh it's definitely something that can help you guys out with modeling different things and again understanding that sometimes it's okay to accept the lower row as a front if you have your ltv dialed in again that's only if you have your ltv dialed in for newer brands that we work with we recommend a higher row as just because they don't have that dialed in and need to stay as profitable as possible well guys i really hope y'all enjoyed
