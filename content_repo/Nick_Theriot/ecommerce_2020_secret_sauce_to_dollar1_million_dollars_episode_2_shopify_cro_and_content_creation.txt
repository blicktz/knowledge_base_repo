one can be watched by clicking the link right here where we discuss all the development stages of product research branding copywriting persona breakdown all the nitty-gritty stuff marketing and psychology and today we'll be discussing foundation actually developing a solid foundation of content creation your website and email marketing that's going to be the backbone of your brand and before we get started make sure you hit that subscribe button notification bell so that way you can be reminded for the episode number three that's coming up in just a few days and also for all the hard work I've been putting into this series hope you guys enjoy let's get started content creation so there's three pieces of content you need to get really good at and that's lifestyle content so this is just your product being used in real life world so you're gonna you're gonna find you know figure out where your product should be used at so again new mothers 21 24 they're using this product at home maybe it's some type of product that makes it easier for them to travel with their baby so maybe it's like some type of like diaper bag or something like that that works really good so you want to portray all the different sceneries that they're gonna be at so they're going to the store this product makes it so much easier you know this product makes it easier for when you're going to the store and your newborns in the basket and it helps protect your baby from you know people doing job child trafficking and I know it's going super crazy right now alarm will sound when you when they someone else beside you touches your kid at Walmart so you're gonna do a lot of like videos and stuff like that at that location those locations that your product is made for you got to figure that out and then that's where you want to create that lifestyle content so I'll make this also as the example right here gym wear brand if I owned the gym wear brand I wouldn't be sitting there and doing a whole bunch of content especially if I'm going for like a bodybuilding niche I won't be doing a whole bunch of content at a track you know where people do like cross country and stuff like that I wouldn't be doing that I'd be doing constant in a gym with people lifting weights and I'll have all the models wearing my clothing I do really cool photos and videos of this Gymshark does this extremely well now there's flat lay content flat like content something I've been like in the mix about but flat like content actually works super well if your bottom of funnel and middle funnel audiences when like they're super super like interested in your brand then there's less lifestyle constant and more just like close-up detailed shots of the product clean white backgrounds black background just a clean background different you know could be various colors and stuff like that and you just have really good detailed shots of your products now there's user-generated content this is the one that's absolutely amazing we see some incredibly high returns on this type of content for Facebook ads and this is essentially just you know people customers grabbing their phone hey I just want to tell you real quick about how amazing this product is or maybe if you're a clothing brand them taking selfies in a mirror and like hey I just got my new Gymshark in absolutely amazing that type of user-generated content works amazing and the the way of where it's like just them doing on their phone and being very amateur is what works extremely well not this high production with this nice camera lighting and all this it's the amateurness that works so well because the ideal audience can relate to that because they're just like that person and they're saying to themselves hey I'm just like that person then they're more inclined to purchase and then again you want to show off the products through these three pieces of content and you want to post it daily try to stay away from memes and stuff focus on your product focus on how your product helps others the benefits the pains of it people wearing it people loving it you focus on all that you post daily you're going to do well now let's dig into a little more about the content creation actually going into the models that are wearing your content are using your content so models play an extremely big role representing your brand for example if you own a gym wear brand you want content of very fit people modeling your product on social media imagine if Gymshark used everyone on Gymshark was overweight or I'm just thinking of Gymshark but any fitness brand imagine every single one was overweight and seriously unhealthy and they're promoting it as you know amazing new tank top and like a very unfit person you're gonna have this image in your mind of uh said gym wear brand for very unfit people and they're not even trying to focus on getting them better it's just like like they think there's nothing wrong with that and you know not trying to go that's a whole nother world so um just imagine that it wouldn't it wouldn't catch the attention that you're looking for so people who are in a place they're trying to go so like for example if I'm trying to go here and I'm right here I want to I want to show off every person that's right here already so that way my ideal audience is like oh my god I just want to be like that person I want to get over here I want to be like that person over here so people who are right here establish authority with people right here and that's what draws them in because they're like whatever I want that those people representing it those people are where I'm at right now I want to be like those people I'm gonna buy that shirt there you go that's as simple as it so when you're doing models and stuff like that you want to make sure that they are in a place um obviously this will be kind of different based off certain brands like if I'm just showing off uh you know a coffee cup it doesn't really you know nothing but specifically clothing is a big one uh clothing you know if I'm showing off a new born brand for new mothers I want to do pregnant woman um you know modeling the products and stuff because if not it's just like oh it's no big deal so that's a big key right there now again this rules do not apply for UGC UGC is a separate thing this is people loving your products whereas models is where you're portraying the product to people okay so now we're going to dive into the website portion which is absolutely huge too many people miss out on this and I've seen some pretty bad websites uh from these lower brands like with music playing as soon as I land on the website some crazy colors uh website very complicated I'm just like what are you doing okay you're not Louis Vuitton you do not need a complicated website to sell your $20 t-shirt like I get on their website it's just like uh no menu bar no nothing it's just like access the new collection like very and then like it takes me five minutes to figure out how to access new collection it's like $20 t-shirt with like absolutely no way I'm gonna purchase that because um I don't know just complicated whatever anyway website so you want the website simple and clean easy to access is the key here if you do you want a fourth grader you go get a fourth grader and allow them to view website okay no that might be illegal but um make sure if your grandma can't order from the website it's too complicated okay simple and clean you want to focus on three colors two primary colors one secondary color your secondary colors where you're gonna do all your buttons for your add to cart check out now um that works super well and make sure it's like a bright secondary color or like your third color and uh yeah you want to make sure your products are illustrated with high quality detailed shots make sure you compress the images into a low size format so that way you don't really affect your um like uh what do you say affect your loading speed for your website because that plays a huge role you want to have like a home page about us page shipping page privacy policy connective us just a few like trust of thars uh trustworthy pages that people are used to seeing people see a page you're not used to seeing them might be like what or like they don't have these uh people are like what what's going on um so your home page right here immediately establishes the vibe of your brand so make sure whatever uh you're trying to portray with your brand hey we help new new mothers make sure you establish that on your home page um you know kind of like the overall of who and what is your brand okay new boy you know we help new mothers um by providing amazing products to help them out with security of their baby when they're shopping you know like kind of establish that on your front page um as you kind of scroll down you can see maybe some social proof of like other people wearing the products you can also establish a little bit of authority with some big influencers uh some reviews maybe some awesome things we've done uh like some accomplishments some achievements uh things like that um all that cool stuff that's going to help establish that like wow this is a really freaking cool brand that's what the home page is for it's kind of like your introduction to your brand um and then you want to start splitting up your products into different collections um don't just do like all one all product page unless you have like two products um still maybe kind of split things up but you want to split these things up in different collections specifically for like t-shirts uh and clothing just in general um because it's it just makes it more naturally easy to find stuff and if it's hard to find stuff it's hard to navigate then i'm like whoa now again there's hard to navigate and too granular so you got to find that middle right there between wow you know i go through five different tabs just to get two women's you know necklaces uh whereas you know i cannot find women's necklace at all so you gotta try to find that median point so for the product page you want about five to six images of your product you want like two main pictures like overview the product maybe a front and back like for clothing um and then like three or four detailed shots so close-ups of different specifics then i also like to add in about two lifestyle shots of that product so just two people out and about with that product and um yeah just kind of establish what it's like in real life now the description i see some pretty crazy stuff for this uh you want three to four short sentences that describe the product and how it helps the consumer then you want about four to five bullet points talking about the benefits of the product so this is um benefits so too many people focus on the specifics uh think about the mp3 player versus the ipod the ipod was a thousand songs in your pocket whereas mp3 player was eight gigabyte ssd get it so one of them is just a specific another one is taking that specific and turning it into a benefit for the consumer so a thousand songs in your pocket so try to have about four to five bullet points talking about the benefits of the product uh for clothing go into the description how soft does it feel does it smell like a a mountain it's made in the middle of the mountains and when you pull it out it smells like a ocean i don't know ocean uh a lake in the mountain like i don't know just come up with like some really cool stuff that describes the product and like some benefits you know of the product itself uh then you want to answer any questions the consumer might have so you'll get these when you talk to your social circle um you'll get these from like social media comments and stuff find the common ones and answer that on the page itself because if people or have all the information in front of them that's more likely to generate a sale because they have all the information in front of them to make that purchase make that decision now shipping this is something that i wish everyone would do right now literally just say hey product ships in five to seven business days or product arrives in five to seven business days super simple don't you don't have to put oh it's five to seven business days blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah just i want to know how long you guys shipping is i'm used to shopping on amazon and seeing hey it arrives by august or october 23rd it's 21st today so october 23rd um i'm used to that so now i want to go on the website and shop it's like oh add to cart but now also have to go to the shipping page how long does it take to ship and stuff like that i can't i can't wait to get to check out but why do i want to wait to check out and do all that to find out it takes ships you know ships too long answer that shipping in the description just one quick sentence how long it takes to ship um and then do a guarantee so the guarantee is to remove all the risk from the buyer so hey 30 days you know a 30-day guarantee is pretty common um if from the time you get it if you don't like this t-shirt you can ship it back and we'll pay you 50 of your order back that's how confident we are in your product our product so make an amazing guarantee that you can fulfill so be careful um but also too that removes as much risk from your your buyer so that way they can purchase more confidently you want some reviews um i highly recommend uh we'll get into this app in a second where it's like add all three to the cart and save uh so i have like an app to show you guys where it's just like add all three to the product uh cart and you can save so um and then recommend that products you won't have all this on the product page um so we'll go into conversion rate optimization now as we get into it because this is another huge one um you want to install an email capture plugin opti monk is my favorite app uh just something simple as hey you get 10 off this order just enter your email below you enter your email in and boom you get a discount code it's applied to that order something simple as that you only want to have it on the product pages though i cannot stand this when i get on a website a specifically a website i've never been to before and i get to the website and i'm on the home page and it's just like get 10 of yourself your first order i'm like whoa i do not know anything about you i have no clue what your brand is etc and you're already trying to push like give me your email like i mean i don't even know what you are i don't even know what you do i don't even know what you sell so put it towards just on the product pages and you're gonna capture a much better audience because you're on the product pages specifically if you go after a time the one like five to 30 seconds before it pops up you might get fewer emails but you get more targeted emails because these are people who are actually viewing that product and interested in the products you have versus just i don't care i've never been to your website i don't know what you sell but i'll answer my email so just be cautious about that so you want to capture those emails my favorite one get percentage off your order if you enter your email in um now the banner the shopify banner that's that thing way on the top um you simply the easiest one to i recommend is if you're promoting a sale obviously do a sale but do a free shipping over x amount reason why is because more people will be cautious about hey if i spend over 100 bucks get free shipping and you can also add this into description of your product pages if you do this but what this is going to do is it's going to increase your average order value you increase your average order value you'll make more money you'll increase profits and you'll spend less on advertising so simple as that um same thing unlimited bundles and discounts app this is that's literally what the app is called in shopify um but this is the like the prop that they know like out allows you to put on your like website it says add all three to the cart and save just kind of like amazon does and this works absolutely amazing because you can bundle products together increase increase average order value spend less on advertising make more money etc so what you do is you want to put um two other products together that complement the product not just here you want one baby stroller here let's add two more no you want to add three i don't three carton you want to add two products baby stroller here's a diaper bag here's five baby bottles so they all complement each other so think about that clothing here's a shirt here's that necklace here's the pant get the full look here's the shirt that you're already looking at here's the pants that go great with it here's the shoes that go great with it and you add all three to the cart it'll usually be 150 bucks but you'll get get for 120 also you spend over 100 bucks so now you get free shipping as well wow that's awesome and also so you want to make sure your site speed you literally just use the google site speed tool make sure it's 1.5 for three seconds to load anything above three seconds it's horrible for paid traffic um and then shipping at checkout so like when it says like choose your shipping shipping it'll say like priority mail 30 bucks free free or standard shipping free but there's no time of how long it takes for those days so repeat it again priority mail three to four three to four day priority mail so you want to make sure you have those listed you
