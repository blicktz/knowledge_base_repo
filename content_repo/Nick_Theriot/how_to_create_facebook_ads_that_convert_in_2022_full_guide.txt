We all know what actually drives performance in the ad account is the creatives in the ads inside of your ad account.

So today I'm happy to share with you guys a quick five-step guide that's going to help you create Facebook ads that convert. Before we get started again my name is Nick Theriault if you're new to the channel and I run a Facebook ads agency specifically an e-com growth agency where we partner with brands and I have nothing to sell you guys unless that you take a lot of value from this video you scale and grow your brands at least 50k to 100k a month in revenue and you would like to work with us as a client for our agency. So with that being said make sure the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday and let's dive into this video.

So how to create Facebook ads that convert and why is it so important to have ads that convert? This is a brand that you know roughly we came in and we took their brand from roughly $38,000 in sales over the course of like things like a month almost two months right here that they were running ads before us and then we came in and on board and literally a year exactly we were able to help them do 1.2 million in sales within that year period of time so and we did this with literally no retargeting campaigns no interest or look like campaigns and no complicated ad account structures literally everything we did was focused on three to ten new ads every single week with the focus of finding new ads that are going to increase overall revenue for the business and improving our offer that is it and you can find the exact ad account structure we ran by watching this video how to run dynamic creative ads on Facebook 2022. I've literally a video or step you step by step of how I run my ad account structure because again ad account structure literally is plays only 10 percent of the part your offer and your creative is going to play 90 percent of the success of your business.

So with that being said number one okay so number one is you want to identify three competitors okay three competitors so let's say for example if you're selling a little hair removal laser hair removal set um then you know you can identify your three competitors so I just you know for example this video we're going to dive into rose skin co so identified rose skin co as one then I'll go identify two as well and again if you're selling shoes nike under armor you want to focus on the big you know big people just because you're at like 10 000 in revenue doesn't mean your competitor needs to also be in 10 000 revenue all right as soon as you enter the shoe market every big brand that's selling shoes is your it's directly correlated to your market competition so the first thing is identify three competitors okay now number two is ad library audit and I also highly recommend you guys to actually literally recreate this slideshow um exactly how it is so identify three competitors put your three competitors down now number two ad library audit so what you want to do now is you want to actually go to the ad the library um for each of your competitors and look I'm not going to show you guys how to do that in this video because I quite frankly I think that's just common sense now but I'll actually go look at the facebook ad library for your competitors it's very easy just go to facebookadslibrary.com and then search up your competitor find their facebook page boom and you can see all their ads are running so once you actually get to their facebook ad library you want to identify three of the most common ad types inside of the ad account so for this one they had some lifestyle photography slash like product close-up photography right here number two ugc a lot of ugc and then number three professional video done so three common ad types of the ad accounts okay now again i would really literally recreate this whole slide um you know competitor one whatever your competitor is or three most common ad types of ad account and then boom you know copy a few screenshots now next thing what you want to do is you want to go over to the next slide um competitor number one and then put the name of one of their ad types so i just put ugc because that's one of the ad types for this one okay and you're going to do this for all three of the ad types in their ad account okay and you want to fill out all of this okay so first off what are the creative types of that ugc so like ugc there's there's a lot of different creative types of ugc okay there's like a compilation where a lot of people are talking there's an unboxing style type of video there's um like a green screen effect there's just storytelling there's a lot of different types of ugc ugc isn't just one direct hey do this and this there's a lot of different variants of ugc so you want to list all of the creative types of that main concept in the account okay so the main concept is ugc or the main type is ugc where all the different types of concepts you know um so you can actually say that's creative concepts of main main creative there we go to clarify that for you guys um so i just put one for the sake of this video but you want to put all of them okay all right next thing is hooks what are the different types of hooks used amongst those ugc videos so oh my god this thing actually works that was one for you know rose skin co right there um and again you're going to identify all of the different types of hooks they use and hook against the first three seconds whatever they're using to grab your attention okay next thing what are the specific benefits are they talking about this product okay so for this one was permanent hair removal that can be used on any body part that's the benefit of this particular product next thing what are the specific pain points they're talking about um hairy bikini line razor bumps um these are all very key to good to understand so now you can understand what's working for them okay and features is there any specific features you know of this product slash unique selling points um this one was you know skin cooling technology in that aspect right there next thing um oh i completely missed it uh objections so this is another big one right here is there any objections that they address and as soon as i see this product i'm thinking oh wow this this must hurt because it's like a laser zap in your skin okay and it literally hits that objection of it's completely painless okay perfect now next one is character attributes okay this is a huge one so many people miss this all right they're like i want to do ugc and they get some random you know it might be a guy who's you know quote unquote attracted to girls who look a certain way and all this ugc content looks that way and it's like no okay when you're picking your ugc creators you need to look at it from the perspective of who is my ideal audience going to you know resonate with and for this particular ugc content it was a variety of females 25 to 35 years old with a variety of different ethnicities as well okay so that's a big one right there so now we know we can have a few different ethnicities of girls who are between 25 and 35 years old and we can also kind of dig dig a little deeper into the look of the girl you know is she's someone that looks like she goes run 10 miles every day is she looks like more like a mom does you know you you can go a little bit more into the attributes of that specific person as well because that's super super huge right there okay next one is scenery so what is the scenery in the ad this is huge as well so many people miss this um so all of the ads there's a lot of bedroom shots of girls in the bedroom um bedroom and actually even more specific bedroom on top of bed using product boom all right um product in action those like close-up shots girls in robes a lot of the girls were in robes for the video um intros start with a girl using product close-up shot on leg seen a few like that so what are all the different sceneries intro scenery like just the visual scenery you see inside of the ads that's super important right there and lastly is there any slang slash buzzwords that would only resonate with your ideal customer okay so like for example bikini season ready that does not appeal to me or resonate with me as a 25 year old male okay um now for a girl going into the summertime who's about to wear bikini all week or all summer then that's going to appeal more to her and it's going to be a very specific slang word that should be using in that aspect right there okay slang and buzzwords are freaking huge when it comes down for for improving like performance and resonation stuff like that to creative so now we have a really good understanding of the type of people we need our ads type of environments we need to utilize the type of pain points benefits and stuff like that we need to talk about and then we also know what type of like slang and stuff like that we need to use in our ads okay so now again you want to do this for all the ugc types or all the types of ads so i would do another slide like this for lifestyle photography and i'll do another slide like this for professional video okay then i would do this whole process again for the other two competitors okay so you have roughly nine different slides in that aspect right there or 12 because it's four slides per competitor you have 12 slides and again i want you to just really replicate this and i'll be like your brand kind of just like inspiration that aspect right there okay next thing plan out so next thing is really important is to actually start to plan out the ad concepts that you want to start taking action on okay so i like to use a little google sheet right here it's nothing fancy literally at all i just batch number it's just a number i give each ad concept so that we can have a number by it so that way we want to take action on it's easy to understand which one's which status done working on it that's it um add concepts a quick little headline or kind of like initial like a name for the concept and then description of what that concept is um and then just like a link to like any inspiration or anything like that we can utilize to help visually storytell that idea okay so very very simple google sheet there's no reason i need to give this to you guys it's so simple to create takes you two minutes inside of google sheets okay and you want to start planning out all the different types of ad concepts you want to film okay so you could start off with different types of hooks you can start with different types of videos videos and hooks from your research um if you go through you know three ad concepts or three ad types for three competitors that's nine different creative types you'll see probably like three different you know sub concepts all those types you have like 27 different ideas right there okay and list them all in the sheet as concepts and then give a little description of each one of which you want to create very simple um so now you understand what an ad looks like you know what you need to create you planning everything out now now the next thing is to actually start creating each concept okay so the way we do it at my agency is that our copywriter will go ahead and pick out a plan concept so let's say for example we want to take action on that particular concept cool copyright or grab it and she'll write all the body copy plus the headline for that specific ad and then she'll actually go ahead and script out a video so it's a ugc video with the girls talking about this and this and this then she'll script out that video and it will send that out to creators if we need to or if we have the footage okay cool we'll figure out what we need to do to basically actually get there to articulate that um as well as there's like any you know copy that goes on the creative so if we have like some little pop-ups of headlines and things like that on the video itself then she'll go ahead and plan that out as well too inside up there then my visual creator will take all that information and actually edit that into the final ad and the way we do it with our structure of how we test things um and i i'm giving this to you we'll do one body copy one body copy one headline and then we'll do three videos or three photos per concept okay we don't do photos and videos per concept we do three videos or three photos so say if we want to do a ugc compilation with the hook of i can't believe this works and then i'll do three different videos with that ugc compilation all the same hook just kind of differently changing up the some key parts of visually okay our three photos from a life lifestyle photography so we'll do like this particular headline stay smooth with three different types of lifestyle photography okay very easy to you know leverage and again i do talk about that in my um dynamic ads where we'll go to next okay so once we actually got those concepts created and everything like that the next part is to launch the ads itself and i have a full video on that how to run dynamic creative ads on facebook 2022 tutorial where i literally go directly in the ad account and show you exactly how we set up everything um for like the broad campaign cbo dynamics and how it kind of works in that favor right there um so i have a full video on that but basically what we do is we start launching things and then we just start crossing off the list of what works and what doesn't you should be able to pull up 20 different 27 different ad creative types if you do this correctly our ad concepts 27 and you just start testing every week tests you know two or three a week okay cool if you have a bigger budget maybe five or six a week okay just depends on your budget you know typically like an account that's spending a thousand a day i can test three to six a week if you're spending 100 to 300 a day you know maybe two or three a week um if you have a bigger budget like we have an account that spends 15k a day and we can test anywhere from six to ten a week so it just depends on the account size so yeah guys hope you all enjoyed this video how to create facebook ads that convert in 2022 and i really hope this helps you guys again this is more just how to establish the the standard for when you're creating ads then after you start building off of this then what you can do is you can start pulling your own ideas from based off which you start finding things that work you can start ideating creating your own stuff um first the first goal with creating ads for a facebook account that convert is just replicating what works
