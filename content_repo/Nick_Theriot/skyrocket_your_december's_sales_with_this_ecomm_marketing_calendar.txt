yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and excuse this god awful like this sun is just beaming in i don't have anything to block the window right now but yeah welcome back to the channel i have a pretty cool video for you guys i'm not really gonna know what to call this but i basically want to go over december with you guys and give you guys kind of like more of a roadmap of things that you need to be looking at uh for december 2021 so there's a lot of stuff going on in terms of the ad world and you need to be able to understand this if you want to improve performance um or facebook ads so that being said make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday friday let's dive into it guys by the way sorry for being inactive i've just been insanely crazy with black friday and just a lot of stuff going on in personal life and uh just didn't upload it all last week my apologies uh but we're back in action this video has been is recording now and i already got the other two videos for this week recorded and let me just say they are spicy guys they are packed with value so you do not want to miss those so make sure you stay tuned for wednesday and friday's upload that being said let's dive into this video okay so let's look at the simmer so this will be kind of like a marketing calendar perspective and just stuff you need to look out for in a simmer and certain things that you need to be doing so today's december 3rd um you're actually going to be watching this video in december 6th so just a little heads up on that right there but basically with the simmer there's a lot of stuff that's going on and you have to understand the natural waves and momentum of the market so that way you can really excel with your business so on the third um or realistically like more like on the first or the 30th of november is when you can start pushing your buy now and get it before christmas angle in terms of like hey buy this product now get it before christmas and there's two specific people you need to keep in mind there's the people that are going to self-give they're going to give something to themselves they deserve it it's been a long year you're a badass i saw a jewelry brand today it said you've been an angel all year long you deserve yourself a treat this christmas so like self-gift and then there's the gifting for others so maybe it's a dad maybe it's a mom maybe it's a husband maybe it's a wife maybe it's a friend maybe it's a brother or sister yada yada yada there's someone that this particular customer is going to purchase for and you want to make sure you're hitting on that as well the most perfect gift for dad this christmas the most perfect gift for mom this christmas um like those type of things right there so there's a bunch of different angles in that in that scenario you want to test and start pushing two recommendations take your best performing creatives apply this copy to it and then take your best performing um and then create some new best performing uh some new creatives with this new copy as well um that you find that works so really focus on that buy buy now and then also to establish a deadline for buy now and get it before christmas typically across the board for our brands is december 15th if they place an order on december 15th 99 of the time we can get it to them the day before christmas you have to understand the logistics of your brand to be able to make this count okay if you do not understand your logistics and you do not understand how long it takes the moment someone placed an order until the day they get it like that's just you're gonna have to figure that out okay simple as that to get about that two-week window up until about the 15th and then you're gonna start getting closer to that thursday and friday uh which is going to get closer to about that week before christmas and you'll see start performance drop significantly so expect bad performance between december 16th to december 23rd expect bad performance i can't say how other way to say it um but to drill into your head like that there's gonna be bad performance 16th to 23rd why well everyone who's spending money at the beginning of the month is buying for someone um or they're buying for themselves to get in before christmas they want their shit in before christmas okay so they're gonna spend all their money in the beginning of the month then as you get closer to christmas people are gonna not buy anything because what if their mom what if their boyfriend with their girlfriend with their brother with their sister what if one of them purchased that for them so they don't want to go buy it now because they feel guilty if they buy it and someone else buys it for them so now you have consumers in the market not spending money because they don't want to buy anything for themselves and they've already spent their money on their gifts so now you have a segmentation a week or so of bad performance and it's expected and it's okay all you can do is pull back on spin if you want and call it a day okay now going to friday that's christmas eve um which is 24th through 26 christmas eve christmas and then christmas like the day after christmas i think for some of you guys over uh i'm in the usa but like i think maybe in like australia they have the boxing day today after christmas um i could be wrong just letting you guys know about that this is a great time to do a christmas clearance sale get rid of as much stuff as possible that was maybe for christmas maybe stuff that you just couldn't move and wow this sun is just getting really bad now oh god okay i'm really sorry about this so run your christmas sale this is a great time to really scale hard in this period of time right there focus on existing customers focus on emails who haven't purchased from you focus on your engagement your website visitors all of everything kind of like your black friday almost don't expect the same levels black friday but get some you you get some good revenue from here essentially the way to look at it is a lot of people get cash for christmas and they're going to spend that cash on stuff they love so maybe they didn't get that nice rolex but they got enough cash to go buy their own i don't know what world that's going to happen but i'm sure it happens for some people at least that year um okay so then that goes really well 24th through 26th and then 27th through 29th is going to be dry again people are hung over they're usually a lot of people have to go back to work that monday and it's kind of like one of those things where they go back to work people are pulling back on spin they they spend enough money they just had this new year's i mean this this uh black friday the christmas everything like that they're going back to normal and they say pull back hard like expect bad performance again the 27th i would say the 27th through 30th expect bad performance okay then the 31st i'm not sure what the situation is don't look like but it's new year's eve and some people are do get off work that day um and new year's is like you can typically kick off your new year's offer between the 30th to 31st and run it through like a day or two after new year's now new year's offer um this really can be anything this can be another sale to get rid of old stuff um honestly people are tired of your sales you did one for christmas you did one beginning of the month you did one for black friday people are tired of your sales so it's a great opportunity to introduce new products right here but again just something a test um our advice is to go radically different um in terms of like if you release new products and new creatives and stuff like that do something really different it really screams 2022 i'm not saying you need to go blast 2022 on everything wow this sounds bad wow i'm not saying you need to blast 2022 on everything but you need to make it feel like it's a whole new like vibe essentially i love this i love this strategy going to new year because it just adds on to new year everything feels fresh and new and then these new creatives that look really cool and everything like that it just helps add to that as well as keep on a little bit of that um some of your existing best performing creative everything like that so um but yeah so this is kind of like just the game plan for december for december looks like in terms of like your december marketing calendar and um give you guys a little update on things of where performance will be bad or is your kind of your your like not necessarily routine but like where you're gonna see your momentum at so i i like if you're seeing good performance scale hard up until you can before you cut off and then expect bad performance you want to front load a lot of spin this month um and then you have your christmas where you're gonna spend a good bit and you have like your new year's offer you'll spend a little bit more towards the battle in the month um but yeah definitely expect some bad performance during like this time right here and 16th to the 23rd so well guys i really hope y'all enjoyed this video my apologies for the sun um but hopefully you guys enjoyed it either way i'm not again i'm not really sure i'm
