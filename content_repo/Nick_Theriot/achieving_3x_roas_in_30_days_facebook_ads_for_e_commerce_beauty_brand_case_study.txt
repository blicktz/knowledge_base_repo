what's up and welcome back to my channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I want to share with you guys a new client case study slash client win over here at the agency Theriault solutions we took a client who was tired of losing money every month on Facebook ads who has been about three thousand dollars per month and we taken their ad account and simply just consolidated the ad account restructured it and applied some new ad techniques to it and we've been able to take them to over three extra turn on ad spend before we hop into this video make sure you hit that subscribe button to support the channel as we deliver all this free amazing content to you let's jump into it so we've taken this ad account they'll spend about three thousand dollars per month losing money every single month on advertising to now doing a little over three extra turn on ad spend so before we hop into it I want to show you guys kind of the process we followed so over here at our agency Theriault solutions we follow a simple process called quadrant this is our powerful scaling strategy we follow in-house where we simply do four different stages you know a deep dive stage two is a strategic planning stage three is initial launch of your ads deploying ads and stuff and stage four scaling so we use this process right here with all the ad accounts and don't judge me yet on this website as we are rebuilding this whole thing we're putting together a nice professional website just to give you guys kind of quick little overview of how we built up this case study so the initial deep dive with this client and just for a little bit more like retrospect this particular client is in the beauty and supplements brand or beauty beauty products hair hair care niche they do sell hair care products average order value is a little over a hundred dollars with this particular brand maybe a little bit less run that run that particular number so the first thing we do like said is is our deep dive where we dive into the ad account we dive into their Shopify their Clavio we dive into all the metrics of their brand and stuff and we try to pinpoint the areas that need improvement now for this particular brand we focus primarily on the Facebook ads as that's all they really want it so we really dive into our ad account and we we like just initial look at it we recognized a few different things there's no structure to the ad account there's no naming conventions it was very high frequencies and a lot of different ads it just didn't make sense in terms like retargeting and bottom of funnel middle funnel and stuff like that there's no exclusions which lets a lot of audience overlap and auction overlap which again just raises your CPAs and stuff there's no system for scaling ads so when they did find a winner there was no system and improving that whatever whatnot there's a pixel installed on the website but the problem was it was not tracking purchase conversion value which basically led to where we couldn't track ROAS and how much ads are actually generating in terms of revenue so this is what the ad account looked like before we got into it as a full month October 1st to October 31st and obviously the prior month so this looked exactly the same anywhere from a hundred to three hundred dollar cost per acquisition before we got into that account and stuff like that this is a few of the campaigns that they ran at the time within that particular area so let's jump into it so that was our deep dive analysis and everything then strategic planning this is where we start to dive into like the actual strategy and how we sell this particular product so we did a little bit of market research uh amongst the competitors um we we looked at the consumers and stuff their ideal customer and everything like that um and really dive deep into how other brands and competitors are marketing to that consumer uh we looked at blogs um amazon reviews of other products to really get a good gauge of our consumer of who we are marketing to so once we got it from really good market research uh we laid out our uh funnel which we do a top of funnel middle funnel bottom of funnel pps which is past purchases so this is our funnel plantation and then we need to plan out content for each stage of the funnel so um this is like your ad angles your ad psychology um and even the creatives you'll be pushing into those stages so the creatives that we go on the top funnel middle funnel bottom funnel and pps so this is your uh your image your video um maybe even some carousels and some catalog ads and stuff like that now what we need to do is deploy the ads so once we got all the planning done strategic planning we also like i said we do a little bit of the um the copywriting and creatives all that right here now it's time to deploy ads so up until here strategic planning deep dive and stuff we spend no time in the ads manager besides like the deep dive where we just look inside that account uh we plan all of our creatives videos photos stuff like that um outside and then when we go into our deploy ad stage we go ahead and actually load in these creatives inside of the ads manager to copywriting the photos the videos all that stuff um so we put that together inside the ads manager and then what we do is we start to launch the initial testing ads um and we'll use a few like testing audiences to start off with where we're testing these creatives and testing these copies so um again strategic planning i didn't list it right here but we also build together um or list out all the audiences we want to test in terms of um you know inside the ads manager so uh we'll use like um interest explorer.io uh to list out some interest that would be really great for this brand um and then we also too is look at some of their metrics in terms of their purchases website views stuff like that so see what's up a look like audiences we can build out we try to shoot for at least 100 events of a particular action so if we know we're getting 100 events every day in terms of website website views or you know we'll do like a four or five day website visitor lookalike you know maybe every 30 days we get 100 website purchases we'll do you know like a 30 day purchase so like we'll do different variations of look like audiences and stuff um based off what's been working and amongst a lot of our ad accounts and stuff like that so uh then we do is we go ahead and put all that together we launch those interesting testing ads and for what we've been doing lately is for our first initial launch on an ad account that has really not much data of what's working what's not working is we like to launch a dynamic creative campaign so we'll do is we'll have like five to six ad sets inside those five to six ad sets we'll do abo for all of them so you know one campaign um each ad set about 40 to 100 per day and then what we'll do is we'll do a dynamic creative where you can load in multiple different photos and videos ad copy headlines to test a whole bunch of variables at once and that was a really good key for the for us on this particular ad account because we got to test a lot from the beginning at once uh so through this after letting it run for a few days we got to establish our leading kpis so our cost per acquisition that we're happy with roas uh ctr percentage cpc unique landing page view costs unique ads card costs unique initiate checkout costs so we get to establish all of our kpis and stuff of what we're comfortable with to scale at and then we started to cut off the losers and optimize the winners and put more budget into the winners so what did we get here out of all of this work uh we managed to from november 25th to january 4th now i am excluding all of our black friday campaigns because we actually did more way more than this um because we did run black friday but from november 25th to january 4th today 2021 um these are eight campaigns we had used to really scale up this ad account uh spent about seventy nine hundred dollars made back twenty three thousand dollars at a 2.98 return on ad spend um if you're you know calculating also the all the other purchases they get so obviously about 20 more purchases than this um just do from outsiders and facebook not tracking properly so we got a little over a three extra turn on adsmen for this particular ad account um and literally took them from you know literally 310 per purchase to 48 per purchase we have implemented a systemized process in terms of way we test new audiences test new creatives and scale up the winners so we have our three top of funnel campaigns um this one right here is our creative testing campaign audience testing campaign um and our scaling campaign right here where we you know we start off like a hundred dollars and they just kept scaling up you know a little bit each day uh it's been performing really well um one thing about this ad account is we're getting a lot of delayed attribution with this particular ad account so um people are not buying the first day so we'll see like one day zero purchases and then like two three days later also that day has like a four extra turn on ads been because people purchasing later on take a little bit more time to purchase so that's a big thing with this ad account right here um we have our middle funnel campaign just going after all of our engaged audiences with social media our bottom of funnel campaign retargeting people who visit a website but didn't purchase yet um and this sort of dynamic creative uh dynamic campaign we initially launched um again it's a top of funnel campaign just really pushed out testing a lot of different variables and you know keeping things fresh and then lastly is our pps campaign where our pps campaign um again just past purchases getting repeat buyers so and then lastly is just scaling ads um our process for scaling ads is if kpis are being hit we scale budgets so if we're hitting our kpis that we're looking for key performance indicators um we're scaling up budgets and another thing too is we're testing more creatives so one thing a lot of people become complacent once they start to see results in their ad account and they stop doing things and then what happens is results deteriorate over time and it's because people are not testing enough creatives or new creatives and new audiences so that way we can freshen up the ad account so that's a big thing with this ad accounts we kept or continuing to test new things so that way we continue to scale up the ad accounts and again this is still pretty fresh um so we are we do have more creatives in the background that we're about to push out so um yeah this is a pretty crazy account uh pretty fun account to work with not gonna lie um especially with this haircare line it's with a pretty large very very very large influencer um and for them to struggle months and months and months with advertising and you know barely seeing a return to just within their first a little over 30 days working with this um able to you know completely shift their ad accounts um you know reducing their cost per purchase um and helping them out with everything so and it's been making a pretty large impact with this brand um and also to the space we're in we do see a pretty high uh cost per click and stuff like that so um it's pretty unique a very very very competitive um market we're in with haircare um beauty products are the same way beauty products and haircare um just in general i mean very very high cost per click um high cpms and all that um and that's that's not coming just from this one account but multiple other people i've talked to before we took on this account to really make sure we went in with the right proper strategy and everything and uh that was a big common like thing between everyone else who's run ads in this niche so um i hope you guys
