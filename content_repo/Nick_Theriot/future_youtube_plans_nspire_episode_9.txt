I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's good YouTube? Welcome back to the channel Currently about to get up a leg day real quick Have a pretty busy day planned Check this out, low weigh in 155 pounds On the dot We started off last Tuesday at 156.6 or .4 Something like that Dropped a pound And that's cool Because I'm trying to take this slow Because at 145 is my goal So we're only 10 pounds of weight And we're doing this for 12 weeks total We have 10 and a half weeks to go So if I keep dropping about a pound To 2 pounds a week Or a pound to a pound and a half a week I'll be set for this whole cut Good morning Phoenix Let's go ahead and get him some light He loves this so much There we go dude I have to say Jump scots Are killer 10 was cool That second 10 Makes it feel like a cardio movement Just got off a nice cold shower Sipping on some greens And now we actually have to go Take care of some errands downtown So might as well bring you guys with me Forgot to give you guys a cold start And you know I'm just thinking real quick First off it's probably loud as hell Sorry But I ordered some chemicals Some chemical guys And they still have yet to ship it And it's really upsetting Yeah there we go Let's roll Just got home Ran a few errands Picked up a smoothie And now about to jump into a work session So also check this out While I was at the shop I decided to grab my old vlog camera It's a T3i Rebel With a Sigma 18-50mm lens But it has a 1.8 aperture So it's some really awesome bokeh You can put in it With the old Rode video mic So Nice little Mirabella Whatever you say it right there But yeah I do have a lot of work to get into Let's jump into that now Currently what I'm working on right now Is like a content calendar I've been putting this down On like sheets of paper and stuff But I wanted to like actually visually see it Of how it looks The type of content and stuff I'll be putting out And this is going over my two YouTube channels One being Nickterio Which you're watching this video on And also two my other one Terio Solutions Which has nothing on it yet But the whole goal with that channel Is to grow a very niche specific type of video So everything around marketing And marketing psychology Whereas Nickterio the whole focus of it overall Is allowing people to educate themselves Through our videos and stuff And learn from the videos To achieve overall life mastery Through what I do So that's kind of the goal of this channel as a whole And I came there and summed it up So like the Terio Solutions one You know we got stuff like Facebook ads tutorials Marketing psychology Case studies testimonials And then let's see Trying to focus on the last one Google AdWords tutorials So this is like a very niche specific Channel right here Of everything around marketing Marketing psychology And stuff I need to sell clients Now the overall life mastery With Nickterio this channel right here We have a bunch of different things Leadership, education, business, relationships Money, health, and spirituality Now there's a few things I need to remove from this And number one is probably education Because this channel If let's say if I do like a top five books I'll do a top five books around fitness Stuff like that Like I need to kind of pull back some of these topics So number one would be education Because I don't need to show you guys How to educate yourselves And if I do it will be very few specific videos Next one is spirituality That's just something I do not want to get to On this channel And that kind of It's a mixture between You know going after your purpose and stuff in life As well as you know what you believe in And stuff like that So there will be very few videos around that And then lastly is leadership As I just don't have really much to cover from that So now getting down to the four main key pieces I do want to talk about And that is business, relationships, money, and health As I believe if you can get these down You're pretty much set And money is completely directly correlated with health And my overall philosophy If you can master money Master your health And master relationships You are fine You are set for life So everything around this channel Is going to be on these four topics right here Let me pull that away And then now I can start planning content around this Boom And then I have everything separated now Now I don't like to plan too much content And I want to continue doing the daily vlogs So what I want to do is take a different Definitely a systematic approach to it I follow How2Beasts David with How2Beasts He has a really good system of the way he does it Telling the story Telling the How2 throughout this day While still daily vlogging And that's something I really like And something I want to bring to the table With the transparency and the documenting of the journey So I'm still working on how I'm going to put those two together But that's like the vision in my head right now Of what I want to do My fourth time recording this one clip right here But it's been a few hours now It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon And I am about to get some food in So I'm going to do 400 grams of jasmine rice Which is a lot But I got a lot I need to catch up on 400 grams of white rice Or jasmine rice And we'll do 6 ounces of grilled chicken And then later tonight I was going to do this now But I thought I was going to do it later tonight Just because I want to maximize the time I have right now And I'm going to do some avocado toast, oatmeal, and stuff like that You saw in yesterday's video So I'm going to go ahead and prepare this food And finally eat a good meal All I had earlier was a Plenty Nutrition Shake Which I tracked everything like that Still going good I'm actually going to hit my macros today perfectly Can you really? I get them all the time Really?
