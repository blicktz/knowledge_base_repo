five facebook ads that print money and how do i know they print money because these are the exact ads we've ran in client accounts today i'll be showing you some of our top five ads that we've ran in client accounts yes i'm gonna be actually showing you the ads some some you'll see some of the brands we run ads for and then also to you also gonna see spin receipts as well just to prove that hey like we actually run these and like how much they've spent and stuff like that so uh with that being said let's dive into number one so this is an ad that we recently created uh it's probably one of my favorite examples of a supplement ad that's fairly easy so first things first right here is that you're gonna see this big text this is the creative headline a lot of people ask me nick creative headline versus regular headline which one's more important is the creative headline all day because the creative headline itself is what's going to grab people's attention so big bold text easiest way to fight inflammation we're talking to a um kind of like a problem aware market that's looking to that's dealing with inflammation which is a problem right there and then the next thing is we're introducing uh the solution to that problem which is mushroom coffee i don't have the actual ad copy in this particular photo but you'll see in a second some other stuff and basically we're just calling out a few of the supplements that's in this particular mushroom coffee reishi turkey tail chaga specifically so and then here is the uh spin on this particular campaign or this particular ad itself we spent sixty thousand dollars over the lifetime of it i think it's been running only for like six months specifically uh we drove 40 or 1454 purchases cost per purchase is forty dollars the aov for this brand is like seventy dollars and then but it's the ltv that's extremely high for this brand so we're scaling at break even and making all of our money on retention in the second month third month and then on on as the clients stick with us for years uh for this particular supplement brand so yeah great great example of like an image ad this is actually the only image ad i'm gonna show you guys today but big bold headline two or three features from benefits and that's it very simple and also eye-catching visuals now next i'm gonna show you guys is a facebook ad for a clothing brand uh that we spent over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on and i'm actually just gonna pull it up right here um here's the actual ad itself uh again 159 000 so actually pretty much the time i'm making this video is probably spent like 175 000 now um but i'm actually gonna pull this up still on twitter sorry post all these on twitter by the way so like if you want to see more ads it's consistently from me check out my twitter so let's check out this ad really quick uh so this is an ad from one of our clients called icon amsterdam i'm sure you guys have seen them before um long-term client of ours been with them for over two years now um absolutely amazing client and this is one of our like kind of our ads that we run for a specific account um full note we didn't create this ad um their content creator created this ad uh so just want to make sure you know i'm not taking credit that i created this ad specifically but um just a great example of an ad for a clothing brand right here there's so many key things that we have to look at here number one the fast uh paste has been working really well for clothing because there's really nothing we need to communicate here there's no like features and benefits we need to communicate um we're more of a fashion brand we're not really like a feature focused brand with like revolutionary new stuff like the pants fit amazing and that's all we need to showcase and that's about it and the rest of it is just you know the the lifestyle so a couple things here you can notice like the saint lawrence uh the kind of professional background and stuff like it looks like a professional studio uh you see the guys wearing like a rolex or something like that um he takes care for himself as well you know he's not like overweight and you know he looks fairly good for a guy um so yeah so good good person we're portraying we're portraying that kind of like luxurious lifestyle a little bit without saying luxury or anything like that and then also too we're showcasing the product we're showcasing a variety of products as well so that way it also shows that we have a variety of colors so that way people don't come for just one color they know that we have a variety of colors um so we're gonna help satisfy a little bit more people's needs and stuff like that um yeah so very straightforward it also you know all the the visuals and everything it just it makes these pants look luxurious um you're getting a lot of value for the quality of it and um yeah really solid ad something like that we've ran for a while now we've seen a lot of really good success uh with this ad and um definitely something i recommend uh testing out now next one is this is an ad that uh we spent a little over 100k in less than six months um it's actually helped to scale the brand now from 5k a day to 30k a day and this was basically a very challenging ad to create why because after we did an ad account audit for this account um we tested like probably close to like 60 different creatives for this account and just could not find the right thing for this account we knew that this particular account had a lot of creative testing done before us so we had to really dig deep here this is one of those like hey nick i've tried everything i've done everything correctly like you and i just can't get anything to work um now granted this account was already doing really good when we came on board they just want to take it to the next level so we had to really dig deep to find totally new ways to position this product in the marketplace that's what we had to do and that allowed us to spend about 97k uh over six months to be honest it's actually like 97k over like two months um in terms of like you know just the time we've been running this ad and i'm gonna show you guys this ad right now and i'm gonna show you how we position this product in a completely new market so let's see let me actually open this up so this is my girlies who need a girl's night soon so we're basically creating like calling out specific group of people and then we're calling out like hey here's something fun you should try which is kind of like uh you know unaware market and we're introducing something that's like a solution specifically for them uh from here and yeah we're just portraying the product instead of just saying here's our product you should buy it i'm portraying and creating a problem for people um and solving it with our product here's here's something for our girlies uh calling out specific group of people and then i'm basically just saying like you know for girls who need a girl night soon here's something that's really fun you should try that's new that we think you'll enjoy right there and yeah and it's been a solid ad for us and it was a great example of just shifting away from the hey like you know the typical hey here's our product here's the features and benefits to now how do we position this in a starving marketplace which that's always my favorite positioning in a starving marketplace because now we can actually grow cells faster because we don't have a lot of competition we found a starving market and we're helping this starving market now next one is an insurance ad uh for one of our clients uh we spent a couple million dollars a year for and this ad is basically selling insurance uh specific type of insurance you'll see in a second and there this is like just such a challenging ad to create and i'm just gonna dive straight into it so i can really break this down for you guys um this ad has been very successful for us like i said we spent over four hundred thousand dollars over uh nine months now let's see i don't want you guys so first off just spin receipt a hundred four hundred and forty four thousand dollars we spent on this ad and i'm gonna show you guys pretty much the whole thing so this was the copy we created uh the headline and then the uh the thumb stopper so like this is the most important part of the ad right here and then like the copy copy it just up here in the headline right here that's like 20 this is responsible for 80 of the stop so you need to put a lot of emphasis on that and i don't do thumbnails i just take the uh the screenshot of the first three seconds of an ad and i use that as the thumbnail so and we're actually going to go through this ad and turn off mini nick right there all right so this is the actual ad right here now key thing here is that we were advertising this product now for about 12 months before we created this ad and we needed to open up an unaware market and unaware markets the largest market you can open and it's also one of the hardest markets to open you still need to hit the same kpis as any of the other markets but we really need to hit that unaware market so we can increase the amount of people we can reach so we can continue spending so number one thing we did was call out our target audience so first thing you have to do in an unaware market is call out your target audience call out um the group of people that we're targeting and then little known secret about medicare so we're enticing people we're calling people out who are on medicare but we're also enticing people to keep watching second thing your hook needs to entice people to keep watching that's also like something super important right there now what we're doing is we're starting to introduce the problem i slowly introduce this so little known secret about medicare that could cost you thousands i'm keeping people in the hook of why they need to keep watching and why they need to pay attention here when you call an ambulance your emergency ambulance bill could be deemed not medically necessary now i'm talking to a problem aware market i'm making them problem aware aware of the problem which is that they could have an ambulance bill denied that could cost them a lot of money and i'm visually showcasing how much money is well that is costing them so that way they can really understand it's very something very bad here leaving you owing thousands again just completely twisting that knife really important now this is something really powerful here because you wouldn't know this unless you're actually running this account we had a lot of people that basically said well my health insurance will cover it blah blah blah so on all of our ads which is false because there's about a 50 chance that your health insurance will not cover this so really powerful sales tactic is going ahead and calling out an objection addressing an objection before it becomes an objection so i'm calling out the are you sure your insurance will cover it before we even introduce the product so they don't even know what the product is yet but we're calling in handling an objection out before it becomes an objection are you sure your insurance will cover it they all thought they would so i'm basically showcasing how like hey all these people thought that their insurance were gonna cover it too and i'm further just twisting that knife and handling an objection now that i got people hooked in i got people really diving and watching this ad and i've overcame their objections now they're primed to be able to uh for us to introduce uh basically the the solution and that's our insurance product basically like ambulance insurance so i'm gonna call it for here um introduce it uh this is a unique way i don't always do it like this but it's a unique way over two million members trust them to protect them i just want to really call the fact that hey we've been in business for a long time uh we're ethical and uh you know we all do the right things um now because this is an unaware market and because it's a stage one sophistication that basically means they haven't seen a lot of products like this before so i need to really educate them on how the product works so here i'm basically just simple method of how it works and very easy way for them to understand very articulated cool so now that i've gotten from unaware problem aware so now they're solution aware they understand how the product works now so now that i'm a product aware now i'm just simply increasing the social proof right here now it's a great time to introduce like yeah some testimonials of other people getting their desire solved so and you can't really hear it but just people saying like how you know this particular product helped them a lot yada yada yada yeah that's it and then at the end here is a call to action um a little bit more other social proof right there and then call to action very simple um but yeah really really amazing ad like i said we spent over about four hundred thousand dollars on this ad um and just from a psychological perspective we put everything into making that ad as perfect as possible now this one right here this is probably this is the last creative we're gonna go over number five right here um this ad right here took us less than a minute to film and it's done over two hundred thousand dollars in ad spin uh for us and actually the amount of sales it's probably made this because this is two hundred thousand dollars of ad spin based off what i could find under this ad name um but we also have two ad accounts and this is just one of the two ad accounts that this has crushed in so i would probably say it's probably spent close to 500k and done a little over two million dollars in sales but just because of this video i'm just going to claim what i what i can see here and i just want to showcase this to you guys um but yeah so let's break down this video and a lot of you guys who follow the channel religiously probably have already seen this video it's the simplest ad we've ever ran and it absolutely crushes so 15 seconds that's how long this video is this particular girl who filmed this video literally just set her camera up filmed this 15 second segment sent this to us over a text message i uploaded straight to the ad account and it spent 200 grand that's it there's a lot going on here though so let's pay attention here so first off i know you guys won't be able to hear it and there's no captions on it but all she's basically saying is here's our product here's how you can customize it that's it so nothing special in terms of the wording but just being very simple this product does not need to be over thought it's a very simple straightforward product second thing here is look at the contrast between the product itself and the background the product really stands out it's it's it's very easy to see it's not overpowering because we tried this exact thing with different backgrounds and like this background just performed amazing next thing is that the people that are watching this ad are dominantly 50 plus conservative southern women that's who's like our dominant purchase like buyer for this particular brand not the only people purchasing but our dominant buyer and blonde girl she got a country accent she looks like she could be her their daughter and you know woman's gonna stop like oh my god look how cute she is blah blah what she's selling yeah that that type of like that type of uh you know attention grabbing right there next thing is look at the background it's very southern you know the bricks and everything like that makes you almost feel like you're on like a ranch for example it's not like country like we tried this exact ad but like in miami filmed on like a boardwalk did not do well at all but this top ad right here did way better so the environment and the person in the ad all identifies with our customer and like makes the customer stop to listen next thing is that the ad copy itself you don't see it i just basically say when's the last time you surprised your sweetheart worked amazing and yeah this ad right here it's done like said a little over two hundred thousand dollars in ad spend obviously uh the spin receipts and all that like that like i said it's probably actually done way more just that's the only thing i could actually like uh find with that particular ad but yeah guys um that's five
