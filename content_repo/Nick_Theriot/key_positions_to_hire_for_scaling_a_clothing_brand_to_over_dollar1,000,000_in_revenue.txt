hey what's going on guys Nick terrio here today I wanted to bring a video for y'all on discussing everything that goes into scaling a clothing brands over 1 million dollars in revenue so over the last few months our agency has been blessed to be able to work with a very fast growing clothing brand and recently we crossed over 1 million dollars in advertising revenue with them so we've generated them over 1 million dollars in revenue at over 3x return so it's been very profitable for them since then we've been able to learn a lot of what goes into scaling a business over a million dollars in revenue specifically a clothing brand and not just what goes into the ads but the overall business to keep positions you need to hire out the systems and stuff you need to build out and I wanted to make this video to go over kind of everything not just the ads so the very first thing actually goes down to the type of clothing you have you need to make sure you have clothing that can sell that people want and that the culture and the branding you build around that product fits the culture of your ideal audience so when they take a look at your clothing they're like hey that fits me that fits my lifestyle I want that clothing if you try to sell clothing no one wants you have a very hard time to scale it you're gonna have very high acquisition costs and overall it just will not work out for you so starting off first things first you need to have a hot proven product that people want some of the styles and stuff people will wear and an overall concept of you know the key pieces you're gonna add to your collection going into this next thing I get a lot of questions on my youtube channel about this and that is doing drop shipping for clothing brands shipping plays a huge role when scaling a brand and if you can't offer a good shipping time it's going to decrease your conversion rate so if you're doing drop shipping for clothing start off maybe with your first two thousand dollars in sales and then immediately just get you a cheap warehouse space put together a cheap team and stuff like that and then start doing all the fulfillment yourself as you're gonna see a bigger return and bigger increase in conversion rates which is going to drive more profit into your business so shipping plays a huge role so you must be able to offer a good shipping time which all my clients offer five to seven day shipping time so something good whereas if you go up to hire three weeks four weeks it just it loses the desire for the product you know people with clothing they might want to wear that hot outfit next week to a birthday party to an outing to a dining and they can't do that if the shipping is very far in the future and also adding to the shipping is you need to make sure you have all the branding and the packaging when it arrives to them you know I recently did an unboxing video on this channel for vacay swimwear where they have like the nice brand that tags onto the product the brand you know packaging etc all that plays into the overall brand image so it actually helps increase the value of what they received in the mail especially if you're charging a higher ticket for the clothing adding all these little key touches helps get them like hey I got what I paid for posting consistent content on social media is a huge role for clothing brands in fact we actually do not work with any clothing brands that do not have a team in place or system in place to post consistent content as that is very huge for helping with social proof and keeping the brand relevant as well as keeping audiences engaged so to post consistent content you need a few key team members number one you need a model to actually pose with the clothing some people like the owners do it themselves they're the models some people have a team in place some people just go to their friends and family to pose with their clothing that's perfectly fine you will also need a photographer to capture it and even some clothing brands highly recommend getting a videographer too to capture video and stuff so we can do like promo videos for certain fits some people literally can just use their iPhone to capture everything like just an iPhone 11 this works really well for video and photos so you can literally just use that so you definitely need a team that can actually capture content then as well as you need a few other key people for the social media side you need a social media content creator as someone that can actually get the photos the videos edit it put them together put some engaging clothes together do the copywriting and stuff the little you know captions and stuff so that's the content curator that plays a huge role with posting content every single day then the next role you'll need is a customer service rep that can that can do social media management in terms of inboxes and comments we get hundreds of comments inboxes every day so luckily our clients have team members in place to answer those because we're not product specialists we simply just work the ads for the business but having a team in place to actually do the product and you know answer all the comments and DMS about the products and stuff will also increase sales as a lot of people are scared to purchase something and they need just that extra reassurance extra questions and having that team member in place to answer all those drastically helps with overall sales now the last key person you need for social media is a ads manager and I highly recommend you have an ads manager as one person a content curator as one person and then a customer service rep for social media as one person do not put one person all three of these roles because they just cannot handle everything and be great at it now going into the ad side that is what we do for clothing brands we work with clothing brands we help them scale their ads we you know we do all the ads optimization and stuff ad creation and then simply what we do is we commentide the brand we start spending their money profitably growing their brand overall and scaling them very aggressively and as we scale aggressively we need to make sure they have all these key positions in this video set aside because you know once we started scaling aggressively we can double your revenue every single month once we start pushing out ads and stuff as long as inventory allows we can really grow your brand now that we're on the topic of marketing another team member you need to hire is an email marketer email marketers are very critical with emailing your audiences between people who just opt in for free coupon code who hasn't purchased yet to people who already previous customers our brands that we work with they'll probably send out about three to four emails average a week and during hot times during holidays and stuff they'll probably up that to maybe seven to ten emails a week but updating on new product launches updating them just on what's going on with the brand as well as like follow-up sequences and stuff from people who haven't purchased yet abandoned cart recovery all of that stuff is where an email marketer will excel now going back to customer service another key team member to add to the team is someone to answer all of these site questions if you have like one of those little pop-ups in the bottom of corner where people can live chat with you on your site as well as all the emails you get on day-to-day basis regarding orders future orders problems etc as this will be a time-consuming task depending on the size of your brand the amount of questions and dms you get emails etc you may be able to hire one person to do all your customer service in terms of inbox emails site questions and social media dms and comments now the last person you need on your team and this will probably be the owner in most cases is a product manager and operations manager you could probably get by it's about 2.5 million dollars a year in revenue with your clothing brand before you may need to hire an additional person for this but this would be pretty much the person that overviews everything as well as pick out new products and stuff hot products work with the manufacturers factories etc that you're getting your supply in so this is a very key position and like I said usually this is kind of the owner especially around a million dollars in revenues usually you don't need to hire person for this yet but this will be a key person you need to hire later on down the line now I hope you guys enjoyed this video showing you the behind the scenes of everything it goes inside of a clothing brand when you're scaling it's over a million dollars in revenue this will give you an idea of some of the key positions you need to look out for and this will well carry you over to a few million dollars a year before you need to further expand your team if you enjoyed this video make sure you drop a
