Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys.

Today I want to talk about is Facebook ads dead? Is media buying dead? And what I personally believe media buying and Facebook ads is the lowest income steal that you could really strive to become good at.

And let me explain before I ruffle some feathers. Let me explain. So that being said guys, before we get the video started, hit that like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

And guys, let's jump into this video. So why I believe Facebook ads or media buying is currently dead and why if you're just trying to strive to become good at Facebook ads, that's a very low particular area to strive at. And like I said, before I ruffle some feathers, let me dive further into this topic.

I'm going to give you a little bit of experience, personal experience of how this mindset came in play. I'm also going to give you guys some examples and show a few things to you guys. So I know first things first is when I was first getting to Facebook ads, my very first client, you know, came on board.

My first e-commerce client specifically, they came on board and stuff. And one particular thing about this client was they already had some really good creative. They were giving me two to three times a week.

They were giving me copy, creative, everything. All I was needed for was to run the ad account. And that was it.

Now, let me get into this. So I would basically came in, I looked up a good ad account structure to follow on YouTube, literally took that structure, threw it into their ad account. And I mean, just blew up the RAM.

That's it. Simple. Like I thought I was God, essentially.

Like I literally just came into their brand. They had spent $22,000. I like a 0.8 ROAS.

Spent like $22,000, made back $16,000. I came in first week. We did three extra ROAS by me simply restructuring their ad accounts.

And all I did was restructure how they're running the ads. I didn't touch anything around creative copy, customer avatar, stuff like that. And came in, did an amazing job.

Scaled up their account, three extra ROAS. I think I charged them like $5,000. It's like a service fee to do all this for them.

And, you know, made it back their investment fee within the first week. And literally within like the first two months of us working together, we hit their first $100,000 with the business. Really awesome.

Loved it. Kept working together. I kept building up some amazing results for them.

So after that, I was like, I'm feeling pretty, you know, my ego is pretty fluffed up after this, you know, huge win for this client. I can do this over and over. And I took out some more clients, some, you know, other brands relative to like their type of brand as well.

So, you know, I can try to stay in the same niche. Failed three brands straight. Three brands did the same thing over and over.

Failed. I'm like, okay, there's gotta be something here that I'm not seeing. So what I did was I pulled a step back.

I realized, okay, those three brands, I had to do the marketing. I mean, I had to do the copy. I had to do the creative.

I had to guide them on all that particular area. And I've learned a few key things that was working the first brand. So I did get a little bit of a heads up, but I did have to do all that.

That's when I've realized something that you can have the most amazing media buying strategy. You can come on my YouTube channel and you can look at how I manage an ad account. And you will still not get the results that I'm getting.

If you are not replicating my creative approach, my marketing approach, my like psychology approach that I take with these accounts, these ad account strategies and stuff mean low. I realized there are very low. You're very low on the totem pole, the food chain.

And since essence of, you know, media buying, marketing, Facebook ads, e-commerce and stuff, just being a media buyer at heart is very low in the chain. If you want to be higher up on the food chain and have a position that, you know, is very hard to be replaced, is someone that can come up with fresh new creative ideas for campaigns that actually work, come up with new adding or concepts for copy and really do some strong customer research and understanding how your customers are using your product, coming up with new benefits and new angles around the product and guiding that and having that, you know, illustrated through your creative team and, you know, put together and stuff. And then taking that and putting it into your ad account.

The ad account concept is very simple. It's having a creative testing campaign of testing new ads, having some rules of how you test those ads, then have some rules for how you scale those ads. And that's it.

The actual media buying concept, I can put on paper, give it to my, you know, like one of my assistants and they can replicate that. They can literally look at the account and see that, Hey, our target ROAS has been hit for the last seven days. The paper states, if target ROAS has been hit over the last seven days, increase budget daily by 20%.

They can do that. It's very simple. If this, if then do this very simple formula, you can put inside of an ad account and give to people and that's it.

And they can replicate that. And that's what I did. I took that from the YouTube video.

I replicated on this brand, did amazing with it and thought, okay, that's it. Then I went and do it for a few more brands and failed miserably because I was not focusing on what matters. And that's the creative, the copy and, you know, the different angles you're showcasing around your product to, you know, get people to purchase.

So after understanding that concept and understanding that in my mind, I spent a lot of time investing in more becoming a good marketer, becoming a good, you know, person that understands marketing, creative copy. Now I don't write any model and add a copy. I use a, you know, a copywriter does all my copywriting, but in order for that copywriter to do a good job, I need to illustrate, be, be a very good communicator to that copywriter and in terms of what I want.

So if I just tell that copywriter, Hey, here's a product, go write me some copy. She or he does not know the angles to go after the benefits to really push the offer or anything like that. That's all something right there that you need to do.

And this particular position right here inside my agency is called the strategist, the person that, that can think of new creative angles, new copy angles and stuff, and then have people on the team that actually can execute on it. So for me, I know UGC works really well, user-generated content. So instead of me trying to DM a whole bunch of people, sending them products and, you know, commute and getting them to do that for me, that's a lot of time right there.

I put a creative director in place. So this person right here, my team, he goes and message those people, sends them products. And then we have like a simple plan.

Like, Hey, we know gift giving is a very strong angle for this particular product. We understand that it's mostly men that purchase it. We also understand that it's mostly men giving it to their wife and their wife being super surprised when they're opening that product and how it's an amazing product to them.

And you know, that's, that's the angle that works the best. So let's go replicate that across a hundred different people, keep more stuff fresh. I can also illustrate that to my copywriter and the copywriter can write that down and she can come up with multiple different pieces of copy to run that angle, but just different variations that we can test and understand how it works against our ideal audience.

So those key positions right there, that, that strategic position right there, if understanding creative angles, coming up with new angles to sell the product, coming up with new ways of how you positioning your product in the market, that right there is what drives all the performance. That's the 80% of our time. We focus on that or the 20% of our time is we focus on that to drive 80% of the efforts or 80%, 80% of the performance in the account.

So after I fell those few clients, I've shifted, I've invested a lot of time and money into my marketing mindset. And now an ad account is a very low activity for me. My high activity and the high profit actions I take is looking at these strategic standpoints with an account, with a business, and then I have the right people on the teams executing on these actions.

And I'm the person that foresees these people and guides these people based off these key things right here. So when you're running an ad account and you're not seeing performance, ask yourself what creative you need to use. What creatives have I tested?

What copy have I tested? What are the different angles that I can come up with that can sell this product? What are my competitors using to sell this particular product?

When you dive in these key things right here, this is going to drive the performance. This is going to get your results. This is the only thing different between one agency to another agency when they take over an ad account or from running your ad account to an agency taking on that account is these new concepts like this that they're bringing on board.
