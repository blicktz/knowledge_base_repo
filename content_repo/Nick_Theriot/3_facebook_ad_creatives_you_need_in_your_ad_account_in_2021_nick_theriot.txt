yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Sario it's today of an exciting new video for you guys today I want to showcase three ad creatives that I think every single one of you should have inside of your ad account it's been performing absolutely amazing for us inside of our ecommerce clients so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday just like this one let's get started guys so three ad creatives that I think every single ecommerce or just any advertiser should have right now inside of your ad accounts number one is a customer reaction video so you can actually reach out to maybe just a few local content creators to do this for you you can get your sister to do this your mom and your brother your friend your girlfriend your friend that's a girl your friend that's a guy you really get anyone to do this for you specifically but it performs extremely good so it's literally just taking your you know their phone they're holding it up like this hey what's going on you know blah blah blah blah etc talking you know to the camera and stuff but it's it's very natural and organic and they're just holding your product and just the the ad starts off like this oh my god guys I just got this amazing water bottle in I'm drinking water like no one has ever drank water before this is absolutely amazing and this type of ad this reaction style user-generated content ad has been performing absolutely amazing for us because it's very organic don't really apply any heavy editing and stuff it's very organic and it also builds up that social proof and that I gotta have this because I I see their energy and that energy is what is cap is really like you know fueling that buyer to really want to make that purchase so that energy is contagious and stuff works really well for brands and it's something that's been crushing inside of our ad account now a few key tips when the ad starts you have three seconds three seconds to grab someone's attention so make sure it starts off with the media with the reaction so when that first three seconds of the video starts off for that video ad make sure it starts off with something that's really high energy and eye-catching so wow this video this video is absolutely amazing so it starts off with that not just hey guys I just want to show you this really amazing product that's been just amazing like like you know the energy slow it's dead it's not yeah so make sure that is going on make sure you can clearly hear the person make sure that you can clearly see them the lighting's good the sounds good you know it's cropped properly it's not just up to their face we can like see their nose and just like hey guys let me show you this no you're gonna make sure all that is showcased properly to make this particular work really well so just a reaction to your product and these other two creatives are honestly they're gonna have some of these things composed in them but that's just the first one it's a really good reaction and also to make sure you have the product when they're reacting to it oh my god guys this water bottle is absolutely amazing now the next one that I think works super well is a unboxing video so again you can do this in two different ways you can have it as a user-generated content video where the user or like the customer will do it or again you can pay a content creator friend whatever you can even do one of this to yourself so two different ways to do it number one just like the reaction video taking that product taking that phone maybe propping it up so like let's just say this is the main camera and I'm unboxing this little package right here hey guys I just got this in the mail I'm super excited it's a new hydro water flask and let's unboxing it and like showing me unboxing this and like wow look how awesome this so again you know keeping that reaction element to it but unboxing and showing the product off in front of the camera some people do like an unboxing and setup and like the first use and all this happens within 30 seconds so keep it fast-paced keep it moving again sound quality good lighting but also to keep it very natural with like a phone film you know you don't need a high production setup like this you can literally do this with an iPhone so you have to have that borderline of good like using your environment good natural lighting good sound quality you know you don't want me doing this in a dark busy street trying to do this on the side of the road you know very hard but you know just in a room some good natural lighting very low quiet quiet something that can be achieved at home with no issues at all so that's that's a number two just a good unboxing video showing off the product but another way you can do this is actually taking the more higher-end approach maybe getting a tripod or something to hold up your phone like this where it's pointed down to the desk and then unbox the video like this so if you go to unbox therapy and look at their YouTube channel look at some of those unboxing videos he does where the cameras point it down to the desk so I guess two cameras he has this front facing camera then he has this one up here that's pointed down like that so you have this but then you also have this and then you do it unboxing on the desk that's also performed super well there's really no sound to it just maybe some music some fat you know rewind and fast forward and slow down for key moments of using that or unboxing a particular product and then some captions and stuff about what it is and like you know maybe setting up the product for the first time so this is the second one to think super well this one you can do like your mofu and bofu right here so your reaction video can kind of be in the beginning to like catch people's attention like whoa what's this new product what are people talking about what are people raving about I want that particular product and that one works super well for that now you have your unboxing video which is more mofu bofu retargeting content for people at different stage of awareness what's your business and your advertising structure now number three kind of the final one it's just your standard testimonial you but your video testimonial so again you know you had your reaction video this is where it can be very borderline reaction to testimony reaction just about wow look at this amazing new thing hyper energy this is so cool look at it look what it does here's the benefits here's my pain points it solves all that now testimonial same thing but it's a little bit more just like me and you're talking right here hey guys I just want to tell you all about this really amazing water bottle I've been struggling every day on a day-to-day basis to actually drink all my water you know I fill up a glass I kind of touch on a few hours a day it's just been really hard to get all my water in whereas this water bottle right here it has these really cool you know measurements of ounces and everything to it and it just helps me get all my water in for today now it feels so much better getting all my water felt healthier I'm losing weight pain points benefits results using the particular product and I think it just works really well you can grab yours but just simply click the link below and yeah so simple literally like that just a good testimonial where they were at what was the the tool they used to get to the results so again you want it you want to structure is where they talk about their pain points where they were at before the product then they meet this amazing product how cool it is how awesome it is they get this product it's amazing and they're talking about it how easy to use etc and then the results how has their life changed things this amazing product now again this one might be a little bit more natural energy just like me and you're talking it's not really a hype up reaction video it's not really an unboxing video it's more just holding product talking about how amazing it is and then here's the video of it so this again could be more bofu mofu they share a lot of standard characteristics of what type of content in each one but it gets more for people deeper into the buying process you could also test this at tofu if you just can't really find a creative at tofu to work a good testimonial leading with a good testimonial also goes a very far way so these three creatives are super easy to get you know have your clients if you're if you have a client or if you're an e-commerce business owner just grab on your products you can film a few of these yourself if you if you haven't put your name in front of the brand yet or your face to the brain yet you can do this real quick you can literally go take 30 minutes out your day go film these three four videos and we've seen some amazing results for example we've been able to take one of our clients who's been getting around a forty dollar cost per purchase and we literally just leveraged a few of these and we're now we're getting ten to fifteen dollar cost per purchase we've literally almost cut them down by a fourth by simply just leveraging the right type of content the more organic the more natural style content that still continues to perform absolutely amazing for brands online so these are three ad creators that I'm I work I literally require every single ad account to have these test them out see how they work and if they do work well duplicate them go get some more unboxing videos go get some more testimonial videos go get some more reaction videos to your product keep doing
