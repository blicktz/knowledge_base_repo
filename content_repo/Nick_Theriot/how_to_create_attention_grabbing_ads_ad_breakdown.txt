yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick serio today an exciting new video for you guys today we're gonna be breaking down kind of some ad concepts and some ads kind of like psychology from a ad i saw online um that just think has a lot of really good psychological concepts inside of it and i want to show you guys exactly you know how to grab attention and a few things to um you know relay over like social proof and authority and all that fun stuff right there so really kind of diving in of why i think this ad became was successful and also to just yeah to give you guys a lot of ideas for this video so um i know i'm sounding amazingly hyped up for this and like you know this is just gonna be the best video ever in the world but trust me guys so you'll have some value in this one so before we get started hit that like button hit that subscribe button and comment below um maybe some interesting ads you've seen recently that i should check out so let's dive into it guys so this ad right here is an ad from ridge wallets and ridge wallets is you know eight figure brand i think they're going eight figures but they're crushing it they've been in the wallet space for a little period of time right now their primary demographic is males i'd say probably from 18 to i don't know maybe 40 45 plus so but yeah so that's the primary demographic right there and you know they have a lot of money they spend a lot of time on advertising and things like that so and i recently saw this one ad and i was like yo this ad is a genius so let's just first watch it first and i've seen this i've shown it to you before in this channel but i haven't already did like a breakdown of it so just show you all the thing okay so that's the full out right there now what i love about this ad is that it hits everything it hits the aspect of grabbing attention it hits the aspect of a little bit of authority it hits the aspect of comparing wallets it hits the aspect of showing off the features it hits the aspect of reviews social proof guarantee like it hits all the major concepts that you need to be hitting in your ad what i also love about it is that in a world where we're shifting away from retargeting it also handles a lot of objections before you know like just right away it has a lot of objections you know oh is anyone else using this is there any reviews or any guarantee what does it do things like that so let's start breaking it down step by step so first off grabbing attention number one how well is it attention this is grab attention now it's gonna be a little controversial here this is the first frame of the video and we know most guys um can find this somewhat attention grabbing okay so they know their ideal market they know you know what grabs their attention so hey 18 to 30 year old guys what grabs their attention online okay girls money cars like that's literally probably the three best things biggest things and then everything stems down from those so we do we're gonna put a pretty girl in the first frame um boom so there you go so girl taking out of our pockets and then boom so we grab the attention of our ideal demographic okay is there other ways we could have done this yes we could have done you know a guy pulling up a lamborghini pulling it out we can have a picture of this wallet and a lamborghini kind of like in the background if we want to like position it that way um we could have a guy pulling out of his pocket versus a girl you know we can have a guy in a bar like pulling it out like a card out to pay for it uh for more of a lifestyle status right there so there's a few different ways to grab attention but what you got to look at is that what grabs people's attention is something they either strongly hate or strongly love okay so if you go back at like the you know the um presidential elections in us with donald trump and all that stuff like that uh every time someone saw one of his things they either immediately loved it or immediately hated it and that's why you know love him or hate him he got a lot of really great attention because of his very polarizing views either love them or hate them that's the thing with it so when people online and they see something they either strongly hate or strongly love they're going to be able to you know it's gonna grab their attention in that sense right there that's something i've noticed a lot so and for advertising strongly hate may be a little bit more difficult so i personally go more the strongly love unless like i'm selling like uh i don't know you know like for example like one of our brands right now uh they're selling a specific insurance um and we show off what they strongly hate and why they need that insurance to protect themselves against that so we use that as attention grabbing so so yeah so strong something you strongly love strongly hate in the beginning to really grab their attention now it's just from a visual perspective now from a copywriting perspective right here it starts off with her saying guys this wallet's for you so like obviously you know i wouldn't change the text on here i think they did a really great job with the text and you know obviously like look i'm like three seconds in and it's already been one two three three different scenes in three seconds so that's also showing to you guys like just keeping things moving and fluid and stuff like that if you're if it took them if it took her three seconds just to pull this wallet out of her pants that would be um you know just take too long so what else could we do you know another way around this is that we could have even did the um the organic instagram text or snapchat text with like the bold around it but i really like the fact they didn't do that because they're trying to separate themselves as more of a higher level social status they're trying to give people that perceived level of hey you wear this is gonna have a high level social status so the creative feels very mature very sophisticated in that sense right there but if they've used that organic text so i've actually added some level of uh amaturness that i would not want to associate this brand to in that perspective right there so let's move forward got their attention okay now uh i'm not sure if this is the i think this might actually be the founder or ceo but if it's not then this could be some level of authority but i also really love the fact that they shifted from the girl talking to the guy so we use the girl to grab the guy's attention now we're just kind of shifting the change and actually it's a whole new voice that comes up starts talking now but yeah so best wallet you can buy you know that's a pretty average review why you know maybe there's something different like something else that's more exciting but i would say it's a review it's some guy holding it talking about it really cool scene if this was like a guy and like using like a 1080p or like a 720p webcam and like his mom's basement saying it's the best wallet you can buy like it would have very low impact compared to this it has a lot higher of impact from that perspective right there now um so it shows off that then it shows and jumps into here okay this right here is pretty much just a comparison of two it's kind of like you versus them and that sense right there i i really like that they did this i think this also adds another level of why you need it so it's the best wallet you can buy then boom it shows off this right here so it actually does answer that question of why so that's pretty good um let's see i think they even have like they have text that's popping up but it's like popping up below my little play button right here i just can't see it so but all right like don't take my word for it okay but you don't think my word for it best while you can buy but you don't think my word for it cool so we got their attention we're kind of seeding the initial thoughts we want in their mind hey guys you need this wallet it's the best wallet you can buy boom why oh wait here you go here's a why okay hey that's that's pretty cool like you know that's significantly smaller and that's also a big thing too if they would have been at the top like they shot the this photo from top down and you would have just seen like the top of this wallet top of this wallet and it's like you couldn't see the size comparison at all this size comparison actually speaks louder than you think this really shows and sells that product significantly because now you can actually see okay wow that's a big difference okay that's cool i like that you know i need a smaller wallet they're over and it just keeps going it's showing off this is a pretty cool way to show off all the reviews i like that so now we we seeded the why we shown off social proof okay cool now what's the objections that's where we're gonna start tying into now or actually features features the next thing so now we're actually showing off like what's the big deal about this product cool so i was just showing off like the guarantee it's us out for 45 days if you don't love it get a full refund okay cool guarantee a really cool way is showing off the features right here more reviews 30 colors showing off more it might go a little too quick now so so go back to this guarantee let's go back to this very very simple test out for 45 days you'll love to get a full refund i love that it didn't do 30 days because now it's like everyone has a 30-day guarantee in retrospect a longer guarantee actually works better and the reason why is because with a 30-day guarantee people feel they don't have enough time to use a product so if they're if you bought the product at 30 days you're gonna get they're gonna get a refund whereas if they have a little bit longer of a period of time to use it and get really solid sold on it they're more likely to uh use it that's essentially there all right less likely to use it that my sin my bad very easy way to show off the features so you know features the benefits okay i can show off the you know the the craftsmanship in it that's also pretty cool but what is the major reason why you know i need this wallet and it's obviously to hold cards and cash okay so right here it's showing features and benefits what's the benefits of it uh what's a feature that's can be turned into a benefit well feature it holds up 12 cards so that's really cool it's also a benefit at the same time holds up 12 cards um rfd blocking technology honestly i just feel like this is like the biggest like not gimmick but just like i just have a strong correlation in my brain between rfd blocking technology to drop shipping products uh just because that's when i first kind of got in the e-commerce while seeing a lot of cool so this is just showing off all the varieties also really not a great thing right there showing off the variety of colors you have to appeal to more buyers so that way they're they're like oh i don't want black i want blue well here's the over 30 colors they have okay let's see what we got there over 30 colors um i cannot move this okay oh there we go carbon titanium okay cool so carbon titanium right here that text we missed the bottom is just like the structure of the wallet that's center there also helps with adding to the perceived value we know this was made of carbon and titanium lifetime warranty cool all right cool then once you go back you'll never go back to your old wallet so that's pretty much it now i'm not sure if this ad was longer i actually got this out on snapchat but i'm not sure if this ad was longer and just due to snapchat cutting it at a certain period of time that that's why it ended or if there's that's just it you'll never yeah you'll never go back to your old wallet so there's a lot in here there's social proof there's comparison there's why you need it there's features i recommend you guys to even go ahead and people who struggle with creative and stuff like that literally here you go here's an exact format that you guys can use like literally go take this ad and replicate your own in your own way okay you know the first scene where they use the girl to grab attention stuff like that um again people people look at actors in three different ways in ads it's either someone that they want to be like so you know a dude that's overweight who wants to be like chad over there with apps and everything then you so you can do chad in the beginning um someone that looks just like them so if it's dude overweight then it's another dude that's overweight that's like hey i completely understand it's hard to lose weight you know here's here's where i'm at now here's all the progress i'm making so here's i recommend you try it then the last one is a sexually attractive character that people are attracted to that's that's right there so you know um maybe that particular guy that's overweight and he sees those girls and like they're really cute stuff like that and then like you know hey they're the ones selling the product down so like that's another way right there too as well there's three different actors you can use in ads to essentially grab people's attention um in the initial kind of like first scenes in that sense right there so again use that in your own way show off a feature scene features the benefits so highlight the specific features that have the biggest benefits to the product you know like mp3 player and apple where ipod went throughout of 16 000 songs in your pocket mp3 player went around the the thing of like 16 gigabytes so they of all the features that that mp3 player had and that ipod had apple chose the one with the biggest impact to the consumer so so there's a big thing right there yeah guarantee customer reviews like all easy stuff to add in as well like this is just a really great ad to replicate it shows off a lot of different concepts all put together and also shows you just in the sense of how to put them all together in that sense right there too as well so yeah hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown and really hope you guys can take some value from this if you create an ad from this and it crushes it drop a comment below because i have to see that i'm very curious to see
