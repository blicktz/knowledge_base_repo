what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have a special new video for you guys we'll be going over 10 tips to managing over a thousand dollars a day in Facebook ad spend based off everything I'm currently doing right now what's working and how you can do it yourself if you're new to the channel again my name is Nick Theriot and I run a digital agency helping e-com businesses scale from 25k a month to 250k a month in revenue after watching today's video you'll be able to start managing campaigns more confidently especially as you shift into higher budgets before we get started make sure you hit the subscribe button and the like button below as we post weekly videos on e-commerce marketing and Facebook ads showing how to scale your stores that being said let's jump into the video alrighty so I think tip number one is what I'm going to show you today does not apply to testing campaigns this is only going to apply to live campaigns that are currently already scaling profitable that you're managing on a day-to-day basis my testing campaigns have our own set rules and stuff that I follow for that specific campaign but these are for your live campaigns that are already proven to be profitable and now you just need a better way to manage them testing campaigns you want about 72 hours of consistent data and ad spend with no interruptions whereas these rules and stuff that I'm going to show you today these tips and stuff they will not apply to testing campaigns you're going to be specifically for campaigns that are already moving forward already profitable and stuff so tip number one is you're going to have separate rules for live campaigns and separate rules for testing campaigns so big tip right there now tip number two is you need to know your numbers here's all the numbers that we would like to know for specifically for the rest of the video as well you want to look at the last six months of data or even the next longest say if you're not even advertising for four months look at four months of data and you want to find your breakeven ROAS first thing uh you want to find that okay this is good ROAS but you know it could be better and then you want to find that ROAS that's like wow this is amazing um you know I love this I love this particular number right here we doing good with this and then you're going to find a number 30 below breakeven ROAS and a number between 30 above breakeven ROAS so for example if your breakeven ROAS is 1.5 30 below will be like 1.05 and then also too when you're looking for these other two ROAS targets of oh wait no it's good but it could be better um make sure this is all based off realistic data that's already happened uh don't be unrealistic here you know if you were dreaming of a 5x and never got that before don't put a 5x down put literally a 3x down because you've gotten that before and also to be very specific or ROAS numbers because a 2.5 is a lot different than 2.0 so make sure you're including your decimal points right there uh you also want to learn your or know your average cost per purchase and the average cost per purchase times two so if your average cost purchase is $25 your 2x epp is going to be $50 now another tip is delayed attribution I think this is a big one right here that a lot of people forget about and especially a lot of newer you know brands that are advertising and stuff but delayed attribution plays a huge role inside your ad accounts so for example um let's say today monday or tuesday you click on an ad and then thursday you make that sell your like purchase is going to accumulate back to tuesday so on wednesday when you look back at tuesday's data and saw you had zero purchase on that campaign then thursday the sale was made and then friday you look back again at the week and all of a sudden tuesday has a sale and it's profitable well that's because of the late attribution we start to see this to really become a big thing especially on ad accounts that are also doing a lot of email marketing as well so just something to think about as well now tip number four is do not look at a 24 hour window I see too many people they literally look back at the last 24 hours and that's how they make their decisions of what they're going to cut today what they're going to scale today what they're going to decrease today um so make sure you're looking at longer time frames my three time frames I'm always looking at is the three day to seven day in the monthly so three day is kind of like my usual for like I'm going to increase the budget I'm going to decrease the budget or maybe we're severely unprofitable on the three day mark for a specific campaign I'm going to cut it so you're always going to look back at the last three full days of advertising data same thing with the seven day same thing with the monthly uh and this way it doesn't allow you to look at the bigger picture before you make pay before you make um before you make decisions and it's also going to look back at a much stronger window of data versus just looking at the last 24 hours when it could have been a down day that specific day I see too many people literally every day just inside dad's manager oh we were down yesterday you gotta push the budget down oh we're up yesterday you gotta push the budget up and every day it's just a roller coaster ride and that's not what you want to be doing and also there's a lot of harsh swinging emotions so um look at longer time frames before you make decisions and always look at the last three full days or seven full days or the monthly in terms of where you at for account performance now so now you understand a few of the tips and stuff that just kind of like basic rules and stuff I follow when running ads let's actually dive now into some of the actual specifics of okay we're going to increase the budget here today we're going to look at last full three days data you know what's what's going on how do we actually manage it because managing it comes down to cutting when to cut stuff once increase budget when to decrease budget when to add new stuff in so that's all big parts of what we're going to cover in today's video so now that we're moving forward uh first thing is just your top of funnel budget increase and again this is going to be specifically for your campaigns that are not testing campaigns testing campaigns have their own specific rules um so what we do is for our top of funnel budget we're gonna we're gonna map out three three particular robust targets um I like to do my break even number I like to do my good but could be better robust and then I'll also like my love you know I love this number but again make sure all these are realistic ones that's already been accomplished many times in your ad account and you're just simply um you know actually writing them down and stuff so now what I like to do is a 10 20 30 uh percent increase for these specific targets so for a lot of our accounts we want to spend a lot and we're okay with increasing budget even if it's at a break even ROAS if it's below a break even ROAS we're cutting it but or we're decreasing budget but um if it's above a break even ROAS we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna start increasing it by increments so um at a break even ROAS we're gonna increase by 10 percent and anything from a 2.25 upwards to a 3 we're gonna increase it by 20 percent and target number three is is anything above a 3x or increase it by 30 percent and that's the total budget so if you're running a CBO campaign it's pretty easy if it's ad sets you're gonna do each individual ad sets of which how you're gonna increase these particular um daily budgets so now what I like to do is when I'm doing this is I like to basically look at like getting the last full three days of data and then I'll make my decision so if I'm making this decision Wednesday afternoon I'm gonna look at Tuesday Monday and Sunday I'm not gonna include Wednesday and you're gonna do this once a day per campaign or per ad set now some of you guys might be on a little more conservative side with ad spend and not willing to not willing to increase anything if it's at break even ROAS so you might want to make your targets a little higher so maybe you're great you're willing to increase budget at 10 percent once you're at a 2.25 then a 3x for 20 percent then a 3.5 for 30 percent it's gonna vary by person and also to how much they have ad spend how conservative they are how much they're spending it's gonna be a lot of different factors in it whether what these three ROAS targets will be now also to don't recommend scaling past 30 percent 30 percent is also the border uh Facebook says anything above a 20 percent can potentially throw your ad set throw your campaign back into learning limited or affect the delivery of it as it's too big of a budget increase but we've been finding your 30 percent right on that sweet spot so that's why we only like to shoot for very high ROAS numbers on that particular ad account before we increase about 30 percent we're not going to do this at like a break even because we know that sort of campaign is just going to go to shit now our middle funnel and bottom of funnel increases for the budget is quite different because we were applying the same rules for our top of funnel but the problem with it was it was drastically increasing too much and it was burning out our audiences very quickly at your middle of funnel and bottom of funnel you're already going to have a naturally high ROAS so if you're applying the same rules as your top of funnel it's just going to throw out the budget really quick and then you'll see a very harsh decline in your middle funnel and bottom of funnel you'll burn out your audiences and it's just not a fun time to be honest so with this we um we also like we also see like people with high ROAS and then they'll just increase their budget like oh my middle of funnel's out of 5x let me hurt but start scaling it and then they're spending more of their middle funnel than their top of funnel and obviously that causes from some issues because you'll wear out your middle funnel audiences and you need to pump more people in there so what i like to do when i'm increasing the budget for a middle funnel and bottom funnel there's a certain frequency you know we've noticed 2x for some accounts uh we've seen some with a 3x 4x but there's a certain frequency for the last 24 hour period of which ROAS will start to drop after so if you have like an 8x frequency and you notice any budget increase after just destroys your ROAS then you know okay as long as i keep my frequency up below a 8 then you're good and you can keep increasing budget and keep looking and monitoring that frequency so frequency is just something you got to keep in mind and if it looks good and everything i'll increase by 20 percent simple um if if i know the frequency is high ROAS is down i need to pull budget back because that frequency is too high people are seeing the same ad too many times i need to toss in a new creative i need a lower ad spend for that particular one and then we'll move forward so you're gonna have to find that number it's kind of hard to tell uh like i said some accounts i see of anything below a 2.0 in the last 24 hours is good some amount of accounts i can see a 8x in the last 24 hours and lowering it did nothing and it only you know so you have to find that specific number for your account it's kind of hard to tell exactly which works for you um for me again last 24 hours anything below a 2.0 for the frequency has been really good for us though okay so you're probably wondering okay how do i manage all this because this is a lot of information i just learned and especially if you're when you're like us and we're managing seven to eight accounts on a day to day basis so tip number seven is you need some type of rules to automate this now we use reveal bots in our agency because we just love how easy to use and the amazing like expansions you have on these rules and stuff like it's it's it's amazing because you can create some really powerful stuff whereas facebook ads manager you can create rules it's free and everything but the problem with it is that it's very limited in terms of what you can do reveal bot provides some absolutely amazing just options and pretty much anything you can think of you can literally put into reveal bots now the cool thing about using a bot is i'm not in front of my ads manager every day 24 7 i'm not in my you know weekend saturday sunday and that leads to problems with inconsistencies especially when you're spending a lot of money and you're working with many different accounts um you know just those two or three days away from it can you know cause some issues so that's why i like to use reveal bot because it gives me that confidence to step away from the ads manager and understand that hey my strategy has been duplicated into reveal bots and i know reveal bots gonna take care of it for me now i love artificial intelligence but i think the biggest thing for you to understand is you need to have your strategy down first before using reveal bot so you need to actually go ahead and take everything i just showed you in this video go work on it for a few days fine tune it tweak it and stuff and then okay now i know exactly what i do on a day-to-day basis then duplicate yourself into reveal bot it'll be the cheapest ads manager you can find in terms of you know taking some of that responsibility off your hands i'll go ahead and include a link below for reveal bot full transparency it is an affiliate link if you use it that's cool if not that's totally cool as well um again it helps out the channel so if you do are inclined to using reveal bot and you want to use it please use my affiliate link pay me back for these awesome videos completely free for you so um thank you okay so now we're going to go into decreasing budgets i think probably this is a big one and first thing i'm going to do is find a number lower than your break even roas about 30 below so if your roas is between a 1.05 which is definitely unprofitable and then 1.5 which is a break even roas uh we want to decrease the budget by 20 and again we want to look at a three-day window before making this call so we'll do this daily and we'll do it on all campaigns even your middle funnel and bottom of funnel campaigns um you can also set this rule for your middle funnel and bottom of funnel campaigns based off a higher roas as you're already want your middle funnel and bottom of funnel to be higher if my middle funnel and bottom of funnel is at a 1.29 for a few days then obviously there's some bigger issues and we need to pull some budget back maybe update through creatives new offer something like that so but we we apply this to all of our live campaigns again does not apply to our testing campaigns another note on this um i i like to look at like facebook has a super smart algorithm obviously of how much money we push at it on a day-to-day basis it gets us results and stuff but what happens if we start to pull that budget back is it smart enough to okay this advertiser is starting to pull out the market let's get up some results to keep them in so that's also another reason why i like to decrease budget for a few days before just cutting the campaign and we've normally seen if we decrease the budget for a few days we'll see a spike in results again for that campaign just by decreasing the budget a little bit pulling back retracting back a little bit so if we can do this for a few campaigns and bring them back to profitable that's absolutely amazing now as we move away from budget increases budget decreases let's go to trimming the fat now i did get this this particular terminology from tim bird and his i think shotgun strategy but uh trimming the fat for me is just every three days we're going to start cutting off a bunch of stuff that's definitely unprofitable so i give three days for all new campaigns and essentially we're going to do is when our roas is below our lowest three three yeah when our roas is below our lowest target for roas so it's at 30 below one so for us it's a 1.05 so if it's below a 1.05 maybe it's 0.95 we're going to cut it we're going to start off with the creatives so we're cut off all the creatives that's unprofitable then we'll move to the ad sets cut off all the ad sets that are not profitable and then if we're left with only one ad set one creative and that's it cool if not if we're left with nothing then okay cool we just cut off that campaign but i always like to start off with the creatives first and then move my way up from creatives ad sets all the way up to the campaign um and then also too if we notice that there's a 2x cost per purchase with zero sales again on the creatives nothing cut it and what that's going to do is it's going to trim the fats and trim the stuff that's not working and we're working from creatives up because if we turn off all the creatives but like let's say if you let's say for example you have an ad set that's like 1.05 pro s then you look inside of it you have two creatives for like a 4x return on ad spend but only about small portion of the budget was fed out to those uh those creatives and then one particular creative has like 300 spin and a 1.05 then obviously we just need to turn off that one and that way we can start testing those new creatives with you know a higher return on ad spend now every seven days i like to go ahead and just cut everything that's not profitable um i like to also look at about 30 above breakeven ro s over the last seven days if we had a campaign and we turned off creatives turn off ad sets and still at a you know breakeven return on ad spend or in that like mixture uh i like to turn off everything below uh below that and basically the number i'm going to shoot for is 30 above breakeven return on ad spend so if it's you know 1.5 30 above it's a 1.95 and anything below 1.95 i cut again start off creatives work all the way up but if i've already been doing this every three days then it should just be very simple of cutting you can also use reveal bot to automate a lot of this with the seven day period of time and three day period of time and again just do it for a few weeks or do it for some time in terms of these two specifically but some of these you can start setting up almost immediately just have a good understanding of how each one works don't just set it up as that way you'll lead to some issues so again guys you can grab reveal bot below absolutely amazing key piece of software way cheaper than hiring someone in-house to come manage all this for you um and then just an awesome little key piece to help you out with your ads manager and especially when you're busy and can't get to ads manager you set up some rules and stuff that's going to protect you from overspending and cutting things early it's very very awesome all righty guys so that's the end of this video i hope this helps out um i'll manage ad accounts eight different ad accounts on a day-to-day basis some spending you know four or five hundred dollars and some spending upwards to three to four thousand dollars per day so these are all the rules i like to use to like help me out with organizing it and stuff so i really hope you
