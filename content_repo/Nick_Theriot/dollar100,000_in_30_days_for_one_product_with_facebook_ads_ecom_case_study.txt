yo what's going on guys welcome to my channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I want to bring you guys a new video where I'm actually going to show you a campaign we ran for Father's Day where we literally generated over a hundred thousand dollars in sales for an e-commerce brand specifically targeted to just Father's Day so it's a very limited product it was a product that we dipped in and we dipped out we made our money and we exited before losing any capital losing any you know profit and stuff and it's really cool how we did everything so I want to make just quick video to update you guys because this is the exact campaign I had posted in a video while back where I was build a Facebook Ads campaign with me or actually show you guys how I set everything up and now I'm gonna show you guys the results the final final results because we have actually turned this campaign off it's not running anymore we ran it for less than 30 days to generate over a hundred thousand dollars in revenue with a very high amount of profit essentially because their break-even profit margin it's like to 2x we spent $28,000 so their break-even was like $60,000 and we made them over a hundred thousand dollars so they made like forty thousand dollars in profit essentially so let's dive right in my computer and I'm just going to show you guys everything first off I just want to say this is not for beginners this is not a beginner strategy this pixel and stuff that we've used is seasoned they're been running ads for a while now spending anywhere from twenty to thirty thousand dollars a month in ads so this is not a beginner campaign this is for someone that's been running for a while and simply just wants to come in and maybe launch another product going into it this is an e-commerce brand like I said they've been running ads for five months they're selling custom metal signs their objective is to sell father's day sign which is a barbecue sign essentially so it's per people who like to like barbecue outside and also too it's for father's day because obviously if you barbecue outside and stuff it's a great like little gift for mom to give dad from the kids as it's something he enjoys so it's selling kind of on that emotional factor right there uh again results we spent twenty eight thousand dollars and we made over a hundred thousand dollars in revenue at a 3.5 x row as and from the time I launched this campaign we were 30 days out from father's day so that was really key the timing because we knew that people were going to buy the sign for father's day so we had to make sure that we were far enough out promoting it that people could get it in time before father's day and you'll actually see the results as we closer to father's day are pretty shocking so the beginning stages how I set all it up uh basically first I need to identify my ideal customer so I know I'm selling to women 21 to 55 they're likely to have a family they're likely to have you know household you know so there's some pretty decent income they have either a dad that likes to barbecue or or you know a husband that likes to barbecue so they'll either be purchasing it from themselves to give to their dad or they'll be purchasing from themselves for to either give to you know their husband or from the kids for father's day uh next thing we did is after we identified our ideal customer we wanted to get a bunch of content with the sign luckily we already had it all like already had a bunch of content for the sign on file so we didn't really have to go out there and create anything new then what we did was we wrote down three to four different ad angles for the product so one of the biggest things that we used for this product was we leveraged the emotional factor of praise from their husband so what I did was I literally wrote some ad copy that said you know hey moms uh be the best spouse you know win the spouse of the year award by purchasing this father's day sign for dad he'll praise all of his friends about you because of the sign you know just made hype their up saying hey this is the best thing you can purchase uh for your husband or for your dad and that was just one of the angles that really took off a few other ones were just like hey check out some amazing barbecue signs stuff so um wrote a few different ad angles for the product to get people's attention and for them to purchase then I identified possible interest to target so for me it was like father's day there was literally interest called father's day that crushed it there was another one just online shop engaged shoppers just kind of typical that we all all like go after that work really well uh barbecue pits uh outdoor grilling like just different things like that that uh interest that we could target inside the facebook ads manager to go after people so now I have all of this put together now it was time to set everything up so what I did was I set up four cbo campaigns with the purchase conversion um each campaign at $100 a day so we're starting off right there at 100 at $400 a day uh for this campaign and keep in mind we're any keep we spend anywhere from two to three thousand dollars a day on this ad account so this was nothing for us to set up I did what I did was I did three to four ad sets per campaign uh in fact I think a few of them actually did more so what I did was I did you know like a few different interests and each interest had its own ad set then the look like campaign I had a few different look like audiences with each look like audience having a ad set and then lastly was the pixel with no targeting and then I did an ad set literally for women 18 to 24 then another one with women 25 to 34 then another one with women from 35 to 44 and literally no targeting also we're targeting hundreds of millions of people in each individual ad set and then what I did was I did four ads in each ad set and there were the same four ads for every single ad set in all four campaigns so I had created one creative which is a few pictures in a slideshow format because from uh history on this ad account uh the slideshows absolutely crush it with these metal signs and then what I did was is I did four different ad angles for each creative so essentially you know four different variations of uh ad copy essentially and then again four hundred dollars was the starting out budget and I could even do two hundred dollars per ad set as long as I knew it was profitable but I like to test campaigns at a hundred dollars a day so the first three days let's actually show you guys to set up so this is uh these four campaigns right here were the first few days of data and you can see right there may 21st that is when we launched this campaign I need to refresh this all for you guys just to make sure you guys know it's proof and I just have it sorted by father's day uh so that way I know we're just looking at these so these are the campaigns set up right here let's see I can actually show you kind of have this set up so this is the pixel right here again just that's it that's the only targeting I did for those um accounts and stuff for those things so and uh yeah that's that's pretty pretty much it for that and then we had four different creatives and again I had one at one visual photo like a you know slideshow for all of them same slideshow but I had a different ad copy for each one so we could test that see what kind of pulling power each one had and if we go into warm audiences this is another campaign I set up just to go after existing people then I had value based which this is just look like audiences it's just using the value base look like audience thing and then lastly uh you know the father's day interest interest conversion so I also did relationship status so that way we could target people who are in relationships so because they're most likely to have kids and she's most likely to purchase it for her kids to give to parent uh that so that was how we had everything set up uh kind of just going into it so we go through the first three days right here now these are the most important and the reason why the first three days is the most important is because it takes about 72 hours for Facebook to optimize a campaign so generally uh you'll see probably your worst results during this time and it just takes time for Facebook start picking up picking up picking up and then like you you have to have some entry level data you can optimize on so like this campaign right here uh you know website visitors was the best one we saw 12x roas during this time uh pixel wide open you know we saw one with 2.49 roas and uh you know we had a nice winner right here for a creative uh value based you know saw some okay results but the interest conversion so this is just targeting interest the same and you know keep in mind we already spent hundreds of thousands dollars on that account and interest are going better than look like audiences so if we dive into it we can see right here barbecue and grill did best and we got a few you know good sales on that one uh but yeah so that was the first three days and again we just didn't touch anything we just set it let it run we thought we identified one clear winning campaign plus one solid winning ad angle and then we scaled up winning campaign 100% of those three days were over so that's this one right here uh let's see we can see on that monday the day after those three days and or it was like another day maybe another one it was like a day or two after the three days were over we increased this uh by a hundred dollars because i wanted to let the results stabilize out a little bit more uh so then after that those next seven days we just let that run uh we scaled up another campaign that's stabled out so let's see let's do may 27th through oh a little too far those next few days we had scaled up this one right here uh pixel wide open we had also scaled that one up after a few days to a hundred dollars uh to two dollars a day so from a hundred dollars a two dollars a day and you can start seeing we had a good robust 3.5 robust on this campaign we started to see results stabilize out a little bit we're seeing about a thousand dollars a day in adsmen let's see and it was actually yeah that's saturday going into that sunday the sunday i had set up a few new campaigns to test out so i'd created a retargeting campaign based off people who viewed the website or view that specific product which is a few testimonials uh and then this one right here where it says add to cart initiate checkout this is basically me pushing different conversion objectives so i was pushing instead of converting optimizing for purchases i was optimizing for initiate checkout or optimizing for ads to cart and then i also did some micro bidding which micro bidding is something where you launch hundreds of ad sets all at like three dollars a day and like every few hours you turn off the unprofitable ad sets and it's pretty cool because you'll spend like a few dollars to get like one uh one purchase but that's a whole nother video right there to explain because it's very complex and so i launched three new campaigns or four new campaigns all at almost a hundred dollars a day so that caused us to horizontally scale scale so i mean uh horizontally scale uh most people vertically scale which is increasing the budget so i'm doing a little bit mixture of vertical and horizontal scaling with this uh then after those next few days um oh and also too by the way i was turning off unprofitable ad sets so i'm either turning off unprofitable ad sets turning off unprofitable ads and i'm increasing the budget by 100 percent every three to four days uh throughout this time i'm seeing a three to four at uh three to four x row as um you know launch those some new campaigns uh or this is actually the next seven days that go by so let's show you guys i think it goes through here so i started launching some of these new ones right here so these right here are those each individual ad angles so i identified adding on number one was profitable so now what i'm doing is i am creating a whole other campaign just to test those ad angles alone because sometimes when you're testing multiple different ad angles like that it's uh facebook will like just pick one for that specific campaign and do really good with it so just putting those other ad angles in completely new campaigns uh so that just helps test those out so i want to make sure i want to make sure i had all my angles tested out because i did not want to risk uh just limiting my awareness and my perspective to just those and then not test those other ones that could have been better and i like i said i was really trying to scale and this is how i was horizontally scaling as well because i wasn't really increasing budget much on these other ones right here um i did get them up to four hundred dollars a day down here but as you can see overall you know i didn't really go higher than that and now if we look at it we're about two weeks into this or almost a month into it uh one two about three weeks into this you can see right here we're at twenty one thousand dollars spend uh three point six nine robots and seventy seven thousand dollars in revenue for the business now some stuff interesting happens as we go into this uh friday the 12th right here uh as you can see you know friday the 12th wasn't as hot you know we went from a 3.31 robots uh down to about a 2.85 robots and then you can see the 13th got a 3x row as sunday we got 2.92 monday i think monday it's hard it's 2.53 so we're slowly starting to see like that three to four x range robots drop down now to that uh you know two to three range and that was showing signs of for us that things were going south because father's day was the following sunday uh right here and this was the last week before father's day and two things were happening keep in mind we're in the summer so more people are traveling and going shopping covet just started allowing places open back up so people are spending their money on other things or they're out busy uh shopping uh going to vacation stuff and they're not focused on purchasing online and as well as we're getting closer to father's day and people don't want to order a product they're not going to get in time for father's day so there's two different factors right there playing and this made me to start become aware of this because uh essentially now it's like okay things are losing momentum i need to decide at what point am i going to turn things off because if we go south really hard i want to make sure we preserve as much profit as we made for this we kind of dipped in and we dipped out that's essentially what i want to do i'm not trying to push a dead horse you know a few days before father's day and we we tie you know we hit up and screw up all of our profit we made uh for this campaign so and then we look at the 16th right here we had a really bad day so friday drop drop drop drop drop and then like tuesday 1.85 and then i start scaling down and you can actually see right here uh that tuesday let's see hold up monday so we're upwards two thousand dollars a day now we're spending on this campaign uh you know making five thousand dollars back break even margin is 2x roas so first unprofitable day another unprofitable day and you can see right there immediately scaled down it's hard i started turning off everything that was completely just sucking essentially and then thursday everything off so we dipped in we dipped out so uh from that thursday to that friday the first day of running it we spent 28 000 3.34 roas and then we made 93 000 back keep in mind that there's about a 10 to 20 percent data disruptancy between shopify and facebook and inside of shopify it's a little over a hundred thousand dollars so and um yeah that's what we did for this father's day campaign for me i think this was very successful we did this exact same thing with the uh another sign we have for valentine's day except you know we learned from mistakes during valentine's day we started two weeks before valentine's day um we made i think like thirty thousand dollars in revenue at a three extra roas so we spent ten thousand dollars made thirty thousand dollars back uh so for this campaign we literally tripled it and for the next holiday we're going to triple this so we'll probably spend about ninety thousand dollars and try to make about 270 to three hundred dollars thousand dollars back in revenue um and with that that's just learning the business learning you know the client because this is a client for my digital agency right here so this is not you know just my store uh but that's just learning their customers consistently on our customers and pushing boundaries as well uh it's like so now we're upwards two three thousand dollars a day uh just spread out through multiple products they have uh they're crushing it with a funnel i'll build for them and everything so uh but yeah guys hope you guys enjoyed this video this was simply just a video to kind of take you guys through a campaign i want to kind of change your perspective on things and take you guys through it in a different way um than most kind of like campaigns i see on youtube i want to actually kind of go day by day and kind of take you guys through my thought process uh but i think with this campaign right here i i had a really good ad copy i had a really good creative so that way almost all the audiences i was testing were profitable just add more profitable audiences than the other ones and i guess a few tips is i was using cbo for everything and i would literally duplicate that budget so if i was at a hundred dollars today i would double it to two hundred dollars a day i would double two hundred dollars today to four hundred dollars a day and i was consistently doing that um every few days three to four days is my usual kind of like point and if when i go to double it if it's been bad over the last few days i just let it run for a few more days or i'll turn it off right there so i generally take uh go about seven days before i completely turn off a campaign uh and every three to four days i'll go ahead and i'll turn off an ad set inside that campaign that's unprofitable so if i'm running a cbo campaign with eight different ad sets and i see one's clearly unprofitable i'll turn it off and that whole campaign is still unprofitable after seven days then i'll go and i'll turn that whole campaign off or i'll try to add in some new creatives new ads uh new creatives and new audiences if those still don't work then i'll turn the campaign off so uh which you can do for yourself this is purely for scaling right here uh get your creative down get your audiences down start off on low budget 100 to a dollars a day uh focus on consistency first you do not want to start scaling after your first sale uh try to get a few days of consistent data before you start scaling and then after that what you want to do is just start increasing that budget up uh you know by 100 every so often uh turn off your profitable assets turn off your unprofitable creatives scale up a bit and then you could also do horizontal scaling which is just creating whole new campaigns with different variables so that's horizontal scaling so you know if say if you're trying to go up to 200 a day you could increase that budget by 100 or you can create a whole nother campaign at 100 today now you have two campaigns at 100 today which is 200 so that's my best advice
