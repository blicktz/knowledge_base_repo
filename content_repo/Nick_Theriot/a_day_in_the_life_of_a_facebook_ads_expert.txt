Currently showing you guys real quick Terrio Solutions Bay 224. We are at Topgolf tonight for the women's event or women's shelter in Lafayette, Louisiana where I'm based out of, they're having a charity event so we donated to sponsor because you know you need to donate to your shelters guys. But yeah here out with some of the team friends and having some fun with everyone.

So we just got back from Topgolf. You know first off huge shout out to the Acadiana Outreach Center for putting on such an amazing event and they specialize with women and children shelter providing shelter for them and everything. Charity I've been donating to for a while and everything like that and you know they put on a really good event tonight to raise some money and you know just show basically their sponsors and stuff like that some love.

But taking a look right now at ad accounts and stuff and I want to show you guys a really quick case study. We have had two accounts now. Find new winning DCTs and these are both accounts spending about $10,000 a day on Facebook ad spend.

So I just want to show you guys Friday through Wednesday. You can see in this account 12th through the 17th roughly around you know $12,000 a day we're spending on. So we can see right here we have this new DCT that took off in this account and just to show you guys like Friday the 12th it's way below and then on Saturday the 13th that 180 took off amazing DCT spend.

And yeah and it's been crushing pretty much to since then. So I just want to show you guys this quick little case study. We spent $40,000 on this DCT over four days with literally a $14 cost per purchase.

All right. So this is a another account as well. We're spending roughly about $10,000 a day.

We just have to actually lower it because we're getting so many leads for this account. We had another DCT take off. So this is $254 right here.

And this actually took off like almost like basically a week ago like pretty much beginning of the year like right after New Year's. This took off on January 6. You know guys can see right here $254.

And pretty much since then it has been just completely crushing it for spent $46,000 $23 CPL target KPI for this accounts $35 guys. So just want to show you all a quick little case study real quick while we're having a lot of fun and play. It's also still some action happening in the background.

Just want to give a little update on the sparring footage. First off, huge shout out to Lindsey, my sparring partner. He is very good.

He's way more advanced than, you know, me. And that's exactly what I needed because last year was like year number two of boxing. This is year number three.

And the biggest thing I've been missing is sparring. I spar 12 times last year once a month, not nearly enough. So now we're starting to spar once a week, which has been phenomenal.

You know, with my coach Rock and he's been kind of helping us both out. And like I said, Lindsey has been really good as well. So, but yeah, so I'll give you guys an update on that footage right there.

Let's head out in the morning to something pretty cool for you guys to see. Take three more shots that I've seen since then. Take three more shots that I've seen as a Daytona Camera.

Go buy plenty of shots that I may be playing with! knock open. Go buy 21, check the store for $ графos!

I agreed to see here in the hundred95 and conversion�� to conspiracy ICdirecting system. Go buy these shots. how things are up here okay just to give a little context for why we packed our bags and headed to miami for the weekend and that was one for jeremy hans's mastermind but also two we came out to dinner tonight at komodo with some clients some students and some friends from the mastermind enough of that we wouldn't get to some trouble with cigars and just wait till we see the footage here all right guys so we're currently getting a little bit of work done here with my buddy zach right now he's actually presenting today at the mastermind so uh should be interesting to learn a couple things from him yeah had a pretty good little workout in so um let's go ahead and head over to the mastermind jeremy hayden's mastermind we're just wrapping up day one and got a few of the other members got omar and sohal and you know just really quick what do you guys do real quick you run a so i work i run an agency in med tech and biotech med tech agency and then i run marketing for a financial services company okay and obviously everyone knows i'm super big in self-development so i want to ask you guys how important is self-development for you guys and like i don't know like any tips for people that are just kind of on that fence of investing in themselves or just not really sure like anything you've learned maybe like growing up maybe some of the mistakes you made in self-development and like what's your biggest thing to like you know leverage to get to that next level yeah i think probably the most important thing is that uh if you invest in yourself you're never going to go wrong with that right and so if you don't want to take it from me look at the most successful people in the world from warren buffett to bill gates all these people spend a lot of time to read and self-invest and i think that you have to get to a point where you even allocate money to it so every year about somewhere between five to ten percent of my income i allocate to self-development it shouldn't just stop at college it needs to be continual okay so investing five ten percent of everything you make back into in uh personal development what's your biggest i mean investing in yourself is everything uh truly you have to be the type of person who deserves money which means you have to keep upgrading yourself if you want to earn more money is a byproduct of solving problems so if you want to make more money you got to solve bigger problems the only way to solve bigger problems is to invest in yourself to become someone who can solve those yeah i love that so five to ten percent of your income it's back into personal development you who do you need to upgrade yourself to to get to that next level yeah you don't just get the things you want you have to become a person who deserves the things you want and i love what you said there because i know a lot of people that oh when i get to this level i'll invest in myself yeah you'll never get there you'll never get there you have to make that investment take that risk to get to that next level and then yeah and the other thing i was going to say is that pain has to be associated with this so sometimes you buy like a 20 30 book it's very easy to just to forget about that but when you invest more like a few thousand dollars to work with someone one-on-one it's just like working out i mean some people can watch a youtube video and go work out other people you need to pay for a class get a trainer etc and you get better and bigger results and you hold yourself accountable and to sohail's point in order to get the things that you want you have to deserve those things and you get you end up deserving them by becoming a different person not waiting for that person you know the the self-development and self-investment is a vehicle to get you to the next step a next level of life spiritually mentally and physically if you think about it i love that that's really good to omar's point if you're the more you invest in yourself the more seriously you're going to take anything so it's just naturally um you buy more books you're more likely to read books because you spend more money on them the the more heavily like the more deep you get into anything whether it's fitness so you start counting your calories you start working with a trainer you're naturally going to take it more seriously because you put more into it it doesn't always have to be an investment of money but it can be investment of time resources mental space but as long as you're investing more you're going to take it more seriously i love that that's solid appreciate you guys all right here with zach hesterberg biggest lesson about personal development what's your like trick or like common mistake you see other people make um a couple things but the first thing that comes to mind is uh like obviously stay around people that will push you and continue to challenge you in what you believe is true so for example like if you believe that a hundred thousand dollars a month is a lot of money uh you should probably uh try to surround yourself around people that a hundred thousand dollars a month is like embarrassing to be making because it's way too low like just challenge yourself or be surrounded by people that challenge you in your belief systems um the second thing though is in personal development it's actually like a mistake that i i think a lot of people make i've definitely gone another route is people get so into personal development they're like oh yeah i gotta keep reading gotta keep reading or i gotta keep watching these youtube videos or gotta keep investing in these courses and people become like course junkies and they'll continue to like that they just get this high and almost like dopamine hits from learning learning learning learning but yet they never actually take the time to simply execute i'd say like i don't know if you're gonna learn for let's say you're gonna go learn something for an hour uh you should probably try to execute for like 10 times the amount of time that you're actually putting into your learning as well like don't go down the learning route and just never actually i see that so much yeah so those are the first two things that come to mind those are so good so that is surround yourself with people that push you to make more and then also too don't be a course junkie don't sit down and wait and just keep taking courses and never take action or youtube videos or whatever yeah yeah and also with the pushing it's not even just about making more it's also like skill set yeah identity as a person yes yes i love that good stuff man yep cool by the way big shout out to jeremy haynes this is his beautiful house cars all
