Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Theria and today I have an exciting new video.

This is something I've been wanting to do for a really long time and that is we're going to be reviewing some of the ads from David Oakley. So he's one of kind of the copywriting legends, copywriting greats that I've been inspired by a lot of his work and stuff like that. So I was able to pick up kind of like I think it's like around 80 of his ads he's written that have been successful and I want to actually review them with you guys.

So starting off we got the man in the halfway shirt and this is pretty cool because you know this is probably like one of his most iconic ads and I'm probably like add like no maybe like 30 or 40 right now. Oh yeah 39 out of 89 and the first 39 were good but they're more like B2B and shit like that and it starts the the ones we're probably reviewing this call or in this particular video is more around kind of like e-com and stuff like that that you guys would be looking at. So this will be interesting.

So we got the man in the halfway shirt. If you haven't seen this ad before it's probably one of the most iconic ads that has been you know talked about in the advertising slash marketing industry right here and just looking at it my first impressions of it. It's definitely you know looks like a wealthy maybe say wealthy guy but he's you know has some tailors around him some people around him so he definitely has some level of money.

We're going to say he's like you know super rich in a private jet but he's definitely a little bit of a richer guy you know. Someone broke probably wouldn't be looking at this ad you know just because the tailors and the you know fabrics or everything like that in the background. Also with the eye patch and I want to say the eye patch really signified something at the time this ad was written.

I don't have a specific date on here but it's definitely somewhere around the 60s and the eye patch definitely signified some level of like you know maybe maybe like sophistication or something like that. Yeah just just an interesting guy you know maybe my maybe he's a combat veteran or something like that you know kind of like a James Bond in that sense right there. So interesting visual right there pretty cool pretty straightforward and then the headline the manly halfway shirt or halfway shirt and this particular ad I would say is more around like product aware specific people typically in your you know you're unaware you're problem aware and you're solution aware you're not mentioning the the headline at all or you're not mentioning your business name in the headline at all you're not mentioning your business name or your your product name until you get to that like product aware and aware stage so deeper into the five stages of market awareness but going further into it you know American men are beginning to realize that it's ridiculous to buy good suits then spoil the effect by wearing an already mass produced shirt.

So this is an interesting way it's creating a problem okay American men are beginning to realize as ridiculous to buy good suits so they're buying good suits and then spoil the effect by wearing an ordinary mass produced shirt. So basically you buy a really good suit what they're trying to articulate here is that they're buying a really good suit and the problem with buying a really good suit is that you're contemplating it with or compliment it with a shirt that is subpar to what this guy is wearing right here okay so that's basically how they're trying to position their product is that you're they're targeting people who buy really good suits and basically they need a really good shirt to go with it because it's basically like ludicrous in that sense right there to wear it with like a really bad shirt. So since the growing popularity of halfway shirts which are in a class by themselves halfway shirts wear infinitely longer a matter of years so this is all about positioning in terms of we talked about this in that last video how do we position our products is it cheaper is it quicker is it faster this particular scenario over here they're talking about how halfway shirts basically last a lot longer and they're hitting on the quality the first kind of benefit of wearing this particular product then they're hitting on the benefits of it they make you look longer younger more distinguished because of subway halfway cut collars so again product wear you know and also to the market sophistication around this this is definitely like a stage four because no one is like hey like you need a shirt like you know do you need a shirt question mark everyone needs a shirt so now it's because of the level of market sophistication go look at product positioning video i have and this is about a four where it's like you want to focus on feature first the mechanism first that makes your product different and enlarge on it as much as possible so that's basically here they wear infinitely longer that's kind of like the main feature of it quality and then it goes further into the benefits and stuff they make you look younger more distinguished because the southerly cut collars subtle way halfway cut collars so benefits what do people want if it's an older man you know older guy it's probably directly buying this they want to look younger more distinguished i like that it's basically kind of just sticking out being icon be be unique things like that um whole shirt is tailored more generously and it's therefore more comfortable so it kind of goes into a mechanism plus benefit um why is it different it's tailored more generously how's that benefit it's more comfortable so oh it's kind of like mechanism plus benefits in that sense right there so tails are longer and stay in your trousers the buttons or mother of pearl even the stitching has an antebellum antebellum elegance about it so just further talking in about the features of it what's making it better the mechanism and stuff like that okay cool now this next paragraph increases the value of the product the perceived value so an easy way to increase perceived value is by positioning the products that you know the the materials that make up your product as something extremely hard uh to get in that sense right there so above all halfway made make their shirts of remarkable fabrics collected from the four corners of the air i can't say those he said that the viala and arctics from england wool woolen tapta from scotland sea island cotton from the west indies hand woven mandras from india broad cloth manchester linen batiste from paris hand blocked silks from england exclusive cottons from the best beavers in america so it's really increasing the perceived value of the materials in it so how like what's so special about this shirt oh i don't know all right where's your materials come from oh this spot this spot okay cool as a copywriter you can basically take all that and increase the perceived value if you increase the perceived value people feel like they're getting a deal when they're purchasing your product because now i'm looking at this like damn this shirt must be a few hundred bucks but if it's only like a hundred bucks and i think it's a few hundred bucks then all of a sudden i can easily sell a hundred dollars all day for this particular product where um you know all my competitions is struggling at sixty dollars in that sense right there so okay cool so the next part you will get a great deal of quite satisfaction of wearing shirts which are such impeccable taste i'm not really sure why i put lifestyle in this it's definitely not lifestyle it's just another honestly it's just another benefit really lifestyle would be more about like what you do on a day-to-day basis and how this fits inside of your life halfway shirts are made by a small company of dedicated craftsmen in a little town of waterville maine this is also another interesting uh terminology here so i noticed that and this is something i've seen in a few ads before where if you you make yourself seem a lot smaller it feels like there's more attention with each product and also to a lot of people rather support some people rather support a smaller business in that sense right there made by a small company of dedicated craftsmen so like immediately you just think of a small company a bunch of craftsmen working and tailoring each shirt before it gets sent out in a little town of waterville maine they have been at it man and boy for 115 years so just further talking about their expertise and stuff like that in the field and then yeah it basically just goes to the call to action in that sense right there so if you really kind of question yourself like what is the main composure of this ad how was it written so first first thing they did was create a problem they they took your they took you from i don't know if i need this shirt to all of a sudden okay what is the problem this product solves and that is american men are beginning to realize that's ridiculous to buy good suits and then spoil the effects by wearing an ordinary mass-produced shirt it's creating a need and a why for this product and then it immediately just keeps going into feature what's a feature about it what's the benefit to it feature benefit feature benefits you know feature shirts wear infinitely longer a matter of years benefit they make you look younger more distinguished because of the subway cut collars and again that's that's even um a feature right there talking about the physical aspects to it whole shirt is tailored more generously that's a feature and is therefore more comfortable benefits tells her longer and stay in your trousers that's a feature and a benefit tells her longer which means they'll stay in your trousers that's a benefit because that's like a really aggravating thing um the buttons are mother of pearl even the stitching as and spell and elegance about it uh so that's a feature and then a benefit in that sense right there so so yeah so just articulating a few different features and benefits of the product just talking about distinguished aspects of this particular shirt okay and then obviously it goes in here which increases the value who i mean to put that increase value with this whole like paragraph right here and then obviously it goes further into like another little benefit in this sense right here so then obviously this too also helps out with um kind of that not really benefit but it helps out with that perceived perceived value so yeah so that's pretty much the man in the halfway shirt um definitely a pretty cool ad and they definitely have a few in here that david ogley had created um this is also a really interesting concept right here how they had taken different approaches to this ad before they found the right ad that works the best and this one right here is even more particularly interesting because it really hits on that stage four stage four maybe possibly three clasp and aggravation convince an ingenious new pin color that dispenses with holes class and aggravation that could be a stage three or four um particular market sophistication to again go look the video product positioning kind of goes through it so yeah a lot of elegance a lot of you know a more sophisticated man um a man of many different hobbies maybe maybe a teacher right here that's that's one that kind of threw me off a little bit so maybe it's that middle class the middle class guy not super elegant just modern middle class you know he goes to work nine to five that's what really shows me right here on the train right here and then yeah so and then obviously this one this definitely uh you know goes further into like the wealthy with a club him holding a bottle of champagne it definitely looks like more wealthier um maybe the shotgun right here and stuff like that so but next one we're gonna look at is this beer particular ad and i'll be the last one we'll look at actually for this particular video if you really you guys enjoy this make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button um post new videos every monday wednesday friday you never know what you're gonna get sometimes from our facebook ads sometimes it's around um you know things like this but it's all about over growing our marketing mindset here is what this whole channel is about and helping you guys crush it with your ads so let's take a look at this uh this is one i personally haven't read yet so you're gonna get a purely raw emotional aspect from me on this particular app so first just looking at the creative we see this particular guy holding the bottle upside down it looks like he might be trying to read something look into the bottle something like that and next thing is you see how is he dressed so it's a really big thing the way your characters are are dressed in your creatives is very important because if you're trying to attract a wealthier more sophisticated audience you're gonna you're gonna like relay something like this is immediately positions you know wealthy with this particular beer right here okay so it's just something you have to be cautious about when you're filming your ads you know if you're trying to sell expensive products and you're showing kind of people that are just don't have the money for it people that don't have money for are going to see their ad recognize it and then not people with money so you have to understand that okay you can see the lemon and sweeps swept steps i i don't know how to say that bitter lemon that's because swept uses whole fresh lemons juice pop peel feel everything okay so this is definitely a product aware again just very key on this i think also too is because product aware because okay cool you know you're not going to run an ad do you want to drink or you're not going to run a solution aware ad either where of all the different ways you can get drunk you can get drunk off this no you can just go straight into product aware people know about beer already people are aware of a lot of different brands you can just go straight in and show people exactly so this is definitely going to be a market sophistication of three or four i'd probably say four right here and it's really hitting and i would say it's four because sweeps uses whole fresh lemons that's really hitting on the key point that maybe prior brands started adding lemon into their product as a unique mechanism and then all of a sudden sweeps was like well we're going to use fresh lemons because i mean come on i rather a fresh lemon as well so that's a really big thing right there and then also too it's showing you how to test the claim that's a really big thing right here uh that's something that i've recognized in breakthrough advertising is if you show people how to test the claim then it increases the believability in the ad itself because they're like holy shit i can't wait to try it i can't wait to see that uh if you look at like um dairy queen for example where i don't know what their particular um like saying is well they test the claim by literally serving you thing flipping it over giving to you just to show you i guess how good their ice cream is so cool so let's dive into this so says commander whitehead president sweeps ltd sweeps invented invented bitter lemon he continues it was our first new product in 150 years and we did not stint or 100 years and we did not stint okay so maybe just showing i think the first impression to me is there's some level exclusive exclusiveness to that in the sense of first new product 100 years so like you know this this should be good um you know some type of perceived value maybe uh you know exclusiveness to it uh and then maybe quality as in like they spent 100 years getting it time to make sweeps uses whole fresh lemons in making bitter lemon juice pulp fill everything um grown up thus it's a tart grown up taste okay so this definitely goes into um describing process slash features that's not right okay sweeps bitter lemon is the first adult soft strength declares the sweepsman the only one you can order without filling like a yolk okay cool so this is starting to dive further into benefits this definitely answers who is this for and that's going to be this right here cool there are at least two more uses for sweeps bitter lemon it is an unobtrusive way to sit out around or two is also the most versatile new mixer since sweeps tonic itself interesting so is this a beer or is this just more of like a soft drink with like no like alcohol in that sense right there so this is describing how you can use it ah okay so it's an intrusive way to sit out around or two okay so okay i understand what it is so it is it is a non-alcoholic beer it's basically saying that hey you can drink this with your buddies it's a it's an easy way to get out of um you know drinking around or to sit out around or two so you can almost say this is a benefit or problem solved in that sense right there of like really recognizing okay cool this is where it sits and no matter how you use bitter lemon always turn the bottle upside down before you open it that way everyone gets his fair share of lemon morsels interesting okay cool and that's just again just kind of showing um product use and then i mean there's really nothing around that like i can't really say anything specifically like that so that's an interesting ad right there okay so it's a obviously it's something up a soft drink um that's unalcoholic and that's in right there it's non-alcoholic so that way you drink this with your friends and stuff like that okay cool that's pretty cool and very interesting so curious what what do you guys think about this particular one right here it was definitely very product aware it was definitely positioning the product in its own league with using real stuff bitter lemon specifically is the unique you know kind of like the bitter lemons and the fact that you can even see them inside the juice the pop feel everything it's just showing really that it's in a whole world league of home because for example if everyone is doing this particular one but everyone's using natural flavors this is using real stuff that's going to position a product in a much more unique way so i really like this and again there's a few different benefits features processes around this in terms of structuring the ad and everything like that so um this is interesting i enjoyed this ad this is pretty cool i don't know if it beats the man in halfway shirt was definitely an interesting one and yeah guys so i have tons more i can review with you guys just to give you guys a little preview right here um here's a lot more ads that i would love to review with you guys just let me know in the comments below if this is
