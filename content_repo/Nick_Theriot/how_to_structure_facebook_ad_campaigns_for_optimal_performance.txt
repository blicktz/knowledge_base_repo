yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today I'm gonna show you guys the actual ad account structure I use for a lot of my clients and stuff kind of how we structure an ad account and stuff and kind of the pieces behind each campaign and why we set it up so you're probably stuck right now you're probably inside the ad account throwing things around and you're not really sure exactly how to structure things you might have a few random campaign setup you know maybe a CBO $100 a day retargeting campaign and just random things set up of different variants of naming structures it's typically what we see inside of ad accounts we audit and stuff so that's why I'm creating this video for you guys to show you and after this video you're gonna know exactly how to structure your ad account some of the campaigns to create and some of the audiences to go after keep it simplified be a lot easier to run so with that being said before we get started make sure hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos just like this one every Monday Wednesday and Friday let's get started guys okay so we jump my computer right here I kind of got like a little screenshot little setup of what a ad account will typically look like and I know this is probably not what you're used to seeing but I wanted to be able to better illustrate exactly how it looks like actually broken apart so all these boxes that are kind of highlighted those are our specific campaigns we need to create so starting off at a cold audience which is blue because it's cold they're not aware who we are they have no clue it's a completely cold audience first time we actually hit them with an impression so right here this one we have three campaigns we start off with the two light blue ones because that's and then those are light blue because we spend a little less on those what we do with those two right there is exactly what they say we have a creative testing campaign and audience testing campaign and we set these up as a BO so ad set budget optimization with the ad set budget optimization we're creating proven audiences in our creative testing campaign so in our creative testing campaign we have about three to four proven audiences and these will each be in their own ad sets and we like to run these around ten dollars per day and what we do with that creative testing campaign is we test new creatives we put new creatives in those ad sets to test and we stick low budget and we test for three to seven days at a time so that way we can you know really do spend little on testing but also to really figure out which creatives work the best now our audience testing campaign is exactly the same same thing except we flip it around and instead of testing audience I mean instead of testing creatives we test audiences so we take our proven creatives we put them in those ad sets and we set ad sets anywhere from twenty to forty dollars per day kind of depends on the overall budget we'll test anywhere from three to ten new ad sets every single week like I said we like to run for three to seven days and we start plucking out the winners so now you have two campaigns that's gonna be pushing out new creatives once a week we recommend putting new creatives in every week you're always one creative away from hitting that seven figures with your business so get that instilled in your brain consistently every week put a new batches of creatives of one of three new creatives out every single week audience testing campaign testing where from two to ten new audiences every single week and you're gonna start finding winners and that's where the cbo scaling campaign comes from and the cbo scaling is literally best winners of everything so we're gonna take the winning audiences and the win them creatives we're gonna put them all together so you'll have maybe three winning audiences we're gonna create three ad sets inside the cbo campaign and put each one of those audiences in that cbo campaign and in the creative side let's say you have four winning creatives we're gonna put four winning creatives in each ad set so that's how we pretty much create the cbo scaling campaign we'll start off at a hundred dollars per day and then we'll start increasing that budget by maybe twenty percent every few days do not touch the budget in the creative testing campaign or audience testing campaign you want to leave that budget exactly where it's at uh reason why is because we want to limit auction overlap and when you start testing multiple audiences multiple creatives and stuff you start using the same ad set across a few campaigns you start picking up some auction overlap so we'd like to keep it low budget so one we don't want to run into too many auction overlap two we also don't want to blow through budget in our testing campaign we want to do low budget testing to validate different variables and then we can bring it into our cbo skilling campaign now quick little tip make sure you are using exclusions in all of these campaigns literally every single ad account i you know do a consulting call with there's no exclusions in our tofu campaign now why we need to do exclusions is a whole nother like in going through the process of you know getting down further into exclusions a whole nother video but essentially you want to make sure you're hitting cold audiences you do not want to be remarketing to people and we have seen campaigns with no exclusion that's targeting a cold audience start to kind of almost act like remarketing campaigns so you want to make sure you're using exclusions in your campaign exclude all existing customers warm audiences and hot audiences you're retargeting and stuff so once you get your tofu built out your top of funnel you have three campaigns you start pushing these up you're probably anywhere from around 200 to 400 per day in ad spend and you're pushing all that to like said i just you did an iphone right here but this will be like a social media post so you're pushing that traffic to a social media post this is your creatives and stuff and then what's happening is people are going straight to the product page or people are sharing it with their friends they're talking about it they're liking it or they're watching a video maybe it's a video ad you're doing so they're doing two different actions right here they're doing an engagement or they're doing a actual you know what you're intended to do is go straight to the product page so we have two different routes depending on where they go so we're going to start off with the mofu warm retargeting so this again this is a whole nother campaign right here so this is one campaign this is two campaigns this is three campaigns this is campaign number four right here mofu warm remark retargeting i'll probably have about four different ad sets in this particular campaign right here and again you want to do abo you want to start off about ten dollars per day you want to do an ad set for ig engagement 30 days ad set for facebook engagement 30 days an ad set for website visitors 30 days excluding view content make sure you exclude view content and in fact you want to make sure you exclude view content and purchase 30 days on all of these re-targeting mofu audiences specifically for warm retargeting we're gonna have a completely different structure for hot retargeting but you want to make sure you're excluding view content 30 and purchase 30 and all of these and you want to do ig engagement 30 facebook engagement 30 website visitors 30 and 90 or 75 plus video viewers in the last 30 days of all videos so have some fun going through all your videos selecting those and it's really good so inside those four ad sets you're literally going to sum off by ten dollars per day scale them up by 20 every few days depending on how the results are going and then inside of those ad sets you want to put social proof so people reviewing your product testimonials ugc best performing social media posts so if we encourage all of our brands to post daily on social media and the ones that do the best we like to toss them in here and then some of our cold ads so literally taking some tofu ads just putting it in our mofu retargeting and retargeting some of those people because again at this stage all they did was like share or watch a video they didn't even go to our product page they haven't even visit our website yet actually viewed the product yet they've maybe visited a website but haven't viewed the product if that makes sense so these four ad sets right here we literally put the same ads on all of them and then we have our next campaign the mofu reactivation now this one right here this one's literally the same thing except instead of a 30 day it's 180 day for the website visitors and it's a three or i think 180 day as well for the video views but then it's also a 365 for ig engagement and 365 for facebook engagement so this is a far out one we really only do this one for big events sales events new product drops just you know when we're trying to really shoot a big broad message out and we need some more audiences to target we'll go after these reactivation right here but all you're doing is recapturing you know their attention hitting them from a different perspective and sending them over to our product page right here and now we have people everyone at all angles to our product page page and in our product page right here they can either purchase or they don't purchase and we have to do our hot retargeting so this is your next campaign so now you're at one three five six campaigns inside of your ad account right now you have six campaigns with you know a couple assets in this one couple assets in this one couple assets in our bofu hot retargeting you want to create one ad set inside and start off at ten dollars per day and you want to include view content 14 days and add to cart 28 days that's it just one asset with those two because those are two very very hot audiences when essentially we're we're going to do view content 14 days because that means they just view the product add to cart 28 days so if they added to cart as a whole separate audience right there we're going to target them out a little further because they seem to be a little bit more serious about what we're offering to them now inside the bofu hot retargeting we also want to exclude purchases 30 days so that way we don't remarket to any of those people that just purchase now again these people view the product they've not even have added to cart but something is holding them back from purchasing and that's when we need to go to more an objection handling mode and there's a few different ways you can do that you can educate people further on the product maybe it's a complex product on how to use you can educate it you know for clothing brands this is a great time to do like some try-ons videos showing some behind the scenes showing the quality maybe if you have a more complex product really digging deep in finding those objections you can look at some of the comments on social media posts and figure out what's the questions people have around your product and then you can use those specific comments inside of your hot retargeting campaign to kind of like remarket to people now you can also increase the urgency and sometimes increasing urgency is not like hey our sell ends tomorrow our 20% off sale sometime it's pushing some salts in that wound that they have right now so if they're in a lot of pain and your product solves that pain point increase that pain to get them to the sale be very careful with this as you know you don't want to go overboard with it but you want to apply a little pressure to kind of squeeze them and push them into your product and that your products don't solve all their problems again you got to be confident with your product make sure it does all this and you know you want to make sure you you be in ethical with it so next one is objection well increasing trust so increasing trust this could be a ceo video of the ceo talking saying hey you know this is what our brand stands for this is what we do here's a little bit about me you're basically just building a little bit more trust and being the likable character for your brand you can also hire a spokesperson to do this specifically for your brand but i mean look it takes five minutes to do film a quick video to talk about it and there you go and then lastly you can also do a little bit more social proof testimonials and stuff and you still can do a discount if you want honestly we've always did a discount for retargeting but we've been applying more of these specific tactics right here and seeing way way way way better results plus a discount it doesn't make them work for anything so we want to make sure our customers work for stuff before we give them a discount or they'll get used to that and then they're when we actually do a sell we just really can never do it because they're you know already used to getting discounts and stuff like that so it's less effective so if you do everything properly in our bofu hot retargeting campaign we're at what six campaigns now we're at six campaigns in that account and we stick to these six right here we don't create duplicates of these campaigns and stuff we literally stick to these exact campaigns and i think that's one problem a lot of facebook ad people have when i look at ad accounts is they're duplicating shit everywhere they're doing all this crazy stuff and i'm not saying this is the perfect campaign setup you know this in a year from now can change but this one's been the most consistent over the past few years it's been the most consistent when i talk to a lot of other advertisers and stuff and it's still going to be consistent with this new ios 14 update all that good stuff so moving forward this one will be good for the next few months so there's really no need to do any crazy variations of this like here's what works now if we keep it simple we can focus on the main thing and that's creatives marketing and those psychology principles because that's what really drives results with facebook ads and marketing nowadays now once you handle objections all that this bofu hot retargeting all this effectively like i said you have two routes you have people going from the product page straight to the customer uh you have bofu hot retargeting people come back and become a customer so once you get the customer that's great congratulations you got your sale but what can we do to further increase that lifetime value of the customer because one that's part of one of the three ways to increase revenue for business customer acquisition increase revenue increase lifetime value of customers and then increase average order value so we set up a past purchases campaign and it's green because we accomplished our goal we got a customer but now what can we do to these customers how can we push more products on these customers right here get them to purchase more give them to become real brand advocates for the brand and then that way we can continue to you know make more money off of them so this is where we can upsell different products to them maybe your product's more of like a 30 day thing and then you have to purchase more do a refill type campaign for your past purchases figure out different products we can push and push into our existing customers and be mindful of what products you push on them immediately because when you do that then you can be more cognizant of exactly what products you push in front of them because like look if i go purchase an iphone i don't want to run another iphone ad to me because i already purchased one but i can't purchase that i can show off the airpods i can show off the the case i can show off you know even maybe a macbook like you can show off different products in your store that complements your your purchase or for the customer's purchase and that way they'll come i can purchase more and then they're back into the purchase campaign and then more and then over and over and over and this will keep spinning spinning spinning and your lifetime value keeps increasing increasing increasing and you're able to spend a lot more up front right here on acquiring customer because you know your lifetime value is 400 bucks so you're able to spend 100 bucks on a customer acquiring a customer when your first order is only 50 bucks so you can be afford to be unprofitable at the beginning because you're confident in your lifetime value is so much more profitable so just some stuff to think about when you're building a brand but these are the campaigns that we run in our ad accounts and we stick to these right here we don't go out there and try to find new campaigns new ad account structures that that break the algorithm that you know some weird manipulation of algorithms to get these results like we literally just use these campaigns right here inside of our ad accounts i will be breaking down this further inside of elegant ecom which will be my course i'll be releasing towards the end of q2 there'll be more about that and i'll actually break down you know me actually going to ads manager and breaking all this down and further going into these topics right here of you know what to put inside of these campaigns and stuff so hope you guys enjoyed this video i get a lot of questions of how to structure my ad account so this is a good kind of overview of how i view it and then you know how you can actually
