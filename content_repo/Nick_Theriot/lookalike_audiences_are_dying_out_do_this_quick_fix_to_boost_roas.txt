yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have a new video for you guys where we're gonna go in depth of what to do when you find a winning lookalike audience and how to further expand on it to help prevent burnout of that lookalike audience before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this video let's get started guys okay so a lot of time after we find a winning lookalike audience we'll start to scale it up you know we'll start increasing the budget and stuff on it and then over time we'll start to see the romance drop now obviously we can introduce some new creatives and stuff but also what happens is we run out of people in that lookalike audience to target so usually a lookalike audience one percent USA we'll see like you know 2.1 million people for example and out of that 2.1 million people we probably only have like three percent that we actually will purchase our product right away right now and is what we need if we're going to do some purchase conversion campaigns but what happens when ROAS drops again you can introduce new creatives or what a lot of people do is they start testing more lookalike audiences so they see that hey a purchase seven day lookalike audience works great let's start testing more lookalike audiences so let's do initiate checkout let's do add to cart let's do website visitors and then there are like five or six different lookalike audiences all in like their testing campaign which is okay if it's in your testing campaign but what you'll see is ROAS really doesn't improve at all on your your first one or on any of them and you'll actually start to see maybe a little bit of performance drop and the reason why is due to a thing called audience overlap now you have to understand guys when you're running a purchase seven day audience you know a lookalike audience one percent USA and you do a initiate checkout seven day audience one percent USA and then it adds a cart seven day audience one percent USA they're actually not that different you know you would think okay well yeah one's full of ads carts one's full of initiate checkouts one's full of purchases obviously it's gonna be pretty different but in reality it's not that different and we just gone through this with another ad account where we started to scale up on one particular audience so I was like let me do both let's let's test a few variety of audiences and then let's also test going vertical so going vertical with a lookalike audiences instead of just keeping that purchase seven day one percent you start to test one to two percent three to four percent five to six percent and you're expanding the people inside of your lookalike audiences you're reaching new people so when you do it the first way of just testing more lookalike audiences you run to audience overlap and I'll show you in a second again what audience overlap looks like and what that does is it just means you're reaching the same people it's just a different name for the lookalike audience so purchase seven day initiate checkout seven day both look like one percent USA are likely probably not like a audience overlap like 60 percent and we'd like to keep that under 30 percent so let's hop in the ads manager I'm going to show you exactly what I'm talking about because I know that might be a little hard to kind of grasp and stuff but I'm gonna show you exactly what I'm talking about with one ad account we're working on right now so inside this ad account right here you'll see that we have a purchase seven day audience right here I'm looking the last seven days of data lifetime this audience right here has absolutely crushed it for us but what happened was over the last seven days we've seen results drop down and we needed to either a new creatives or b new audiences reach new people that haven't seen our ads before so that way the creative that we're using right now yes it fatigued in that audience but can we put that creative in a new audience that a new set of eyes that hasn't seen it before and will it respond well so that's exactly what we did and we tested a one to two percent purchase seven days and we seen a 2.1 x roas this brand has a break even around 1.6 1.7 so we're you know pretty good in the clear right there and it gets to this top of funnel so all we're trying to do is break even at the minimum so that's what we did and we've seen a good increase in results and stuff and it's exactly what we wanted we wanted just a new set of eyes and increase it now what I also did just for fun I am starting to test some new look like audiences just to see if any of them will perform better just slightly just better but also to get to keep in mind I don't want to start testing a bunch and fall in the loop of continuously testing look like audiences and continuously running one percent I know I need to go vertical as we scale to reach new people so if we go inside of the audiences right here and inside the audiences you actually have a really cool tool where you can see this audience overlap so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a purchased 180 days audience right here and I'm gonna grab a let's say 10% of website visitors last 180 days so this is the top 10% of website visitors are on our website and I'm gonna click right here and I'm gonna go to show audience overlap and you can see right here we have a 56% audience overlap between these two right here the selected audience and the comparison audience and the problem is I said anything below 30 we're nearly double that 30% so if I run ads I spend money you know purchase 180 day audience right here then the problem here is we're gonna reach 56% of those people of another ad set so now you have two ad sets fighting with like a 50% 56% overlap and due to the 2.1 million people inside that look like audience 3% of those people ready to buy I highly suggest that 3% of these 1.2 million people overlap are the 3% that are in both of those ad sets which will increase CPM's because we're essentially bidding against ourselves two we're going to pay more per purchase three we're diluting our money across multiple look-alike audiences that all share a similar audience overlap which is gonna drop results and you just keep on this train right here testing and testing and testing and just you'll never have that initial outbreak like you want it so instead what we do is we go vertical we're gonna start expanding we're gonna start going higher we're gonna start going to one to two percent now we're gonna start going to two to three percent and we're gonna reach a fresh batch of new people that first time we're gonna see those creatives and it's gonna give us the algorithm more people to go after so going back inside the ads manager we'll show you right here that's exactly what I did I started going vertical I went one to two percent I went two to three I went all the way up to ten percent because I know that a we have a well-optimized pixel two we need to test more and I didn't want to go and just put all my eggs in one basket for one to two percent so I went and tested all of them and I've got a few winners and that's exactly what I want it's okay to have a few failures I just needed one or two winning audiences and that's kind of what we did right here so if you look we see I tested all the purchase seven days that worked really well and we had a one to two percent that performed really well and we had a four to five percent perform really well I know it's weird I know it's not just straight up okay one to two percent work should work really well since the one percent burn up so you know there's no reason to test all of them but that's the problem that's one of the keys and concepts of working really well with Facebook ads is test everything to really improve results so that's what we did and obviously we have two winners so now I want to continuously focus on these and then again I'm going to test these more but I do want to have one or two look like audiences also two I'm testing on the side because yes they might have a little bit of audience overlap but in some cases we do see a little bit better performance I just want to try to warn you guys don't fall down this cycle of continuously testing one percent look like audiences and stuff because you just the simple tweak of testing a going a little bit higher expanding out of just a one percent as we're going to start to see much different results we've seen this with an ad account before where I just kept on running one percent one percent and it got to the point where all the look like audiences didn't work and because we ran it so long we spent so much money on it everyone's just diluted and fatigued in there we tested new creatives and nothing which need we need a fresh new group of people some fresh new data so then we jumped up one to two percent three to fours etc and seen a big rush in results because we start reaching new people that look just like our you know current people right now that we're going after and it was just like getting that initial rush to get new results so I only recommend this to people who are spending you know a few hundred bucks a day that have been scaling for a period of time if you just start running facebook ads you launch a lookalike audience it performs well for three days then dies out it's likely that you didn't burn out all those people it's more along the lines of you probably just not doing something right which you're targeting your creative and your offer and stuff so this is only going to be applicable to certain people I just had this exact conversation with another one of my consulting clients and they run into the same issue they had five lookalike audiences that all had huge audience overlap they had one particular one that was performing very well compared to all the other and he wants to know how he scaled if we need to do more look like audiences like no you need to go vertical on the one that's working extremely well so I recommend you guys try this out let me know in the comments below if this helps you out in any way so closing out if you're an e-com business owner you're spending
