yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terry and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today we're gonna ask the big question can you spend ten thousand dollars per day profitably on facebook ads in 2022 and the answer is yes and i have an exciting new case study to show you guys for an account that i gave y'all an update on probably about a month and a half ago where we finally hit like 5k or 10k a day and since then we're still been spending 10k a day every day profitably so i want to show you guys exactly everything behind kind of like the scenes show you guys what we did and everything and how we're still crushing it for this particular client so before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit the subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday that being said let's dive into it so spending ten thousand dollars per day profitably on facebook ads in 2022 is it possible yes so here's just showing you guys the ad accounts we literally have four campaigns running that we're actively spending money on spent last month um totally spent last month i mean it's gonna be just under 350 000 that we spent and this client was very profitable um their cost per lead objective is 34 or less and that's gonna put them at like a little over a 5x for us and they hit i think like a 30 cost per lead at the end of the month um looking at their you know their overall like back-end reporting not facebook because facebook is facebook is reporting about 80 of the results we're actually seeing on the reporting and facebook's reporting about 80 percent less or 10 10 to 15 percent less than what's overall so for example we might see 100 leads in the back end and facebook report like 85 90 leads so just going into it so our main campaign that we're pushing our budget behind is tofu rural this is a very complex business and they cannot advertise in certain states so our tofu rural um is consists of a certain amount of states like that we can advertise usa states that might be different if you're like a different country i think they call it regions or something like that but basically a state and then we also have specific verbiage we have to use for other states like wyoming and florida so that's why they're in separate campaigns because we only want to advertise to those states with a specific type of like language and copywriting so just give you a little backstory in the accounts jumping into our main tofu rural where we spent i think roughly like i said like 300 something thousand dollars last month we did primary spin uh on broad 243 000 on broad you can see hdb2 and then we also did have a new broad ad set i launched literally like a day last day of april um and that was hdb6 reason why is because we can't advertise in two states as effectively as like may 1st so i have to remove those states and basically i just created a new ad set when i removed those states because i don't want to like make that like drastic of a change inside of um you know i mean broad ad set now i we did run interest and look likes for a small portion of the time and this is something really really interesting right here i want to show you guys okay so we ran interest and look likes um look likes was basically just like a 30 day of everything 30 day leads looked like 30 days website visitors like all that fun stuff and then interest is basically there's a particular interest we use like rural interest that we leveraged yeah and both the interest and look likes limited the audience i think it was like five to ten million dollars ten million people in each one of those whereas our broad is like 35 40 million people so we did have a smaller audience now what did i say before look likes and interests severely limit your capabilities of reaching people because if only a small portion of your people are inside that look likes and interest obviously at the beginning low levels of spin it's going to look a lot better but at high levels of spin it's the cost is going to go up way higher than than our broad so you see our broad right here we spent two ten times more with a two dollar more cost per lead whereas that look likes and interest they only spent about 26 21 and you see already they're like only two dollars below now what basically if we would spend that same amount on those look likes or interest we'd see a much much higher cost per lead because audiences are smaller audience pool smaller spending a big budget it's like basically me giving you a 16 ounce cup and then you have a gallon of water you gotta pour into it okay and you cannot overflow one bit overflow is higher cost per results so you go pour a gallon of water a 16 ounce cup that's basically the the effect of what you're gonna see right there where reason why we go to broad and we get rid of like look likes and interest now if you have a gallon water and you have five gallon bucket and i say you can't overflow one bit will you have any problem at all with overflowing no you get a gallon going into five gallon bucket you're good so that's the same thing we brought right here we have a big budget we have a lot of people can target and we have some really great ads so we can just let it roll now going further um below you can see this is just basically what we're doing is we're finding top ads from our creative testing campaign and we're dropping in into our main main creative testing our main main ad sets and then we're just yeah we're turning them off as they don't perform anymore i think our kpi objective is like 34 and we're cutting leads or cutting ads off if they spend like i think like 100 200 bucks and if they spent um you know they have like a higher cost really like 40 bucks so that's just it we're dropping our high performers turning them off as they don't perform and letting budget go to some of our newer stuff and best performing stuff this is looking at everything from a creative testing level just looking at our different batches of ads um as you can see right there you can clearly see the winners there and you can also clearly see the stuff that's just not as hot uh so if you look at like batch 28 and you look at batch 19 this is the reason why we test everything on broad because when you find those really good ads like you see like batch 19 17 cost per lead batch 28 34 cost per lead now i know from a simple fact here which one can i put a few few hundred thousand behind versus one that's hey it's if it's borderline at your kpi at creative testing a low budget creative testing then it's not going to be good at scale because again 34 we know that performance is going to go up like we know cost per leads are going to go up as we spend more behind it so creative testing you want to see stuff that looks really good not stuff that looks baseline or borderline bad so that's a really big thing right there and it's the same thing for e-com same thing for app install same thing for webinars whatever you're running it's the same thing we do this in all of our accounts upload a few case studies now and they all do this so but yeah so other actions we took uh we're doing a lot of audience research so we're spending like an hour a week in that account the other hours six seven hours a week for each client we spend on um we're doing audience research uh we're scripting out and creating new ads and then we're writing copy so for this particular client because of what we sell is more of like a membership we use a lot of raw footage and it's like there's nothing physical about this particular service that we're getting leads for so we're doing a lot of like raw footage just a lot of different edits and stuff like that i'm telling stories with literally raw footage from like shutterstock yeah so um a lot of different copyright testing we're digging really deep in the audience research and so again and like i've said this before audience research and people are like oh well uh why do i need to do audience research if i'm just going broad well you're missing the whole freaking point here audience research is about really understanding the desires the marketing the market momentum what they like what they love what they hate yada yada yada all their pain points and stuff like that so that way you can create some really compelling ads that use all that information essentially against them that way so that's why we do a lot of audience research so that we can find new angles or different desires and stuff like that that we haven't hit yet so works pretty good then obviously just scripting out the creation of the ads leveraging storyboards something like that um you know writing copy very simple have a copywriter go out there and create some new variations of ad copy all that fun stuff right there that's other actions we're taking to improve performance um but yeah i think it's just really cool give you guys a little update um like i made a video like this i think back in february where we're close to ten thousand dollars and then basically march and april we consistently spent ten thousand dollars per day and then this month i think we're gonna go even higher so we're really trying to see where that limits at definitely the biggest bottleneck we're seeing is like spending ten thousand dollars a month you can create three four new ads a month that are all winners whereas like we need to find three to four ads every week so when you're spending more things just happen a lot faster you can find winning ads faster you can test up faster but also to your things are gonna fatigue faster so like it's a good and bad when you when you don't have a lot to spend you take more time to find winning ads and you have a little bit less pressure on your team but when you're spending a lot you have a lot more pressure on your team create new ads every single week that converts so like that's a big thing right there like probably my biggest lesson when like spending more so yeah guys thank you all so much for watching this video make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button
