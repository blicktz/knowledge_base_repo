I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's good YouTube? Welcome back to the channel Currently right now, I am doing a little bit of planning I already took a scoop of pre-workouts So I am getting jittery as hell If you know what I mean And we're gonna be jumping into a chest in a few minutes Just got off my first call for today Just got off my first call for today It was pretty much just like an hour and a half Training call for one of my team members And really went over and dive deep into some of the metrics of e-commerce This particular team member is amazing at creatives Ad copy You know, kind of structure of the creative side of Facebook ads But she's still kind of learning the whole aspects of the targeting Excluding audiences When to kill When to scale Different campaigns and stuff More of the campaign management side Which I'm pretty good at For all the metrics and stuff So just finished that Now I'm about to go ahead and record some video pitches For the agency Approach with the content strategy For your brand And you're absolutely crushing it on Instagram With followers and stuff So you're doing really good with that So jumping into today's main topic I wanted to talk about four things That I recommend having And understanding Before you start your diet Or when you start your diet Or if you're already in a diet right now Maybe get these in order To better enhance your results Number one is Have a diet plan that you can stick to I can't tell you how important this is For me, it's always been tracking macros If keto works really well for you Go with keto If doing carb cycling works really good for you Go with that But for me, it's always been tracking macros I like the consistency of knowing What I get every single day Secondly, I like the ability To be able to fill my macros With the foods I choose I focus on healthy foods But I do have my days Where today I'm going to do Frozen yogurt later today Still fits with my macro range Just frozen yogurt though To fill up some of my carbs I've always gotten really good results With tracking macros And me personally I don't really want to do keto Because I don't want to get rid of carbs I don't want to do carb cycling Because I don't want to do A very low carb day Then followed by a high carb day It's hard to plan on meals for all that So me personally I like the consistency And the stability of tracking macros Test each one That catches your eye Figure out which one works best for you And stick with it Now the next thing I think That's strongly recommended For if you're going to be doing Any type of diet Is knowing when the diet will end I made this mistake back in 2017 When I did my very first Diet cut down shred And I didn't set an end goal I just kept saying I'm going to do it Until I'm shredded enough And what this caused me to do Is I didn't take the diet As serious Because I didn't have a specific date in mind So it didn't give me any pressure To be shredded for a certain time And what that did to me mentally Was I just kept having more cheat meals I kept getting off my diet More frequently I wasn't working as hard But last year in 2019 I set a goal I was like look July 4th Or July No it wasn't July 4th It was like June 28th I was like Hey I need to be shredded for this date So I started off with the expectations Of working really hard Because I didn't want to You know If I hit that At that date That was the end point I wasn't going to continue my diet At all Regardless of how it looks So I needed to work hard To make sure I hit my goals So you need to make sure You have an end in date Some people who You know Maybe it's your first few times Maybe you can't really set a clear End in date My recommendation is starting off If you're not that overweight Maybe you just need to lose About 20 pounds Three months Maybe if you need to lose more 20, 40 Maybe even 50 to 100 Maybe six months Maybe you need to go on A longer term diet So you need to kind of Do a little bit of research And figure out What's a good time for you And also too Of how you want to look for all Because that's going to Drastically change Of when you need to end You know To be honest I have a three month mark Right now For this cut Because I want to lose Very slowly So I can keep my calories Really high So that way I lose less muscle But honestly I could probably just be In and out In about a month And lose 10 pounds Real quick Maybe even two months With some extra cardio And stuff like that So you need to know What date you're ending Coming outside With the pup Chilling You know You can see her See her right there But number three On my list Is you need to have A designated date For your cheat meals Now Some people Some diet Some coaches Try to like Encourage you not to do A cheat meal For a really long time I'd encourage that too If you can go two weeks Without a cheat meal Go for it Me personally I just do not have The mental energy To do a cheat meal Every two weeks Even three weeks Or even four weeks I like to do one a week That just gives me The best boost In terms of Look If I get one a week What it allows me to do Is I can save up All week Like oh Monday I really wanted those Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A tenders Or Chick-fil-A fries If I can push that All back to say Friday Maybe even Saturday And Saturday I just have my Two hour Or my one hour Block to eat Whatever I want I'm going to pick up My Chick-fil-A Pick up some candy Pick up some ice cream You know whatever I give myself one hour I do a full on cheat meal Some people like to do A carb increase that day Like cheat meals One a week One every seven days Is what I do So I try to do like Every Saturday That's the perfect one for me Just because Sunday I'm just lazy all day And it's hard for me To even get my calories In that day Saturday I'm usually out About Doing stuff with friends Doing stuff with family Etc And I can fit it in better Maybe if we're going To eat out that day Or something like that So generally Between Friday and Sunday I would say I would do a cheat meal And like I said I do one every week And make sure you have A plan in place For your cheat meals Because you know You don't want to go Like alright 90 days without it Be struggling Killing yourself over it And then one day You just blow up And have a full on cheat day Maybe even cheat days Then you get stuck And not figuring out How to get back on track So there you go Have a cheat meal in place Also to make sure At least 7 to 10 days I guess you could say Before a cheat meal I know one time Back in 2017 I was doing every 4 days Every 5 days I was basically doing A 3 day split And then I would do Like 3 days on 1 day off And then my off day I would do my cheat meal Then go back 3 days on 1 day off Cheap meal So make sure you're doing At least 7 to 10 days out That's what at least From my experience Has worked best for me But you're more than welcome To test that out Gotta say guys Coming outside And actually taking care Of some work Is a game changer Currently uploading my Video pitches Getting those sent out And as well as Touching up on a few Other LinkedIn tasks For the agency And then we've got About an hour left Of this work block And it's been going Pretty smooth today And really enjoying it And then we're gonna Go over to my Girlfriend's house later So Let y'all see the doggy Ari Hey girl Hey girl Hi I'm gonna jump up here It's too bad Alrighty guys I am currently Heading over to My girlfriend's house Right now And I wanted to Bring y'all Topic number 4 This is the last topic Of like my 4 key pieces Of a diet And actually I could have added Another one And that's number 5 Or it could be number 5 And that's just having A good training program And stuff I'm assuming You already have Your training in check Number 4 though Is your why Why are you Doing this I know My previous Two Diets and stuff I Literally started Right after getting Out of bad Relationships Or Relationships So You know Obviously Get over a heartbreak And stuff You know You wanna change Yourself up You wanna improve Yourself And I'm sorry For the shaking I'm on a bumpy Ash road right now You wanna improve Yourself So I had a little Bit more motivation Stuff like Oh you know Fuck that I'm changing myself Getting everything Back on track This time Is a lot different When I'm doing This diet This year Because I am Perfectly happy Going into it And it actually Brings a little more Challenges Because I'm like Oh you know I'm happy You know I don't have as much Motivation to stick to it Because like I'm happy with the way My body looks right now And I'm also happy In general With business I'm happy in general With my girlfriend I have now I'm happy all over And going into this diet Now is actually Gonna be a little bit More tougher Because when it Starts to get down To those final moments When I really Be strict down Like I can't go eat froyo Like I'm eating tonight On the fancy macros And you know It's gonna It's gonna be a little different So overall though Why am I doing this though Is because I want to Again I want to Still I want to Improve myself I want to challenge myself I want to sculpt my body up I want to Bring a really good body For summer I still think Summer's happening Even though The economy's Kind of shut down right now I still think After the 90s That it's gonna be Moving at least Some way forward To where we can do Those types of things again So I want to be prepared I want to Just overall I love the challenge of it I think it's my favorite part I love improving myself Seeing that drastic change Looking your best So that's why I'm doing it So have your why Clearly laid out Why you are Doing your diet Because every time During those hardships You need something To fall back on And if it's just Because you want Rock chiseled ab Dude look Bros Guys You can do Whatever the fuck You want For your why If your why Is clearly Because at the end Of the cut You're going To the beach And you want Girls to look at you Because you have abs Or you're shredded Go for it That's your why Go for it Is it because You want to look Like these models On Instagram That's shredded And stuff Go for it Whatever you want Your why is Don't let someone Tell you Because that's superficial Or something like that Like oh that's not It needs to be Something like Oh I want to Improve myself You know what Go for whatever Why you want Whatever motivates Whatever drives you Go for it And that's going To keep you motivated Through your cut And stuff Just have some Realistic expectations So you know You don't want to Go through the whole diet If that's your motivation Is to get girls Looking at you Or vice versa If you're a girl Watching this And you want to Get shredded for summer And vice versa Obviously for me I don't care I just got a girlfriend now Even if it's just Hey I want to get Straight up my girlfriend To look better for Then cool Go for that Don't let anyone Tell you that's like Superficial
