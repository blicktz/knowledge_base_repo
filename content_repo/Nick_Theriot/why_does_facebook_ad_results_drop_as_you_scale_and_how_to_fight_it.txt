Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys.

Today we'll be discussing why does Facebook ad results drop as you scale? So this is something that I've always wondered as well. And I've gotten a few different examples of why this happens.

And then one particular buddy of mine, his name is Tyler Gorner, amazing media buy and everything. He kind of explained this to me. I was like, wow, that makes a lot of sense.

So Tyler, if you're watching this video, thank you so much for explaining this to me and everything of how this works. Full credits to you, man. But I'm hopefully going to bring some light to the YouTube channel and show you guys exactly how this is, you know, how this works.

So before we get started, make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Guys, let's hop into it. So why does Facebook ad results drop?

As you scale, you know, you probably start off with some $5, maybe $10 ad sets for some of you guys. Then I have some median people that's probably in the $100 to $500 range. And then you have people that like I deserve from like my clients and stuff are spending $1,000 to $22,000 per day in ads.

And, you know, at these different levels, there's all this kind of same thing applies to what I'm going to be showing you today. But a lot of people watching this video are probably spending $5 to $10 per day per ad set. And with that, let's let me show you a few things real quick.

So first things first, let's just hop into a scenario right now. And let's say every day you wake up and I give you a $5 bill. And with that $5 bill, you have to find me a $5 item every single day.

So wake up. Hey, here's a $5 bill. Now go find me a $5 item.

And before you go to sleep, you have to give me that $5 item. Now, the next thing that $5 item can never be the same. Has to be a new $5 item every day.

So that's how it's happened. And if we did that, this is what it would look like. That's one item per day.

Easy. I mean, you could wake up. Cool.

Here's Pepsi soda. $4.50. Day number one.

Day number two. Jack Link's beef jerky five count. Multi-pack bags.

$5. Here you go, Nick. Cool.

Easy. Easy. Like, very easy job.

You could get that done with no issues at all. But now, all of a sudden, we changed that game. Now, I'm going to give you a $100 bill every day you wake up.

And you have to go find me $5 items still. But you have to find me 20 items to spend that full $100. So now, all of a sudden, you went from one item per day to 20 items per day.

And again, those 20 items per day, none of them can be the same. They all have to be different. So if you look at that, that's 20 items per day.

So day one. Okay. All of a sudden.

All right. Let's see. We've got a knife right here.

Credit card thing. We got some black disposable masks. But now, you're struggling to find $5 items.

I literally struggled just for this presentation right here to find $5 items. So now, what's going to happen is, is you're going to start finding some higher priced items. So now, you might have some more $10 items in there.

You might have some more $30 items in there. Especially if you're doing this every single day. Because that's 20 items every day.

You have to find. All unique. Never can be the same.

Ever. So now, the likelihood of higher priced items increase. Which, in our case, as a media buyer, an increase in our cost per action equals bad ROAS or lower ROAS.

So now, you understand how Facebook operates. Facebook, we give it $20 a day. It goes find a few $5 items.

Let's say your target CPA is $5. You spend $20. That's four items every day.

Facebook has to find you. Now, instead of items, that's people. And unique people every time.

Because they can never, you know, one person won't purchase from you every single day. It's just not the case. Unless you're a coffee shop.

So, with that being said, Facebook has to go find a new person every time to purchase these products. Unique people never can be the same. And your target CPA is $5.

Spending $20 a day, it has to find four unique people every day. You spend $100 a day. Now, it has to find 20 unique people every day.

Every single day. And guess what? It's not always going to be perfect $5 per person.

It has some $10 items, some $15 items, some $20 items. Some lower ROAS result days. So, Nick, if that's the case, how do you actually combat this?

Like, is this just like in a reality? And as you spend more, the lower results you are going to get? Partially true.

Not going to lie. A lot of brands I work with, if we can't give them an amazing ROAS at $100, $200, $300 a day, us spending $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 a day, maybe even $10,000, $20,000 a day, it's not going to happen. Because as you spend more, you're going to accept the lower ROAS.

So, right now, you might be spending $100 a day and get a 2X. To get to $1,000 today, there's no way you'd be at a 2X. You'd be at like a 1X.

And that's why, again, brands we're working with, we're spending $500 to $1,000 a day. I would like to see at least a 3 to 4X ROAS. Because as you scale, at scale, let's say it's spending $10,000 a day, we're only going to see like a 2X ROAS.

Maybe $50,000 a day. We're going to see a 1X ROAS. And it's hard for every brand to like have a general rule of thumb.

Because some products, very broad, it can scale up really easily. Some products are very niche. It's very hard for Facebook to find people.

So, once you start to scale, all you're doing is burning your ROAS up. So, it's different for every brand. But it's kind of like a teeter-totter.

You know, like, you know, your spin might be low and your ROAS might be high. And then all of a sudden, you pump up spin and your ROAS drops. So, you try to find that median that's maybe just a little bit more spin than ROAS.

So, you can keep growing it, you know, week over week, month over month, year over year. So, with that being said, how do you actually combat this? One, it's just having a product people love.

Really good product. Really great reviews. All that good stuff.

Also, two, going after a big enough market. Number three, testing a lot of different ad angles. So, where you can, you know, have like four or five different reasons why people buy a product.

You know, this might be the perfect gift for someone. For someone else, this might be a unique piece on their wall. For someone else, this is the greatest outfit ever.

So, you know, and for the other person, this is the, they like to be expensive, luxurious, etc. So, testing different angles and for your product consistently. Scaling up the winners works really well.

Now, the next thing is having really good creatives. So, for clothing, I know a lot of brands, a lot of clothing brands, you know, that appeal to a very large demographic. You know, men, women, different age groups, different ethnicities, different body types.

They've been able to scale really big because they appeal to a lot of people. So, it's all about getting your stuff, your creatives and your angle for how you promote those products to appeal to a larger demographic. More, more people will see this.

More people will be appealed to it. More people will purchase. More money you can spend.

If that helps you out with this question. Why do Facebook ad results drop as you scale? So, I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

And, you know, hopefully just kind of explain everything because I know once I first kind of dove into this, at first I didn't understand either. But now I do. And now I'm thinking, okay, I understand what we need to do.

We either need better creatives, more demographics in our creatives, and then also to more angles that appeal to a lot more people. You know, maybe there's an angle we're not using yet that really kind of unlocks a whole new spectrum to our particular products. So, if you're an e-com business owner and you're doing 25 to 50k a month right now in revenue and you're trying to hit 100k a month and you don't really know how to get there.
