What's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. It's currently like in the morning right now.

I really just kind of woke up so excuse the... And I got an interesting story about this too. So basically what happened was last night, went to trim up my beard like I always do.

I put my guard on, my clippers, going up like that, the guard falls off. I just wasn't paying attention to it, but it was too late. And just no guard through my beard.

So I just had this like beard, whole big bald spot beard. So I tried blending it in with like a smaller guard just to leave something and just looked way too patchy. So I was like, all right, whatever.

I just had to leave something because yeah. So let me know what you guys think. Rocking the stash now.

I'm not going to lie guys. Today has been kind of I think like the first day that I just kind of woke up. In like a mood.

I think it's starting to kind of finally like, I don't know. I'm just in that like very like shitty mood. When you wake up and it's like...

So good news is I actually got the vlog done. And also I got a bunch of day-to-day operations I do for the digital agency done. So I got all the, I guess you could say, work I do every single day.

The repetitive tasks done for today, which is a great start for the morning. Now we're going to let that render out and stuff. And I was going to jump into a workout, but we do need to do one more thing before we jump into a workout.

Phoenix left a nice little meatball in his cage last night. So I'm going to go ahead and clean that out. And just let you guys watch that.

And then we're going to jump into, oh and I got to put my clothes watching. Then we're going to jump into a nice little back day. So before I actually clean his cage, I do need to actually, this is like temporary holding cell.

I do need to make some air holes in this because I'm just waiting for a bunch of people to comment on it. If I put them in here without it, they're going to freak out. He won't be in there long, like literally five minutes.

And he's going to be back in there. So I'm not worried about it. But let's go make some holes.

What's going on, dude? What's up, girl? Alright, that is much better.

Trying to make sure you guys can see as much as you can. But simply what I'm going to do is take them out, put them in there, then scoop out his meatball. And then after that, kind of just move around the mulch and stuff.

Here he is, guys. Say hi to the camera, Phoenix. He does not like the camera so far.

So, like I said, Phoenix is my kingstake. He is two years old. He is chilling.

So I'm going to go ahead and put him in his little enclosure. Just to show you guys, like I simply just kind of messed up the mulch and stuff. And all that does is kind of like breaks down his burrows and stuff he made.

So that way when he gets back inside of his cage, he's kind of like, ooh, it's all fresh. It's new. And it just keeps him busy.

Okay. One more look out of guys. I'm going to show you guys.

Go ahead and put his light back on. This is simply just a like cheap little shroud thing from Lowe's. And it's literally just an LED bulb.

It's a black light. It's honestly just a light. It's not.

He has a heating pad in there already. And he's pretty comfortable in there already. So I don't need another heat source.

And he's showing no real signs of bad habits. So that's all it is. Just for show.

Looks pretty cool. I like it. Alrighty guys.

Welcome to the main topic of this video. And I got some like background footage of me doing the back day going on. It was a pretty good like back day.

But you'll see why it's kind of like cut it short towards the end of this commentary. But yeah. Today was definitely weird.

Start to the day. I definitely was very like down when I woke up. Just like when I woke up.

Like it was just like. You know. I got my sleep I needed and stuff.

I went to bed. I haven't been setting an alarm. So I just woke up naturally.

And I just like just felt this immense pressure on me. And I just wanted to honestly stay in bed. I didn't want to get out of bed.

I wanted to just stare at the ceiling. And just very down and dark in my head today. And to be honest.

Like you know. I don't know if it's just the pressure of all this like pandemic and stuff that's going on. It's just it's finally getting to me.

Because I haven't really had too many bad days with it. I think you know. Right when it was announced that all the closures and happening.

I kind of got down for like a day or two. And then like today was like the first time. So like in a week and a half.

Almost two weeks since I've been down. But yeah. Like I just I didn't want to get up.

I didn't want to edit my vlog. Like it's all pointless. You know.

I didn't want to do my daily sales activities for Terra Solutions. I didn't want to do anything. I wanted to stay in bed.

I wanted to stare at the ceiling. And just sit there and do nothing. But I ended up still getting up.

You know. I've spent a lot of time working on my mindset. I spent a lot of time.

I spent two years. Three years. Since I started this entrepreneurial journey.

And learned about how the mindset is the king. If you can fix your mindset. You can accomplish anything in your life.

And I was really. All that training has been put to the test. And I say training.

Like I've been through all these programs. No. I just I've read a lot of books on it.

And a lot of practical actually experience of going through things. And getting over. Overcoming things.

And that was put to test this morning. Because no matter how amazing your mindset is. You're going to be approached by these thoughts.

And it's all temptations. And it's you know even the best people. Good.

Really good people. Every day still get temptations in front of them. And it's whether you indulge in those temptations.

Or you steer away from them. And that's where I was today. And I had these thoughts.

I accepted. I had these thoughts. And I had two options laying out in front of me.

Do I. Allow these thoughts to. Overcome me.

To. Pull me back into bed. To sit in bed all day.

Depressed. And. Upset with myself.

Or. Do I get up. Regardless.

Whether. I want to actually do these things. Like.

Nothing in me wanted to do these things. I still got up. I forced myself.

I did not let my body. Win. I did not let my mind.

Overcome me. And. I did these things.

And through actually going through them. I felt amazing. Just after editing my vlog.

And started. And over. And doing the sales activities.

Retail solutions. I felt amazing. Like.

I. I just. I stepped back into.

My mindset. I felt good. I felt.

Just accomplishing little things. Repetitively. In the morning.

Puts you on the track. For a good day. Because.

It's those little wins. That just build up. To make.

Overall. Good day. And.

That's how I felt this morning. And right now. I feel really good.

Compared to this morning. And the only difference was. I pushed myself through it.

Versus just allowing it to. Overcome me. And force me.

Back in bed. And if I were to stay in bed today. I'd still be in bed right now.

So I've been a few hours now. Editing this video. I'd still be in bed right now.

Watching Netflix. Goofing off on YouTube. Or stuff like that.

But instead. I got up. I showed up.

And still did the things. I didn't want to do. And now I feel.

Hell out better. Because I forced myself. To go through things.

And that's something that. You will have to do. And.

Some people are like. Oh you shouldn't have to force yourself. To do things.

Well. You know what. Life is not perfect.

And these are all good things. For me. That I just need to.

You know. Get over myself. Because I'm being a little lazy.

And depressed. And I'm a lot happier. Because I did those things.

First if I wouldn't have. And then. It would have all compounded.

To be worse. So yeah guys. Hope you guys enjoyed this little workout.

Hope you enjoyed this little commentary. And we'll hop right back into the video. Now.

Hope you guys enjoyed that little workout. The only thing else I didn't get to do. Is.

Just some dumbbell deadlifts. But. It's currently 11.

155. And. And.

I completely forgot. I have a meeting at 12 o'clock. It's just a zoom call.

With a. Discovery call. For a prospect.

I don't even know. If they're going to be here. An actual client or not.

But. Go jump into that real quick. Be about 30 minutes.

And. I may do. Some type of.

Cardio after. I'm not really sure. What I'm going to do after that.

But. Stay tuned. Workout.

Home workout. And. Enjoying my quarantine.

How about you man? I'm doing alright. Oh cool.

I'm going to show my video on TV. Because. I also have the hat on.

I do have. I do have pants on and everything. Because I know some people.

They'll literally like. Put a dress shirt on. And like.

Be in their boxers. While going home meetings. I do too.

I have a little makeshift stand up desk. Here at my girlfriend's place. So.

Nice. Nice. Thanks for waking up.

Alright. Video. Just finished processing.

This is the. Zoom recording call. So what I do is.

Every time I have a meeting. I always. Record the zoom call.

And then send it to. The. Callee.

Whoever I was talking to. If. Depending on the call.

Um. A recap. That whole meeting.

So. And also too. Just send him a bunch of information.

I did also. Through this call. Come up with.

Three. Different. Like sheets.

I need to. Create. Google Docs.

Uh. Just. I find myself repeating.

A lot of stuff. So I'm like. If I repeat it too often.

That means. I need to create a system. To automate that.

And there's three. Key things. That I need to.

Put in a sheet. And that way. I can give to people.

After the call. Or maybe just forward it to people. In the early stages.

So. Now. Uh.

Again. I didn't get to finish. My workout.

So now. I want to go real quick. And just do a little bit of boxing.

I'm going to take you guys with me. And kind of show you guys. A little bit of my boxing routine.

Alright guys. Blake. Please.

Like. Look. It's not as though.

I'm shredding right now. But like. Um.

I know. I wrap my hands. Before punching a bag.

Just because. I like the confidence. To be able to throw a punch.

Without worrying about. Fucking up my hand. Basically.

I know some people don't. And especially. I mean.

I'm a hobby boxer. I wouldn't call myself. And any.

I don't even want to call myself. Intermediate. Just because.

Like I said. I do this. I'm completely taught myself.

I just hit the bag. That's it. So.

Um. I'm not looking to 1v1 anyone. Catch me on that water zone though.

If you know what I mean. If you want a 1v1. At all.

But. Generally right now. Is.

You know. I'm just kind of warming up. I'll usually start off.

I normally do a routine. And it's basically like. 30 seconds.

Of combinations. 30 seconds. Of just.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

Like just keeping your arms moving. And then 30 seconds. Of.

Like knockout hits. So we're just on. 1v2.

And then your 2v1 is your hardest hit you can. Um. Like your knockout.

Basically your finisher. And. I normally.

So that's. Like around right there. 30 seconds.

30 seconds. 30 seconds. So it's 90 seconds long.

And I usually do 3 of those. With interval timer. And then.

That's 1 session. And I'll generally do 2 sessions. Per.

Workout. But today I'm really just want to hit. You know.

Kind of. Relax my mind. Uh.

Just work my own combinations and stuff. Like. You know.

Just kind of practice. Right now. I'm not really going for more of a cardiovascular exercise.

Just more kind of playing around today. Basically. Generally kind of use.

Some type of like warm up. Starting off first. Just kind of get that.

Shoulders. Muscles. But.

I mean. Shit guys. Starting on this at home.

It's a pretty damn good cardiovascular exercise. And also too. I like boxing.

Because. One. It's a stress reliever.

It's a nice little stress reliever. And. It's.

I don't know. I don't really do any sports. It's always like.

Say basketball. So you like. A lot of people have been going outside.

And shooting hoops and stuff. I don't really do any sports. But.

This. I guess you could say. Is my sport.

I guess you could say. You know. For something that.

Just doing the side. But also too. It's like.

Cool. I guess you could say. To.

Practice. Get good at. Over time.

Even though I'm not. Using a coach and stuff. I'll watch like.

Videos on YouTube and stuff. So I guess you could say. YouTube talk.

And. It's also like. Good to know.

I guess. To. You know.

Protect yourself. In case anything. What to happen.

You know. I need to defend myself. I'm not being trained by a professional.

At least. I have like. Built up.

The routine and stuff. And obviously. Well.

Well. You know. You're not going to sit there and box with someone.

They're trying to like hurt you. Well. Yeah.

Fucking course. But. You know.

If you need to be able to throw a punch. You can. And you'll be a little bit better.

If you've never practiced on a day to day routine. So. Yeah.

Okay. I'm fine. I got this new bag over here which I really like.

So this is like a 50 pound bag right here. Really like it but the problem is you can't really uppercut like you want. So I put him on this bag way over here so you can see it.

It's a 100 pound water bag. Damn that feels good. So I'm going to do this for a little bit longer.

The camera battery is about to die but I just need no music. Just one of those days of hitting the bag, hearing the sound. Just your fist hitting the bag.

Kind of relaxing a little bit. Let my mind come on some mind relief. So see you guys in a little bit.

Hey guys. I just showered and stuff changed and now I'm finishing up some work for the rest of the day. Sipping on two scoops of ghost protein.

I'm actually going to end the vlog here just because I've already covered a lot today. And I'm really just sitting down doing some work and going to see Kennedy later and all we're doing is watching Netflix. So there's really nothing else to film.

So I'm going to edit this vlog and I'm going to see you guys tomorrow. Drop a like, drop a comment and let me know what you guys do when you're feeling down and no motivation and stuff. What do you do to kind of like get back on track and keep moving forward?

Drop a comment below. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
