what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have a new video for you guys we're gonna be discussing three Facebook ad campaigns I recommend everyone to be running at all times this is especially for those who have an e-commerce store with some level of social influence so for example you're getting a lot of organic sales through Instagram and Facebook and you want to maximize your efficiency with reaching everyone retargeting people all that good stuff so again this is for the people who have some level of social influence already getting some sales some stuff like that from their Facebook or Instagram and they want to just leave no money on the table at all before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys so three campaigns that we recommend everyone to be running at all times is a bottom of funnel campaign a middle of funnel campaign an existing customer campaign so if you're getting a lot of sales say from your Instagram your Facebook organic traffic maybe doing in shoutouts and stuff like that well using these campaigns is going to allow you to retarget everyone who has engaged with your page visits your website and are already existing customers this way we can target these people specifically and we're not just wasting a bunch of money on people that are cold audiences testing cold audiences and stuff like that these are very low budget campaigns we can run I'm talking about 20 30 a day total for smaller pages and pages a little bit bigger you know maybe go up to 100 300 per day with these retargeting campaigns so the first campaign is your middle of funnel campaign and what a middle of funnel campaign is specifically is targeting people who have engaged with your Instagram page or your Facebook page these are people that are aware of who you are they may have checked out some of your content and stuff but likely haven't visit your website yet so you want to make sure you exclude all website visitors and previous purchases when you're creating these custom audiences inside of Facebook ads and the middle funnel audience is purely people who are engaged they're aware of the brand they're warm but they haven't made a purchase yet or taking any serious action so running a simple ad that just more of like a colder audience ad just getting that grabbing their attention they're aware of who you are so share some reviews share some more product benefits and stuff what makes your brand unique works really well grabbing their attention and bringing them back to the website to where they can check out your products and stuff so if we go inside of the ads manager I'm going to show you exactly how we have that set up this is for one particular ad account where we're running the verb you know a Valentine's Day sale again these are people who are engaged they are warm and especially what we did is we just target social engagement last 30 days website visitors last 30 days but we excluded people who viewed content and purchased now again like I said these are people that are going to visit your page they're going to take a little action with your page and your brand and stuff to where they're just warm and all you simply just want to recapture their attention to actually get them to come visit your website or make a purchase so again working good with depending on the type of your product nature your product nature of your business for us was a Valentine's Day sale we ran for one of these campaigns and what we did was is we just used different call to actions in terms of hey still looking for the perfect gift you know deadline is coming soon give your loved one the perfect gift so just different calls actions like that to really grab their attention and stuff so you can also do video views too as well which has worked really well for us we just recently released a video on this again that's warm people at different stages of the funnel so again reviews testimonials what makes your brand different and again just you know getting them back to your website or getting them to come take action on your website to view your products and make a purchase now the next campaign to run is your bottom of funnel campaign the bottom of funnel campaign is very particular because it's really digging deeper into the consumer's mind these are people that already viewed your products but have yet to make a purchase they've used some of your products they added some stuff to the cart but they haven't made a purchase yet so we're going a little bit further and we need to retarget these people and get them to come back to make a purchase now i do have a video coming up on this or had a video already on this where i talk about you know discount codes and stuff like that with bottom of funnel retargeting so you don't really need to provide a discount code to get them to come back to purchase some products you do depending on the nature of your cut you know consumer and the product if it's just a quick you know product with little to no effort to sell it then maybe a discount code to make those tripwire purchases but for some products you need to dig deeper into the understanding and the psychology of the consumer to understand what type of content to put here so i can tell you right now testimonials and reviews work really well as well but also to educating people more on your product so if they don't feel like they're educated enough they will not make a decision and they will not make a purchase a confused mind always says no so if you go ahead and just try to get them to make the purchase you know and they are you lead them to your website they don't make the purchase yet then they're likely still confused on your product and the nature of your product and what it's like what you know you gotta like what to do with this product so that's why in the bottom of funnel you provide content with to them of exactly how to use the product different objections they might have maybe it's shipping warranty different uses for the product and different motives of why they need this product to further educate them and handhold them to the buying cycle so for our little preview right here of the campaign we're running since it's a valentine's day sale what i did was is i i went ahead and showcased more of the call to action of hey this is a limited time sell i showed some reviews and stuff of people with the product so we get to the tripwire products the product that is a very spontaneous purchase so the littlest thing we needed to show them to get them to make that purchase so what we did was is we just a testimonial that's it that's all we needed just to show them that hey this little small product it's gonna be a great gift and stuff and because it's a gift i chose testimonials and reviews that showcased that that i bought this as a gift it was amazing it was an amazing purchase so and that's what we ran in here and like i said like literally ten thousand dollars spent forty six thousand dollars back worked extremely well so some products like i have another brand that's a hair care brand and our bottom of funnel consists of a lot of educational videos on how to use their products crushes at a bottom of funnel but sucks a middle funnel which is okay because again we have warm people that don't know the product is yet then we have the like hot people that are like i viewed the product i looked at and everything i just don't know if we need to make a purchase yet so we provided them more information so they can make a purchase confidently now the last campaign is the pps which we like to call past purchase campaign and i've done a video already on this where like we ran a ad for another client um for like purchases in the last seven days and what we did was is we did purchase last seven days and we did more of a um like a thank you video for purchasing educating them on shipping educating them on what happens if the clothing don't fit and how to return it and a discount code a 20 off discount code for them to come back and purchase more so these people who already made a purchase and they're seeing a discount code for the first time because again we don't want to train them to expect the discount code we're giving them a discount code for completing and complying with our brand and for them to go back and purchase more and it worked extremely well for us and again past purchases so that's a quick little upsell campaign upsell them when come purchasing more it could be new product releases it could be news about the brand cool new stuff coming on these are you know purchases people who purchased your brand already and it allows you to actively target these people highly targetable so that way you can reach them in the best way because you can run email marketing campaigns to previous customers but with low rate open rates sometimes you want to hit them from multiple different angles not just email marketing so that's why we also recommend running some facebook ad campaigns to your existing purchases so i'm gonna show you an example right now this is actually an example of when it doesn't work well and again this is going to be different per brand some brands they have an amazing customer relationship after the purchase like another client of ours super amazing we do a 5 to 10x ROAS on our past purchase campaigns for this particular one we've been struggling we've tried multiple different ads and stuff different angles and as you can see the ROAS just really isn't there at all and we're targeting past purchases 180 days we have tried past purchase seven days just not working right now so that's just an example of what a past purchase campaign does but again you want to focus on upselling people getting people to come back and purchase more new product releases you know keep nurturing that relationship that you worked so hard to obtain with those buyers so closing out guys if you're not running facebook ads right now in combination with some of your cold organic outreach methods and maybe some of you are using like influencers and stuff to promote your brand facebook ads is a great way to completely clean the table of every last cent you can grab from people that are coming to your brand every single day if you're an e-com business owner and you're spending at least a thousand dollars a day on ad spend and would like a free
