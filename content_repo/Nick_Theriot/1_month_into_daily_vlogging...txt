I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's going on guys? Welcome to today's video. In fact, actually still never went to bed from editing yesterday's video.

I wanted to show you guys kind of like an inside look of everything that goes into these vlogs. So currently right now it is 2.56am. I started editing this video at 1.30am.

So it'll be about an hour and a half or maybe 1 o'clock. I started editing it and quickly threw everything together and I just finished making the thumbnail too. So the thumbnail's finished.

Everything's ready in Premiere. It's done. I got some notes I was writing down during editing the video and then I may even kind of go over a few things that happened today.

I might be like thankful for it or some thoughts. Done a little bit of 3D. Got my water and stuff.

And then Phoenix has been in and out of his cage. Or in and out buzzing around. But yeah, this is kind of like an inside look of these vlogs.

Of what happens after the vlog ends. And let's see. Currently got my alarm set for...

Oh, I don't have an alarm yet. I'm going to do 8 o'clock for tomorrow. I don't know if that's focused or not.

But I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get about 5 hours of sleep. And then we'll jump straight into either a workout or...

Not really sure what the major plan is. But I'm going to go ahead and put this rendering. So that way while I'm sleeping, it's all rendered.

So that's why as soon as I wake up, I just upload and schedule for later during the day. So that's the way it can properly process and everything on YouTube before it goes live to everyone. So see you guys in the morning.

It is currently 9.39 in the morning. If you can see that or not. There we go.

Currently 9.39. We'll go about 10 minutes ago. Going to now.

Take a scoop of Ghost Pre. And we're going to get a workout in. We're going to get a workout in.

Get that out of the way. So that way we can have a nice 4 hour work block later. And then we'll see what we get into after that.

So last night I put this rendering. Went to bed. Now I woke up.

First thing I'm going to do is click upload now on it. Maybe do a few personal notes in here. And then kind of check everything.

Calendar, Facebook ads, YouTube analytics. And it's kind of like my morning routine lately. Then also too I'm going to step on my pre-workout.

And after I finish all of this I need to clean his cage. And then we can jump. We can jump into a nice little shoulder day.

Also I didn't say it earlier but we had our first low weigh in. 155.4 pounds. So that is pretty cool.

So 30 days of daily vlog. And I think that's kind of like the video topic today. And it's been a journey.

We officially crossed over 30 days probably a few days ago. But for 30 days now we've been putting out videos. Every day but Sunday.

Except now for this Inspire series. And yeah. So far I'm enjoying it.

I think the only thing that's really killing it is stuck in this quarantine. Because I want to do more things for you guys. I want to go out.

I want to experience more things. And we're just stuck inside. So I think the daily.

I think it's also a good thing. Because it's really forced myself to build up this habit. Even at the worst of the worst.

And also it's a good thing. Because it's given you guys some extra content to watch. If you know you're someone that's stuck at home too.

I have a lot of time with it today. And you follow me. And you need a video to watch.

Well. Hope you guys enjoy the videos. And I think that's also a great time to start a YouTube channel.

Because you have more attention to potentially get in front of. So there's more people online. So there's more chances and more opportunities for your videos to go viral.

Or for you to get more views on your videos. So something interesting about Phoenix. Every morning I open up this window farm.

Brings in some nice UV light. And every morning he's under his rock. He comes out as soon as I open it.

So he absolutely loves it. There you go. He's all out.

Which is perfect. Because I need to take him out now to clean his cage. So it's a good start.

So it's a good start. So it's funny. If I just put him on the bed.

He just goes. Goes. Goes.

Goes around. Obviously I don't let him on top. Anything else.

There he goes. He's trying to venture away now. I need to take him out.

I need to take him out. I don't know how this is going to work. But I'm going to attempt to try to read.

While I'm in my cardio today. I'm trying to get more reading in. So like.

Add 20 minutes by taking a bath. And while I take a bath. I read.

If I can add 10 minutes right here. Add another 15-20 minutes. My videos render.

I can try to add different areas. My goal is to read one hour a day. Just try to get more books out the way.

I think it grows smarter. Start off this workout with some. Just.

Get some bands. Focus on activating those shoulders. Nice squeeze in the top.

The top where it's the most resistance. Next little exercise is the douche. Just kind of like a front raise.

This is where it gets a little complicated. Just because. The chairs I'm normally used to using.

So it's starting to fall apart. Dropping the weights. So.

I've got to try to balance myself on the couch. I can't really do it too heavy. This is a picture of yours.

Balance. Balance. Rear delts now.

Just simple back. Rear delt wide. Alright.

Next exercise is doing. Simple. 25 pound plate.

Raise it up. Probably my favorite exercise. I think anyone's favorite exercise is your shoulders.

Some simple double-blahs. During this whole workout. I'm trying to focus on.

I don't really touch my phone. Did pretty good. So just now.

Just before I started this exercise. Try to make up. Instagram posts.

So you know how that goes. But this will be my last exercise. My shoulders.

And then we're going to go do. Hit the bag. And I know hitting the bag too.

It makes us hold my shoulders. So. Overall.

Pretty good shoulder day. And. Let's go punch the bag now.

Just finished up a nice round of boxing and stuff. And I think one of the biggest challenges. With daily vlogging for me.

Has been two things. Number one. The first initial one.

Was going out in public. And bringing a camera. It's very.

I don't know if I say. I feel embarrassed. But I just feel like.

The pressure of other people looking at me. And just like. Eh.

Put it down. So. I think that's the first one.

And to be honest. That's the first thing I wanted to actually push myself. To overcome.

It's just like taking the cold showers. I immediately just jump in. It's cold for a second.

But then I'm good. And I knew that's the same thing. Lost food.

Vlogging. Bad. It's going to be cold for a second.

It's going to be hurt. I'm going to pick up that camera. In the middle of a bunch of people.

But honestly. I don't give a fuck. They're going to be like.

Oh. Who's that person with a camera? Boom.

To be honest. I've never got one negative. Pump of it.

About the camera. I have so many people though. When I was in public.

Like. Oh. Hey.

What you do? You do like YouTube videos. Or what you channel?

That's so cool. What you do? So.

That was number one. Number two. The biggest thing.

With daily vlogging. Is the editing. It takes me about two hours a day.

To edit the episode. So. Where that two hours came from.

Was my sleep. So. I do get two hours less.

Instead of eight hours. I get six hours now. Sleep.

Um. Every night. Uh.

For daily vlogging. But that's the only two complaints. I have about daily vlogging.

And. If I were to add another one. It'd probably be just.

Every day. Making sure you come up with something. Because sometimes I'm like.

Oh. I need to come up with something super creative. And then other days.

I'm just like. I'm just going to film the day. And see how things goes.

Alright. For post workout. We got.

Two packets of oatmeal. Some avocado toast. And.

Two scoops of ghost whey. Protein. Also catching up.

On my book. So. It's been a few hours now.

Since I've ate. Showered. Did my meditation and stuff.

And currently. Right now. I am going through.

Like. My agency operations. I decided to do like.

A four hour work block. From two to six o'clock. So only thirty minutes into it.

I finished up. I finished up all my LinkedIn. Prospecting.

Follow ups. Etc. Etc.

And. I'm going through my emails now. And I got the coolest.

Freaking email. Like. This is so rewarding.

To get this email. I did a. Completely free consulting call.

Last week. It was just a simple discovery call. Just to talk to this client.

And. You know. We started digging through his ad campaign.

So literally. It was like. A 45 minute call.

Super cool dude. Super cool brand. And they're basically struggling.

Uh. Barely breaking even. On their ads and stuff.

And. Got on the call. And literally.

Just showed them a few simple things. To flip and switch off. Turn on.

And test. And. Like.

Guys. So. During the call.

I think we were hitting like. A. Roast.

Of like. 1.5 or something. I don't know.

This is too bright for you guys. Let's see if we can fix this. So.

There you go. You should see that better. Purchase.

Roast. Right there. That's where we want to see.

Look at that. 4.98. 4.65.

4.18. Average. Roast.

Of a 4x. Right here. For these few campaigns.

We got them. Helped set up. And this is like.

The coolest thing. And like. The most rewarding thing.

About what I did. Because. If you went from a.

Say a 1.5. Or. Let's say a 2x.

Roast. That's your break even. Roast.

And. You go from a 2x. To a 4.1.

4.2. 4.3. Roast.

You doubled your profits. So imagine that. On a bigger.

Grand of scheme. Let's say we. Double the profits.

For the year. You go from. 500,000 dollars.

To a few tweaks. I just helped them make. To now a million dollars.

In a year. Because we helped them. Double their profits.

And that's probably. One of the most rewarding things. The most satisfying things.

When I'm working with these brands. And helping them out. With a few simple tricks and stuff.

And I literally. Hopped on a call with them. For like.

34 or 5 minutes. And I've literally made. Tens of thousands of dollars.

Maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Over the next few months. With the knowledge.

I provided in that call. And just the entry level. Of him applying that knowledge.

Immediately. Got him back. A few extra thousand.

In his ad campaign. So. A cool thing was.

The brand that did a consulting. They were going to send me some free clothes. So.

Hyped up for that. And yeah. I'm going to keep crushing with this.

All the agency operations are done. I do have another consulting call at 3.30. And.

I got just a few little tweaks. And little like. Homework I need to do.

With tarot solutions and stuff. I need to work on a Google ad campaign. For one client.

I need to add in some active campaign. Leads. From old calls I've had.

Update the information and stuff. And also I need to reactivate. My LinkedIn premium.

Because I just did some. Routing out. Changing things.

Up. With my subscription. Cool.

Are you closer to the coast. Or upper north. Trying to hurry up and eat.

Real quick. And we're actually going to head out. Go see my girlfriend.

And. We are just. Destroying the kitchen.

So I got some chicken cooked. Chicken breasts. Amazing.

Got to put in a plate. Get eight ounces. That's a lot.

I kid you not guys. I got ramen noodles. For my carb source.

Because. I don't have any rice prep. And stuff.

I don't have any quick containers. I do not feel like cooking rice. Right now.

Because I'm trying to. Herb and eat. And leave.

And. I did ramen noodles. With no seasoning.

At all. So it's just the noodles itself. And then my plan is to put them in here.

Let's bring some soy sauce on it. And I got like some chicken noodle. Chicken and noodles.

That's. That's the good. That's the move for tonight.

And I'm going to do some pineapples. And I'll be done. With my carbs.

Protein. Everything for the day. I'll actually be short.

Like. 30 carb. But.

I'm over. By 10 grams of fat. So.

I have 100 calories left. I'm just not going to use. Maybe I'll toss in some more carbs.

Somewhere. Somehow. In there.

But. That'll be it. For today.

Show you guys. What we got here. So like I said.

We got the ramen noodles. We got the chicken. I didn't put any of the seasoning.

For the ramen noodles. What I did was. I put some soy sauce on it.

And a little bit of pepper. And then. Got.

Pineapple. Water. Read my book.

And like I said. I literally went over my fat. Like 10 grams.

I have like 68. I have 30 grams left of carbs. So I got to figure out.

How to get that in. I have like 100 calories. So.

We'll see. It's all about balancing. And.

We have an epic leg day tomorrow. So I know. All this will be put to good use.

But. Again. It's a cheat meal.

Because it falls inside of my calories. So. We'll go.

We'll see. Welcome to the end of this video today. And pretty much just sat down.

Got back home. And now. About to start editing this vlog.

Like how we started off editing this vlog. Or started off editing the last vlog. And now.

Ending. Editing this vlog. But.

30 days. Of vlogging so far. Or over 30 days of vlogging so far.

And to be honest. Loving it. Overall.

I'm loving it. It's something I wanted to do. And it doesn't even feel like it's been 30 days.

Like. Every day. I just kind of pick up the camera.

And I start talking about something. And that's just what I've been doing. Obviously.

There is a lot of room for improvement. Just between getting more camera angles. Getting more.

More building on the creative. And the storytelling process. Which I'm currently still working on.

And overall. We're going to keep pushing. And I really want to do.

Two. Three. Four.

Years of this. Before I really kind of like. Okay.

And my channel is not growing. Or anything like that. Like you know.

Right now. I'm still just laying out the foundation. I'm still just getting my feet wet in this.

And I'm really happy with everything. Is going. So I want to thank you.

Huge. Thank you to everyone. Who's been supporting the channel.

Supporting every video. I really greatly appreciate you guys. A lot.
