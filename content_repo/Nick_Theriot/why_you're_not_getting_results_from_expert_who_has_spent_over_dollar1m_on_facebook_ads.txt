Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys.

Today we'll be talking about why you are not getting results from someone that has spent literally over seven figures on ads. We've spent over a million, probably close to two to three million now, honestly, by time filming this video and everything between all of our clients and stuff and generated multiple millions on top of that in revenue. So with that being said, today I want to discuss why you're not getting results with your Facebook ads.

And literally this is something that I've came up with after discussing multiple different client discovery calls and pretty much the common questions and common problems I'm seeing in literally every single ad account. So with that being said, before we get started, make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That being said, let's dive into the video.

So guys, I really want to introduce y'all to the 80-20 rule. This is something that is a book, literally 80-20 principle. You can see right here, secrets achieving more with less.

And this is the rule of kind of structure everything within my business, whether it's, you know, between my team, between results and everything like that. So when I look at an ad account and when I look at all this stuff that it goes around advertising, I like to look at it from this perspective as well. So if you haven't discovered the 80-20 rule yet, it's 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of your outcomes are from 20% of inputs.

So with that being said, it's basically 20% of the actions you take today deliver 80% of your results. If you do, if you work 10 hours a day, two hours are going to deliver 80% of your results the next day or, you know, over time. So in the 80-20 rule, you prioritize the 20% of factors that will produce the best results.

So basically looking at your business, looking at your advertising spin, looking at your channels, your advertising on, looking at the content you create and figuring out what is the 20% that delivers majority of the results. For my YouTube channel, for example, our case study videos get the most results. So recently I've been starting to produce more of those because they get substantially higher amount of views, attention, and getting a lot more new people to the channel.

So I've been focusing on producing more of those because it's 20% of videos that get 80% of the views. So looking at that and looking at this little diagram right here, 20% of your time delivers 80% of results and 80% of that time expended delivers 20% of results. So likely right here, you're either focusing 80% of your time on stuff that just does not matter, delivering 20% of results, or you're focusing 20% of your time to get 80% of your results.

So I know that might kind of confuse some of you guys, but basically your ultimate goal was just to like literally if you're working 10 hour days, get down to two hours of just highly productive stuff. And that's going to give you 80% of your results. So where you're at right now.

So 90% of people that I get on calls, we have discovery calls, account audits, everything like that. This is how their current process and their current placement looks like right now. 80% of their time is just playing around the ads manager.

They're constantly going on YouTube, how to scale Facebook ads, you know, how to do creative testing, how to do audience testing. They're spending a lot of time on all of this that may take, you know, for me, it took months to figure out an ad account structure. And guess what?

The way I found out about it was because I hopped on a call with someone that literally took 30 minutes. I got an ad account structure. So spent months of problems to just taking one different action, radically different of asking someone for help.

And I got an ad account structure to tremendously changed projection for a lot of my clients. So with that, a lot of people right here, they're spending 80% of their time on the ads manager, the structure is scaling, and they're not even spending anything on creative and strategy. They're literally just constantly in the ads manager, turning off ads, turning on ads.

It literally looks like a stock room on wall street, people running around, like literally looking at stocks and like putting in, putting out, like their ad barely breaks, you know, spends a few dollars and you know, is under X amount of ROAS, turn it off. Then the next one put, you know, more budget behind it. Like just a lot of just this unnecessary actions inside of the ad accounts.

And they're constantly sitting back. What can I do to get better performance? What can I do for better performance?

And they're just looking at the logical side of the ad accounts that are not looking at the strategic side of creative and strategy at all. And when I look at their account, this is what the problems are showing up. They have poor performance in the ad account.

They're stuck at that, like 1.5, 2X ROAS. They need a 3X or their target ROAS is 3X. Their breakeven ROAS is like 1.5 or their ads just have really poor engagement on it.

But you can definitely tell things are dying down in that account. Not getting the results they want at all. Terrible, bad performance, constant swing highs, lows in the business.

So they're like, they'll like every now and then decide to test new creative. When they do, it takes off, creates a good results. And then it dies out and they're like, wow, what did I do?

Is it an audience issue? Something like that. No, it's a creative and strategic side, but you know, the lack of perspective they have, you know, allows them to kind of fail on that, that part of changing projectory and looking at, you know, new creatives and testing stuff like that.

So they also might say some stuff like, I'm lucky that creative took off. You know, one time I was working on an ad account and it was for this one specific product. And I'm like, we've been using the same angle for a while.

And you know, we just weren't getting performance and everything. It was like, we're about to call it quits with this ad account. Then one day I'm just like, huh, let me try this.

I tried it and boom, the creative took off overnight, solid, like three to four extra hours where it was a scale pretty hard because I've tried a completely different action. I tested a whole new creative, but you see, I was too close to the ads manager. I was too close to looking at lookalikes versus interest audiences.

None of that played an effect of what allowed me to take that ad account off because I simply had the wrong creatives I was trying to use and I want the wrong strategy. And because of my failure to actually look at that, because I was spending all my time on ad accounts, you know, I could have took 20% of my day, 20 minutes out of that hour, whatever, and focus on the creative every day. And then we would be in a completely different perspective.

And that's what I do with a lot of my clients right now. Another thing is they're not spending any time on creating new advertising angles and preparing assets. So what you should be doing, what you should be doing to get results and to consistently keep, keep testing new creatives and, and scaling the ad account up and stuff like that.

20% of your time needs to be focused on this right here. Other 80% of your day don't really care what you do, but 20% of your time needs to be specifically this every single day. You need to focus on the, the few things you can do.

That's going to get you 80% of your results. And that's what it comes down to right here. You need to be doing some, some level of strategic planning every single day, looking at your audience research, you know, really understanding your consumer perfectly, you know, understand your consumer better than they, they know themselves.

I hear that quote a lot. It's very true. Coming up with new advertising angles.

So new angles, we can reach these people. Even if your account's performing well, keep looking for those new angles because there's always going to be that day where it's like, Oh, that one stopped performing. And it goes a few months of not performing.

And you, you never tested new ones to find new ones you can scale with creating new offers. So new offers, maybe just sitting down and thinking, okay, look, you know, it's in of summer. We can do in of summer flash sale, 25% off hint, hint those watching this video.

It's crushing for us right now. We're just launching that just, just hint, hint might want to try that won't work for every brand, but the brands that does work, works really well. Now the next thing is you want to be creating new creatives every single day.

So either this is going to take form of planning video and photo shoots. So actually sitting down and all right, Hey, we need to talk to this videographer, this photographer, get some photos and stuff like that. Our video is done.

You can also get some UGC from below.app, love their platform, or even content creators itself, like reaching out to people on Amazon, Amazon on Instagram and stuff like that. And I've good Instagram aesthetics, sitting with them a product and they can create some content with it. So, and this also too, I didn't even think about this.

This will take form as well as planning, creative concepts. So this might be, okay, Hey, we want an unboxing video. How does that unboxing video look?

All right. A girl gets it in the mail. She opens it up.

She says how amazing it is. It shows off all the features of it and then shows off how to take action. Okay.

Now we have a creative concept. Now let's see how we can take action with that. Do we need a photographer?

Do we need a videographer? Do we need just some content creator? How can you take action with that?

So you're actually starting on the top and planning these things out and spending a lot of time on this. Now creating new ad copy. We don't, I personally don't write any ad copy.

I come up with creative angles and advertising angles that I tell my copywriter to write ad copy around. I recommend no one's writing their own ad copy. To be honest, it's way too easy to get copy now by literally going to adzombies.com or finding a copywriter, a Fiverr Upwork.

That's very good. And the reason why is just because copywriting is like a whole nother thing to learn. That's very tricky.

I do have a few videos that shows you how to write your own ad copy, but just it's an easy task just to outsource off. So unless you don't have the money, at least 50, 60 bucks per ad, then, you know, write it yourself. I will have more videos very soon coming around that because I do have some really cool concepts for that.

Now, after all of this is done, then you can spend a little time in your ad account, like literally for 15 whole minutes, open your ad account quickly have formulas. Hey, if XYZ happens, turn off this ad. If XYZ happens, scale this ad by X percentage, like literally have formulas written down and you do not deviate from those right there.

You follow those accordingly on a day-to-day basis. The whole ad account concept between YouTube, between Facebook ads, TikTok ads, Pinterest ads, all of it can be managed by simple formulas. It's why I made a video just last week about how it's a low income activity, because you could literally document these few formulas and you've gone through that account and hiring someone on Upwork VA or something like that as a virtual assistant that's really good with technical stuff like that, that could literally replicate all that.

So when you have those solid procedures in place, it should just be 15 minutes in, 15 minutes out. That's it. Now your 15 minutes, first 15 minutes should literally just be looking at the scaling, you know, adjusting budgets, turning off things.

That's it. Second 15 minutes should be actually launching new ads that you create in this first area right here. So launching new ads, structure, new tests, all that stuff.

So this is how your workflow should look. And a lot of people have this, has this backwards. They have it flipped on the top of its head.

They're spending all their time on this and a little time on this, and they're not getting any results because all their time they're spending on the ad account is only getting 20% of the results. And then 20% of their time they're spending right now gives them 80% of the results when they do launch a new ad or something like that. So you need to flip it around, spend a lot more time on the content, the creative, the angles, and the audience research, and less time on the ad accounts.

And you're going to be in a much better place. And that's literally how we do it inside the agency. We only spend like first hour every morning going through ad accounts.

And the other half of the they focus more on getting creative zone, planning videos and photo shoots, crafting new advertising angles, looking at strategy, crafting new offers, all that fun stuff right there.
