hey what's going on guys Nick here it's been a while but it's the first video I've created probably in the past year and actually uploaded to YouTube muscle put to Facebook and stuff but I want to show you guys today a strategy that I'm using with my clients for Facebook ads this is probably the strategy to use if you want to grow your personal brand your business your e-commerce store your local business on Facebook Instagram pretty much overall social media domination and I'm gonna show you that strategy today if you don't know me I run a Facebook Ads agency have been for the past two years I worked with many amazing people over these past two years and I couldn't be more thankful and now I do a mixture of the Facebook Ads for clients and starting to try to get back into this YouTube thing and providing value and helping people out it's something I love to do it's my passion so until maybe the next year I'll upload another video who knows let's just jump in the video and give you some value so a big problem lately or a big problem I still see today I've been running Facebook Ads now for three years a big problem I still see today is that too many people are still running ads that look like this now hold up because I'm about to make some amazing drawings right here so I just want you guys to take a second to be prepared because these drawings are gonna look beautiful let's just say that so they're running an ad like this add and then boom and then offer boom that's it that is their strategy they take their ad and they give it to their offer they're like wow well if I can reach you know say 500 people for maybe or a thousand people depending on what your CPM is that 500 to a thousand people a day for 500 or for $5 with Facebook Ads I just put this ad together and I send people to my sales page and I get link clicks and someone's bound to buy it right so that's what they do and they push to their offers offer could be a call this offer could be a sales page this could be a you know a lead page as many different things you could do but that's probably your three primary landing pages is a call page a sales page or a lead page and that's basically where they schedule strategy session they buy your product or they maybe put their information in for a free download free webinar or you know maybe like actual like lead for a local business so that's the current strategy 98% of businesses are running with Facebook ads on Facebook and it's horrible because in the process of this their majority of them I mean I'm still running this potentially to for some clients but it's rare that it works these these clients is very specialty and it works for like said 98 9 air 2% 98% of the people that are running this specific structure they're converting don't get me wrong but they're converting really low and they're not building any brand equity in the process they're basically just making a bunch of quick sales and that's it what the process I'm gonna show you today guys is going to build brand equity it's gonna allow you to get the brand awareness get people to follow your brand grow your brand online but in the process actually make money too because there's two types of ways marketers go there's a direct response marketing which is this right here where it's ad offer and you convert at some percentage then there's brand awareness which is what some ad agencies love because they just you know take a portion of the ad spend the more ad spend you you spend and they blast you all over line but it's literally just like hey this is Nick Terrio hey if you need digital marketing call Nick Terrio like and they don't work on any type of results and stuff like that it's basically the per the people that sell ads that for signs on the side of the road there's almost impossible to track those results and stuff and people are paying thousands for it and seeing little to no results that's what brand awareness is but when you combine the two mesh them together you create a very powerful strategy and let's go into that strategy right now so let me clean this up a little bit I think that's how you do it like I don't really use this that often but um you come there and you start off with you know let's just say three videos boom wow that was horrible okay so three videos you have video one let's call that v1 and if you can't tell that's a v even though it looks like you video two video three and these three videos is you proven to your audience you're an expert in your field you're providing content you're providing value can be a mixture of videos you do three different types of videos but they're not sales videos you're not persuading them to buy your product you're giving value exactly how this video is I'm not persuading you at all to buy my services but I'm providing value and showing you that I've knowledge in this field that and I'm giving you value that you can go and apply to your business and there might be up one percent of people who actually watch this video completely who might want my services and I understand that and that's why I do it um and also to just to help people out but that's the same technique here you want to show people that hey look here's some free value here's some helpful information to help you out um for an e-commerce store an e-commerce brand where you're like okay you know look I sell clothes how do I provide value to people like this go create some cool video content of your clothes being worn by celebrities maybe you have a fitness brand go create some videos um gym shark does this really well they have like videos where you know they show like their athlete story and stuff like that and people watch them working out they do a cool like edit and stuff um gym shark alphalete does this well and then they can retarget I don't know if they do this but you can retarget the people who's watched and engaged those videos and I'm gonna show you that in a second kind of jumping a little ahead but um so what you do is you you create some video content just some engaging stuff people like damn that's pretty cool that's it that they want to share with their friends and stuff and you run engagement campaign on facebook targeting your ideal buyer so map out your ideal buyer test that audience make sure it works and that's when I'm running direct response campaign is when I'm testing that audience I run a direct response campaign on make sure it's profitable first then I unload this strategy right here so come right here um we go boom boom so I take all my videos and I target to a cold audience so this is your cold audience right here and then then that cold audience transforms into a warm audience so now I have a warm audience now these are people um that have been watching my content and they've gone from cold to warm and the process I probably picked up some likes on the videos some comments and I've also probably picked up a few page likes some shares and stuff like that and what I'm doing is I'm making awareness for the brand I'm showing off the product or maybe the service in the process and now I've gotten people interested and engaged with the page um and now I have a warm audience people are aware of what we do what we sell etc so this warm audience and the way you get this is you basically you're you're retargeting say 25% is a good number to start off with or if you have some really long videos maybe 10% 10 seconds I meant so if you go into the ads manager let me see and you can actually create a video sequence or not a video sequence a target people who's watched time periods of a video so I can upload a video push it out and I can actually retarget people who's watched specific periods of that video so 10 seconds for you know a really long video like I'm talking about eight minutes plus um or 25% maybe for a video that's about a minute and a half so anywhere from a minute and a half to like eight minutes it's kind of like the ideal video and if I've been seeing anything less than a minute half is okay um anything longer than eight minutes it's kind of a little long to watch on Facebook or at least as an ad that'd be a good one to like send off to your mailing list or direct people to like YouTube channel but 10 to 25% test them both if you're not getting a lot of people converting at 25% do 10% so what you do is you choose 25% then you can choose your video that you want to do so like this video right here boom has 22,000 views confirm I'll type in my audience name blah blah watch 25% dash um you know interview that's what this video was and then boom and what you do is you create three four videos that like I said right here push into a cold audience retarget them in the warm audience section and then what you do is from there now you have a actively um an audience to target a warm audience and what you usually just when you create your campaigns now you come there and you target on the targeting section just select those three or four or five however many videos you did for your cold audience I recommend starting off three different videos from different ad angles so three videos that are unique they're not like each other and you target those three videos are these audiences right here and you do two types of ads you send them off right here this is again the warm audience and you want to send them off to more video content now this content is gonna be a little different this is gonna be some more salesy content without them being realized they're being sold to so that's the type of content you want to push right here and then with the warm audience and then go back on that like what I meant by that is you want to create some content that also kind of addresses maybe objections that might come up to which you have for sale so like so that way they're going through more content and so they've already engaged with your page they got your content now they're getting hit with more content and that's basically just keeping them wrapped around you but this is this content because they're already engaged with you a little bit more aware of who you are now you can not necessarily don't just give them like a sales pitch but show off more of your product or your service going into a little bit deeper of a detail of what would separate your product or service you know maybe list make a list of like objections and stuff or beliefs they might have that you need to overcome for them to buy from you and create video content around that and that's gonna help out with getting them in the right perspective as they see your offer ads so you basically target two two types of ads to this warm audience you have your more content than you have offers so you're targeting both so you're sending both outside of timeline after they watch those videos and on the offer side right here this is where you're gonna send them to your your sales page you know your webinar your lead magnet etc and then after that is when you're gonna do you know your retargeting ads that work that looks like retargeting so yeah so that's pretty much how the whole strategy works and I'm actually going to show you a different way right here boom if you want to screenshot this video right now this is a little bit more clear of a path but I need to show you something I'm using of me trying to use the whiteboard for this video so again you start off with your three videos these are awareness videos showing off your product or service in a cool fun way pushing them over to you pushing them out to a cold audience which turns that into a warm audience of retargetable people just showed you how to retarget the people in this video instead of you having to go on Facebook or you I mean going on YouTube and actually figured out yourself and it showed you how to do that so then you target those audiences of people who watch these three videos and then you do two things you create a few ad sets that make offers and then you create a few ad sets with more video content that goes a little bit more in depth with your product or service and again address future objections address limiting beliefs and show off how awesome it is that creates more desire and at the same time you're also pitching them so you're doing both for the same time you're not just doing offers and then video content you're doing both so they're being hit with a mixture of both ads they're not going to some people might just go straight to the offer sign for your webinar purchase your product boom you're done some people might watch a bunch of your content and then decide to take action on one of your webinar ads or your strategy session ads or your download ads so I really hope this helps again the way this works is it overall it's building a lot of trust because you're allowing people to you know you're showing off the product or service you're allowing people to you know you're allowing people to know you're allowing people to know I can trust you and then you're creating some cool content that they want to share with their friends like comment on stuff that's going to grow your following and at the same time you're pitching the people that's engaged with your page and these people can be way more likely to purchase download do anything from you because they already know I can trust you versus the other gurus who go out there and decide to you know create a direct response ad and then boom and then disrespect 98 99% of the people who look at that and convert off the 1 to 2% that does so hope this video was helpful for you guys please like comment subscribe if you haven't I don't know when the next video will be and I really appreciate you checking this out thank you for watching
