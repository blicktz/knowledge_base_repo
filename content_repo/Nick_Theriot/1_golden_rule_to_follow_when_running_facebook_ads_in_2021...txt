yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and i hope you are having a great day today i have an exciting new video for you guys where i'm going to show you my number one kind of golden rule i follow when running facebook ads in 2021 and pretty much my golden rule since day one with facebook ads so i've put out a lot of content over a while now and i get all these questions about certain things about hey should i turn off my abo campaign before duplicating into cbo should i turn off this ad set before i duplicate it before i create a new one like just should i increase the budget this ad sets the one well then look you're in the right place right now because got my golden rule for all of this that's super easy and super effective to follow and it's going to drastically improve your performance so before we get started make sure you like button on this video and subscribe for new videos just like this one every monday wednesday and friday so that being said let's get started guys okay so i put a lot of content lately and you know specifically my particular structure where it's like okay you know i test abo campaign for creative and audience and then i duplicate into cbo that's most consistent like my strategy and stuff and i get a lot of questions about should i turn this off before duplicating into that cbo campaign or before i move this creative into my audience testing campaign should i turn it off so i get a lot of questions pertaining around this maybe here's my new ad account structure i want to launch it but let me turn off all my ads first before i launch it and you know should i do that and i get these questions and it's like okay follow my golden rule so my golden rule when it comes down to facebook ads and any type of paid advertising is if it works do not touch it like grill this into your brain so there is a few kind of maneuvering around around that a little bit but let me explain so let's say you're running an audience testing campaign abo 40 per day per ad set 20 per day ad set whatever you're testing audiences in an audience testing campaign and you know you find a purchase la one percent 30 day it's killing it it's working really well and you want to duplicate that into a cbo campaign to scale it and you do that and then you turn off the one that was already working really well in audience testing campaign and now you're scaling it your cbo that does not follow my rule of if it touch if it works do not touch it so you do not want to turn that off you want to leave it on and you want to get your cbo and scale it up yes you'll have a little bit of auction overlap but because you're spending significantly more in your cbo scaling campaign i'm not worried about a 20 to 40 a day budget competing against that i'm worried about auction overlap when it's an ad set budget optimization campaign and you duplicate a purchase 30 day and have two purchase 30 day ad sets both on a thousand dollars a day here's a major auction overlap a 20 or 40 a day ad set and then and then that same ad set being put in a cbo at 100 200 300 400 500 500 a day very little auction overlap there will be some but very little so if it's working do not touch it so that does not mean you can't duplicate it because i'm just talking about do not touch an ad set or creative that's already working you can create a duplicate of it and put a higher budget on it if maybe you want to duplicate an audience to test at a higher rate go for it same thing for creative for creatives working well in your creative testing campaign don't touch it because what happens is you increase your chances of screwing up the results you could you could achieve so i give you my account structure and then i give you these suggestions and stuff and then you already getting on three extra rice you turn everything off so you can follow my stuff then that was three extra rise you're just turning away from so you have to find out your point your kpi of okay anything below this is unprofitable and turn it off and if you go to apply some stuff and it's below that turn it off then that's totally okay now if it's above that there's no point to turn it off we have one particular client recently we took on and we built out their mofu their bofu their tofu all the campaigns and stuff and we're still using their existing scaling campaign because it's a creative that's still working really well so we're going to continue pushing it because it's still working i don't want to turn it off because it's still converting well and some people would have turned it off but i'm trying to work with them not against them and turning off everything just apply my stuff it's a big waste of time i want to leave things on if it's working so if there's one golden rule if it's working do not touch it now you need to scale it up say for example the cbo campaign 20 a day cool do it once per day don't do anything crazy and i only like to do that on audiences that's been proven multiple times so that's why i'm perfectly okay with my cbo campaign because my audience testing creative testing campaign i'm still testing those the effectiveness of that creative in that audience whereas the cbo scaling campaign i'm literally creating that campaign specifically for scaling and they've been proven variables to where whatever budget we throw at it works really well now i wouldn't jack if i wanted to jack up the price or the daily budget above 20 in a day then i'll go ahead and duplicate it at a higher budget so let's say if i want to increase on cbo from 100 to 500 i'm not going to do that one campaign i'm going to do that too so i'm going to have my original 100 one and i'll duplicate it at a 500 day budget to increase it so that's where i'll go with that so if there's one rule you can follow it's working do not touch it duplicate it and scale it up or if it's a cbo scaling campaign increase it by 20 maybe you're doing an abo scaling campaign and you're scaling your ad sets inside of a campaign then go ahead and you know the 20 increases but general rule of thumb is if it's working do not touch it regardless of what where it's at in the funnel unless it's like you know i've had it before where we're running like a valentine's day sale a few days after valentine's day because it's still working well i've had you know cyber monday ads go from to like the friday after cyber monday like if it's still working really well don't touch it because you're limiting your results and stuff so i
