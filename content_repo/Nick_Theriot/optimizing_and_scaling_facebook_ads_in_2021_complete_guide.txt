what's going on guys welcome to my channel my name is Nick Terrio and today I have a new video for you guys on optimization and scaling of Facebook ads in 2021 what do you need to do to optimize your ads and scale some stuff to look out for some things that I've learned over the past that can be very beneficial to you so before we get started make sure you hit the like button below and hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel for new videos every other day just like this one so that being said let's get started guys all right so optimizing ads in 2021 what's some stuff that you may need to know learn about and stuff and even scaling too we'll talk a little bit about scaling all that good stuff but the first thing first is before you can scale you need to optimize and simply optimizing is just cutting off the stuff that does not work you know cutting losses cutting losses people will go ahead and they'll um you know they'll let an ad run way too long like like a few weeks too long like hey cut that off if you spent you know probably I like to go by days you know and AOV so if I spend at least two or three times my AOV on a ad not an ad set or not even a campaign on an ad I want to kill it if the ROAS is the lifetime ROAS is below the KPI I'm trying to hit so I'm trying to hit a three extra KPI and after say a week and we spent over two to three times our AOV I'm gonna kill it if it's not hitting those KPIs I set so key performance indicators and that's your ROAS and all that stuff so cut your losses go through your ad account right now find the ads that you just you've been running and maybe it's about time to cut your losses short so next thing is introducing new ads now I don't want you guys to go ahead and just go to your ad account right now and start typing up a bunch of new ads I want you to go ahead and identify your best performing ads this might be three or four ads sometimes it's two ads and that's totally okay I want you to go identify your best performing ads and then what I want you to do is create spawn offspring not really gonna get a reproduction class here but create children of those ads so for example you know I like to look at the uh the pizza and the hamburger reference so let's do a pizza and hamburger so pizza and hamburger right here there is a let's just say these are your best performing ads you have a pizza ad a hamburger ad so ad number one and number two whatever your two best performing ads right here a pizza and a hamburger now in the pizza world there is a lots of different pizza so you can go down to pineapple or no some people like pineapple some people don't you can go to I think it's a margarita pizza which is like a vegetarian pizza I'm just gonna call that marge or no some people don't and then we have you know pineapple margarita pizza what about a meat lovers pizza so this is your best performing ad right here pizza we just know people like pizza that's it they love this ad they like pizza but we don't know what they like specifically about this ad so we don't know what specific interests of this pizza like because we say pizza everyone has a different representation of what a pizza is that they love for me I love a good you know meat lovers pizza from this little joint in my hometown and then also two domino's cheesy you know what's it called pepperoni pizza absolutely love it for a good cheat day so hey anyway so you have your pizza but then we have the people who like pineapple we have the people that like margarita and then we have the people that love a meat lovers so a paid advertising is your best performing ad you know let's just say it's a video of you and your product on a desk okay so now we know what video works we know this particular product works because we're promoting an ad and then you know this location works maybe the specific color of that product works but we never tested a different location what if we did a photo instead of a video so a pineapple or no or margarita or no so you know maybe video do a different style of advertising in terms of a photo do a video maybe do you already have a video maybe do a photo of your best performing ad maybe do a collection ad and set or a carousel ad instead of you know just a single photo ad you know right now your product is red in the picture you have a product that has multiple different colors try doing a green product you know your meat lovers the product is taken on your desk in your office take the photo of it outside in nature and show off some of the visibility in the environment and stuff you're in so what you're doing is you're breaking down your best performing ads and going after the more specific variables that's worked really well so for us specifically one of our clients sells this particular sign metal sign and you know we had two people holding it up and you know we're like hey this works great some you know some content of people in the picture and the sign so we started producing more content but not the two people holding the sign it was just single people holding it and it performed horribly so then we go ahead and we decided to get more pictures exactly like that just different environments and different ages of people and it built this really like this trend now to buy this sign and post it in the comments and works extremely well for us but anyway it's due through testing different creatives and going after the individual variables of why this ad went good and repeating those variables and testing them with other variations is what allows to optimize our ad account by producing better ad creatives so that's ad creative number one and you know your hamburger so again this is one particular ad this is your second ad you can go after all the different types of hamburgers people like you know swiss cheese or no swiss cheese some people like a very spicy hamburger some people don't so all hamburgers just different variations so break down those variations those variables inside of your main two or three ads sit down on a piece of paper and really think about what made these particular ads successful and you can find some really good breakthroughs inside your advertising campaign so that's how you can optimize your ad account better because you're going to produce better ads so cut your losses short produce better ads produce better what works and you can also do the same exact strategy right here for ad sets as well so let's say for example your best performing audiences is a is a purchase la 25 to 30 years old or 25 to 55 years old all for gender well break it up to female one for an asset for female one an asset for male break it down maybe to further ad groups you know age groups and stuff like that that's all stuff you can further break down further optimize the ad account so optimizing 101 is key before you're doing scaling you want to break down that account and spin maximize your current daily budget before you start to scale now scaling is super simple like i'm not gonna lie it's super simple the optimizing is the hard part scaling like look this is all you have to do for scaling i'm gonna give you guys the formula right here let me just uh you know kind of do a little breakthrough right here and that is simply roas yeah you know heck what let's just do a whole nother key all right so scaling let's do roas greater than and let's let's put lifetime lifetime roas greater than whatever your kpi is so i'm just gonna put kpi but let's say for example my break even or s or what i'm feel comfortable with scaling at is 3x then my lifetime roas is greater than kpi you know lifetime roas is greater than 3x then we're going to do increase budget by 20 percent boom and you'll run this once a day boom you can do this all your campaigns if you don't even want to be targeting campaigns make sure you also add in another thing for frequency if you're on a retargeting campaign you're a lot more susceptible or there's a higher percentage that when you start to scale your frequency is going to get blown out of proportion and when it gets blown out of proportion what's going to happen is is you're going to aggravate your audience so just same thing right here but also put let's do and if frequency less than 3.0 houston we're having a malfunction over here so if lifetime roas greater than kpi so 3x whatever your break even or whatever your roas is you feel comfortable with scaling increase budget by 20 and if frequency is less than 3.0 that's your formula for scaling the other way is simply just duplicating that asset or campaign at a higher level that's it but in order to scale in order to do this you have to do all of this first so you have to do all of this first right here before you can scale a lot of people want to scale without doing all of this stuff the hard work the stuff that takes time and is why a lot of people partner with my digital agency
