what's up and welcome to my channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have a new video for you guys today we're gonna be diving into exactly how we did three million dollars in revenue in the last 12 months for our e-commerce clients we're working with is a cumulative totals isn't just for one client granted we did scale two of our clients upwards seven figures plus first seven figures they have ever achieved inside their business so that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this video let's get started so this video is not going to be your typical case study in fact I'm not going to really talk much about break even ROAS I'm not going to be talking about increasing your average order value I'm not even going to be talking about look-alike audiences or anything like that so if you came for that the tactical stuff this is not going to be it because come on I've covered this in every video today is going to be a very strategy intense video and it's going to be more of looking at a business from a mile high and seeing exactly all the strategic moves we've made to really get the amazing results we do for our clients so first things first is understanding the product the customer avatar and the offer these three are like put together they're glued together they're always going to go together and you need to spend at least no less than 10 hours thinking about these three together so you start off with your product and then you have your customer avatar this is your ideal customer you might have two or three because you might have multiple personas that buy your product but what you also need to understand is what is your offer what are you offering people to make the purchase what is you grabbing their attention so for example you know the experience the offers the experience what experience are you offering to people with your products and you're gonna have to write down and test many different offers but for example for valentine's day we ran an offer where it's like a metal sign and you and your significant other you know you put your two names together and you know still cut the sign and stuff and you receive it and it makes for a really amazing valentine's day gift something very sweet the offer we're offering people is the perfect gift for valentine's day so we could also offer as the perfect engagement gift we could also offer it as a you know the perfect wedding gift so there's different offers and ways we can offer the product to our customer avatar and you know another way we've done in the past that sucked horribly was the perfect ornament in your living room or you know here is your excuse to purchase something to put in your room or something like that like hanging up your wall it doesn't really have much pulling power but the offer for the perfect valentine's day worked really well in 2020 we ran this and you know from january 14th to february 14th when we had 30 000 in sales for this particular product we validated offer etc in 2021 we ran the same offer again from january 14th and up today because right now it's not february 14th yet you know today's february 10th for us if you know i'm not sure when you're gonna be seeing this video and we've done 880 000 in revenue this wasn't because we learned more ad set and tricks like that i mean yes but the big key right here is we had a really great offer that people loved and we only run it here and there so with this you need to have a really amazing offer really great offer that gets your customer avatar excited to buy your product so this is key number one and your job as a marketer is to create these authors and craft these orders the ways we sell your products especially for clients and everything like that so you need to have really great offer what is what is the experience you offering to the consumer we've had another um clothing client of ours and the offer was just clothes that made them look good and feel good you know it was for the clothes that you would wear to go out downtown and have fun with your friends and stuff and you know that was the offer we showcased this offer as well by putting a lot of fancy cars and fancy houses and stuff in the ads and stuff to really jack up the perceived value of the clothing so the experience was the offer the experience of the offer was you know hey just some amazing clothes and stuff it's a luxury clothing line that's affordable the offers to look good feel good feel bougie feel classy at a good cost and you know ladies were tearing it up and that was the offer now we crafted the perfect offer around the product we communicated that offer through the ad creatives the copywriting all that good stuff so you need to understand what you're offering of value to your clients and you need to write down many different offers to your products and sometimes maybe one persona might have multiple different you know offers so you know if your persona is people who are doing facebook ads then you might have another persona people who are doing facebook ads who are stuck scaling at 100k plus then you might have another persona people who just started facebook ads and there's gonna be different offers for those personas because you won't have the same offer for all of them so you need to really understand your customer avatar the personas you're going after how they complement your product and the offers you're offering them in order to scale you know the wider more widely accepted offer you have so for us for valentine's day the perfect gift for valentine's day almost everyone who clicked on that had purchased and we could target literally almost anyone as long as they were in a relationship so we had a very large audience we had another problem with a gaming chair company and the offer we had was you know for a gaming chair and stuff but there wasn't that many people in the market every day for a gaming chair so the problem we ran into was that it was harder to scale past those certain thresholds so that becomes an issue um now understanding another thing is having a great product is another key with this another clothing line we worked with they had really amazing clothing all year round they had they it really complimented the offer the product you know the branding and everything like that and they decided to launch a whole new collection completely different from everything else brand sunk overnight because you know they only like keep inventory of what products they currently have in stock and they just do a new stock every week a new drop every week and the new drop they decided to do let's do a like a muff long instead of a one every week let's just do a muff long style a big drop everything like that the brand sunk overnight because people weren't liking the new products and didn't have anything else in stock and became issues tried everything with different facebook ads targeting all that good stuff nothing's really working so the you know the product just didn't fit with the offer and the branding anymore and became a nightmare so have a great product understand your avatar your customer avatar very well and understand what offers work really well for them as that's key for when you're scaling now going into copywriting because now that you understand that stuff everything else just kind of falls in place so with copywriting we wanted to test different angles depending on the market sophistication so there's five markets of market sophistication one is like people who are not aware second one is people who are aware they have a problem third one's like people who have aware of a solution then like the fourth one's like you know i'm not entirely sure on it but it's like aware of the um you know the company maybe they might want to be with and like the last one's like aware of who they want to go with and everything like that but they just need some more specs to like pull them off so some further details and what we do is we'll create different ad angles that represent this based off our offer so you know we have our offer put in place and stuff like that that would create different angles around that offer that suit each market sophistication so when we launch our campaigns and stuff we can reach more people so if we do like a cold audience testimonial ad we're reaching more people aware of the solution and all that we just they just need to know who to go with so here's a testimonial then another one it's like they don't they're not aware of anything yet so we're just going to slowly introduce an ad that slowly warms them up of what we do and you know how we can help them so each ad works with the market sophistication and this is a very complex topic to be talking about in this video and go on for a long time so highly recommend doing some more research on that i'll definitely have some more videos around that but otherwise we kept that copy around that and then what we also did is we kept it concise because in e-commerce the game changer is the creatives that play a big impact on it some products work really well with long form ad copy but for most products between 70 to 150 you can go with short concise ad copy with some really really good creatives now speaking of creatives creatives are king and 99 of brands are not creating enough creatives and 99 of marketers underestimate how many creatives it takes to really scale account scale a business for valentine's day the huge one the 880 000 a month we've had we we underestimated we we had 15 creatives created all different and all worked really well proven all that good stuff and we ran out of creatives like a few days before and we started running through issues where we're trying to build up creatives and we had to scale quick and create some fluctuations because we weren't prepared for that we didn't we didn't expect we'll do that much we knew we'd do a lot but we just didn't expect that much so having a lot of creatives available is very key when you're scaling really hard and a lot of brands and marketers underestimate that they underestimate how many creatives they need they under test the creatives and stuff like that it just becomes a whole big issue now you're probably thinking right now we spent a lot of time inside the ads manager when scaling and doing you know over three million dollars in a 12 month period for 2020 and in fact you're actually wrong you know we um first starting out i was on a lot i spent a lot of time in the ads manager i was literally like a day trader just in and out the ads manager and that's that's far from reality that's far from the truth and it's a a desire maybe a vision people have that's very incorrect you know when you're scaling and stuff i'm still only spending like once or twice a day in the ads manager and i'm not spending that long i'm jumping in i'm making tweaks i have exact strategy of what i turn off what i turn on based off a certain amount of days exact formula so i'm in and out in and out and you know i keep everything simplified i keep a good account structure you know we literally have four campaigns that we focus on scaling with um and then we have two campaigns for testing so we literally have six campaigns live at once and that's it we never create more campaigns we create a few new ads that's here and there that's it but usually i'm jumping in turning things off scaling things up and i'm also introducing new creatives into our testing campaign so we're not spending much time in our ads manager you know maybe 10 15 of our times in the ads manager the other 85 90 is all based off of creating new creatives new ad copy studying our market you know becoming more familiar with our product and doing more customer research product research all that good stuff because that's the stuff that's really going to move the needle if you have just a few basic systems in place to really run the ad account the big stuff that's going to move the needle is all the research further diving into personas and all that stuff we've literally tested our ad strategy from a hundred dollars a day all the way to twenty two thousand dollars per day in ad spend and it's worked extremely well from time to time again so finishing off i know we didn't completely talk about what you think we expect to talk about this video but i hope it was quickly in depth of exactly what to focus on as as you're scaling you need to focus on the bigger picture things a lot at least you know from zero to hundred dollars a day it's more account structure but from further once you start scaling it's more bigger picture stuff that you really need to focus on so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're an e-com business owner spending at least a thousand dollars per day click
