Today I'm going to show you how to fast track your Facebook ad results by spending less time in the ad account and more of what you can control that actually controls performance on Facebook. Yo guys, welcome back to the channel. If you don't know who I am, my name is Nick Terrio.

I run a marketing agency. We manage anywhere from roughly 750k to a million dollars a month in ad spend across Facebook. And today I'm going to have a cool new video for you guys.

Make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new marketing videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. With that being said, let's dive into the video. So spend less time in the ad account to make more money is essentially what this video is about.

Now, I want to first address something really quick. And this is something that I've fought many times. And it's something that something you guys could be in.

And that is your current mental loop. All right. You probably think about things like, Hey, if I create a better ad account structure, my Facebook ads will do better.

If I, you know, you might be reorganizing your account each week, which leads to very inconsistent weeks and days and performance with Facebook. You might be swapping different strategies and things like that. And you're, you're, you're thinking more of that thinking the way our ads were being ran is the issue versus just creating better ads will improve performance.

And lastly, just not giving enough time for things to optimize. Whereas this video is hopefully to give to you guys in the loop. I want you in is what ads do we need to create to hit revenue goals?

What are the next level ads that we're going to create for the business? That's going to allow us to spend significantly more. That's going to allow us to generate significantly more in revenue.

What creative cost slash copy can we create that will decrease our CPA, allowing us to spend more? How can we improve our business and be less reliant on Facebook for performance? And that's another thing that we can talk about a little bit later, but example, what that is, is all right.

Hey, let's say for example, we have a $25 CPA. Okay. It's not looking good.

Can you go increase your LTV to make more money off each customer you bring into the table? Can you go improve your AOV to also improve performance? Can you go improve your conversion on your landing page, your website and stuff like that?

That's also going to increase performance. So there's other things that you have to do, which will help you out with Facebook performance. And I wanted to first address this with it first showing you two specific case studies.

Okay. So this is the yearly spend for an insurance Legion account that we work for our work with. It's one of our partners.

And in January, we were spending a roughly $175,000 a month. And in April, we spent $339,000 per month. Okay.

Or, you know, that month. Now, obviously you can see right here, we basically doubled the business revenue in terms of like leads and everything like that. We also doubled spin.

And you can also see our, you know, CPL actually decreased over this period of time. And the big question is how was this possible? Okay.

And fun thing is, is that we never changed the ad account structure. Once we never changed the way we test ads. Once we ran the exact same ad account structure.

In fact, we actually ran the exact same ad sets throughout all of these months right here, but yet we spent more and how were we able to do that? And that is because we focused on things like building better ads. We focused on things that we can actually control.

Second thing is we ran no retargeting. We ran no interest or look likes. We ran all broads targeting as well.

Okay. So we purely focused just on building better ads, finding new winning ads, and just consistently doing it every week. All right.

There was months like March where we did not find a single new winning ad and we tested roughly probably 20 to 60 ads that month or 20 to 30 ads that month. All right. There was months like February, we found three or four new winning ads.

It'll also spend significantly more as well. So there will be some months you just don't find any new ads. It could just be mental ruts, could be creative ruts, things like that.

It could be multiple to the different reasons why. Okay. Now we'll show you guys another thing.

Self-advent brand right here. Okay. We did not change the ad account structure.

Once we ran the exact same ad account structure as the insurance legion account, exact same thing, but we went from $81,000 in revenue to $235,000 in revenue across what, five months. And you know, we're also spending roughly three X more, you know, three X more and spend three X more in revenue. Okay.

Now again, there was time periods like April and May where we're kind of stuck at this level. And then we saw a big quantum leap in performance. Why?

All right. Again, we just created better ads. That's it.

Okay. And we did it for a long period of time. A lot of you guys are like, Oh, I'm gonna go create new ads.

You go create new ads for one fucking week. You don't see any new winning winners. You're like next shit's bad.

And then they go do something else. I'm telling you guys a strategy that I know for a fact works. Okay.

We've done this consistently. That's the problem right here. You guys might quit midway of April, midway of May.

And when reality is let's say April, May, that's eight weeks. We didn't find a new winning ads to the last two weeks of May. So that was six weeks.

It was grinding, testing 10 to 12 new ads a week before we found the, in that last week of May, for the last two weeks of May, before we found those new winning ads that allowed us to scale to $235,000 a month. So things take time. If you take a step back and look at the macro level, it's worth it though.

Okay. So that's just one thing that you really need to focus on. And again, with these ads, we're constantly looking at why is this a winning ad?

Why is this working better than other ads? If this ad didn't work that we launched, why didn't it work? What's different about it?

Things like that. And we're looking at increasing the ads that we can, that we can spend significantly more on, because just because you have a winning ad does not mean you will spend a ton of money on it. All right.

You're going to have different levels. Each ad will have its own amount of spend that it can spend on it. And that's why as you start spending more, you have to really look for finding more ads, I can spend more money on.

Okay. Now the strategy we leveraged essentially to test this during this period of time was just one CBO campaign at a daily budget with one asset with all winning ads, with one asset for testing ads dynamic. And, you know, I'm just going to share this with you guys, because quite frankly, that wasn't the point of this video was to tell you guys the strategy we use.

In fact, it wasn't just this strategy. We did a mixture of dynamic plus our standard testing campaign structure, which if you don't know what that is, if you go look at my video of how to run Facebook ads, 2022, I have a seven part series where I do a testing campaign structure. And I show you guys how to do that.

And then I will have a video. I may have already been up by the time you're watching this video, but it's 4 million and 30 days. And that video, I go more in depth on this, but that wasn't really the focus of this video.

It wasn't the focus on the structure and strategy and stuff like that. It was just mainly the focus of, Hey, you know, we were able to do these types of performance right here with, you know, obviously this structure and stuff like that, but it wasn't the structure that allowed for this performance right here. It was the fact that we kept the structure and strategy the same.

And we didn't fall in this mental loop right here. We fell in this mental loop and we held that mental frame the whole time, even though when performance was bad and performance was good. When performance was good, we're testing new ads and building ads to continue to grow the business.

When performance was bad, we're still continuing to test new ads and build ads and better grow the business. We weren't allowing our emotional states to dictate our actions. We knew what actions we needed to take to be successful.

And we maintain those actions through good performance and bad performance. And that's what allowed us to go through things like this and achieve things like this. So guys, I really hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Again, it was mostly just really to focus on one key point to drive home right here. And that was stop fucking testing all these different strategies and structures and all this different stuff in your ad accounts and spending a ton of time on a daily basis in the ad accounts, trying to day trade shit, literally keep it all very, very, very, very simple. We way we run everything is we spend 10 to 10 to 15 minutes a day inside the ad account.

And the other amount of time we're spending on researching new ads, researching our audience, doing a lot of audience research to better understand their audience, building better ads, like researching old ads we've ran and stuff like that and figure out what made it work, what made it didn't. We spend a lot of time on the ad psychology side, which is allowing us to grow the business revenue. Okay.

You guys are spending a lot of time in the ad account, trying to day trade the ad account and substantially hurting your potential performance because you're not focusing on things you control. Okay. You're focusing on things you think you control and you're taking actions that are very easy and you're mentally wired to take actions that are easy.

That makes you feel like it might get a better result to make you feel good at the end of the day. Whereas the hard shit is building better ads and figuring out creative planning and things like that, but it's hard and you don't want to do it because it's hard. And due to that, you're, you're going back to the easy route.

So you need to focus on the things that's actually going to grow the business because fucking playing around ad account structures does not grow in a business. All right. What's going to grow the business is finding new ads.

They could spend substantially more money on to grow the business and revenue and ad spend and all that good stuff right there. But in order to do that, you actually have to do the work of building those ads. And that's what a lot of you guys are not doing.

So that's why we're going to really illustrate this and send this point specifically home. Thank you guys so much for watching this video. Again, I run an agency.
