The big lie about winning Facebook ads, no one tells you. First thing is, all ads eventually die. There's no once an ad works, it just keeps printing money.

Eventually ads do die, and the two biggest variables is time in the market and spend. If you spend $1,000 across 30 days, likely performance will be pretty stable. If you spend $1,000 in two days, likely performance might be a little bit more crazy.

So it's about time and spend. Second biggest thing is you have to look at is audience saturation with that particular ad. Each ad has an audience around it that resonates with it, and the amount of people you hit within a period of time, your frequency over a period of time, directly correlates with how long the ad will stay up and how well the performance keeps up for a long period of time.

This is why it's super important to keep producing new winning ads on a weekly basis. If you enjoyed this type of content, make sure you check out my YouTube channel, at Nickterio, more long form content of how to run Facebook ads in 2022. Thank you for listening.
