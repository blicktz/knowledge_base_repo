what is going on my name is mia and i wanted to film this quick testimonial video for nick so i just wrapped up four weeks coaching call with nick and i have to say it was one of the most powerful life-changing paradigm shift transformation that i've been through on my journey and i have to say that nick is um so incredibly smart so switched on when it comes to marketing and really knows the difference between how to run an agency and how to actually market and really understand the needs of his customers to provide the best experience so a backstory where i once was so i had an e-commerce agency i had around 20 clients i was providing them with a great service but there was a few things that i struggled with one was really marketing to the potential that i knew i could uh rather than just running ads i wanted to really market my clients products and really be different to any other agency out there and really understand my customers needs but i didn't quite know how to fulfill that vision and how to kind of go in that right step the second one was um the operations and rather really switching the paradigm of freelancer to actual ceo a business owner and how to run a real business a real organization that is systemized it runs smoothly max productivity in your team and um a really neat organization and then the third one was just my beliefs really especially with the pricing what i thought that i could do and my beliefs didn't really match the identity that i knew that i could become and what i could do so those were the three things that nick really massively helped me to overcome to achieve and now four to six weeks later we have built an incredible team of people who have amazing ethic who have a passion for the brand we have systems that save us tremendous amount of time effort and money our clients are the happiest i've ever been and they actually feel like their vision is being portrayed in the marketing it's not just running ads it's really fulfilling their vision and they feel truly empowered with the ads that are running and then number four is just the mindset the beliefs that i had around my agency and now i can really say with confidence that i feel proud of the ceo of the business owner that i've become and i feel proud of actually the organization that i'm running and rather just seeing it as you know a freelance business it's now a real organization that provides massive value that is systemized and is working like a machine that is changing the lives of women all around the world and it really is down to nick's training how much he cares the time that he takes to really go through his teaching the quality of his work and really putting customers and his clients at the forefront of his business so i just wanted to personally thank you so much for the transformation that i've achieved and i'm excited to work with you and continue our journey in the coming future when i need to get to that next level so thank you so much if anybody's ever hesitating about um investing in yourself and really investing in nick then really the question that i want to ask you guys is if you could do it by yourself why aren't you there and i think that's the biggest shift that we need to overcome is really dropping our ego and just admitting that actually i do need help and i do want help from an amazing expert because the roi is forever it's huge it's a life-changing so i hope this helps anybody that is watching this video don't pause kickstart on the program you won't regret it and in four weeks five six seven ten weeks later you and your business will be completely life transformed that's going to be incredible so thanks again and um take care take care take care
