Off Aliexpress Shop shipping website and everything I was trying to sell them for 200 And the only reason why I stopped Was because I spent about $400 on ad spend Got a bunch of added cards and stuff

massager Which I love Cause it works Absolute amazing Oh Fuck Oh Fuck Oh So if y'all never used one of these before I'll just show y'all how it works It's a simple on and off switch And then there's three settings on it Of how fast And it's not a massager It actually like goes As you can see it Like hammers And you can three different speeds And honestly it's amazing for sore muscles I feel like
