yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Therio today I want to kind of bring you guys like a little master class for writing ads for e-commerce this is going down into the copywriting area I've been getting a lot of questions for it especially like how do I structure top funnel bottom of funnel how do I write copy all that good stuff so I want to create a quick video for you guys I lie it's not really that quick but it's in depth and bring up some really cool stuff that I think you guys will take some amazing value from so that being said let's jump right into it so to understand copywriting the first thing you need to understand is what does it do in terms of advertising it's more than just putting a bunch of cool words together it's a lot more so this is what people typically think they think that hey this is your typical person average person we position a product in front of them and then boom they buy and they get to their desired state but the problem is people have a current state and desired state you think of a nice sports car and you're like wow I wish I could drive really fast I wish I could feel the power of sitting in the seat pressing the accelerator feeling my back go against the seat and feeling the car launch forward they want to get to that desired state so what we do is we just position a product from them and they buy but what we need to do is we need to communicate with them that this product will get them to that desired state so this is what copywriting really does so this is your reality people want to get here and they don't they're not just going to go to the product because they don't understand that that product solves that need so what you do is you take copywriting and advertising and through copywriting through advertising we communicate with them and we amplify those pains those desires unique selling points of the product you know the benefits just communicate with them that this product is the product they need and we'll get them to their desired state and this is what gets people to buy so if you're failing to do this in your advertising you're missing out on a lot of money and if you are effectively doing this you're generating a lot of money and you're probably doing way better row as you're probably doing more consistently with yourselves you probably have your brands probably growing very well um so yeah and also do I'm going to assume you have a proven product I'm not talking to the people who's never tried this particular product yet in terms of Facebook ads and stuff I'm going to assume that you are already running ads you've already got a profitable product and then now you just want to amplify the results and you're tired of testing new ads new audiences and stuff and you're actively failing to do something simple like copywriting so let's dig into it uh first off you need to understand the core components of copywriting because if I would just try to like show you an article full of copywriting and stuff you'll probably be confused and stuff like that so um copywriting is actually very simple once you break down the core components of it so the first thing is the headline the headlines job is to get you to read the first sentence the first sentence's job is to get you to read the second sentence so if you keep understanding that you'll understand how to keep flowing through with your ad copy but your headline is just to grab people's attention if you're running Facebook ads your headline is generally going to be your first sentence of an uh ad versus the headline feature that they have at Facebook ads um and you can actually test both of them and you know swap between those but your headline grabs people's attention attention it stops them and then it sometimes it can be a very elaborate headline sometimes it can just be a well-placed word at the right time in the right stage of the funnel to really grab people's attention so then there's unique selling points of a product and now just let me say that these are not in any particular order it's not like you need to write a headline down then write down unique selling points i'm just just for simplification just going down the list so unique selling points of a product is huge because these are the the points this is basically what makes the product different why would i buy your white cotton t-shirt when i go to the store and buy it for significantly less what is the unique selling points of buying that shirt what is unique selling points of buying a mustang gt versus buying a mustang 3.5 liter or ecoboost i think it's 2.7 whatever just you know what's what's the difference what's the unique selling points why would i buy that car wreck buy this car why would i buy this shirt for significantly more what's the difference so what you need to do is you need to focus on the benefits you you're gonna have to do a mixture of benefits in like the specs of it because some products people make them way too complicated by talking about the specs of it imagine if like iphone described their um mp3 player or ipod i think it was like what like a thousand songs in your pocket that's the benefit of it imagine if they said hey this is a ipod it has a 2.3 gigahertz processor with 80 gigabytes of 8 000 megabytes of storage buy it now like what the hell because you're not actively taking those tech specs and turning them into benefits that actively help the consumer so the consumer was looking for an ipod and they were very very techie and knew exactly sales points yes but we want to focus on the benefits what does this product how does this unique selling point benefit the consumer so for apple they did the ipod and their promotional message was a thousand songs in your pocket that sounds way better than just talking about the tech spec so would you what's a good idea is you need to figure out your ideal audience some people prefer the tech specs some people prefer the benefits so you're gonna have to dabble in with testing between the two of them now the next one is the pain points customers have or has so these are the things that are troubling the consumer right now what is the pain points what are the problems the consumers having right now um pain problems both both things you can like go together so call out the pains and the problems that person's having as if they're voicing in their own head so when you're actively putting an ad out in front of them and you're listing all those they're like what the hell you're speaking directly to me now the next one is beliefs uh these are like things just people have grown up with and just have naturally uh that you you may have to come overcome to to get them to buy so for example uh you know in the fitness culture an outdated belief is you gotta do a lot of cardio to lose weight that's a belief people have and it's false if you want to lose a lot of weight you don't necessarily need to do cardio uh you can do really anything you want in terms of physical exercise but you need to make sure you're eating in a caloric deficit to lose that weight so a belief is i gotta do a lot of cardio to lose weight i gotta eat salads to lose weight it's a belief so then i show them a diet that's around caloric deficit that's going to you know do the same benefit it's going to do way better results and they're gonna eat a lot better and then a position out in front of them they're like well wait i gotta eat a salad well here's why not you know what beliefs you gotta overcome next thing is objections this may be a price objection this may be a shipping objection this may be objection to the product um every product has its own objection sometimes it could be a branding objection hey i think you're a cheap or a cheap like drop shipper and i don't want to purchase from you because you're drop shipping overcome that objection with not necessarily copywriting but in terms of going ahead with content that positions you're with like an actual facility packaging up packages sending them out and everything looking very professional next one is social proof this one's super easy to do i mean this is literally just testimonials from your clients customers this is telling stories of how your product has helped each individual uh there's a lot of social proof super easy you guys should all know this um iro this would be something you would have on your shopify actual page your website it's just an irresistible offer they can't pass up like it's an offer they have to take now i know like for coaches and programs they'll do like you know the first 25 people who sign up get 50 off so like it creates that rush that sense of urgency to hurry up and go buy now guarantee this is a way to remove all risk from buying so for example i guarantee you that if you buy this course and if you don't make at least a thousand dollars in ads on from ads in the next year i will personally pay you back for this course and also give you an extra three hundred dollars on top of that so that way it's like if i fail i make 300 bucks so i guarantee will be different for every brand be creative with this there's no like boxes with this guarantee so yeah but if you can get all of these correctly put together and like i said there's just no straight down just hey i gotta start off with the headline i gotta start for unique seller points and stuff um i will go ahead and like write down like long form direct sales copy with with this whole format but it's not necessarily needed if that makes sense so now i want to show you guys something more tactical uh so like you understand these principles and stuff but you're probably like okay do i need to like literally write out long form ad copy like that on every single ad like what how do i apply that to my top funnel middle funnel bottom bottom of funnel so what i've been noticing has been working really well for me is i start off with top of funnel and top of funnel this is someone who's never heard of your brand before they're not aware of you but they may have a little bit of desire for that product so through facebook ads marketing um and targeting and stuff i can literally just you know target a specific person that i would think would have desire for this product and i can start just setting the seeds my top funnel is very soft in terms of selling i'm really just trying to grab their attention so i'll do like a catchy headline um a little bit about the product maybe call out a pain point so that way i feel like i'm speaking to them and a buy now button simple just capturing their attention this is going to give me a landing page view this will give me an add to cart this might give me a checkout initiated so give me a social media engagement and probably also a uh purchase i try to break even on top funnel always break even on top funnel and then as i go down i'll uh segment that up a little bit so middle of funnel is where i'm going to the social engagement audience this is people who's engaged my social profile uh instagram and facebook and what i like to do is i like to just do multiple ads um each one kind of target around specific things so i'll do one specifically for social proof i'll do another one specifically around objection handling another one around beliefs another one around just more information on the product so that way it's it's kind of and at the same time also like to lay it out over the course of a few days so like i might do the first three days just objections and unit usps that's like objections to that product like why i might not work for them um plus unique selling points by the product so that way i'm educating the consumer of like hey this is the product you need you know here's more information about it here's why it's gonna be amazing here's why your thinking's false about it um so yeah by now then after a few more days i'd like to go ahead and position more here's social social here is social proof because we noticed you've been checking all the ads and stuff but maybe you're just not completely sold on it because you're curious if anyone else has tried it before so here's some social proof then i like to go down to bottom of funnel and this is where i'm gonna go longer form direct response copy this is where i'll literally come there and maybe include all of this in an ad right here because these are people that have been very engaged with the brand you know they literally you know they went far into looking at this product and stuff so now i just need to further figure out what is preventing them from buying and i put this little bar right here because it's like shorter ad copy a longer ad copy and i kind of just phase you know as you go further on the funnel the longer the ad copy gets and because people are more willing to look at your brand they've taken higher bigger time investments with your brand so they're more willing to view read something from you um based off those attempts if that makes sense because they've already took high levels time and stuff with your brand like okay i trust this brand here's a long ad but it's okay because it's from this brand i love them so that's uh yeah that's how that works so now you understand that um okay the copywriting process now so now you understand the reason why we need to do copywriting you understand um you know how copywriting works um you know what it does like what's its place in the marketing industry then you also understand how it's laid out across different funnels you understand all the components of it so you're like okay great i'm ready to write some copy so what is the steps i need to take to go ahead and write some copy so first thing is you need to get clear on who your product is far so the best example i can give for you guys is i make these youtube videos because yes i want to give back to you guys i want to create some amazing content for you guys but also if you notice a lot of my videos steer away from here's how to set up an ad you know here's how to load up an image like i'm not trying to target people who are just getting into facebook ads i'm targeting people who've already been running facebook ads and here's how to improve what you're currently doing so that's what i'm focused on right now the reason why is because my ideal buyer for my digital agency is someone that's already running ads right now tired of doing it themselves and want to work with an agency aka me i position that type of content in front of them that's going to get them to be curious in it they'll see how much better i can do it than them and they're like hey i want to work with them so that's why i never focus on entry level stuff i like to focus on mid to high level stuff with facebook ads and stuff and give you guys this information to help you out and then yes i also do get some clients on side from it so you want to get clear on who your product is for and exactly what they're they're thinking is right now you know don't just be like i want to target people who want to learn facebook ads i want to turn i want to target people who want to learn facebook ads but not how to learn them but how to improve their current facebook ads right now so get clear on who your product is for uh then what you want to do is you want to analyze all your competitors and save all of their ad copy uh literally create like a google drive folder copy and like you know screen capture all of their ads so that way you have like a folder full of copy like 30 40 50 100 pictures in it of just competitors ads competitors ad copy and stuff and we can study that because if it's working for them you can take some ideas from it and use it to your ad copy to get you better results from beginning um it also helps you kind of like figure out what's the right type of tone to go to your like voice tone branding a lot of different good things come from you analyze all your competitors save all their stuff then uh you know just go over it here and there so if you have all your ideal customer then you study your competitors and stuff now sometimes are brainstorming what i recommend doing is going on the top of sheet of paper bust out a notebook on the top of your sheet of paper put pain points fill up that whole sheet of paper like you're literally going to write 34 to 50 pain points and you're going to force yourself you might write rewrite one two or three times but all of that that one is just kind of slightly rewritten and you want to do a bullet list don't try to write all of this ad copy in once don't start off with your headline then try to write something else you need to break up each one of these like psychology each one of these components you want to break them up on sheets of paper because if you try to write it all at once it's me miserable so you want to brainstorm like i said once one sheet of paper you need selling points another sheet of paper headlines another sheet of paper objections another sheet of paper pain points write out as many as possible possible as you can usually your last ones are going to be better than your first ones next thing is you want to do is you want to take all this ad copy now and start writing different variations of it so as you can see right here i have my brainstorm headlines objections and look i'm going one two twenty thirty one two twenty thirty and you know sometimes you might not have that many but what you can do is you can rewrite them in different ways that make sense more to the consumer um and then what you want to do is just start structuring variation one variation two variation three uh start structuring them in google drive like i would try to go with like four or five different finalized pieces so four or five different variations it's like for example we're writing this for one particular product i'll go with like four to five different variations then what you want to do is start testing start spending some money on it in facebook ads google ads whatever you're going after uh then what you do is you will have like two variations that'll work i mean that won't work you're gonna cross them out you know like variation three this is the winner someone's doing like a four extra row ass this one's on like a 1.5 this one's doing a 2x this one's doing really good so now what you can do is you can start making spawns off of this variation three so this will be variation 3.1 and you just simply change up a few little things just little little changes you want to figure out what why is this working you want to break it up and try to reinvent it try to make it better see what you can make it one percent better one percent better you know maybe you get to a four 4.1 4.2 4.3 x row ass so that way you're doing slightly better now and then again you'll do variation 3.2 um and then through all of that keep learning you know you want to consistently repeat your first 10 pieces of ad copy um your first 10 pieces of ad copy will be trash first 25 will be okay your first 50 will start catching people's attention your first 100 will start getting you the desired results so you may get lucky your first one might crush it you might not but it's okay copywriting is a skill just like facebook ads you gotta consistently learn so that's why i put keep learning i recommend books like how to write copy that sells it's a very straightforward book that allows you to learn a lot uh it's on amazon there's like breakthrough advertising which is really expensive 100 200 for that book but there's a lot of other just copywriting books on amazon that work really well um but also words that sells a really good book it's basically like a dictionary of book of words literally just words there's no it's not like something you read but just dictionary full of words that sell that's worked well in advertising in the past as well as phrases that sell due to sex same thing so keep learning then i want you to repeat that whole thing go back to your ideal customer keep studying keep studying you want to keep filling out ideal customer avatars because sometimes you might have three or four ideal customers for your business and then if you just keep going back over and restudying studying them you'll get a different focus and different perspective on them every single time you do that keep studying your competitors seeing what's new and do like what's new for them what they're doing keep brainstorming you might start thinking of new stuff for this keep structuring new ads so now you might you you can like think of more stuff of this based off of this um creating new structures like new variations and stuff that you can get and test and then you might even have like variation number 20 that's only like a 10x roas so it's just absolutely crushing and dominating so so i hope you guys enjoyed this video copywriting is definitely a skill that's going to take time to learn but once you do it it's very very profitable and one of the major keys to getting your advertising to work whether it's facebook ads youtube ads whatever platform you want copywriting is key now if you're a ecom business owner doing ten thousand
