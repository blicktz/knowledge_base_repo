yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today we have exciting new video for you guys I'm actually going to show you a little tip slash trick for the ads manager because a lot recently happened with the iOS 14 update and the reporting columns have not been working properly where you do not see totals at the bottom of the screen and stuff and today I want to show you a little trick that'll come help you out with that so you can kind of get your reporting columns to work I would say probably 90% efficiently without having to use any third party software so before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel for new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys so with the announcement of iOS 14 Facebook has done a lot of weird things lately you know verifying domains you have to get that done you have to set up these events now in the ads manager reporting has just been a nightmare lately but we've been managing with using third-party apps such as logging all of our data in Google Sheets and making our decisions based off of that right there just looking at total overall cost so our total overall ad spend our total overall revenue in Shopify and just making the best guess as we can with certain campaigns to turn them off and scale up as we can but recently I kind of discovered a new trick where we can actually get our columns back at again on Facebook so we can actually see the totals and stuff inside of the ads manager so let's jump inside of the ads manager right now so now we're inside the ads manager what we can do is we can look and you can see right here you can see the total spent but you can't see any of the purchase conversion value for a lot of these campaigns right here so one trick and the easy trick to do is simply go right here to customize columns and we go right here to compare in windows turn off include and or you have to actually click one first so let's do 28 turn off include and hit apply now all of a sudden you will get pretty much your totals and everything back and you'll see right here total for today 396 expense and then we have about 19 purchases 830 this is correct because we do when I do compare it against the Shopify revenue we're currently at about 1300 so we're a little over a 2x we're actually we're on 3 3.1x return on ad spend for today which is really good this particular account has a 1.39 break-even for us so right there in the green now what a 28 day click attribution does is it's basically if someone converted within the last 28 days of clicking one of your ads it's attributed to the ads manager so if we actually turn this away so let's go down and break down let's go to customize columns again and let's say if we do a shorter window let's do a seven day click and you can also even do a 28 day view if you want so let's do a seven day click and it lowers down a little bit so let's go over the last say seven days because you really need to look at a few days of data to really determine whether or not this is beneficial to you so if we look at a seven day click over the last seven days so we have a few days to really kind of like compare go to customize columns and let's do a one day click so we understand it's about a 1.66 ROAS right there let's try a one day click we're at a 1.58 now this particular product is one of those products you buy now or you don't buy at all we had another company where i was like a gaming chair company selling really high ticket chairs and we actually need to do a you know a longer day click to really determine the the uh the ROAS and all that good stuff so let me go back to customize columns we did a one day click over a seven day window let's do a 28 day click over a seven day window and see how that looks and it's about the same around a seven day click so but again just play around with this see which one works best go with a higher window so try to go to 28 day click um look at that right there you can also test a 28 day view let me just show you guys what a 28 day view is so let's go to customize columns and let's go to edit and let's do turn that off right there and you can see a 28 day or yeah it's a 28 day view so a view attribution is if someone just views one of your ads and then goes purchase from your brand so it's less likely someone's going to view one of your ads and purchase from you so it's totally okay we optimize based off clicks and look at clicks and stuff like that you obviously look you know you're missing out just on a few sales so i definitely look at that 28 day click and let's do 28 day that's the one i would look at if i was in your you know scenario and it's the one i'll be carrying over my clients and i'll hit customize columns um already got my preset pretty much saved so i'm just going to do conversions i'm going to do dash two you can name it whatever you like so there we go right there now we have our reporting columns everything is set up properly go to assets right there and we can see everything so try this it may help you out because i know with data and you know having the right type of data and be able to see and make these decisions and stuff you know with this ios 14 update i'm looking at huge data discrepancy you know for for example a few brands we're running ads for ads for facebook is the only source of traffic and their customer retention still the same their repeat customer rate is the same so literally the only variable is how much we spend and we've seen a drop in roass on the facebook ad side but we've seen an increase in roass overall and we're clueless and literally it's just because facebook is not always 100 correct sometimes they'll attribute more sales than they're they're actually responsible for sometimes they'll attribute less sales than responsible for and it's really hard to make decisions so that's why i also do recommend to use some type of third party software you can get supermatrix high rose or wicked reports this is definitely not cost efficient at all but for people that are really scaling their brand aggressively spending over 10k a month or making over 10k a month then i would highly recommend venturing out into one of these potential third party data processors as it helps you make better decisions of what campaigns are profitable and what campaigns are not so i would really recommend right now that you stay with looking at your total shopify revenue and looking at your total ad spend if you're spending across multiple channels then you may like said seriously need to get a third party processor uh for data to understand what you know what's going on but 90 percent of you guys are probably just spending on facebook ads and if you are doing multi-channel you're probably spending 100 bucks a day on google ads and stuff but some of these bigger brands we're working with they're spending thousands of dollars a day on each channel and then it becomes really haywire so if you're just doing on facebook ads look at your total cost of shopify look at your total cost of or your total revenue shopify your total um you know spend cost and ads manager and you'll be set to go so if you're an e-commerce business owner and you are looking to scale um and making over and you're
