what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick serio and today i have a very special guest for you guys this is a introverted almost uh nerdy guy in a way that went from introvert to a sales professional and then literally leaving the company going back down to zero and then building a hundred million dollar e-commerce empire throwing manufacturing and fulfillment guys this is one you will not want to miss and with that being said let's get started well josh glad to have you here man absolutely coming in from what hollywood hills louisiana to hollywood hills louisiana hollywood hills yes i know obviously yeah most people don't really know where i'm from but uh you're from lafayette louisiana yeah tell me a little bit just like really quick introduction of you who are you who is josh gory so i i've kind of done just about i guess everything i was uh went to college did the whole i grew up in a very small town parents say go to college make good grades you know the whole nine and um i was an introvert didn't really have any very you know didn't really have very very many friends in high school had a lot of people up you know that i was around but got to college studied engineering which made me more of an introvert and uh a friend of mine on the track team um got me introduced to this uh multi-level marketing company and um i was doing fairly well with it as a college student you know making 500 bucks thousand dollars a month here and there and um he had built this business up he was doing all the talking he was the extrovert of the business but he got accepted into dental school so he had to go and do that um and so i was at a point where i was like either i'm gonna have to learn how to talk to people or i'm just going to give up this opportunity to make you know more money and so um i went to dallas a friend of mine gave like literally thousands of presentations to the point where i overcame that fear was that justin it was justin yeah it was justin no well justin was the guy that went to dental school um so my friend anthony was the guy that i went to dallas with and uh literally slept on couches doing 10 15 20 presentations every day and most of them were just like four-on-ones like you and i are having and um for the life of me having a conversation with a person that i didn't know just i couldn't do it and um i and there's plenty of people out there that are introverts plenty of very very smart people that just cannot communicate how they feel and you know what they're trying to you know sell or you know what they're trying to convey um and that was probably one of the hardest things that i've ever had to do it was it was tough and but i know we were talking earlier about like adversity and stuff like that yeah and like your first that was that was not my first like point of adversity i had plenty of adversity you know pretty much my entire life but this was the most adverse thing i had ever done for like your entrepreneurship career in a way no it and it changed the direction of my life completely i would have never been able to build the companies that i do i understand people now i can i can watch someone i can see how they i can i pick up on the smallest little social cues because i've done it so many times i've been in front of people and so you take that guy that couldn't talk to one person and a year later speaking in front of 20 50 000 people on stage i would have never imagined me doing that um and get to the point where like you're hopping up on stage and not not not one thought about being nervous or like wanting to run off just that yeah you just got up there and just let's go and uh so did that built a really big multi-level marketing business and um i got to the point where i'm like i knew that it was almost like college like i've learned enough i know what i need to do now or at least i know that this is not what i want to do for the remainder of my life i didn't take the next step and so and and to be clear here you're like making good money right now no no i'm crushing it i'm crushing it yeah and so as soon as i decided that i wanted to do something different i basically got booted out of the company and um i was stupid i mean i'm 20 21 22 years old at the time um i'm going out every night i'm picking up entire bars tabs like i don't even drink i didn't even drink at this point yeah and um obviously i do now but um didn't even drink at this point i'm going out every single night just buying clothes i had like seven cars just stupid like you're i'm every like 21 22 year olds dream at this point is that when you bought the corvette yeah that's when i bought my first corvette i bought i had a g corvette uh bmw motorcycle i mean i had all kinds of stuff um so going from making a basically from i mean my parent i grew up in the middle of nowhere my parents got internet for the first time like a year ago so going going from someone that didn't really grow up around anybody who had money to now i'm making you know a lot of money compared to everyone else i've grown up with and then all of a sudden having that taken away without investing or diversifying in any sort of way the best things i did was i bought a jimmy john's and i bought a hair salon which i which kind of kept me afloat for a little while and um the only thing i thought was i would sit at my jimmy john's every day and i'll watch people come to the door and the one thought that constantly like like drove me crazy was there's only a certain amount of people that can walk through that door it is even if we wanted to sell a million sandwiches today you can't have a million people walk through that door i i resonate with that so much because like when i own my detailing business yeah before what i do i remember that i remember that i could only do two ceramic coatings a week you are exactly right and it would blow my mind because i'm like if i could just do like 100 a week i'd be making like 100 grand a week but i'm like i can't because i literally don't have the shop space yep but then there's like not everyone in lafayette like i just don't have enough room but not but not only do you not have the shop space but then like do i have the people do i have the infrastructure if i train the people to do this what's stopping them from going out doing it on their own yeah and so it's exactly how i thought about like people coming in and so all i could think about was i want to learn e-commerce i want to learn how to sell things online and i think the first i'm pretty sure the first thing i ever did was i drop shipped um leather jackets and i did i mean i and so i never never bought any courses never didn't really watch any youtube videos either i just like straight just just balls to the wall do whatever i can to try to get sales and i tried all kind of stuff like i would go i'd create like 10 15 20 fake facebook accounts go like all these ads from all these leather jacket companies so i'm getting constantly served leather jacket ads and then i would just post my web i post my domain in their ads this is before this is this is an interesting thing too because i've you told me this before and like i've never seen anyone ever talk about this before but but i think now facebook's kind of and i think you can like basically stop people from doing that no you can still do it there's nothing that's stopping you when i tell you i was i mean like i i was getting so i was i wasn't getting a whole lot of sales getting shit ton traffic um not a whole lot of sales but it was my it was my basically my first understanding of of i didn't have any money to spend on on ads so i was like how can i get free traffic to my site and so that was kind of how i started out then i was selling things on ebay um and then sold things on etsy for a while got kicked off of etsy um and it it trained i i each time i went to selling something different i went to leather jackets like fishing bait to bikinis bikinis was my first taste of of something good i've sold bikinis too at one point yeah and so i my girlfriend at the time i sent her to like victoria's secret hey pick out some bikinis and so she'd go buy them she'd come back i'd either send them off to china and have them um copied sent back to me you're talking about a 60 bikini that i could have made for two or three bucks and then i actually bought a sewing machine and serger and started making the bikinis myself i went to sewing machine classes serging like i learned how to do all this stuff myself so even though you're like you're making like really good money now from all your investments and stuff like that and you could have easily hired someone else to like do this for you you still went through it and like taught yourself everything like the soaping part at this point i was not making good money i i got kicked out of limu i had i had the jimmy johns that was kind of paying my bills it's making i was i was getting by but it like i wasn't going anywhere so yes i could have paid somebody to go and do it but for me it was more like i want to learn the insides and out of this so that i can train somebody else how to do it and um so did that for a while and i was constantly trying to find a product and then go and try to put it in front of people and listen to this one it was amazing how many times i've listened to these hour and a half long two hour long podcasts you know youtube videos and you get one little piece that changes everything and this guy said everyone gets a product and try to go sell it to an audience he was like it's the wrong way to do it find an audience that's looking to buy a product and put the product in front of them and so look for an audience first and so that changed the way that i kind of was going about starting you know these new businesses and uh i had two things in mind babies the baby market i was like people will spend a bunch of money on their on their newborn kids or weddings and i felt like weddings was probably the the answer because people spend ridiculous amounts of money that's not even their own money it's their parents if somebody's parents money they're buying groomsmen gifts or buying invitations they're not buying just one item they're buying hundreds of items all these you know all these other items and so um i wanted to get in that market i bought a little laser engraver got it in started selling groomsmen gifts and that was the start of complete full the very very beginning and complete full you would say is like your main company you own now yeah complete full is the main company i own now and um started that it was it was just basically selling on etsy very beginning um i didn't want to i didn't want to i ran facebook ads um every time i seemed to hit a home run with a good ad i'd run out of inventory we talked about this before um and so i and i was doing everything like i'm the one actually using the laser i'm the one packaging it up i'm the one running the ads i'm doing it all and so um after that um i got to the point where i kind of i kind of scaled to a point where okay i've i've i'm doing enough in the wedding business i need to venture out into all these other you know all these other markets anniversary gifts um you know babies all but i would stretch so thin that you know that i can't do this i can't do this by myself yeah and so the same thing that you you were talking about with the um the detailing and auto business was if i train somebody how to do this they're just going to do it for themselves so how do i build a system that's mutually beneficial and so that's when i decided i'm going to get into fulfillment and everything that i've learned i'm going to teach other people but i'm going to take care of all the the back end the warehousing the fulfillment the machines that you have to buy and make some of these items and so that's that's an interesting thing right there because you had the opportunity of hey i can just be the next super large brand or i can become the person that's actually doing all the fulfillment you know like a lot of people watching the channel and watching this video right now they know what aliexpress is aliexpress like that in a way you're becoming another aliexpress that was that was the goal it's like like a next level hire because you're actually going to make you back yeah because it's like all the problems that you experience from you know from dealing with aliexpress and all the you know and originally like it was it was great right you could you could drop ship everything in shopify kind of crack down on you know using a lot of that and so i was like how can i become the aliexpress in the united states where i'm making the products i'm fulfilling the orders and i'm helping people and i'm bringing something to the table that i wanted whenever i got started you know selling online and so every single day that's my that's my thought process if a person today watches a youtube video that says i want to start an e-commerce store i want to be the i want to be the person the company that is able to take them from nothing to something and then hand them off to you yeah that's you said a lot of good stuff there and i'm gonna circle back to a couple different things there's a lot of key things you said that we're gonna kind of go through um first thing the whole introvert to like sales rep everything like crushing in that space right there um what was it you know like this was just like one of the first things you had to overcome in your entrepreneurship career um and i know you said it's one of the hardest things you had to do what drove you when you felt like all this shit's going on like you know like this is this is really hard to do like basically i'm being a bitch right now i don't want to do this yeah like how did you push yourself and like hey like i don't care what you guys say just do it like how was that for you like what drove you to push past it was a little bit of what you said about the stop being a little bitch and just go do it um but also like i i like to look at the people that have built companies that i want to build a company like right take steve jobs for example right man was an amazing motivator he's an amazing speaker he was able to motivate pretty much everybody in his entire company built apple couldn't write a single line of code didn't know programming at all and so i knew if i ever wanted to be that person i was going to have to learn those things and i was going to have to do it eventually and so it was pretty much like i'm gonna have to buckle down and get this done and i i never thought that i would be as good at it as i ended up being because i and i still to this day don't feel like i'm that good at it i guess it for me it feels like i'm awkward on stage it feels like it's it almost feels like it's robotic to me because i'm constantly having to rehearse in my mind before it comes out like what's what's being said and done and um i just went out and and watched people that i saw doing it and i said if that person can do it i can do it maybe not as good as them but to some degree i'll be able to get there and i had this guy who's a friend of mine that i went and did a presentation for and normally like i said i'm talking to one person two people at a time and this was my first big like presentation he had like seven or eight people there okay and so i give this presentation and he comes to me after he's hey man he's like i've listened to everybody in the company give these presentations he was like that was the best one i ever heard and for me the whole time all i could think of was i ruined that i left this part out i didn't say this i was just critiquing myself the whole time while i was giving the presentation and after and i realized i was like it doesn't really matter if i don't say everything that i wanted to say but if i say it in a way that connects with people then nothing else really matters about you know all the things that i left out yeah and so that's when i realized i was just like if i'm passionate about what i'm saying and doing just that that passion alone people connect with not necessarily what i'm saying and and and in the context of what i'm you know how i'm saying it and so that's when i realized it's like i'm just gonna get up and i'm just gonna be me and so from that point forward i made leaps and bounds i wasn't nervous anymore i'm just like i may leave out two or three really important phrases but the message is conveyed and so that's that's that's what i learned from you know from doing that and still to this day like i still give speeches i have times where i'm at um like for our company dinners and stuff and i get up there and there's things i want to say and i leave out two or three of them but at the end of it people come up like man that was great you know you'll have like this whole like speech plan and then it's time for you to speak and you see the complete opposite no i'll go off on a tangent just but everyone's like that's amazing exactly yeah yeah i find that uh that's something i learned because over the last two years that's something that i personally focused on a lot was that like i'm i wouldn't say i'm an introvert but i've never been a person that's like likes to talk to strangers like i i two years ago i could not talk to a stranger to save my life yeah but over the last two years as a skill that i've been like slowly working on every day yeah and what i found and i don't know if you ever taken any like myers break tests and stuff like that but there's one particular one called mechanic archetype and if you ever heard of that one before but the mechanic is a systems type of person and you remind me of me in terms of like the systems aspect of how you do everything yes you're a wizard that comes down to that part so um for me i had to almost develop a system for like how to talk to strangers in a way yeah and that like immediately took me from like introvert extrovert like it gave me that sense of confidence because in a way i was passionate about either a what i was talking about or b like i had confidence in that particular system to work yeah so um yeah i understand what you mean about like yeah i have that passion and stuff but yeah just trusting yourself yeah no that's at the end of the day like you know when people say you know they talk about being humble like the ultimate confidence to me comes off as someone being humble because if i know deep down who i am and i'm extremely confident i don't have to say anything i don't have to you're going to you're going to realize and so that that's that's it's like uh it's a really good a walter payton quote he says when you're good at something you'll tell everybody but when you're great at something they'll tell you and so that's when you that's that's when the ultimate confidence is being is being humble and at least it comes off as being humble and so like i'm probably the most arrogant confident person you'll ever meet but most people are like oh you're so humble and i'm like you you don't know what's going on up here like because i know at the end of the day like you put me up against someone i'm i'm like i will do whatever it takes to you know to win and uh that's it's a that's a that's a hard hard um i guess point in life to get to whenever you you've but you have to like you said you have to struggle you have to have gone through enough things where you realize it's like it doesn't matter what comes my way it doesn't matter what curveballs thrown at me like i will figure out a way to you know to get around it you gain confidence in a way of your ability to handle when curveballs are thrown at you yeah you don't gain confidence by like you know sitting in the front of the mirror like you know today we're gonna do something great no you gain confidence by constantly overcoming struggles and so like before like you had met me 10 years ago before i started getting out and speaking to people i wasn't confident because i knew that like i don't have the ability to go and influence somebody and talk to someone and sell somebody on something that i'm passionate about but i know that now that i that i can and so that builds that confidence constantly overcoming struggles and someone that never had to struggle it's like um all the they've done a study on this every single child prodigy has never amounted to much later on in life because they never had to learn from the failures all they did was learn how to be really good at whatever what everyone else had already done that's a good one yeah and so i've i i've learned like i'm i'm like i don't think i've ever been like i don't think i've ever really excelled at anything i've just been above maybe above average or average at most things and then had to fight and call every single way to get to that next level that's one thing like i've looked at it's like there's another like quote of like you don't truly fail at something unless you give up yep and it's like you can have a whole bunch of little failures quote unquote but it's like what you do with that failure determines whether you proceed further be successful or you actually just go back to being you know the random person you are i remember for for everyone you know that's that's watching that you know has started a business or thinking about starting a business and i mean every single day i have people reach out and say i want to start this business i have this idea i want to do this and like i thought the first 20 businesses i started were failures but they weren't failures there were things that i had learned from there were stepping stones to build the person and the company that i have now and so like i wish everyone would just start just get start like fail a million times until you're so good and you've learned so much i watched the thing was today it was actually mr uh mr beast video and he was like there was like five of us and we just learned every possible way to fail and he was like there were five of us so in a year span we basically gained five years of knowledge because all day every single day all five of us were doing the same thing that's good yeah it was really good and so like you i i can't tell you how many times people come that work for me come to my economy with a problem and i have a solution for it like that and they're like dude you're you're a wizard you're a genius like and i'm like no i'm not actually i was like i've just been in every possible scenario i've failed so many times that i have a solution for this i know what not to do and so i wish everyone would would take that leap i think that's something that i truly started to embrace over the last year when i started teaching students yeah because it's like i never really took value in those many failures besides like okay gosh we figured out how to solve that we don't have to deal with that again yeah but then now that i have students it's like i look at it from a whole different perspective like damn that's really great that the 2022 nick went through that because now i can help someone save a couple years of their life for not making the same mistake as me i i think about that so much in my business because there are times where things come up and i i know exactly what to do but i only know exactly what to do because i made the complete opposite mistake years before and so all all the times where i thought that was a failure and i felt like a failure now feels like that just molded me into the person i am today and we talked about this earlier about constantly like how many how many you probably have a lot of a lot of like a lot of young guys how many people want to work and make money so that they don't have to do anything anymore only to realize that's not the goal you want to work and make money and be able to do the things that you love to do not not do anything i think that's yeah like that was something that uh i know like for me i had when i was a little younger it was just like i want to become a famous youtuber so i can play call of duty all day and make like call of duty videos yep and it's like at the time i wasn't putting two and two together it's still work in that sense right there i'm just doing something i love yeah now i do that now with like marketing and advertising and stuff it's like i couldn't imagine just having a lot of money and like yeah you can go travel you can go buy a lambo and stuff like that but like you'd be depressed after a month of living no it is not and i've done that like i i i've tried that lifestyle go out and be like okay i can buy anything i want i can have any car any girl any watch any house anywhere in the world do whatever you want to do and that's cool for a couple of days but then it's just like what now you know and that's hard to you know to tell someone and for them to really understand to experience that but i i i because i was the same way just like i want to want to work so hard make all this money so i don't have to do anything and now i do more than i did when i probably was younger it's one of those yeah you have to experience it for yourself it's kind of like you know like when you're broke for example and there's a rich person telling you hey money's not you know the the happiness etc or something like that it's like who are you to tell me that yeah it's easy for you to say that because you've got all the money yeah i i'm i'm like there's a lot of lessons that people told me hey nick you should you should think about this and then i think i'm a person i have to experience with myself and like okay i 100 agree with you know i have gotten in the past especially in the past year i've gotten really good at taking advice for people like that even though i don't agree with what they're saying i know they've been around long enough they've been around longer than me so i i try to put myself in their in their you know in their in their shoes and say maybe they're telling me something that is actually valuable that i can learn from that i don't have to experience it i can just skip to the next step and so um i remember there was a this video podcast i was listening to it was like the real test of intelligence is how quickly you can learn and change your actions so like right now if i told you if you touch that glass of whiskey i'm going to slap you or if i told zach he was going to touch his glass of whiskey i'm going to slap him and he touched that glass of whiskey and i slap him and he's like and he goes and touches again i slap him again you learn from that you're like well i'm just not going to touch that glass of whiskey like that immediately makes you intelligent but someone that keeps doing the same thing and it takes them how many times is it going to take you to learn this lesson and so for me i feel like that is the true test of intelligence like can you can you see somebody make a mistake and and not make the same mistake or do you have to make the mistake and how many times do you have to make the mistake before you learn from it is there any mistakes in your life right now that you tend to see happen over and over that you ever learned the lesson i i am usually very very good about not making the same mistake twice um i i try to take my ego out of that and and the probably the only the only thing that i would probably speak from that i would say that i can't give uh advice on would be relationships and uh i don't know there's there's only a very select few people in my entire life that i would probably take advice from on relationships uh but like for me like i know what makes women tick and and how to seduce them if you will but i don't know how to i don't know how to get to that next step so back to the c7 c7 c7 so my cousin and i both bought c7s at the same time and i remember we were at best buy one day and he like drove in front of the place and like revved his engine up like rolling the windows down music blaring wrecked his engine up and i was like how insecure do you have to be to do something like that but it made me realize i was like why do i have a corvette and i was like i'm just trying to impress people i didn't buy that corvette for me i bought it because i want people to see me in that car and be like oh look look at josh has now were you like big into cars like would you call yourself a car guy not purely just because oh look carvette it impresses people i'm gonna get it yeah pretty much what it was i'm not really i wouldn't really call myself a car guy i like cars i love cars but we obviously we've been in lambos yeah um i love cars um i don't really know much about them i couldn't i mean every single time someone asks me about my mclaren i have to ask a friend of mine that has all the information like what what's the zero to 60 like and what does what does it do and like all the questions that you know people ask and so i decided then i was like i'm getting rid of my car i'm gonna get rid of everything that i feel like i'm doing to try to impress people and this was at holland again somewhere 23 24 time probably um so that's tough at that age yeah i know it is that's the age where it's oh you were the you were the man at that age yeah right you've got all the confidence in the world you can't die you know you're you in and uh that was that was that was a hard pill to swallow so i bought i said you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna buy something that i'm i'm embarrassed to drive and so i bought a little chevy cruz and i drove that and all of my everybody in my life thought that things weren't going good for me they thought business was not going good they thought like oh josh is about to lose it all and it was better than it ever had been yeah and this was too this was after you know this is after this is after losing all my limu income this is after all the multi-level marketing stuff this is actually after struggling this is this is at the beginning of complete full where i'm killing it i'm doing really well i'm making the most money i ever have i mean i'm back i'm back and i'm back at making seven figures a year or you know netting seven figures a year and i'm driving a shady cruiser around and it was probably one of the most freeing things and not not at first it's it sucks at first right it's a lot cooler to drive up to a place when you got a sweet car versus dropping out of chevy cruise but you get over that and then you start making decisions based on what's going to be better for the company what's going to be better for me not what's trying to impress people what not not any of that it takes the ego out of the equation and that's whenever i decided that i would never not never but i wouldn't take a paycheck from complete full i was going to separate myself from the company my personal lifestyle will be paid for things outside of complete full i'll let complete full grow every single dollar that it makes i will reinvest back into the company and that was probably the best decision i ever made and it is it has allowed the company to grow and prosper as much as it has and so then you jump um year after that i've gotten to a like a 10 000 square foot warehouse thought that was the i thought that was it i was like i made it to 10 000 square foot warehouse is that the one on row three row three i remember that one yeah yeah so i'm like i made it and then two three months later i needed more space i got the warehouse across the street which is also about 10 000 square feet then i needed more space so then i bought the uh the old nabisco building that was 40 000. that thing was huge that thing was huge 40 000 square feet and then i was like i'm never gonna need more space in this within six months we had filled it up i needed more space and as a joke it mentioned to my realtor that i wanted to buy the walmart building and um you're talking the second largest walmart in the world 240 000 square feet and uh we've at this point we're getting to the point where we're we've almost filled it up but this has been i knew it was going to take a while this this this didn't happen in six months uh now i've i bought that i think it's been three three years ago i think so i think it's been three years around covid right yeah just after covid so i believe 2021 is when i purchased uh that building and then in june around june um so a couple months from now it'll be um it'll be the three-year mark yeah and just for things in perspective guys and like that are watching right now this is a whole walmart building and not just any like walmart that you typically go to this is the second largest one in the country or the world the world the world yeah the world and so most walmarts that you go in the average is about 120 to 150 000 square feet and that's um that's what the average is and so you're talking about one that's almost twice the size of a normal walmart and so it's it's huge and it is it had all the power all the space all the parking you can imagine and so it's allowed us to be able to scale up to a level that i didn't ever really see possible but with that being said like there were there's been plenty of times where like things have popped up businesses have popped up companies that have popped up that i wanted to i wanted to buy or be a part of or like partner with where i it was it was such a gamble to go into business with them that i was like i don't why am i am i and at the end of the day it comes down to everybody wants to get rich fast and if you can get out of that mindset yeah you can you can be young and have a lot of money but if your main goal is next year i want to be a multi-millionaire and right now i don't have i don't know like you're that's you can't do that you got to build that base first and we talked about this earlier about i want to be the best i don't want to be first i want to be the best and then later i'll be first and so what good is it to scale a business up where let's say you go from 10 million dollars a year to 100 million dollars a year revenue but someone else has a better process someone else has a better system someone else has a better product and maybe they're doing five million dollars a year ten million dollars a year in the long run who's going to win that battle reminds me of you know the blackberry movie if you haven't watched that yet i haven't i haven't watched it phenomenal movie highly recommend it but like blackberry was leading the whole market blackberry yeah i did watch that i love that leading the whole market yeah and then iphone comes out and they're like oh you know that's a little five million dollar company we're a hundred million dollar company yeah and iphone wipes them out the market because they went customer customer first and they said we're going to be the best and then we'll be first and they did and that's exactly why i try to focus on processes systems first and build the best possible system first and then then we can work on sales like if we have enough sales for for for to cover everything that we that we need to cover the growth that we're you know normal growth that we're experiencing let's let's focus the majority of our time on building the best possible company and people first and then scale it up because if you have a broken system and a broken process and a broken team it doesn't matter if you're doing a billion dollars a year you try to double that to two billion dollars a year you're just scaling up a broken system and eventually you got to fall apart like library did yeah yeah now how's complete full going now so you get into this building you uh walmart and uh after you know the lean you going into some jimmy john's investing everything start off in one building doing laser engraving and you know the groom has been gifts etc yeah then you start off like your own manufacturing you start bringing on people that basically sell for you in that sense right there and then now over the last couple years i mean what are some of the products you've expanded into like how do you how do you actually like you know provide value to the marketplace i guess you say what's your business at this point drop shipping and everything at this point i pretty much tell anybody we can make anything i mean we can't i mean it doesn't matter what it is we can we can do dtg embroidery we manufacture we do doll kennels we've made robots we've made drawings um oil field company parts laser engraving uv printing sublimation and our entire business is is based on building like we talked about systems we have we're just a big team of engineers it's like how like nothing is perfect we don't stop improving anything we cut it doesn't matter what it is even if we know nobody in the world is going to beat us at this we still try to make it better every single day and uh at this point like anybody that wants to start out drop shipping and like i know this because i i've done it like and so all these companies you know you got printful and printify i don't like every all the tools and stuff that they build for like it's because they don't they don't know what it's like being on the sales side and so i have an intimate relationship with selling on etsy selling on shopify like i know what people want i know what they need and so that's constantly where i'm trying to build and gear our team towards is saying let's build the tools or when someone gets started they can get started with nothing they don't have to invest any money up front and we can show them how to build a really good system you know on on etsy or amazon or ebay or you know any of these other marketplaces and then once they've made enough money then hey let's start running some ads let's teach you how to do shopify let me introduce you to my boy nick and so that for me and that's that's i want people to have what i wanted whenever i got started and so every single day it's like we can do every any product i want i want you to come to me with ideas and if we can't i want to be able to tell you this is ready to go and so now it's like we have a we have a big network of people that even if if it's a product that we don't do i can point you in the right direction because i want to help people you know succeed i want to help them you know make that money because eventually somehow we'll probably end up working together even if it's just doing the 3pl and doing the fulfillment side like well i love that it's that's that's the easiest part of our business you just go grab something put in a packet and slap a label on it that's easy and we have like the best rates for doing that so who do you say is like your i guess you could say like do you like to work with people that are already established in the e-comm space or are you looking for more people that like because you also said like here i want to make this as easy as possible for anyone just to get started selling yeah so are you looking for most people that are like brand new and just like oh you know i want to crush it like josh in a way yeah so i guess there's there's two sides of that like one i want i want to help those people that are just getting started right i want to give them all the knowledge they possibly can i want to basically let them have that taste of success early on so that it gives them the motivation to learn and do more do i want to be involved in that process not really i'm trying to automate that as much as possible so that i'm not spending my time trying to teach someone to go from zero dollars a year to a thousand dollars a year i'd rather personally work with someone that's already established so that i can say hey here's how we can you know help you but the ultimate goal is to take someone that does know nothing and bring them to a point where they've learned it all just like just i mean he started he's been it's been five years now um he didn't know what a domain name was and i mean he does uh 20 30 million dollars a year in sales on on pretty much etsy alone etsy uh he's got a little bit on amazon as he's got um the metal address sounds with you but that store doesn't really do um much at all but like his just on etsy and amazon and that like his story is what i want and everybody could do it he just he i've i've showed him something and he's just every single day creating listings and that's what he's that's kind of what he's kind of what he's mastered uh i wish he would step out and vitriol to new things but maybe one day will is that like different products or i i i think him like him and i and we've talked we've had this conversation a bunch of times him and i are different and it's like i like new things i like learning new things i like putting myself in uncomfortable situations he is one of those people that like he if you show him how to do something he will pound it and be the most consistent human being if i tell him if i told him you have to touch this glass a thousand times a day he's the perfect person for it he's going to touch that glass a thousand times a day yeah and you show him exactly how to do it he'll crush it um as far as far as going out and being an innovator and doing something new learning something new he's not going to do it unless i know how to do it and i can teach him how to do it that makes sense because i know he was in lemu as well yeah and that's why i like marketing is all about just like yep hey here's what's crushing for me you just go do it now yep exactly that's interesting it's really cool to see how you've you know because when i first came into your life which was like 2018 or 19 me and you first chatted yep and it's cool to see how like you were like balls to the wall with metal signs and now you're going more into hey like i don't want to be known for just metal signs you know it's like i'm trying to be more of an innovator in the marketplace and actually becoming a full stack manufacturer where hey i want something done yep we'll make it for it yeah and that's that like you have to take steps to get there and so obviously print on demand you know it's is a is a is you know a huge market but i realized early on if i'm going to compete in the apparel and clothing market like you're one you've got to fork out a bunch of money for clothing work on very little margin and be very very competitive with your software and everything else that works so i was like you know what let's not start there let's start on these items that have big margins that no one else is fulfilling orders for no one else is engraving and so i started there first got really good at all that and you're talking 500 to a thousand different skews there on items that pretty much no print on demand company offered so scale that up got to a point where hey we're making enough money here now let's do apparel now let's do hats and then now it's full like you said full-fledged manufacturing so but we got doll like we've got doll kennels jewelry i mean the jewelry process is one of the most complicated things you could possibly do you're talking about taking stainless steel cutting it electro polishing it electroplating it assembling the necklace itself um and being able to do that for six dollars a necklace i mean like if you saw the whole process you'd be like how in the hell are these people doing this for six dollars and then that's a necklace you can sell 70 to 100 no yeah for sure i mean it's it's actually gold plated and we've built really good processes to make sure these things are great yeah you've mentioned some cool stuff to me i mean like necklaces so anyone watching this video right now if you need a new manufacturer in the usa for necklaces josh is your guy yeah i know um we talked about acrylics because i have a student who's big into the acrylics you're like hey i could probably literally do it for significantly cheaper than what he's doing it oh it's making himself it's to the point like we've automated things so much because that's that's we try like i said earlier we try to be best first and so we've automated things to a point where when we give people our prices they're like oh your quality must be bad or like this you know there's like there's no way you could do it for that cheap it's just because especially in the usa exactly they're so used to everyone else having such big margins we're like our canvas our acrylic prints our coffee mugs i mean just it's like we've we've just absolutely destroyed everyone and that's why our business has done so well is because it's easy to go pick up a client we're like we can do everything that you're currently doing for half the price half the processing time and better quality and they're like it's a no-brainer it's easy to pick up clients whenever you're able to offer that you know kind of business and it's it goes back it goes back to like you said the blackberry story like everyone else i feel like in our in our business is the blackberry and we'll just where the with the iphone coming in saying all right need you i need you and kind of going from there so as you're building this business and everything what are the types of not necessarily like we already kind of went over like the types of people you want to work with in that way but what are like the main products you're right now like like let's say for example i'm drop shipping something right now i'm watching this video what am i selling that you're like hey you should come check out some of the stuff i have because i may be able to give you a better rate yeah so um doormats are probably one of our biggest products these things these things absolutely crush we do a lot of decor we do this for kirklands hobby lobby with a few other drop shippers so anything you know canvas print wood frame with the into the bag and you see a bunch of like scripture and all kind of things that people are selling with those um the acrylic signs like you mentioned jewelry is another big one and jewelry is one of those things where in the off seasons it's not so it's not so popular but you look to valentine's day or christmas we're doing 15 20 000 pieces a day and that's that's that business is huge but now it's more like we can do everything so i won't and i want people to like say hey here's what we're doing how can you how can you make this better that's where we perform the best where it's like people bring us problems and we're like let's let's figure out a solution to this right you're you're already selling it like how can we make this process better and even if even if you don't work with us like i i just i i like that's our bread and butter like how can we make the process better every single day for for you then that way that we learned the next time this comes around we're better we know now what does one's review process look like when it comes down to how can we make this process better like and what's what's what's the kpi on that is it speed every everyone at our office hates me uh because we spend so much time trying to help people and don't get paid for it but like what they don't understand is we learn so much in that process to make not only their business better but our business better and also all our other clients business is better and so usually like let's let's say like um the jewelry thing so most people are drop shipping jewelry from china and if these people are doing 10 15 000 pieces of jewelry a day sell them at 50 60 a pop whenever you're drop shipping this from china your lead time is a couple weeks because it's gonna like in china whenever they're making these jewelry whenever they're making this jewelry every step of the process is a different plant so you have a a metal fab place that's cutting out the jewelry you have an electric polishing place you have a electroplating place you have an assembly place and then you have a packaging fulfillment place they're all different locations completely different businesses and so we've got this all in-house and so not only are we able to offer it a lot faster processing time to actually make and manufacture this jewelry and i think we do that in one we're on average one to two days right now and we usually peak season i think it's three days our shipping time you order something from china how long is it going to take to get there and so whenever you're shipping things out for christmas 10 days at 15 20 000 pieces a day that's a lot of money yeah and so maybe it's a little bit more expensive for us 10 months out of the year but how much more money do you make getting an extra 100 200 300 000 pieces or orders yeah yeah and during whenever you need it and so that's where we win and so and i think i if i had to guess i'd say that even the china calls like we're on we're on par with them and they haven't kind of disclosed those numbers but um i i can't i can't see them being any better than us especially the processes they have to go through that's phenomenal yeah i think that's something like anyone can do like in their business it's like you have a variety of systems and processes in your business to achieve certain results and it's like just go reanalyze those over and over well our like main focus is like we're not like we have we have a plan we have an algorithm that we use to figure out what our price is we don't negotiate on price we give the best possible price out the gate this is what we can do and and if that works it's i can't stand the back and forth like okay we can do 100 bucks okay well we'll get this other guy that can do dining okay we can do 89 yeah okay we're gonna no no here but we can do 50. here you go done deal let's do it and so it it takes out all of that back and forth that's old school business i feel like that's that's the way that people used to do business in the past and so like i'm done with that like let's just give you the best possible price right out the gate let's get this over with and so that's that's kind of how you know we do business and we make yes our margins are slim but we i i know that because i've been in the sales game and the cheaper i can fulfill orders for you the more product you can sell so that's what i think it also goes back to what you said earlier about not being in a rush to get rich yeah because you know if you were in a rush to get rich you would be more hesitant of giving the lowest price in the beginning because you're like i'm trying to make as much money as i want off i can't off this dude yeah and in a way it's kind of goes back to like dating and stuff like that if if if you really want that girl guess what she's probably not going to want you whereas the less of a i i need to care in this particular case about like a certain number and we can give you just like here you go here's what you want boom like the more likely to do business which is the more likely you know they'll stay around they don't buy and if you could get in business and not pay yourself anything or at least hold out on taking a paycheck that company is a lot more likely to succeed later on like i can't tell you how many times we've done we've done runs for thousands millions of dollars and made zero profit maybe even lost money on the initial run just to figure it out so that we get this client we make them happy and then figure out the system to make maybe it's five percent maybe it's ten percent on the remainder of those orders but like you have to make that investment first you can't say oh i'm going to take on this and uh well it's going to cost us you know a hundred thousand dollars to figure this out so i'm going to charge this to the customer yeah no take that hit yourself figure this you know figure it out take that loss and then because because then because then what you're making that you're making that person happy you're getting better as a company and then after that then you make your money yeah yeah and so that's that's i wish like people understood that like you don't have to get rich fast it's going to come i think there's levels to that in a way of like you know like when people want to get rich fast usually a lot of them are like in a position right now where they have 500 dollars to their name yeah they struggle to pay bills from off the basis so it's not that they want to become rich fast they want to be able to literally support themselves that's in a way of just like our natural like survival instincts in a way yeah but like rich to me is like someone like a million dollars a month profit you know like you're doing 12 million 10 12 million dollars a year paying yourself like you're rich in a way but like 30 grand a month i think at 30 grand a month i think they did a study where i was like that's where you peak at like you your happiness gets exponentially better the more you make until you hit 30 grand a month i watch and then it actually like just levels off no it does very little i watched i watched a really good um it was a really good series on this and so at every income level everyone said what would make me happier more money and so for someone making 30 000 a year if you started paying them 40 000 a year they actually were happier for someone that was making 40 you started paying them 50 they were happier but once you're able to do everything then it becomes a level of convenience not happiness because if you're making 150 200 000 a year you can do pretty much everything yeah but then it becomes a level of how fast can i do these things do i need a private jet to take me to these places do i need to fly first class do i need an exotic car and so those things don't bring any sort of happiness because now you can do those things you're just able to do them in a little bit better way i think that's the one thing i've learned is like once you make more money the only thing you get access to is cars nice restaurants cool destinations yeah but then once you go experience them it's like okay cool like this isn't actually as fun as you thought it was going to be like it is amazing to me that all these things that i thought i wanted is nothing remotely close to what it actually like is actually what i want once you get them but you you this is the only time you ever realize that the only time you ever realize that yeah like the restaurants the cars it's like when you make more money that's all you get access to yeah exactly and and it's it's really cool the first couple of times absolutely and so now i've got to the point where like i kind of live vicariously through the people that i get to bring with me i get to watch their excitement i get like my parents like i get to bring them on trips and stuff and like watching them experience something for the first time is is is better than me experiencing it for the first time and so that that is really fun i i i love doing that and like today so you you didn't see this but i did so like obviously i like we've got nice cars like i drive my mclaren like i'm driving i bought that car for me like i don't care what anybody sees or you know says or does or you know how cool they think that you know i am or how cool i think i am when i'm driving but today i like pulled off on the shoulder like whipped around a bunch of people and like if i'd have been in any other car i'd have pissed everyone off but because you were in a lambo and i came up behind you in a lambo the car behind me i saw them they started laughing and they pulled their phones out and went to recording and like their kids in the back were like all standing up like all excited and like watching people see things and like get happy and excited like they're all filming like that just brings you're putting good karma out there yeah it brings it really yeah yeah there and so like they're they were having fun we were having fun and like i i enjoyed that we weren't we weren't trying to look cool or impress anybody it was about like they were they were enjoying they were smiling i i just i loved seeing that it was it was it was it was pretty neat i love that but yeah it's like at a certain level you're gonna realize okay hey money isn't everything and i really do believe what those are one of those things that you won't believe anyone until you experience it no that that's that's a tough one to to really understand it and you're gonna go through phases with it too because i know like for me like i got depressed for a little bit of time when like i scaled my business up i hit a level like holy i'm making a lot of money for a month i automated everything in my business where i'm literally like all right i can do nothing the whole day yeah i lasted three days and then i was like i hate my life like i don't know what i've been doing with my life what's going on yep and i was like why because i removed everything i love to do which is work and build on my business yeah yeah and like you you don't realize that like you you work so hard to do less but what you really want to do is work so hard that the things that you do are more meaningful yeah and there's there is people that's like watching this video right now but they may be working like i have a i have some students who are working like 60 70 hours a week for their business and it's like i hate it so much like why because i work so much it's like you love your business you just hate the key actions that you have to work on in your business so it's like that's when you start discovering systems and hiring the right people to where you can only focus on the things you love yeah that makes a huge difference and i don't know like i know like for me there have been times where like i've avoided i've avoided doing some work some part of the business that i don't really like to do and i'll avoid it for a long time i'll procrastinate and sometimes procrastination is a good thing but one thing that i've noticed is like everything that you want everything that you want your life to be is usually in the small things that you aren't doing that you know that you should be doing it's that work that you don't do that you're putting off you're doing the fun part of it but you're not doing the finishing touches and so i i find myself doing that a lot we're like i'll do the fun part i'll do i'll do the hard part because the hard part is fun but the boring monotonous part that i know that only i can do i'm like not yet and as soon as as soon as i get to the point where i finished it and i i finally pushed myself to get past it i'm like why did i do this sooner i i i find myself doing that a lot it's been that way for my pretty much my entire life that's amazing yeah but as soon as as soon as you do that work and you see it and you're like damn i should have done that sooner i i do that all the time well dude this is phenomenal man uh definitely a lot more than like i wasn't like i didn't really know what to expect you went to this one but your story is amazing and i really appreciate you uh sitting down coming to california with
