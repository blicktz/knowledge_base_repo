so yo yo happy monday everyone it's money monday today and i thought i'd take you guys through today with you know what happens on a monday running an advertising agency and all the stuff that goes on and all that crazy stuff so right now we're getting started with uh going in a little workout in and i'm gonna take you guys with me we're also in the c8 today i typically take my c8 every morning when i go work out somebody's sipping on some little pre-workout right now so getting it ready to get you guys a little pool i think we should be good right here oh it's bright so i'm gonna finish my pre-workout currently sipping on some pr labs pre-workout this is part of the pre-workout i've been using now pretty much all my life our last couple years this angle this lighting looks really bad let's see if i can fix this real quick all right sweet that's so much better right there but yeah we're about to get in a little deadlift today and we're gonna go through my schedule today we're gonna go through some of the ads i'm working on today we're gonna go through some of the sales calls pretty much everything we take you guys through all that good stuff and maybe a couple other things to be talking about i'm not really sure yet the theme of this vlog yet but we're gonna figure it out also i get a lot of questions do i prefer the urus or the c8 and honestly i really like the c8 i have a lot of fun driving the c8 but for like short little trips and then urus i like it's like my daily driving around every day but yeah definitely every morning when i come to the gym whether it's boxing or weight lifting today we're doing weight lifting but i'll kind of do a mix but i definitely prefer c8 in the morning about to go eight sets three reps for 245. about to chalk up so we'll put the foam down until we get back home so yo what's up dogs you already go outside dude you almost knocked that thing over go have fun so i figured today we just talked more about like day in the life and because it's monday it's a heavy work day today so i always wake up every day at 6 30 regardless if it's saturday sunday wednesday thursday whatever i always wake up at 6 30 every day and i go to bed every day at 10 o'clock and that helps out a lot with just keeping your body in the correct circadian rhythm and stuff but i always like to start off the morning with a workout three days a week i do shrimp training and then three days a week i do boxing today was a shrimp training day tomorrow will be a boxing then shrimp training boxing shrimp training boxing so that's just kind of like the general layout of my training goes and just ordered some food so you'll have to see what type of food i just ordered i like to eat a big meal in the morning and then just pretty much crush out nine hours straight of work food's about to get here let's go see what we got while i wait i like to kind of scroll through some of my groups and stuff this is the active marketer group right here uh it's my free facebook ads group and we're actually planning on doing a live training with you guys basically once per month where i'm gonna hop on a live call with all 2 000 of y'all yeah right now just kind of planning out the times of uh when we're actually going to do that call so that's a free link below called just literally free community chat and then let's see we got my inner circle group got a few questions i'm gonna go through here in a second but i just dropped a fire sop last night for them on iterations and variations yeah this is my paid group this is the thousand dollar a month group currently got 70 people in there right now this is a great group if you want direct access to me like i literally in this group and i'm answering questions giving them detailed feedback all the key things they need to be doing to scale their facebook ads but i'll be down below as well you can apply to join we only want elite level a players in there so if you're not ready to put in the work in do not get in there i'm also running around and reviewing some content from one of my content creators just paid her to film a few videos so we're about to see a live reaction to package two let's see this if hot drinks make your teeth hurt this gum is your solution that pain from hot coffee or tea means that your enamel is worn down leaving nerves exposed for me even casual work days became uncomfortable once the sensitivity kicked in after my coffee arian gum is made with nano hydroxyapatite which is the same mineral that your teeth are made of and is backed by real science so the results don't lie chewing it daily helps rebuild enamel balances mouth ph and reduces sensitivity in just weeks no toothpaste no expensive treatments needed and no need to put life on pause that's pretty solid right there i like that i like the key thing i like about this is that um she did a lot of transitions this is the one thing i never forget to pack traveling can be rough on your teeth long flights hotel coffee wine at sunset it all adds up to bad breath sensitivity and stains that's why i always bring arian gum it's made with nano hydroxy appetite to rebuild enamel and natural ingredients like xylitol and spruce sap to fight bacteria and keep your mouth balanced it's a realistic and small habit that makes a big difference in how my teeth feel no matter where i am in the world this is awesome i love this something we've been doing with our content creators is we only give them one hook and three key talking points to flow through now and the quality has gotten back so much better this girl's her name is kristen she's actually local to me and i got to sit down with her like an hour and just simply talk like like tell me everything you hate with working with brands tell me everything brands do wrong when they give you briefs and stuff like that and the biggest thing she said is that people are too obsessed with trying to micromanage creators and this makes me think back at this one particular student comes to me one time and he sent me over like a five page long brief he was sending to his content creator it was so specific that like yes anyone could follow it and not up but it was so specific and so detailed that it put so much pressure on the creator and it made the footage look robotic your content creators that perform the best are going to be the ones that's literally creating content based off just like a couple key things they need to flow through have a strong hook that they repeat and then from there the rest they can fill in the gaps with their own creativity and that always gives us the best success when it comes down to working with ugc creators and stuff so this creator she did an amazing job with that i just gave her a hook i gave her three key talking points to flow through and then she did everything else now as far as the b-roll and like the filming in the cool locations and stuff this is where it comes down to auditing your creator and understanding what type of content they create before you even work with them so like before i hire a creator i scroll through their instagram i scroll through their tiktok and i just basically have to understand that when i pay this creator that's the exact content that i'm gonna get back and if i already don't like their content when i scroll on their instagram or their tiktok or their facebook then i should not hire that creator because i'm just gonna get the same content back and i'm gonna be disappointed so those are some key things right there it's gonna help you win when it comes down to working with content creators and i think my food's here so let's go ahead and get that all right finally sent to the desk now surprise we got chick-fil-a i don't know if you guys thought we'd probably get chick-fil-a for breakfast i got another water i like to these little element packets in the morning element tea not sure if uh y'all heard that so i'm on second water today already i'm huge when tracking my water so i'll try to get a gallon in every day which is three of these fiji's and then i do like two or three or yeah one or two sometimes above the uh sparkling water so it comes just under a gallon it's like a hundred and like one or a hundred and uh 105 ounces of water i do a day you know just to stay hydrated and stuff like that but anyway let's see we got some chick-fil-a uh it's usually kind of like the first thing i sit in the morning it's 8 53 a.m right now just for context and timing purposes it's where i sit at my desk eat some food and then i'll typically scroll through a little bit of like instagram it's kind of like my scroll time and just kind of go through and honestly just scroll there's really no like intention behind it while i eat now share what you got from chick-fil-a chick-fil-a i literally been doing this now for over a year i started this in i don't know i think april of 2024 it's currently may of 2000 or june of 2025 but i get the chicken burrito chicken breakfast burrito i'm usually tracking all my calories and stuff each day and currently i'm eating like 1900 2000 calories a day and that burrito is 400 calories now most fast food is not completely correct for the calories they're given like a 10 to 20 wiggle room to where it could be 10 to 20 higher or 10 to 20 less so it's not perfect but just for me it's like chick-fil-a has never lied to me they've never messed up my heart before they're truly nice to me i'm just gonna assume they probably actually are pretty close to that like five to ten percent accurate 400 calories so i usually eat this and then i pretty much just go all day to like almost 6 p.m if i'm eating again i did try fasting for a period of time where i just did eat to like one or you know 12 one o'clock in half and a half but i also got to uh fruit as well but what the problem with working on the morning for me is that i push myself hard during the workout especially on boxing days too where i am completely soaked and drenched and stuff like that that's uh i need something like a core source and i need some type of like just fuel after that workout or i'm just like brain dead by my computer all day i don't know the people that tell you like hey work out in the morning gives you more energy like that's so much right i get that like 50 true depends on the workout some days when i push myself too hard it's like the worst thing for like my productivity and stuff like that so but yeah so i'm gonna get some food and then after that i'm actually gonna take y'all through my calendar for the day so we can actually kind of see what's planned for today and uh how i kind of set up my day for success in that sense okay so this is the first thing i like to look at every morning is my calendar and my calendar pretty much tells me what i got going on for the day i do a lot of repeating events so if i come like right here this is a repeating event you know just literally wake up daily and then like for example personal time this is a weekly like a repeating event as well or daily repeating event as well yeah so i do a lot of repeating events and then i do a mixture of tasks up here where if you click like up top here you can create a task and then boom and then you can also do like a repeat as well of how much you want that to repeat and stuff like that so first thing i like to do is come up here i like to just start knocking things off on this list so like for example we already worked out this morning i just took my vitamins earlier i do my blood work once per quarter and they give me prescription vitamins specifically to my blood work to help perform i also prayed already this morning i did that before i actually started vlogging and stuff and then you can just kind of start seeing like all the different things i gotta do today and this is my to-do list and then like right now we're about to jump to our upload our ig reel i've been hitting my instagram content really hard so i'm about to take you guys through that but just to kind of bring this up let's just look at one particular day actually let's go back to the week so basically all of this time i have right here in the morning i focus on this one just kind of quickly getting through a couple of messages before 10 a.m and then from 10 a.m to 1 p.m this is where i do my deep work so this is where i'm like studying not studying but i'm going through doing some research i'm writing some ads i'm making sure clients are getting results so just anything i can do right here this time to get client results that's what i focus on and then i have calls between one of four every day and then from here from 4 to 6 p.m this is just like low level tasks that's like you might spend some time like learning and you know responding back to some emails and then get up to just really light work right there and then from 6 p.m to 10 p.m every day this is personal time so this is basically just means that anything i want to do outside of work this is what i do between 6 to 10. this is how i avoid burnout because i literally do this every day like every day i work there's not a single day i don't work but i've manufactured time where i just don't do any work in my day today to where i'm like yeah i can't wait for the next day till i get back in and start cranking out some work and stuff like that so yeah highly recommend google calendar and time blocking things off like i have things literally like i do every week on like sundays and saturday you know film like youtube videos and some of these things like explore ideas it's just me like doing like exploring new tools and stuff like that maybe when i add to the agency and stuff literally when i go to like church parents house stuff like that so yeah like everything is put together and all the free time between wake up and personal time that's not in meeting is things where i just focus on high revenue driven actions to get my client results and student results so now let's actually make our instagram post all right this instagram marketing agency not too long ago today's this is month one with them and basically just going through here they send me a new reel we'll post every day today we have nick 17 is the one they want me to post let's check this out real quick you guys will preview hey what's going on ads and stuff like that marketing i feel like what did you do to get like this is gonna be an interesting one called facebook i don't know how this one's gonna do because it is kind of a little bit more like it's not as organic as like a typical line but uh we'll see we'll see let's go actually go and make this and post this now so because today is also a youtube day as i have a new youtube video uploaded today there's actually a couple things i need to do so we're gonna go to your videos right here got my new video that i uploaded today i'm gonna click on share for that i'm gonna copy that link i'm gonna go to link tw.in or dot in and i'm gonna paste that url right there i'm gonna create a link this is really awesome because if any of you guys use youtube or do youtube this is really good to have because it allows you to basically go ahead and keep it open in the app and then next thing i'm gonna do is go to twitter i'm just gonna go and paste this like this there we go i'm gonna open that up now i'm just gonna screenshot that screenshot boom now i'm just gonna delete this because i don't want to keep this on now i'm gonna go to my photos and we're gonna go like this there we go i'm just gonna screenshot that again now i got my youtube video so now what i like to do lately what i've been doing lately is oh wait we actually have to upload the real first real here's my real i'm gonna go click on next there we go and then i'm just gonna let this post like that boom i hate sharing things to my feed not feed but like i hate like people come to my grid i don't want to see a bunch of reels especially people have been posting a lot lately all right now we're gonna go and create our story so i just basically go and every day i take a couple different photos so like here's one photo we took yesterday sunday service there we go and then i'm gonna do another one i like this one with my dog there we go there we go and then we're gonna do our last one right quick and then we're gonna do new upload and then what i'll do here is tap to watch now cool and then the last thing we'll do is go to add my real to my story and then there we go now we're done we're done with content for the day but yeah that's literally how i do my content every day i do that and then i have a twitter ghostwriter so he's already posting a ton of stuff for me which has been super helpful i obviously approve all the tweets and all that stuff but he basically just goes and pulls it from my youtube videos and stuff like that that's how i'll do my content every morning i'll just come to my calendar after and then just literally go mark complete and there we go we just marked another thing off now today i do actually have to do a couple things today there's a couple videos i need to film i got a ugc video i need to film for a student i need to film one of my mentors a testimonial i need to start filming a new vsl for one of my paid programs i got a couple of sops i need to create today so these are some tasks that just didn't get completed last week because i was traveling so they got kind of backed up so my goal today is to try to get more of those completed plus everything on this list today fixed up this is also the time that i respond to all my youtube comments and yes i personally respond to all my youtube comments on twitter someone handles my twitter i do instagram but youtube i've always held that close to my heart so i've always responded to every comment on there i just simply go right here every morning response status i haven't responded boom and then i go in any ones that pop up sometimes it doesn't pop some people's comments up because they're like marked as spam like for example all of these people i'm not responding to because it's clearly spam right there looks like uh shout out nick dara alex berry ugly ads for the video we just got posted earlier because obviously you just got first comments major secret for getting in the zone while i'm working is the sonos i have a whole bunch of these sonos speakers throughout my house right here and just being able to put on some good music and just jamming all day helps out a ton when getting in the zone i'm gonna go to just my super mix today with youtube and we're going to get into a good flow state and bust out a couple hours of work all right let's do a quick fridge check because i am starving right now this is the realistic life of what my fridge looks like we got the energy drinks we got the core powers we have the sparkling waters other energy drinks just because i've been really loving these lately and in the fiji so we're gonna grab us a little core power real quick oh and also love this chobani zero sugar because i try to keep my sugar as low as possible during the day these crush six uh 12 grams of protein per one really good and i'll toss in like some almonds with that which i may actually do that a little bit um and we're gonna come back for this in a second so something i need to do right now is work on these new sops for script writing bottleneck cvr aov and we're actually going to show you guys something really cool around this so i used to actually just sit down and like create an sop by just typing it out on google doc but what i found out that works really well for sops is actually just going ahead and leveraging the voice app in your phone but just using the voice app like this and i'll literally just go and just walk around like i'm going right now talking into my phone and i'll literally go and upload that transcription to chat gpt and it'll create my whole sop verse for me versus sitting there trying to type it now the reason why this works so much better is because like for me i'm more creative when i kind of walk around and i can talk i just perform way better than just sitting down and trying to like force it all out on the screen so for me if i just sit down and think about the process the whole process here then i can just simply talk it out upload that transcript it makes the check the sop creation so much faster and this is an sop specifically for my students so once i actually have the audio files from you know just basically sitting down running around and recording the audio i'll use a service called cockatoo to go ahead and upload them and transcribe that whole file then i'll come into claude over here and i really like claude because claude works way better for long form writing so any type of like landing pages sales page quality works way better and anything that's just gonna be a longer piece of information which an sop right here is a 25 minute long sop yeah it's gonna definitely be a lot long form right there so i'm just gonna go in i'm gonna click on my voice in thing right here and just kind of tell it what i wanted to do as a operations manager that has years of experience creating detailed sops that anyone can understand and follow to replicate results please take the sop transcription below and create me a detailed sop there we go paste that in boom there we go and now it's literally going to go ahead and paste that in let's see let's give that a second there we go and then now what i'll do is just spend some time editing this and reformat it now i'll go ahead and copy this in into google docs and i'll just go ahead and start manually editing this and this is so much easier now to manually edit now that it's all put inside a google doc i'm in a client call right now so being a little quiet but we literally just launched this client a couple days ago generated i don't know what 20 30 leaves here and we already got two high ticket sales for this account so extremely excited i told this client best case for month one break even and so far we do have some profits rolling in right now which is amazing so we'll see how this goes over the next 30 days just finished up my first call now about to hop into a couple more calls just a quick little heads up blocking your days off to where you can only have calls during that time is one of the big success hacks if you have to do calls for your business one of the biggest mistakes i made when i used to do my schedules and stuff like that was um i used to literally like make it to where anyone could book a call with me at any point in the day so like i'll be in a deep work period of time and it'll be like call jump into that call then a little bit more deep work than another call and just be so random so now i know that every day monday through friday i know between one o'clock and 4 p.m central time that's the only time someone can book a call with me yeah sure i'm missing people that could potentially need a book call with me in the morning but my period of having good deep work is super valuable for me and that's what makes me more money and my clients more money and my students more money because i can build up educational sources for them so it's doing everyone a disservice if i have that spot open and i also did used to do the like like i used to do like um i think it was like monday or tuesday and thursday that would be the only two days i would take calls and i also tested this and i would do calls from like literally 9 a.m to 5 p.m on tuesdays and thursdays but i was just melted by the time i got to those afternoon calls yeah this is just personally what's worked for me over the last year and a half and it's been a huge game changer from a productivity perspective and with that being said we do have another call to hop into so let's get into it just finished up calls and everything like that got about an hour and a half went a little later than i wanted to on calls today but one of me and my team members actually had a really good call and i thought a lot of you guys could relate to this so this particular team member he's been with me now for i think this will be his damn i'd like this this be a second year uh he'd be turning two years with me this year this particular team member kind of hit a point where they've been running facebook ads now for two years and only in the ads manager because this is one of my media buyers he's only in the ads manager every day now this particular media buyer also doesn't do any copywriting this media buyer doesn't do anything on the creative side just uploads ads increases decreases the budget and tracks the numbers and stuff and this particular media buyer kind of hit a point where they felt like they weren't growing so we bought them a couple educational programs and by a lot of the other gurus on youtube just because like hey like my stuff's good but also too like i also want to allow them to help build their own perspective like i did by going through hundreds of different gurus on youtube as well so i want to give them that opportunity right there and they just went through a few courses and they were just like what the i feel like we just got scammed so the reality is is that they wanted to grow and expand their mindset but they're at the point where they're hitting diminishing returns where it's like okay cool i want to become a better media buyer so let me go spend eight hours learning exactly how the facebook ads algorithm was designed and it's like okay yes that might be cool it might make you look smart but like it's not going to impress the client client only gives a about results and my goal is to get client results in as little as time as possible as quickly as possible and in a few amount of actions as possible so i was like look have we done anything around conversion rate optimization have we done anything around aov optimization and this particular team member hasn't really dug into cbr and aov yet so what i did was i challenged this team member for the next 30 days to go ahead and spend all their free time learning aov optimization and conversion rate optimization and then go put a plan in place of a bunch of different tests they want to do for our clients around cbr and around aov optimization but a specific hypothesis for each one why did i do this because now i'm going to challenge them to go learn a new skill set that's going to create a significantly bigger impact in results for clients versus just hammering away at the same thing over and over and over that's creating very very very little impact in that stuff for the client so yeah if you feel like you've been in that situation right there where you learned everything around facebook ads and you just feel like okay hey i need to learn more about facebook ads to get better sometimes it's not necessarily just going to learn more about facebook ads it's taking a step out and just like the call i talked about earlier today where input versus output change the input to change the output this is also what you need to do change the input of what you're consuming to get a different output and focus on something new in the business to get a different output so yeah that'd be cool now we need to film some youtube videos got two youtube videos i need to film so take you guys behind the scenes on that i think it's funny because everyone wants to know my like procedure for like putting youtube videos together this is my procedure i route that i write down the ideas and i film that is it so like today i'm filming pov you spend seven figures i'm off on facebook ads that's literally the vlog you're watching right now that i'm filming on you know june 23rd but y'all probably won't see this till like july 4th and then eight million dollars spent facebook ads campaign breakdown we're gonna spend we're gonna film that right now uh it's gonna go upload this wednesday and marketing fundamentals fundamentals it's got facebook ads 30k days that's gonna go live next monday but yeah i just write down these ideas and then i'll go to google slides and maybe put a couple notes on google slides and that's it that's my youtube process all right we're actually gonna keep leveraging this setup today for the youtube it's actually quite simple i'll just pull my phone in right here and then boom i literally just plug in this whole mic it's not the big boy professional setup that's upstairs but again i didn't intend to film today i was just out of town last week to film when i was in new york so i was trying to make this quick and easy so i don't miss a video for you guys so if y'all wanted to know what happens here after the filming process i give it to handbrake to compress the files to make it easier to then upload to google drive here and in that google drive folder is shared with my youtube team here and my youtube team basically goes ahead and does all the editing uploading title seo thumbnails all that stuff sometimes i'll give them a little bit of feedback like right here but yeah so that's what happens and then all i do from here is just answer y'all comments on the comments on the channel now it is six o'clock which definitely for me we're gonna check that calendar real quick let's pull that thing up real quick this is usually where i'm gonna hit my personal time at so we're pretty much just gonna call a hard stop right now i don't care what i have left of my to-do that i didn't get to do today this is my hard stop for today where i don't do anything after that so there's some little things i need to do though like i didn't get to learn as much as i wanted to today so there's some stuff around that um we're gonna do but we're gonna go throw the ball with the dogs now i literally have that as a to-do just to make sure i'm doing it every day and then also i need to take trash out because it's gonna be trash day and we also need some food so we got three or four more things that we still need to go do today that finishes outside of work they literally get so excited for the ball you ready we're gonna throw your ball come on let's go let's go throw come on xander so excited oh he almost knocked off all of my head buddy all right we're back let's go let's go play come on come on it's actually about to start storming outside so you know what you gotta do come on come on come on sit sit down there you go good boy this is literally my favorite thing to do all day after like working and stuff i don't have kids right now i do have a girl that i am seeing that we just started but like i think it's important for me just to start like embracing some of those habits on a day-to-day window of just like hey like one day i will have kids and like i need to make sure i prioritize that time with them so that's also why i have that hard stop at six and like this is like quote-unquote family time also personal time right there but i know one day that will be family time and i want to have that ingrained in me already versus being the dude that's like working all day and missing out on all of that they are absolutely lost today also feels really good outside too come on bud go eat your ball let's go come on come on come on just gonna take the trash out and it looks like we got some packages in the mail as well yeah let's open these things up and then plan on doing an unboxing video today but it's like you also get a special treat today of an unboxing video so i don't know if y'all see how the light is all like just anamorphic forgot what it's called just all over the place right here that's because like it's not my screen that needs cleaning it's that it's cracked right across the camera so i just got a brand new glass for my camera so that way it won't look as crazy like that so that's package number one and package two is actually a uh teleprompter i've never used teleprompters before for my youtube channel even though people tell me like hey dude i don't know how you script your videos are amazing like i don't script them i don't use teleprompter or anything it's just me talking directly to y'all based off results that i've achieved with facebook ads so i got a teleprompter because i'm actually filming a new vsl and stuff like that for some new offers unfortunately though it looks like it might have got damaged a little bit in shipping because that i don't think that's supposed to be correct right there i think that's charged a glass and stuff like that so yeah we're gonna be zipping this thing right back up and uh we're gonna be sending this thing back or honestly every the few times i've had to like re or like get something redone with amazon they just let me to keep it so i may have this thing to keep but it shards glass everywhere so i probably won't and uh yeah definitely want to be opening that up with the little guys running around and stuff like that it's been a long time since i've had to actually put a glass on my phone so cool that i'm having two phones to vlog with because now i can like set my other phone up to watch and yeah whatever all right we're gonna give this a shot i've been a while since i've done this and i'm gonna stone now for i don't know a year so and every time i do the glass i always just like literally let at&t people put the glass on and then i just don't touch it until it's time to go upgrade my next phone again so it's actually the first time i'll keep doing this in a very long time i'm kind of scared i don't know if any of this is important we have an instruction manual so the first thing i'm going to do is clean the surface or wet wet before we can do that we need to take off this old one get a little bit closer oh yeah right there it's all close up all right will it come off oh my god it did look at that oh wow i think i was way off camera too look out i don't know if y'all can see how damaged it is now unfortunately the only problem this phone is it did have one little fall and yes i don't use a case i've never used a case before it's crazy that this is a facebook ads channel and you guys are watching me right now put on a screen protector on a phone like let me know if i like this like i'm just kind of just like literally just bringing you all through everything i do today and just being very raw and long-winded and the youtuber i like that's how he does his stuff for the vlogs obviously i wouldn't do this half a video every single day on the channel just because that's not what the channel is about but i definitely like this once a friday like every friday basically being a new vlog vlog because like i mentioned before fridays are always the worst for videos so vlogs are just like those dedicated serious people that love the channel and just like they watch me regardless so i think friday like vlog days or else and you're in for a treat you know man this thing looks clean just let y'all see this voila there we go we did it a few bubbles but we'll get it fixed i'm actually curious where's the scraper tool they said there's a scraper tool to remove the bubbles oh there's a scraper tool there we go so also to show y'all the uh my fitness pal app i use so like right now i'm logging the food i had so far today to hit my 2k calories we're gonna get 12 pieces of nigiri sushi and that'll make our full basically 2 000 calories and we're gonna be right in around 166 carbs 80 fat 145 protein protein i try to hit about 160 because i'm at 165 and then whoop is the other app i use and this will give me a good amount of tracking so like yesterday for example how many steps i got yesterday was a recovery day it was sunday only burned 1400 calories things like that and then we can see the day before today that saturday we blew through a ton of calories 13 000 steps uh almost 3 000 calories i had boxing that day and then also too i went ride with the girl i'm seeing we went uh ride bikes in our neighborhood and stuff like that so we had a lot of movement right there that being said let's have to go get some food all right we're actually gonna go eat sushi that's the move but before we gotta do that we definitely have to get out the crocs because that's all i've been working in all day so let's get that fixed all right that'll do better outside the crocs also shout out to sam jacobs because if y'all watched the new york vlog new york podcast that's true actually this wasn't even in there so on the podcast i'm gonna do it sam jacobs he hooked me up with this cologne never had it before smells really good definitely recommend it yeah with it i like it and we'll be taking the urus since we didn't do the urus earlier let's bring you guys a little cold start oh nice nice there we go get on corsa mode ready to roll yo just finished up a little bit of food i am stuffed i'm also still hungry like stuffed but hungry i don't know if that makes sense so i'm gonna go tear up some nachobani zero sugar 60 calorie yogurt to satisfy that sweet tooth real quick yeah i don't have anything else to say it's been a cool vlog so far back home and honestly this is probably the most realistic reality right here of pretty much end of the day for me like i said last four hours of the day is just what i quote quote unquote say personal time so i went grab some food i got like two hours left now and honestly i'm personally chill out someone recommend me watching the kingdom of heaven or something like that i don't know i'm gonna check out maybe a movie may play a little call of duty may honestly just take a nap until bed at sin that's about it that's that's my nighttime usually during the week it might be going hang out with some friends or maybe hanging out with you know the girl i'm seeing right now it may be actually going do something outside of work it's productive and stuff like that but yeah no like usually nighttime is pretty chill again i work every day so i don't really have a day off so i force myself to have this period of time where i purposely take time off so that way tomorrow i'm like already like i'm already can't wait to get back in the office tomorrow office the room next door to like start crushing out some work tomorrow morning so i don't really have any like fancy nighttime routines or anything like that i just shower and go to bed but something i do like to do is just be mentally conscious of like where could have i have improved today so like for example one thing i didn't get to to do today was my learning session every day i strive to have like a 30 minute learning session where i just find something to learn about it may be something related to advertising it may be related to something else in my life but i just again every day some type of learning session set up and like today i didn't properly calculate my time today to be able to set up that learning session so like i didn't get that done today the sops while i did get the voice part done i didn't get to finish the like editing of them so like those are still all my to-do from last week so i just i have a few outstanding tasks that i know that i've had better time management over the last couple days i could have gotten them done or just prioritization so you know i just think about these little things like before i go to bed and just like how do i show up tomorrow better and like if every day you strive to just show up one percent better like tomorrow if i'm a little bit more cognizant about my time and like hey i know if i push this thing off to the end of the day it's probably not going to get done and i just put intention behind that every single day you're just naturally going to progress to get better and better and better you don't need to sit down and do a one hour deep dive of or a 30 minute deep dive of then reflection of your day with a notepad just sit down for a second and just no social media no tv no nothing and just be cognizant about what happened today and how can you show up tomorrow better whether it's mentally physically something you do differently tomorrow that's all you got to do that's it keep it simple simple scales but yeah so like that's just a couple things on my mind that i'm gonna try to do tomorrow that better i'm gonna watch some tv now maybe play a little playstation we'll see play i've been playing the call of duty lately so i'm gonna have some fun on that but yeah thank you all so much for watching if y'all enjoyed these vlogs comment below like i'm gonna keep filming them as long as y'all like them but the
