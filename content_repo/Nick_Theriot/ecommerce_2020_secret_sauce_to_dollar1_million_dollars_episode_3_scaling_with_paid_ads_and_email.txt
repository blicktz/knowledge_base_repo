what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Terrio today is episode number three and the final episode of this three-part series I've used where I've basically taken two rants over a million dollars in 2020 and how exactly I scaled those brands and everything that went into it obviously starting off we talked about the branding aspect then we went to like the foundational aspect website version optimization all that good stuff if you missed either one of those episodes you click episode you know one of them right here one of them right here check those out because they're highly highly valuable but today we'll be laying out kind of like the blueprint I use when scaling brands this is where we're gonna start pushing more advertising dollars into it we'll be covering a little bit of influencer marketing and Facebook ads and how I use them together to really grow a brand and be very very powerful with it and very profitable with it as well with that being said guys make sure you hit that subscribe for all the hard work I've put into this series hit the notification bell so I do have 13 more videos that I have planned and ready that's gonna be super powerful for your brand and helping you grow scale drive more revenue all that great stuff so with that being said let's hop right into it you got your website up get your product you got your amazing marketing plan together for our product and then now you get your website up now we need to jump into the email marketing so email marketing is absolutely huge we're seeing anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of revenue for our clients from email marketing as you're driving traffic to the website people are gonna pop up and enter an email in for a little pop-up on your website you get orders you're gonna collect a ton of emails and if you're not monetizing it from day one you're missing out on a buckload of money so what you want to do is you want to set up Klaviyo there's go klaviyo.com I'm absolutely amazing email marketing it crushes Melchamp constant contact all active campaign all these other ones Klaviyo is just dominant for e-commerce and it connects amazingly with Shopify you want to build out some flows for abandoned cart welcome series there's a few different flows that it recommends like right when you sign up to build out so you literally just follow those super simple you want to sure all your emails are branded and follow brand guidelines so you can create a template inside Klaviyo that all your emails follow so we all you have to do in the future is just put the continent so make sure you have a template so that way you have like every email looks like comes from your brand it's not just like different colors and shit every time make sure it looks branded and then best I'm gonna start again day number one you want to segment your list in Klaviyo I like to do it sometimes by product if it's just like two or three product store but also to like clothing I like to do by size so here's all my small buyers here's all my medium buyers large etc so that way if I have a ton of small left for one specific product it can run a sale just so that one product two small customers specifically so it's highly targeted so that works really well you know you're engaged email subscribers versus people who never open up yourself so what you're targeting a more active audience all your customers people who haven't bought yet there's different lists you can create that work really well and what you want to do is you want to do two emails per week promoting various products to all your subscribers you know previous buyers and active subscribers so that way you know again it's very targeted you only do one Monday one Friday we do this for multiple brands works amazing for us again you can test for your specific brand so we've made it you've gotten every thing done for your brand now it's time to launch now it's time to actively go out there start getting customers maybe you're already getting customers here's some things you can implement inside of your you know strategy right now but here's the over strategy so we're gonna have to post one new product or a week or collection of products each month sometimes for some of these people who are maybe running one product stores or only sell one or two products you just may not be applicable to you but if you're a clothing brand one new product a week works amazing or each month have a specific collection you're promoting every four to six weeks we're gonna run we want to run a store-wide sell with an automatic discount applied so for the whole store store-wide 10% off and then which one is you want to promote the sale from Thursday morning till Sunday at 11 59 p.m. so that's four days so every four to six weeks you're gonna run this four-day sale site-wide percentage off or you can do buy more and save so buy two items get third one for free buy an item and any other items you buy is 10% off you know different things like that just make sure it's clear easy for the consumer to understand now what you want to do is if you just starting out you want to start by creating a Facebook business manager account then an ad account and connect your page you want to set up the Facebook pixel on your Shopify store make sure you do that from day one so that way as you start getting traffic to it you can start tracking each individual visitor purchase ads cart etc which makes really good lookalike audiences over time and what you want to do is you want to start working with influencers who are following your who fit your ideal audience you want to focus on YouTube and Instagram make some really good influencer areas and you want to start getting me sending these products to people that would work really well with your brand create a deal with them hey if I send you a product for free give me a good shout out for free cool sometimes the people it's like hey if I send you the product plus maybe 20 bucks give me a good shout out you know you can create a deal with someone you know hey every new collection for next year I'll give to you for free as long as you do a shout out for us every time again you want to start small so like just like just give me one shout out and then if you notice that that person for like the last few months has been doing super good with your brand like in terms of like how many consumers you get from that customers you get from that then focus on those longer term contracts and stuff like that but again start with influencers don't start with Facebook ads yet it's a specific reason why so after you start getting some traction with that you want to set up your retargeting audiences so you're gonna start off with your retargeting audiences audiences you can do this honestly after your first hundred two hundred bucks in sales so like almost immediately I'll start off with this first campaign just targeting all of your engaged audiences website visitors 180 days engage a Facebook page 180 days Instagram page 180 days do a CBO campaign stuff those three audiences together you know each ad set like that's an ad set that's an ad set that's an ad set a CBO $25 a day and then inside each ad set put three to four organic post you post it for the ad so look at your Facebook post look at your Instagram post which ones have done super well over the last say 30 days and copy the post ID launch it boom and then bottom of funnel set up a catalog sales campaign and this one's also purchase conversion so conversion campaign optimized for purchases second campaign right here catalog sales and which you want to do is you want to do a CBO $10 a day you want to target view counter adds a cart in the last 30 days as you start getting a lot more traction you want to cut down those audiences all the way from 30 days then it's like 20 days then it's like 10 days it's like three days and you'll notice as you go super smaller um it'll allow you to have a higher ROAS it's just starting out uh Facebook won't allow you to target such a small audience so you go really wide so we have a lot more people in there so um you want to set this campaign as a catalog sales campaigns blah blah honestly just get all from a discount code to come back and complete their purchase super simple and then um the retargeting so this one's gonna be a purchase conversion campaign bottom of funnel CBO $10 a day only one ad set and this one as well it's only in one ad set but view content make sure it's view content not website visitors view content 30 days and then all the creatives just load in a bunch of user-generated content testimonials uh people take pictures videos etc for product so that way someone comes to view your product they're getting hit with hey come back and purchase and also as hey come back and like here's some testimonials as well some posts to like keep them engaged as your brand now three out of three you want to do this retargeting with Facebook ads and influencers strategy until you reach $25,000 per month I know that sounds like a lot but trust me it's not that hard to achieve um told the strategy to another guy then like a month or two months of really hitting it hard he went from like $7,000 a month to $30,000 a month doing the strategy um but you want to do all that and what it's gonna do is allow you to have a seasoned pixel very seasoned it knows your customers it knows who wants to purchase your product and which it allows you to do is it allows you to have some really freaking good lookalike audiences as well as even when you're doing cold interest targeting it it knows who your audience is better which allow you to make more from cold traffic so then you can start right there um I'm not gonna go super crazy it's a strategy of how you scale with Facebook ads uh campaign but here campaign number one uh let's say just your product name so this will be for one product right here um you want to do an LLA so that's look like audiences um and we're gonna create one ad angle um so you'll create like 10 ad sets with a look like audience in each ad set um and three to four product creatives all the same ad copy in each ad set um so be the same three to four product creators for all ten ad sets uh campaign number two exact same things have you done with interest and there's also abo so this will be ad set budget optimization I recommend 10 ad sets twenty dollars per day that's two hundred dollars a day for campaign number one two hundred dollars a day for campaign number two you're spending four hundred dollars a day on ads um and then what you want to do is you want to run all this for three days after you run it for three days then what you want to do is you want to start picking out the winner ad sets and turning off the losing ad sets and again this is purchase conversion as well now campaign number three um this is again you're gonna do is you're gonna take those winning ad sets you know put them in campaign number three you can turn off these two campaigns you don't need anymore is it just simply testing campaigns uh so this is campaign number three this is your scaling campaign so you know product name um and then you can also put you know whatever ad angle uh you did on this one so let's just do adding a number one uh so we're gonna make this a campaign budget optimization a hundred dollars a day starting out um you want to duplicate all the winning ad sets you want to increase the budget by 20 every day uh and then decrease the budget by 20 every day based off the previous three days results so you're gonna basically every day you know look at the ads manager and you're gonna look at that campaign and you're gonna select the last three days of data if it's at a really good row ass for you increase it by 20 percent then the next day look at it again so good row ass increase it by 20 percent next day oh we noticed the past few days that ross has been bad it's decreased about 20 percent um yeah and you want to do this system for multiple products or put a bunch of products in a carousel uh so another way to do this is uh instead of a product name just do all products just label it all products and do a carousel three to four carousels of all your products as creatives um and then that way you kind of do one more all product campaigns versus single product campaigns so all righty guys that is it that is episode number three uh again that's the final episode for this little
