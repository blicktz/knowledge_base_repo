how we did 554 000 in 30 days with facebook ads guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i cannot wait to drop this amazing new case study for you guys that we did for a clothing brand over the last 30 days if you're new to the channel and you don't know who i am my name is nick terrio and i run a facebook ads agency where we spend roughly 750 000 to a million dollars a month on facebook ads specifically and i make all these videos for you completely for free with the goal of helping you scale your business and having the opportunity to one day work with our agency when you're ready to offload that dreadful task of the most media buying and marketing yourself so with that being said let's hop into the video where exactly we're going to cover how we did 554 000 in 30 days now it says euros but it you know the dollars are higher so you know it actually could be higher i just didn't do the math before this they're converting this is over 30 days right here it says triple l 554 000 roughly 152 000 in net profits and yeah like a 3.69 overall robust which for this brand anything above a 3.5 is a game a plus so again roas is different for every brand and you have to ultimately know your numbers to figure out what you need to be hitting for that so that being said this is diving deeper into the facebook out ad account specifically um so you know we did spend a good bit on facebook ads for a superior time we spent roughly around 103 000 on facebook ads specifically 120 000 on facebook ads specifically we did have a few other channels um like tick tock um not tick tock google ads um but you know a lot of the google ads is a lot of retargeting content um for traffic from facebook specifically so just get you guys aware of that but yeah so we ran pretty much a straightforward approach we did have a few different launches during this time so i did have a few other um campaigns but it's mostly around launches and promos they had ran during this period of time but majority of our spend you know at least 90 of our spend was in our top of funnel campaign right here so which i'll show you everything right now so step one you need to know your numbers okay you need to know what's an acceptable cpa for your brand what is a lifetime value of your brand because this particular brand right here has a really good lifetime value so they could accept the lower roas on the facebook ad side so you can see right here i mean 1.48 roas on facebook side but overall they're at a 3.69 now that's a good thing because they can that shows that they have a very strong retention side of the business they have a lot of free peak customers a good organic following good overall business this is showing some really good signs of a healthy business okay that way we can spend substantially more on acquisition of new customers which is going to set us up for more success down the road so you really need to know the lifetime value of your customer your target cpa and then your break even sort of cpa so for example um your break even rest might be like 1.5 and then your target break uh robust will be like 2.5 so you got to figure out what is the cost for acquisition how much money you have to spend to hit either one of those in that center right there now step number two is once we actually get into the attic and everything we start you know doing the market research first so um these are three key things that we like to really dig deep into what is the market desire what is motivating what's the mass desire that's motivating people to purchase from this business you know a chicken breast might get purchased by a bodybuilder for you know him looking for you know more protein contents and then a mom might be purchasing chicken breast to cook a good dinner so what's the main motivator that why they're like i want to purchase that because i want bump um you know men might you might see this like in this example right here like you know girls or girls and guys not girls specifically girls and guys posting pictures on instagram purely for that adrenaline rush a dopamine rush of the likes and the comments to the point where they literally travel into other cities to you know literally take pictures on instagram and that's their main motivator desire is to travel to this place to get views and content and stuff like that so there's a lot of weird desires across the market there's a lot of many reasons why people do things and that's what you have to really figure out what's that core motivator core desire core why people have that's causing them to purchase from your business now the next thing is market awareness so market awareness is super super important because it's basically where do we pick up the conversation at what is encouraging people to purchase from your business okay so for example um not not encouraging people to pick up since where do you pick up the conversation how much do they know about the problem and product you have okay so for example an unaware market they have no clue about your product they have no clue about their problem okay so we um we work with this particular insurance type of business where no one has a clue about the problem we solve so we have to throw a piece of we have to in our ad the way it's structured is it starts off with educating them about the problem and then leading into the problem and then leading into how we provide a solution and how we're the best on the market okay so we have one ad that does all that you don't need five six different ads to do that you just do one ad that takes them from unaware to aware okay there's five different stages and videos my channel goes over this okay whereas this particular brand some men's clothing brand we simply just need to really hit on the solution aware people and the product aware people which is just simply a solution aware where we're providing that we have the best solution and then the second one is product aware which is simply just giving people more confidence and conviction and purchasing from our business in that sense right there so two different types of groups of people in the market awareness or no five different people groups of people in the market awareness and you basically just have to ask yourself where's the market at and you can really research competitor library things like that to really help you understand that the market sophistication it's how many offers have they seen so a stage one market you can really just be like hey we have men's jeans and if no one is selling men's jeans at all you're the only one selling men's jeans on the market they literally will purchase from you but because it's grown to the point where there's hundreds of different brands selling men's jeans now it's who has the best jeans who has the new technology that no one else has who has the best identity so we sell men's jeans to you know bodybuilders and we're our whole men's jeans rounds around bodybuilders our bodybuilders such a large market we're going to come and purchase specifically from us because we resemble their identity the best okay these are all very important things about positioning of your creative and your copy that i see so many of you guys doing wrong um and if you don't get this right nothing in this whole rest of these steps will work for you just gonna let you know so once all this is put together we send this off to my copywriter my copywriter begins writing the copy for the ad the body copy of facebook um the headline of the facebook ad um the creative copy to use in photos or videos so if we're launching a bunch of videos with a lot of different texts and stuff in the video i'll copy in there so copyright puts all that together um that sends it over to our visual creator which then receives that copy and that plus that brief um and then starts to build out the creatives we also use frame.io which is a really good tool to help like approve the creatives and stuff like that send off to client and things like that it's a really cool tool we can literally like you know make comments on the video at certain key points and it's just a really awesome tool for reviewing creatives so if you work with a ton of creatives definitely use that tool but if it's just you and you're the only person that's reviewing it it's no point literally will serve you zero purpose just when there's multiple people that are involved in the creative approval process so then the next thing is my media buyer receives these ads and launches these ads in the ad accounts okay and we start beginning testing and stuff like that it's just an abo campaign conversions all that good stuff next thing um and also too i do have videos on this on my channel um video number six of my seven part series of how to run facebook ads and 2022 and then i have one video that covers all of this um called how to build a facebook ads campaign from scratch where you're literally over the shoulder me watching me build the ad account so two really cool videos i think you would like and step number six is we verify performance or triple well so we use triple well to track everything when it comes down to e-commerce side um and shopify um so a really powerful tool and then step number seven is actually reviewing the ad concepts we test okay so if an ad concept gets really good spin plus a really good cpa it's an awesome winning ad okay um if it gets really poor spin plus bad cost per acquisition so it's only gonna you know like it's getting terrible cost per acquisition plus not really the greatest spin that means it's not built for engagement um and conversions and here's what i mean so engagement um for an ad to be successful it needs to be engaging it needs to be something that people want to like comment and share on but it also needs to be selling a product okay so it needs to do both and if these two are not aligned it will cause different things in the algorithm so if if it's if facebook doesn't want to spend on it that means it's not engaging facebook doesn't want to push this across the platform okay so then we force spend to it and it just burns money if we're getting poor spin plus a bad cost per acquisition that basically means what's happening is just it's not it's a terrible app overall but if we're getting poor spin plus a good cpa means hey it's not we can't really spend much on it but it's getting a good cpa what that's showing us is that that ad is good for conversions but it's not really engaging so facebook doesn't want to spend on it and then we're seeing good spin like facebook wants to blow money in this but it's getting a bad cost per acquisition what is happening is that it's built for engagements getting a lot of likes and comments and stuff like that um people want to see this ad but it's not selling the product or offer our service whatever that we're selling that ad right there so you get it kind of realize what's going on in this then step number eight is we actually start scaling our winning ads in a prospecting campaign um so 99 99 of the time i'm using top of funnel a prospecting campaign um as a cbo but what we did was is because we just we were targeting other countries i just did an abo campaign um with each country um split by or each set of countries split by languages okay that's all i did broad targeting and all of them um since i've recorded this video i've actually switched this and just broke this up into four cbo campaigns um literally exactly the same thing except just one campaign dedicates each language instead of one campaign with all of these because i'm running abo it's it's identical to me running a cbo campaign with each one in its own cpo so just make sure you guys are aware of that okay but yeah and then step number nine um we track daily revenue daily spend in a google sheet so one column has shopify total revenue and then one column has facebook total spend and then the third column will have literally um those two put together and like divide it to get row as and then each day we're looking at what was overall row ass okay if you're making decisions based off row ass inside of facebook like this like oh facebook's only a 1.41 we need to scale down you're a fool because overall we're at 3.69 and that's the goal is you're hitting your overall goal so overall is you know above a 3.5 it's our target for this brand we're scaling we're putting more money into the brand it's below a 3.5 we're pulling back by 20 okay so just make sure you guys aware how that works and then step number 10 is go back to step number two so you need to continue to repeat this process and the intentions of building better ads each week um when i came into this brand um they were spending roughly a thousand dollars for this another another like another brand not this one in this case that it was other branch telling you guys a quick little story they'll spend roughly a thousand a day on facebook ads um and the ads that took from a thousand dollars a day to 5k a day were completely different okay different types of ads okay and the ads that took from 5k a day to 15 000 a day yes we've been spending 15k a day for this brand are completely different as well so different ad concepts um and different types of messaging and creative and things like that that's going to you know allow you to spend more okay so it's very important you continue to keep coming back back to this with the intentions of building better ads for your business and allow you to spend more and scale your business the revenues you want now look guys if you enjoyed this video make sure the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every
