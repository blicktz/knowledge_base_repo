all right so today we'll be talking about avatars specifically avatars that scale facebook ads helping you hit anywhere between 10k 20k 30k i've seen this work all up to 350 000 in a day with facebook ads so long story short you guys in for a treat today when it comes down to avatars that scale facebook ads now what is a avatar specifically and how deep do you need to go with avatars with facebook ads and everything and we're gonna start off that with like the main thing our main kind of key takeaway from today's video so just kind of diving into it back in 2015 you know that's when i started like my facebook ads journey right and that's when i started looking at things like the ads agency drop shipping like all of those good things right there now at that time you know pretty much you just had this pool of people that were like running facebook ads you know for local and then you could just say businesses right and then that's it right and like you could actually even say like a local business right could technically be an avatar you know because you had like local businesses you had e-com stores and stuff like that but things like e-com stores wasn't really popular at the time in terms of like running ads for e-com stores right like pretty much all the agency groups i was in it was just like local businesses and that was a bit about it and like many people kind of just like did in general stuff and then i would say probably around like 2017 2018 that's when like going specifically after like chiros so let's go back into our thing right here you know you had specifically like chiros which are like chiropractors lawyers boom then you had like dentists roofers boom and then you had i don't know i would say like that's the main ones right so instead of just local businesses now you would what's called niche down and for me niching down is what's like a subset of avatars or like a direct avatar you're dialed in on so dialed in avatar right and that's where you take your big circle of all the people for that particular thing but then you're only going after a small portion now this small portion can still get you to one to five million dollars a month right like it's still if you go after a large enough market you can still hit some solid numbers right there so like in the facebook ads niche like literally just going after roofers for example boom you can hit one to five million dollars a month i remember i had one particular client this client only worked with financial advisors right and his financial advisors agency he actually sold it for i think it was i want to say roughly five million i could be wrong i think it was more closer to three million dollars right there and he sold this particular agency for three million dollars all they did was scaled up with what's what i call just financial advisors there now the reason why you would settle for a smaller portion of the market versus going after the whole market is because like when i would talk and you know when i was running my particular agency and i would talk to different businesses you know the first set like 2015 2016 businesses were just like you run facebook ads yeah i run facebook ads all right cool start running my facebook ads but as the sophistication of the market increased boom boom so let's just say this is stage number one and then this would be like stage number five so like as the market sophistication increased what was happening here is the new question started asking is have you done this before boom started popping up right hey yeah i've worked with other ad agencies but i specifically want an agency for you know my roofing company or i specifically want an agency that has success with dentists or i specifically want an agency that only has killer results for a car detailing business right and this is where the stage five market kind of created itself right and this allowed people to actually go to these sub niches now because the market sophistication increased and these dentists these roofers these lawyers they've already worked with ad agencies and failed with them again market sophistication is all about hey i'm trying various different products i'm failing with these products i still have the desire to scale i still want to continue to use facebook ads and stuff like that i just need to find an ad agency that works specifically for me and that's where avatars start to come and play they want tailored program specific to them right so then here this is when like ad agencies started popping up specifically for dentists specifically for carers specifically for roovers specifically for lawyers and this is why like you don't really see too many huge agencies that are just general agencies right like yeah like don't get me wrong they exist they do exist but it's significantly easier to go all in on one avatar than to try to scale up with hundreds of different avatars right like when you're working with roofers lawyers dentists kairos landscapers e-commerce stores personal brands all of these different things and you kind of going after all of these people what happens here is that you're wide but like you're not deep i rather be deep and narrow right this is what i want and this is what i do not want why because when i'm deep and narrow all of my systems all of my marketing advertising everything is just can get really fine tuned and i get even better of talking to that specific avatar right there now nick this is an e-com channel we're talking about e-com and everything like that why are we kind of talking about agencies and stuff and that's just purely because i want you guys to understand just my personal experience going through these avatars and then now how i started to develop avatars for clients because i applied the same structure to my e-com clients and it helps a lot literally just one of my inner circle students who is drop shipping just applied this for his brand and it was so simple because he literally could just go find a mass market product like this and then just take the adding of those that are working for this e-com brand these other e-com brands his competitors and then just literally just go tailor it all down to his one specific thing and that's the beauty about avatars is that it's actually extremely like easy to work with avatars right the hardest thing about finding or the hardest thing about creating avatars is finding the avatars and once you find those avatars though then it makes it easy now when it comes down to actually start to market those avatars and we'll go into finding them in a second but before we do that let's talk a little bit more about like the actual marketing and advertising right so like here you know if we're looking at it back to like this perspective up here with the facebook ads for local businesses you know before it was just like i'll run your fb ads right and then like we'll send people to like an lp and then like you know book call close right and then it's just like mass market now with an avatar we're still doing the same thing right i'll run your roofing facebook ads boom lp now the only difference here is we'll have like a lot of case studies for roofers and then book call and then close right and then this is just niche down avatar boom boom now literally i can copy all the ads from this mass market and literally just make sure the primary text the actual creative itself the landing page kind of like even what we call our business is all tailored to that avatar we only show case studies tailored to that avatar we don't just show generic case studies we're like here would have like generic case studies you know on this lp this one we actually have roofing specifically right there so that's the first thing there we're actually doing the marketing and advertising the creative the primary text the landing page and the landing page can be anything you're sending traffic to so for like my e-com you know viewers right now your whole product page would be tailored to a specific avatar so if like this e-com student right here that was able to literally go into his niche he literally launched on day one with a 5x roas and then from there he went to his niche he found the main people in his niche and then from there he just copied their ads but then the only difference here is that like those people were going mass market he literally just copied those ads and said the same thing but he only showed that avatar achieving that result i'm not going to say the avatar so i don't want to like ruin you know his brand and everything like that but like it'd be the same thing in this case right here for the roofing so i would go just find the mass market facebook ad agencies and like what they're saying in their mass market facebook ads and then i would go ahead in here and just literally go and all right cool so they're saying how to scale facebook ads i'm just gonna say how to scale facebook ads for roofers they're showing them walking around in an office talking about how to scale facebook ads i'm gonna go like stand on a roof and like talk about how to scale facebook ads for roofers their landing page shows a bunch of case studies i'm gonna show a bunch of case studies but only be roofing case studies they book a call i book a call their sales calls talking about generic stuff i'm gonna be talking about how everything's tailored specifically to a roofing business for scaling facebook ads so literally everything is tailored to where it literally feels like if anyone else gets in your funnel that's not a roofer in this particular situation it just wouldn't even like make sense it would purposely push those people away and that's what we want some people more some people like well you gotta hit everyone you know i gotta go broad targeting oh and that's also another good thing too we're still doing broad targeting here even though it's niche down we're still doing broad targeting i'm letting facebook do the work on that because facebook's gonna find the right audience uh for us through those creatives that's why the creatives have to be dialed when we go in for an avatar specifically where a lot of people up at here is that like they would literally just put the avatar in the hook so like if i say how to scale facebook ads versus how to scale facebook ads for econ brands they will literally just go and put the avatar in the hook itself and that is it so the key thing here is that you need to be able when you create these avatars everything is tailored to it every other avatar would feel like they're in the complete wrong place if they land or see any of your ads it's like if you want to go to mcdonald's and you open up the gps and you find the nearest mcdonald's you click on it boom and you show up to chick-fil-a and it's like i'm in the wrong place i need to get the fuck out of here and go to mcdonald's because i want a big mac and that's the same thing with avatars the creative the primary text the landing page everything is tailored to that particular avatar right there the product photos on your site everything you mention on the site is specifically how your product helps that avatar based off of that avatar wants right there now how do you find these people how do you find avatars right that's what we want to look at next so i'm gonna give you a couple easy ones real quick reviews reviews is a big one this will be your product reviews this might be like if you're a new brand right here you don't have many reviews like let's say for example if i'm selling shoes for example i'm selling some generic drop shipping aliexpress shoes right now well let's say those shoes are running shoes all right so i'm gonna go look at obviously on like the reviews on aliexpress i would go and try to find like the similar shoes for other brands like nike rebox under armor on clouds for example because they all sell running shoes and stuff and i'm looking for reviews and i'm specifically looking for reviews that's like i am so oop hold up i am boom or as a boom or just any other like generic like words they use to clarify who they are right i am a nurse i'm on my feet all day and these on clouds are amazing as a registered dietitian for the last 20 years i'm on my feet all day talking to patients and stuff and these shoots work amazing as a teacher blah blah blah so i'm looking for reviews and that's going to be specifically for like if i'm drop shipping and i'm picking products right now you can look at the generic aliexpress then also i'm looking at competitors and i'm looking at my own reviews they're just the literally the easiest possible way to find avatars right there now the next one is talk to your customers you know for example like in my like inner circle my mentorship like i know for a fact that like 80 not even 80 i would say like 95 of the people that's in my mentorship are literally all e-com brand owners you know i talk to these people i have a one-on-one calls with them i do group calls with them and stuff like that so like i know for a fact that like majority of the content i post on instagram youtube the things that like i even like showing like my landing page vsl and even like the group calls the content like everything i'm gonna deliver is gonna be around e-com specifically because that's just majority of people that i talk to and the majority of people that are like coming into my business and stuff like that so in this case right here i'm literally talking to my customers and they're telling me they're an e-com brand owner so in this particular case like just talking to your customers now like you don't necessarily like have to hop on a call with every single one but this is where like customer surveys work really well use google forms google forms is completely for free and then you can send out a email using whatever email software you have to your existing customers and just literally ask them like you know how would you describe yourself husband father wife you know what's your job role and like things like that and kind of go a little bit deeper into there or what specifically about this product works for you right you know what's your your unique situation and how's this product help them and then that way they can be like hey like i'm a nurse i'm on my feet all day and because of that like these shoes work really well to help out with that so talking to your customers reviews next thing i'll be looking at from here it's just more general content online let's see general content online and i'm basically just kind of looking in this sense right here of like if i go like in the fitness niche for example and just go search up like bodybuilding or go search up like crossfit for example on tick tock i'm gonna find a lot of unique groups of people specifically around like what i would say who have different characteristics right like uh you may have um like people that are a little bit more like i don't even know really what's the best way to describe this to be fair but like let's just use a gym clothing niche for example actually you had gym shortcut first which was just like people who were into like working out specifically and this dude this is where like even goes even further right like in the clothing niche you had like these brands like reebok on dormer and stuff like that and they had this like mass market right of just like athletic apparel right and you had like football soccer you know track baseball and then you even have like people that like gym goers right but like everything was kind of advertised as like all in general athletic apparel so then like gym shark right here was like hey we want a clothing brand specifically for us so then that's when like gym shark gym shark literally went ahead and created what's called gym clothing niche right and they were like the first people to go ahead and start create creating clothing for gym goers people that like in the gym who are working out lifting weights that was like the main demographic but then like those like other brands that started popping up like i have like literally young la on right now young la you have buff bunny you have uh what's the other one alpha elite you have a naka power which is like one of the alpha elites you know friends brand i think it was it charlie i forgot his name but if you look at all these brands right here these are all more sub avatars right like for example a naka power right there they're i don't really know what's the best way to describe it they're more of like the people that are like alternative people that are almost like what i want to say like misfits in a way where like they don't really associate themselves with like the main crowd of people they're kind of do their own thing they're kind of separate from everyone else a little bit not like outsiders or outcasts but they're just a little like you know they're they're they're not they don't go with trends that's what i would say they do not go with trends so there's a naka power right there there's alpha elite which like if you look at alpha lead a lot of it's all about like you know their motto is literally learn more be more dream more something like that so like they're focusing more on like the entrepreneur avatar you know most of their like athletes and stuff like that that they bring on or people that like kind of had their own like come up of success and stuff like that so yeah so like that's alpha lead buff bunny like literally is only for females they only make female clothing and like literally it's in the name as well buff bunny so like you know girls who work out and in the bunny aspect right there heidi summers even has a video of how she like made the name and everything and then you have young la young la i like to think of as almost like the broccoli haired kids specifically who um you know go in the gym little stringers and stuff like that they sit on the bench for the full 30 minutes and like play on their phone and like take like five minutes per person to like bust out like three reps of just the bar and stuff like that so you have like young la right there so they all have different avatars of people and this is done through their creatives this is done through the products they create this is done through branding and lastly people right the people that they choose to uplift is what i like to call it right like alpha lead specifically goes and films these particular videos with their athletes that they bring on board and they uplift this person into the community and when i say uplift it's like they promote this person and kind of like push them up whereas like people who literally do nothing they're not going to share them on their stories go create dedicated videos for them and stuff like that they're only doing that with the people that they are like representing the branding and everything so what happened here is this went ahead and created the gym clothing niche from this avatar and then boom then all these other avatars started sprouting right there so like literally avatars or like those eggs right i don't know if you've ever seen i don't know if it's chinese or japanese specifically but it's like those eggs where like when you open one up then like another one that's like slightly smaller comes out then another one slightly smaller comes out then another one slightly smaller comes out and then it just keeps on going right and this is what like avatars go and realistically here almost all of them can make you a fuckload of money right all of them can make you a fuckload of money but it just kind of depends on how big this first market starts off with you know like the gym goers there's probably over 100 million people just in the general of like the number of people that go and like work out and lift weights worldwide right but in that particular situation there if we would go after someone that's like like a market like this of like 20 000 people and then we try to go after a sub niche that sub niche might be so small that there might be only be like 100 people in it and it's hard or a thousand people and it might be hard for us to promote in that so it really just comes depends on how big that niche is like gymshark for example when they started like they already saw tons of people working out they already saw the trends on general content online of people posting videos that that's the time they had uh what's called ziz uh z y z z like these are all people that i when i started on youtube not really started on youtube but just people i've watched when i started working out and stuff and i was like z's for example then you had like david laid and you had all these other like youtubers and stuff that were kind of collectively working out together and uh ben francis saw this emerging trend of like this fitness content online and then guess what he did he went in he flew these guys all to an expo and had them all repping gymshark start sponsoring them started giving them everything they needed clothing and stuff like that and then boom in came the gym clothing niche right tons and tons of people were like oh what is z's wearing he's wearing gymshark i want to go buy a gym shark and everything like that now that's a little bit more on the clothing side specifically for how that's being sold through influencer marketing stuff but the key lesson here to learn is how these avatars are consistently being created and every niche will have more and more avatars for example in the weight loss niche right now you know a lot of people are tearing up like perimenopause premenopause and postmenopausal women specifically right now and guess what now because so many people are going after these groups of women for menopause now there's a opportunity here to go after subset of menopausal women and i have a couple students doing it right now and i'm not going to mention how they're doing it but they're doing it very smart so that's a key thing right there of how you want to constantly think about avatars so where do you find them reviews talk to your customers general content online i'd say the last one is how do you define you know an avatar how do you know like you have a an avatar here and for me it's like there's no like one word answer for that but like for me i like to look at it as it's a thing that's growing in size you know hey we have this avatar that's growing basically so if we're getting a lot of reviews and we're starting to see a lot of reviews of common hey as a nurse as a nurse as a nurse as a nurse as a nurse hey a ton of people are buying these shoes specifically for nurses or hey a ton of people are joining my program and they're constantly saying they're in e-com specifically or i even want to go a little bit one step further a ton of people are joining my program and all of them are doing you know let's just say at least 100k a month right so it's not just e-com anymore it's one leg deeper now for 100k month you know for example right there so as avatars grow you'll start to see more and more of those and then from there they're just waiting they're waiting for someone to sell them on something because once a collective group of people start coming together now it's just like all right what can we sell them and how can we be the first person to sell that i would really be also looking at emerging markets here not emerging avatars but just emerging things that are like trends and sports and stuff like that for example like here in the usa we have it's that little beanbag game you kind of cross cornhole for example and then like cornhole became literally like a sport it started emerging it started catching off i don't want to sit there and like try to like compete with all these cornhole manufacturers in terms of like selling the cornhole boards but what i would want to actually go do is be the first clothing brand for cornhole i'd want to be one of the first supplement brands for cornhole this first energy drink brand for cornhole players and that way i can actually go and start building out products dedicated for them and like it could be literally the same products from other niches but just literally rebranding it as only for them and only creating advertising and marketing specifically for that avatar so with that being said hope you guys enjoyed
