So me and the boys decided to take a trip for the weekend to Biloxi, Mississippi. Getting some things packed up right now. Show you guys really quick.

Pretty much getting everything put together. And I'm about to head out. About to go pick up Jake.

Go see Kennedy at work. Drop her keys off of an apartment. Should be staying here for the next few days.

And get this show on the road. Can I get a minute, can I get a second to introduce myself? Whoa, y'all two star life Elpro.

When I fall back, hell no. It's how they made me. Alrighty guys, we just picked up some ones for Jake.

So we can go to the strip club tonight. We're about an hour away. We took up some teriyaki and jerryp's for a quick little snack.

And we just have about an hour left. If not, why scream back? Get that picture.

Man, that perfect picture. Sick, cause I need that. I told you.

I'm too real. May the side fail. I swear that side fail.

Like my always made a stare on me. I'm too real. I need the nail.

A whole millionaire right here. Up, up, up. Don't put that out there.

No, no, no. No. No.

What it do, what it does. But you been where you was. But it ain't what it is.

Face in the mud. Y'all really be hating. And the mud said I can't pick it up.

But I did. Y'all know Goon put too much base in a sub. Cut full of blood.

And I gave it a chug. Wait till your neighbors get all snug. Then play this real loud.

We live. This, that. For the kids.

Some strength. Can't say what it is. Goin' kids.

Can't, ain't say what it did. Yo, Jake's down 300. I got me some, I'm down 50 bucks.

And we're trying to find us a blackjack table. Let's go, 100 on black. You got this.

Update, officially $100 down. But I got free alcohol. So it's perfectly fine.

Damn it, Nick. Put the work in. Dude, I like this one.

Tell baby girl, hey girl. She gotta do it with a purpose. Hand me down the bottom.

Every man I heard that she a virgin. Sheesh. And I've been in the gym all week.

Every buzz. That's how I'ma drop the. So quick intermission real quick.

Day number two. We pretty much woke up. We went, drank at this little daiquiri shop.

Bar and grill. Ate and stuff like that. We literally spent like four hours over there.

Then went back to the condo. Picked up some food at Walmart to cook. Cooked all afternoon at the condo.

And then hit back up the Hard Rock Casino. We wanted to stay on the beach. But the weather was horrible.

So let's jump into the Hard Rock. Night rain. Fireball shots of the flame.

Tonight on my team. Celebrate himself made. Night two.

Let's see if we actually win something. Night two of losing. Oh shit.

You're in there, dude. I need a hit. Up, up, up.

No. I totally thought he lost. But he actually just came up.

180 bucks. That's what's up. So unfortunately we had to leave early due to a tropical storm hitting during our stay there.

So we had to leave the day early due to road closures and risk of flooding and everything. But with the short time we're still having niggas anti-democracy. And I had to eat.

But, with the short time we still had an amazing time.
