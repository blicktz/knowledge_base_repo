Okay guys, I finally have drank the Kool-Aid and I have finally decided to try ChatGPT. And this video is going to be essentially how I'm currently leveraging ChatGPT to enhance my advertising workflow. You know, what am I using it for?

How am I using it? And I'm going to give you guys a few different examples in today's video. It's not really scripted or anything like that.

So I'm just going to kind of going to go off the top of my head if that's okay with you guys. Kind of questioning why I'm credible to be teaching this type of stuff. I run a Facebook ads advertising agency with over $50 million in online revenue with Facebook ads and also coach students.

So click links below to either A, have your ads ran by me. We'll go through a strategy session together. See what's the best fit for you.

Or B, the mentorship side where I mentor you on a monthly basis in that sense right there. And don't forget to hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That being said, let's dive into the video.

Like I said, today won't be really scripted or anything like that. Just kind of some ideas off my head and stuff of how I'm currently using ChatGPT. Okay.

Full transparency. I do have the plus plan. I'm not sure if that makes any difference at all.

Again, I'm still very new to ChatGPT. But I want to show you guys how I'm currently leveraging it and where I see its best fit. Okay.

So I've been using it a lot for audits. Okay. So when I do an ad account audit, I basically go through and, you know, if you're making over 50KM off and you book a call with me by clicking the link below, it says, have Nectaria run your ads.

Our first call. I see if you're a good fit. If I think you're a good fit, I'll do an ad account audit where I go through your ad account and pull a bunch of stuff.

Then I present it to you. Then you can either take that strategy and run with it or you have the option to work with us if we think you're a good fit. So that being said, I'll do these audits.

And, you know, I spent a lot of time, like I'll spend three hours on these audits and I need to find a way to, you know, also to three hours. That's literally worth $1,500 because I charge $500 an hour for my time in that case. So, you know, I've spent a good amount of time.

So I needed a way to speed it up without reducing quality. And majority of the time I spend is the research phase of simply researching the product, researching the niche, and just getting a good sense of, you know, the pain points and what people want and things like that. So that way, when I create the few examples of ad concepts we would run for this specific account, we could, you know, have some data to back it up in that case.

So ChatGPT actually has been a really good tool for that in terms of speeding up the research process. Okay. Now, just to be fair, I still would recommend doing some research, you know, looking at Amazon, looking at YouTube and stuff like that, but also to, you know, leverage to speed things up because you would hate to use ChatGPT and for whatever reason it's wrong about something.

And then you use that and it doesn't really, you know, work well for your advertising. So next thing, let's just go look at ChatGPT. So first things first, I'll take you guys through an ad account audit I did a couple of weeks ago for a beard oil brand.

Okay. That's all I can say just because, you know, I don't want to present anything more about their particular business, but did an ad account audit for a beard oil brand. And I did use ChatGPT a little bit to help me better understand the customer.

Okay. So first things first was I saw on Amazon, they had a lot of beard oils that just had a lot of bad reviews. Okay.

And I didn't feel like sifting through all the bad reviews. So I went to ChatGPT and I said, Hey, ChatGPT, why do people not like beard oils? Okay.

Boom. And then basically it went through and started giving me some ideas. Okay.

Now the next thing is that with this is that I also did cross check a few of the one stall reviews and some of the things here definitely did like was correct in that case. So if we look at it from here, you know, cost. Okay.

That's one. The greasiness. That was the biggest one right there.

You know, allergic reactions. I didn't really see much of that at all. Personal preferences.

You know, just basically in a sense right there. So boom. So now I can kind of go through this and you see, this is where the hard parts at.

Okay. Because, you know, but unless you ask that, like, what is the number one reason why people do not like beard oils, you know, and, you know, it can't really say certain things. Okay.

So like, here you go. Boom, boom, boom. Based on common feedback, not like beard oils because they can leave the facial hair greasy or oily.

Okay, cool. There we go. So that was the number one reason I was looking for.

So again, that just kind of confirmed my next statement right there. It's still good to watch some YouTube videos. It's still good to look at some Amazon reviews, but this could definitely help you out right here in a time crunch of like, hey, because you don't really know if it's a cost.

Is it greasiness? Is it allergic reactions? Is it personal preference?

Is it personal preference? You don't really know. Okay.

Why don't you really know? Because you're just, you know, you're not really talking to consumers. You're just simply getting this data from an AI tool.

Okay. So now all of a sudden I kind of know a little bit more about the greasiness that can be very uncomfortable or undesirable for some individuals. Now, the next thing I want to look at is why is beard oil needed?

Okay. You know, another way you could even say it too is like, what's the main problem beard oil serves in that case? What is the main?

The number one problem? Beard oil fixes? Question mark.

So when facial hair. Okay. So this is the number one reason why.

One common problem the beard oil can help to fix is dryness and itchiness in the skin underneath the beard. When facial hair grows, it can draw moisture away from the skin, blah, blah, blah. Applying beard oil helps moisturize and neutralize and anything like that.

Okay. So the actual problem that I'm trying to get it to access is called beard itch. Beard itch is the number one problem that amongst consumers, you see, this is the thing.

Like I just asked like what's the number one beard problem, beard oil fixes. But, you know, and again, I'm asking it very generic questions. There are some people who are like experts with chat GPT and know how to like access such sophisticated questions.

It gets that, but I'm also like still new to it. So I'm trying to like resonate a lot with you guys as well in this case. But in this particular case, the main problem beard oil serves, and this is through my research, watching consumer reviews, reviews, and everything like that, is that it's beard itch.

Beard itch is what people call that problem. Okay. You know, maybe you can even say something like, you know, we'll try it here.

What is the problem that beard oil fixes called in the consumer's eyes? We'll see what that is. So, yeah, it still doesn't say specifically beard itch.

Okay. So beard itch is, you know, beard itch is what beard oil solves. And I'm just going to say this one more time really quick.

Is beard itch what beard oil solves? There we go. So that's, that's what I really wanted to talk about.

Okay. So now you start understanding a little bit more about the problem. Okay.

So now we know that beard oil solves, you know, beard itch. Again, this is through consumer content that I found out about beard itch. Okay.

Now is all of this considered correct? Yes. It allowed us to see the number one problem, which was the greasiness.

It also allowed us to see, or like what's the problem with other beard oils. Now, why is it important about to, why is it important to understand what the problem is of beard oil? Because it allows you to have a superior product that doesn't have greasiness, which is going to do significantly better for Facebook ads.

Okay. Now the next thing is what the problem solves is beard itch. So now again, as a marketer, you need to connect to people with beard itch and present them how beard oil is the main solution.

So now we need to better understand beard itch. Okay. So now let's just, what's one way we can better understand it.

It's honestly the best way to understand it. It's just simply grow a beard and experience beard itch, but you can't do that. So can we tell open AI, chat GPT to do it?

Let's see if we can. So let's see. Pretend you are a man with beard and you have beard itch.

What describe the experience for me? Okay. So it starts to feel itchy and uncomfortable.

It's like a persistent low level irritation. I can be difficult to ignore. Sometimes the skin underneath the beard can feel dry and flaky.

What's one exaggerates, exaggerates the itchiness. The sensation can be distracting and even make me feel self-conscious as I worry about others might think I'm constantly stretching my face. Okay.

Okay. Oh, this is such a good one. Self-conscious.

Boom. The itches can also be worse during certain times of the year or in dry climates. Okay.

It can be worse during certain times of the year or dry climates. Okay. Guess what?

Right now I am, you know, basically like right now it's like going into spring for the USA. So there's a few different key things we can look at here. We can look at certain times, the beard itch being worse during certain times of the year, which is more in like dry climates and warmer clients.

And then the second thing we can look at is the self-conscious part. And then the third part is just further into that pain right there. So where would our, what I want to start looking at now, it's like, okay, where do I get beard itch?

Like now I want to start to like kind of piece the puzzle together to form that identity side. Okay. You know, so like in an ad, you need to showcase the problem of beard itch.

Okay. So now we kind of understand what the problem feels like, but how do I showcase it? Where are we getting this beard itch at?

It's like, you know, is it happening when I'm sleeping? Is it happening when I'm driving? Is it happening at work?

What are the different scenarios that we can further showcase on, you know, basically like showcase on to, you know, our creatives and stuff to resonate with the consumer. Okay. If it, for example, is in the car, they're driving, we need to showcase people with that problem of beard itch first before we introduce the solution.

Okay. So where do I get beard itch? You know, what am I doing when it hits me?

Boom. Boom. Okay.

That did not do exactly what I want. That's not what I want. So let's see.

Let's go a little bit further into that. Describe different scenarios of what I'm doing when beard itch hits me unexpectedly. Okay.

Here's good one. Very good one. Okay.

So I could be at a meeting, could be at a social event, could be at a date. Think about it. Taking out a beautiful girl.

All of a sudden, boom. They're in date, social event, a meeting. Let's see.

Can we get some more? And we get five or three more scenarios. Oh, exercise.

Middle of the workout. Imagine like doing some deadlifts or something like that or heavy back squats. All of a sudden, it's just like, yeah.

Okay. Okay. Oh, okay.

So during a meeting. All right. Like imagine if like I had it right now, like try to film this YouTube video.

I was like, freaking film guys at a social event. Okay. Imagine being out there with a lot of friends and stuff during a date, during exercise while driving.

Oh, there we go. You're driving to an important meeting or apartment. Trying to stay focused on the road.

When you feel an itch in your beard, you try to ignore it and concentrate on driving, but the itchiness becomes more pronounced, making it difficult to focus. You pull over to the side of the road and try to discreetly scratch your beard, hoping to relieve the sensation. Love it.

At work. You're at your desk trying to stay focused. You're in the middle of the workout.

Trying to stay focused. Ooh. So this trying to stay focused is popping up a lot.

Okay. Try to make a good impression on your first date. Blah, blah.

Try to focus on the conversation, but the itchiness becomes more distracting. So like these are literally six different, this is three or six total scenarios right here that we could literally go get UGC videos filmed or professional videos filmed of someone doing these specific things. And then also bearded hitch and they're like, ah, you know, so these are all different problems.

Okay. Going after a problem aware market. If you're, if you're familiar with problem, like the stages market awareness.

Okay. So this is where like, I think chat GPT comes in handy is more in terms of the research side and pulling all these ideas for you. Cause like, I just got six ideas.

Boom. Like that. Okay.

Whereas if I had to do this manually, I'd be doing a lot of like YouTube and Amazon and Facebook and reading reviews. It just take a little bit more time. Okay.

So it helps out a lot with the ideation process. But if you're like, Hey, chat GPT, write me ad copy for beard oil and then copy and paste an ads manager. And they're like, it's not working.

Well, that's the problem. But if you're using this to source a lot of information, this can help out a lot. Okay.

So let's go a little bit deeper into this. So is there anything other than beard itch that beard oil helps with? Or like, why do people love?

So I'm looking for the, like the other benefits of it. Moisturizer, softening, conditioning, sense it. Okay.

So moisturizer, softening, conditioning, sense it. Now I could go into all of these, but I know from just a human psychology and like, why do guys wear cologne? So that's why I like, I'm really like the sense it part right here and let's see.

All right, cool. So pleasant smell, aroma, pleasant, personal style, confidence, making you feel more put together and attractive. One of the things I'm looking for is that through my YouTube research and actual consumer reviews is that guys liked the sense it beard oils because of the females.

Okay. My girlfriend loves it. That's why she got it for me.

My girlfriend couldn't stand like how scratchy my beard was. That's something that ChatGPT hasn't brought up yet. And that's why I tried to take it down that route.

Again, could just be my lack of answering the wrong or asking the wrong questions. A lot of you guys that watch those videos are like ChatGPT pros. I'm sure y'all can give me like way better ideas in that case right there.

But just showcasing you from how I'm looking at it. Okay. So yeah, it can provide a lot of good stuff.

And going back through, okay, we have our scenarios right here. Another thing I wanted to look at was the... It can be, you know, like during certain times of the year.

Okay. Drier times. Okay.

Well, we're going into the warmer part of the year for the States. Okay. So what are bearded guys doing during...

I don't know. Let's just say summertime. Boom.

I know this sounds so weird, but it's not what I want it. I want to know more specifically what activities... I know this sounds really weird, but what activities are bearded guys doing during summertime?

There we go. So we knew that social gatherings was one of the reasons why or like one of the scenarios way up here. Social event.

So what are the specific social events? Well, outdoor sports, barbecue and outdoors, traveling. Okay.

Boom, boom. Music festivals, beach days. Okay.

You can even say traveling. Okay. What places do bearded guys like to travel to?

And again, some of this might seem so like, well, duh, but when you're actually in a crunch and you're trying to put together maybe a script, UGC style content, put together a content plan for specific ad concept, like this can easily help you out with consistently keep pushing ideas and really helping out with that writer's block. The skill here is being able to go deeper and ask those right type of questions from here. And yeah, so that's it.

Um, oh, last one I want to do is what happens, what do you guys do if they cannot get rid of beard itch? Okay. Okay.

So this is another one and maybe I can try answering it, acting it another way. What is the number one thing that guys do if they can't get rid of a bitch? Okay.

It's talking about consulting a dermatologist as well through my review. And this is why it's important to do your own review as well. The number one thing that guys do if they can't get rid of a beard bitch is just shave it off.

That's it. Like literally every guy shaves it off. Okay.

And then get rid of it. So ultimately right here, what you would want to do is okay. Obviously it didn't answer that question, but this is why you want to also want that second hand review.

So that's what I'm saying. Like it's, it's good to have both pulled in together. I like to have like chat GPT on the side of me as I'm going through like YouTube videos, Amazon stuff, Facebook comments, things like that.

And to start asking it questions that I'm seeing commonly across. Okay. So now let's say we did a little good bit of research and everything now.

Um, Oh, I even asked. It's some objections, objections. So like I saw a common objection to beard oils, which is just wash it.

So like why would washing your, or would washing your beard help out with beard itch? Boom. All right.

So it's like, yes, it can, but not completely. Okay. Additionally, it's important to follow up with beard oil or moisturizer, replenish the skin natural overall.

Washing your beard, regular for gentle cleanser and folic. But it wants to help to reduce beard itch and promote healthy facial errors. Skin.

Okay. Why doesn't beard itch go away by just washing it? There we go.

So now like I got a few different ideas here and then last thing, cause I know this video is about to be over. One more thing I want to touch on is, okay. Using this as purely a way to start the ideation process of a particular ad concept.

So from here, let's go and do something like this. Um, write me a short video script of a guy about to shave off his beard due to beard itch and then stop due to another guy giving him beard oil to try. There we go.

So just a general concept and let's take a look at this. Boom. All right.

I could literally take this, clean it up. I do not recommend just copying and pasting it, but cleaning it up a bit, make it a little bit more towards your brand and tailored and everything like that. And then this is a whole UGC script right here.

Boom. A man's looking in the mirror, holding a razor in his hand. Grimming guys reflection.

He rubs his beard and grimaces again. I can't take this anymore. Beard driving me crazy.

Da, da, da. And then, yeah, I mean, another guy walks in the bathroom, holding a thing of beard oil, telling him how to use this. It's beard oil.

Man want to apply. This is beard itch. You know, cool.

Don't let beard itch drive you crazy. Try a beard oil and discover the benefits of a healthy, itch-free beard. Wow.

Amazing. Yeah. Really cool.

The two men exit the bathroom together, laughing and chanting as they walk down the hallway. There's so many ways. We could also like kind of flip that towards the end to have some dark humor of two guys walking out of the bathroom from a closed door, kind of laughing together.

So that would also be going to be funny too. So cool. Now we starting to get some process here.

And lastly is what other one I wanted to do. Write me video, a short video script of a guy on a date being self-conscious due to his beard oil. And the girl he's with is the girl of his dreams.

He's worried about making a bad impression. And then a waiter, I don't know, let's just say a waiter, stops him to give him a bottle of beard oil to help him out. I know, really weird.

Save the date how beard oil can boost confidence. Ooh. All right.

Let's look at this. A man is sitting at the table in a fancy restaurant, nervously running his hand through his beard. He looks around the room.

They glance at the door, checking for his date. I hope she likes me. I can't blow this.

A woman enters the restaurant, looking around the room. The man sees her and stands up, smiling nervously. Hi, look beautiful.

Hi, thank you. Look great. The man fidgets with his beard again, suddenly feeling self-conscious.

Oh, sorry about my beard. I know it's a bit wild. Acting like it looks nice.

It suits you. Blah, blah, blah. The way it approaches, sir, came a small bottle of beard oil.

Excuse me, sir. I couldn't help but notice your beard. I have a friend who makes beard oil and thought you might like to try it.

Not bad. Not bad. Like I said, all generally good ideas that I think we could stem from this.

You know, you could even showcase like long copy telling the story and then like having, you know, a just a guy and a girl together at like high quality picture of a guy and a girl sitting with obviously a bearded dude. So yeah, I love this. I, you know, what are my thoughts on chat TPT?

I think it's really good from an ideation standpoint. Um, I think that, you know, I can get a somewhat better result than the average person because I have the higher quality of marketing fundamental understanding from breakthrough advertising. If you don't have a good quality understanding of marketing fundamentals and you're just like, chat GPT, write me, add copy.

It's not going to be that great. But if you can really dig deeper and start really using as market research and understanding things quicker one, but two also still using, right? Like I said, there's a few things here.

Like it didn't showcase like one girls love the bearded sense. Okay. I wouldn't know that if it wasn't for YouTube and watching the YouTube video reviews.

Okay. And girls talking about that. So I still think you still need your own outside research, but still use chat GPT like on the side, like having this on the side while you're doing your main research to help pull things together.

This also gets you a lot of ideas and stuff like that, that you can further branch. So how does chat GPT work in my life? You know, someone made this, um, comment the other day that chat GPT is autopilot for marketers.

The same way autopilot works on a plane where pilots get in, they get in the plane, they program it and stuff like that to where it wants to go. Then they get in, they still have to manually take off, you know, just the power of thrust and stuff like that. Still watch and make sure everything's going good.

Cause if you go watch like some POV footage of like Boeing 747 taking off, as soon as they get up in the air within five minutes, the autopilot stays on until pretty much literally five minutes before it touches down. Okay. So, but the pilot is still sitting there watching, make sure nothing goes wrong.

And still there's some times where they have to turn off the autopilot, manually fly it during rough times and then put it back on. Um, so I still think that's kind of what chat GPT is, but you still need to have a high, cause like then it ends like, well, can just anyone jump in a plane and fly? No, because they lack that understanding.

So you do need high levels of understanding of marketing plus chat GPT. It's going to cut down the amount of time it takes for you to complete task, your ideation and stuff like that. And also even help you pull up new ideas as well that you might have not had in the future.

So thank you guys so much for watching this video. I hope you guys have a great rest of your day. Make sure to hit the like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

My name is Nick Theriot. Talk to you guys later. Peace out.
