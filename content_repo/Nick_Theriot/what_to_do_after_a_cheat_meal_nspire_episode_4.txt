Um Or yeah, day 4 157.6 pounds That actually is a Up Weigh in We weighed more This morning But think about this Um Ate a lot of food last night And I still have yet to go to the restroom So, if you keep focused too much On the day to day Um Weigh ins Little things like that Could throw you off And It Can like Put you in a bad mindset Especially when you're shredding Like when you get really low Towards the end of your Body goal Um So But just something to keep in mind What was the last time you used to the restroom Do you need to use the bathroom? That's something that's big In terms of a little weigh in And that's why I'm a little higher Today One dude Mobbing around in the tank He's loving the stick He's been chilling on it And uh He's just been chilling He's such a chill snake Go ahead and get him some vitamin D Up in here There we go Yeah You can sunbathe now So this whole time outside I've actually just been catching up on something that I've been wanting to do for a while now And that is creating an intro for the Terrier Solutions YouTube channel I'm about to start posting more content on that channel And I'm trying to take step by step of the things I need to get in place And I know that's something I wanted to do was get the intro done so that way it can look a little bit more professional And uh I'll show you guys what I got so far So right now I'm just kind of downloading some extra stuff, some sound effects But this is an after effects right here This is so far what I got It's no Oscar winner It's But it's simple It's clean I mean I'm not trying to hype people up I wanted to keep it professional Clean Uh I'll be posting a lot of like tutorials and stuff Uh case studies Things related towards Facebook ads in this channel So this is going to be a very techy channel Uh Dedicated to just like I said informing people on Facebook ads How we can help them with their business on Facebook ads I just want to create that separate channel and separate from this channel As this channel is more overall life empowerment And this is more further in the trenches of uh What I also do Uh for like work and stuff Do you remember this song right here? Like drop a like smash the like button if you remember this song Like a G6 No clue why But I woke up with this song in my head this morning Um I had to listen to it But we're going to be knocking down One scoop Goes pre And we're about to hit up a nice little chest day So We'll see how it goes Let's see Just Like a G6 Like a G6 Alright There we go This has to be the most efficient way to take a pre workout Because A I never felt like cleaning this after Or before I put my water in here Two I don't feel like dirty in a cup Um Like a disposal cup and stuff So Best way to take your pre And honestly guys It's like the small things I miss Because I know like Before my workout Like just Chilling If I'm working out with Jake that day Just chilling with Jake In the Like Uh Like our gyms Like lobby and stuff Sipping out some pre Uh Just catching up for a few minutes Like that's just shit like that That's the little things I miss about this quarantine I don't miss I mean Yeah I miss working on a gym But I'm perfectly fine with working out Over here right now Obviously I'm not making the optimal gains Etc But It's going good so far But it's just the little things that go around it That I miss Welcome to the main topic of today's video And that's going over like what happens if you get off track on your diet So actually I did not film it But This whole video Uh Towards the end Went hang out Went to like a little family gathering and stuff At the girlfriend's house And After I pretty much had a cheat meal I It's uh It was a sonic Reese's blast Cheat meal 100% And I Lied to my I So I had to do myself one cheat meal a week That is true But At the same time I'm only like 4 days into my diet I Probably shouldn't have did a cheat meal and stuff But it was one of those things where I was like Look I already knew that was going to happen before a diet And stuff like that So Um You know Obviously If I Knew I needed to hold the cheat meal further away I definitely wouldn't do it But Uh I'm just trying to get over this weekend with Good Friday, Easter and everything And then You know Seeing family and stuff So Um That was kind of my main issue And I did have my cheat meal last night So I definitely not going to do another one Until Next Friday, Saturday, Sunday And I wanted to talk to you guys today about Like hey you know What happens if Let's say you Maybe didn't have a cheat meal And you You had a bad meal Maybe You know You're dieting hard And then all of a sudden You know You go out with your friends one night And it's like 3 o'clock in the morning You're absolutely starving And And You need to eat something And You pull up to a waffle house IOP Or something And just load up or something Or maybe it's during the day You're out and about And You're starving And then That's usually what happens It's usually when you do not have your food prepped Or you do not have access to clean food It's usually when a cheat meal happens At least for me I know like sticking to a day to day diet Is pretty consistent and easy But it's more of the social pressure Of like If I have a big family gathering Or something like that Of You know What to You know sometimes I'm pressured to eat the food And then like Hey alright I got a little cheat meal So But what happens Because a lot of people What they'll do is Alright tomorrow I'll do extra cardio Tonight I won't eat anything else to rest tonight You know Tomorrow I'll starve myself all day What do you do If you have a cheat meal How do you bounce back And There's no perfect thing for this But I want you guys to imagine something Imagine a pendulum How it swings from left to right And in the center It's centered There's no movement It's just straight down But if you pull it back It'll swing Bounce back and forth Bounce back and forth Between both sides Until it finds its way Through the middle That is consistently That is consistently with A diet If you have an extreme moment Where you bounce to one side hard And then the next day You immediately try to Overcompensate You're going to swing back to the other side And then What's going to happen You're going to Overcompensate You're going to starve yourself Maybe for a day or two To punish yourself For having a bad meal And what you're going to do is You're going to be like Oh my god I need extra food And you're going to overeat again So then you apply to So then you'll come into this rigorous cycle Bounce it back and forth For maybe a few days It's a very strong mindset and stuff And let me just make a quick comment too On the video The training footage right here Of me Look I was trying to do a bench press Up on the floor And this is probably the easiest thing to do right here But anything Anyway Anyway Going back So what you want to do is You want to keep that pendulum nice and balanced So if you swing really hard to one side Honestly The best thing to do Is just get back on your original plan So if I have a cheat meal last night I'm not going to suffer today I'm not going to You know Starve myself etc I'm simply going to start the morning back I'm going to do the same amount of cardio I was going to do today I was going to do my same training I was going to do today I'm going to do the same amount of food I was going to do today I'm not going to pull anything away from me I'm going to focus Be neutral with the situation And stick to my plan And I've done this for two other diets And never had any issues And I've never had that bouncing back and forth That mental struggle you have And I think it's the easiest way to do it Because look if you have a cheat meal Alright You might put on .6, .5 pounds Maybe even a pound Depending on how much food you eat And then the next day You know you'll probably Use the restroom and stuff You'll clean your stomach out Do a little bit of cardio and stuff And you'll probably be back To your regular weight in maybe a day or two So Don't stress over it Simply get back on your plan Get back on track And that's the rule I follow Except for all my diets And we'll be following for this diet I had a little bit more social pressure this weekend Just because with Easter Good Friday and stuff But I know Next week and stuff We won't have any of that And we'll both hit it hard Harder Than we're already doing now I think I'm doing a really good job so far With this diet As that was my first slip up In four or five days And I've been hitting my calories everyday In fact I weighed myself this morning And I was I had a lower weigh in Than I had the day before So And I only went over like 400 calories Which is It's not a lot But when I have a regular real cheap meal day I normally do like maybe a whole pizza Or something like that And I know that we'll hold it I just do an hour Eat as much food as I can So But yeah guys That's my philosophy on that Imagine a pendulum Swinging left to right You want to try to keep it centered Neutral And Best of luck guys If you have any of those problems Alright for post workouts We got two packets of apple oatmeal With a tablespoon of Nutella And two scoops of those pre-workout I mean post-workout And then I'm going to take care of some work While I finish all this Alrighty guys I'm actually Did not get any work done Because I finished eating then Hurry up and showered and stuff Here is the fit Currently going to Kennedy's We got a little like family get together And Small Very very small Quarantine And We're going to also Maybe go take some more pictures So Probably going to catch up on all my work Tonight When I get back Be another late night And I'm also being The hugest douche right now Wearing sunglasses When I want to forget them So See you guys soon The guy wasićž your love is gone away it's
