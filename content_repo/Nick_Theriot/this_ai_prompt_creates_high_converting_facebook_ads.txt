so i got a lot of questions going on how do you become a master copywriter when it comes down to facebook ads and everything like that and copywriting has changed a lot nowadays when it comes to facebook ads i think a lot of people think it's the body copy and the headline that goes in and then you need to hire a creative strategist to write the creative i'm like yo that is just not correct at all i personally am not a fan of creative strategists i'm very anti-creative strategist so sorry for any creative strategists that watch these videos i just think you guys are useless literally no hate at all just personal beliefs and everything like that you know for me it's all about direct response advertising and i'm very copywriter pro of like hey if you're a professional copywriter you do the research you understand how you want to position this product in the marketplace and then from there you're the one that's writing the script that's going into that creative and the plans for that creative then it's going over to the visual team that'll actually put that together and today we'll be talking about all of those good things exactly how you actually go ahead can go in an account write a script and you know like what's the research process like all of those good things of being like a really good copywriter so basically we'll do is we'll do all the research and then we'll write a script something like this and then we'll put into visuals like this and first thing always starts off with your research and i'll start off with like my product for example facebook ads agency and i'll go on like tiktok i'll go on like other agency websites i'll go on like foreplay.co and i'll go even youtube for example sales calls and my goal here is to first look at the desires across the marketplace once i understand desires across the marketplace i can then start to prioritize those by what is the most confidence behind those and you know me personally if i look at like facebook ads agency this product the desire to scale ads is a lot stronger and dominant across the market than you know desires outspores to a qualified team right then the next thing i want to look at is who are the different people that have those desires so who are the different people that has the desire to scale ads there's people that are literally at 10k a month for their shop by store who desires to scale their ads and there's people that are literally at 100k a month who desires to scale their ads so like these are just different types of people this might be shop by store owners might be legion business owners this might be people doing webinars like personal brands and stuff like that and then from there i want to pick a customer avatar and start diving deeper into it and the first thing i like to look at is what if they tried to accomplish that particular desire so what has someone tried to this customer avatar what have they done to try to satisfy that desire well they might have tried bid caps cost caps they might have not tried anything right like we like literally might be the first solution they try and then the next thing i want to look at is starting to write what i would say hooks around this which then will go into our angles here so here's our hook why bid caps are keeping shop by store owners stuck at 100k a month now if we want to test another angle around this here's just a whole new another hook right here new ad creative that's helping shop by store owners break past 100k a month and here's their two different hooks i wrote as different angles so your angles are just different ways to say the same hook that feels different boss facebook advertiser reveals the ad creative at scale shop by store owners past 100k a month this new ad creative helps shop by stores break past 100k a month in less than seven days so once i kind of have a rough outline of this then i can start to and this is this is probably from like eight to ten hours of research i just did a quick one real quick for you guys for this video but you probably want to do about eight to ten hours of research of really understanding your market and building all this out then you can start looking at okay who do we want to use first so like let's say for example if we want to try shop by store owners who've tried and failed with cost caps slash bid caps who have a desire to scale facebook ads and we want to sell them our facebook ads agency so then i'll jump into whether it's claude or whether it's chat gpt i'm a fan of claude that's just the one i have a personal preference on i don't really give a what you use as long as you know you understand why i'm using this one and that's the key thing so the first thing i like to do here is i like to go ahead and tell a story i want to tell a story and the story i want to tell is specific to this which i have selected so our ideal customer is a shopify store owner who is stuck at one hundred thousand dollars per month in revenue want to scale their facebook ads so they can break past this ceiling so they can break past one hundred thousand dollars per month in revenue boom now i want to keep looking i'm looking at what if they tried and failed with so let's just assume that they are using bid caps i don't want to say they tried a bunch of things i want to be very clear of what they tried and why they failed with then i want to actually input why they fell with that so like let's just say for example they tried using bill cap bid caps but does not work for them all it does is limit how much they can spend and it's actually negatively bringing down revenue boom there we go so do not be the person i said they tried a lot of things now like you want to pick each solution and create a story around each solution they tried or maybe they didn't try anything yet it's just like boom now we want to introduce our product our product is a facebook ads agency now keep in mind if they've already tried other solutions to scale we and we need to introduce something new our product is a facebook ads agency where we run their ads for them we have a unique facebook ads strategy that is called creative testing this is assuming they haven't tried creative testing yet this works by finding new winning ad creative that appeal to more people and generate more sales helping there we go so now we have our thesis right or like our story so you'll write a story like this for each one of the different like solutions they've tried and fell that per each desire and each customer avatar and stuff like that because like let's say for example if our desire to scale ads was for legion businesses then what if they what if it has a legion business have tried and failed with you know and if they haven't tried anything yet then i don't even need to really call out what they tried and failed with i just need to call it basically how our product helps them then from here what you want to do here is i like to use uh dan kennedy dan kennedy claude knows how like his writing is and stuff like that so please create me 10 headlines i can use to grab the attention of my ideal customer pretend you are dan kennedy boom and then there we go and i'll write that so let's take a look at these so stuck at 100k a month here's how to shatter that revenue ceiling without bid caps this is good but it misses one of the key elements which is ideal audience so i'd probably say are you a shopify store owner stuck at 100k a month here's how to shatter that revenue ceiling without bid caps that's good attention shopify store owners the 100k wall crumbles with this facebook ad secret i'm not a fan of this one but i would probably change this i'd probably say attention shopify store owners the 100k wall crumbles with creative testing here's how to how to get started um bid caps killing your growth unlock the creative testing key to six figure scaling i like that one shopify because why it's calling out what they failed with and then it's introducing the new solution shopify scaling secrets how we catapult stores passenger camera when bid caps fail warning your facebook ads are leaving money on the table here's the fix i don't like that one at all it's just too vague and stuff like that 100k club join i don't like that one bid caps backfire and discovered the ad strategy that's that's rescuing shopify stores okay i like these these are all good let's look at some stuff here i really like this attention shopify store owners there we go i don't want to just basically do please create me a there we go all right attention shopify store owners stuck under game off here's how to shatter that revenue ceiling without bid caps you've built a successful shopify store hitting that coveted 100k month revenue mark but now you're stuck plateaued frustrated you try scaling vid caps but instead i'd probably clean this up there we go and then i'm just going to shorten this attention shopify store owner stuck in 100k a month here's how to shatter that revenue ceiling without bid caps bid caps limiting your growth we get it you're ready to scale but your ads i don't really like that at all i'd probably do this is probably what i would do here blah blah attention shopify store owner stuck 100k a month here's how to shout out revenue ceiling without bid caps i just removed this i don't like that you're ready to scale but your ads are holding you back you're ready to scale but your ads are holding you back enter creative testing uh actually no you know what i'm actually going to keep the bid caps i don't like the caps well i guess you could say it makes sense for our cap for our customer so then from here this is pretty much how i'll basically structure this and then i'll put please add b-roll for each line for my content creator you can also do like for example like b-roll or something like that you know basically i'm just trying to identify like what visuals i want to show on the screens and stuff like that so attention shopify store owner stuck at 100k a month here's how to shatter revenue things about bid caps montage a frustrated store owners looking at plateaued revenue charts on commuter streams b-roll close up of facebook ads been showing limited reach due to bid caps boom yeah pretty straightforward here now a couple other things so like this is good right here this is like 85 polish this is probably going to be significantly better than what you currently are actively doing before you watch this video now i'd probably spend like another hour to two hours on this and just really refine it critique it and stuff like that but the next things that i'm looking at that i'm not really going to dive into this video because i'm trying to give you guys a lot but like not everything because i don't want this video be two hours long but the next thing i'd be looking at is you want to hypnotize your customers and hypnotizing your customers is basically where you kind of i like to repeat the desired state three times and an ad to where we're showcasing a few different like basically case studies of where we're showcasing desired state multiple times so here you know we talk about like okay like maybe like the results and stuff like that here's like an example right here our creative testing proven strategy helps shop owners break through 100k a month all right cool here's how it works so we talk we showcase that once i'd probably showcase maybe a customer testimonial and then maybe like another example of how we took another store to 100 past 100k a month to where we're hitting on their desired state which is scaling past 100k a month at least three times in that ad um i'm a really big fan of going look at like the billy maize's ads um going look at like you know the sham wow or like these different ad things that billy maize has done and if you look at it he repeats a lot of these examples like he showcases how a product is solving that desire multiple times over in that 30 second tv commercial and what that does is it hypnotizes the customer to some degree of like showing multiple layers of proof that this product does that thing so that's just one else and other thing i'd be looking at i would also be looking at different angles as well so you know for example here is this particular angle stuck at 100k a month here's how to shatter that ceiling oop hold up here is our hook boom uh please create me 10 different angles to use and we might find some more here urgency angle time is money every day 100k is a day of missed opportunity here's how to break through now again i'm not like a fan of all of these but i can at least get ideas to start like kind of critiquing my own stuff um big thing that i look for in a hook is the golden hook formula which is ideal audience intrigue curiosity imply benefit that gives me a reason why to basically look at this but yeah there's some decent stuff in here that you know it's been a little time to critique and build off of and then give that a test then i basically do my creative headlines which is literally this script that i wrote right here i'd put all that together then i'll write the body copy then i'll write the headline then i'll send this creative script off to my visual creative team or if i need to hire a content creator to film it i'll go hire a content creator it just depends on the situation then la la i get my final piece of content and we do this you know roughly three different times every week for every client every week of the month so yeah so we create a lot of content every single week but the big part here is those big swings that we do here you know we don't want to be the the person that's just like well hey we have a red creative let's test the blue creative it's like well what the fuck no that makes that's gonna like barely do anything for performance we want to create those big swings with different angles different avatars different desires that's going to create those bigger performance impacts and like testing those different levels of sophistication and awareness and all that good stuff right
