Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nickterio and today I have an exciting new video for you guys.

Today, we'll be going over the actions that you need to be taking on a day-to-day basis to actually get results with Facebook ads. I'm literally about to show you a pretty much like a hierarchy of different actions and their effects on your results. So like, you know, if you have this, but don't have this, you will not get results.

If you have this, but you're not doing this, then you won't get results. So like literally like how you can kind of prioritize certain things. I think this is something that's super, super important because I see people like, Oh dude, do I need to do CBO or ABO?

And they're still running the same creative for the last six months. That's literally deteriorating day by day by day. And regardless of what they do, it's not going to work because they just need new creative.

And it's very hard to understand like what you need to actually be prioritizing. And don't get me wrong. It's not your fault.

It's all these YouTubers out there. That's like, Oh dude, you just throw an ad up and then boom, you get a bunch of money. So like when you don't get that reaction based off the feedback you've been given or you're taught, then you start freaking out and trying to figure out what's wrong.

So you start thinking as a strategy or like the technique of how you use Facebook ads as the tool, but it's, it's more of the strategy in terms of performance and the creative and the copy and all that stuff. So with that being said, um, let's dive into this video before we get started, make sure that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So with that being said, let's hop into it.

Okay. So this is pretty much my hierarchy in terms of like highest profitable action and lowest profitable action you can be taking. This is going to be a really big thing for you as you kind of like look at everything and like try to understand like, Hey, where do I need to prioritize my time?

Because one of your biggest assets is time. And that's something that you really need to be able to use efficiently and pretty much these high income earners. Like that's the biggest thing is they can use their time efficiently.

They know what to focus on because what they focus on is what generates results. If everything you do per day is focusing on higher profitable actions, that's going to make you a lot more money than worrying about AB or CBO. And don't get me wrong.

AB or CBO does pretty much have its place and has its time to talk about. But the problem is, is the people that are worried about this, like I said, are still having problems or creative. There's still haven't dialed that in yet.

There's a lot of other issues and they're thinking that's going to solve it when it's not. So I'm hopefully with this video, you're just going to open your eyes up of everything else you can be doing to improve performance and improve your brain and everything like that. So that being said, number one is product.

You can have a really great landing page, but if you don't have a good product, this just, this won't work at all. So again, people spend a whole bunch of time on their landing page and then just the product is bad. Now, look, this is why we work with brands doing at least 25 K a month in revenue.

So that way we know we have a great product market fit. Now for people that are doing like, let's just say you're not even cracking a hundred, 200 bucks a day in revenue, just because you're still trying to figure out that product market fit, then you really need to spend a lot of time understanding your market, understanding how your product benefits your market, understanding your competition, understanding the features and benefits of your competition's product and understanding why your product is the clear winner in terms of the consumer's eyes compared to everyone else. So that's something really big right there.

And when you have that right there, you'll understand how you can promote your product. And if, when you understand how you can promote your product, you understand what copy and creative to create, and then it, everything else falls in place. So you really need to understand your product, your core customer avatar, um, and how it helps them, why they should choose you over the competitors.

Um, and that's to be a really big, strong suit for you right there. So highest profitable action is really understanding that because, you know, again, you're engineering a product that's going to make you hundreds of millions of dollars. Um, if you're going into this new, you need to have the mindset of, Hey, this is a hundred million dollar product.

How, and how can I make it a hundred million dollar product, um, versus, Oh, how can I make a hundred dollars a day? Because you can go find a product that's going to make you a hundred dollars today. Then once you try to scale past that, it's very difficult.

You know, how can I find a product that's a hundred million dollar product or a multimillion dollar product? Now, next step, you have a great product. Woohoo.

Awesome. Now landing page, you really need to have a great landing page. Um, and, and this is, this is more of your, your product page.

So I know I'm saying landing page, but it's your product page, the page that just says add to cart, um, and Shopify, that's all it is. So nothing fancy here, but you need to be able to have the right stuff on that product page to make it easy for people to take action. It's very key right there.

So the first one is just having good load speed, um, easy to find add to cart button. Uh, we look, we're a big fan of removing all the buy now of Google pay or Apple pay and all that. And then we just have add to cart.

That's it. Uh, we see our higher conversion rate right there. Um, and then we just make sure it's a very strong contrast button.

Um, so like if you have a white theme and now like a strong black or red or green, something that's very contrast for that button that matches your theme for that's card. But if you're like targeting different countries, make sure your currency is illustrated properly. So those other current, uh, countries, um, all questions that your consumers frequently asks, list them on the page, provide answers, kind of like a fact section, really educate people on your products, some great product photography, great cinematography of like product and action and use and stuff, uh, demonstrating the products and social proof.

If you have any credit Dations, uh, demoing the product, like really make sure that product page is very, um, you know, essentially optimized, essentially gives the consumer everything they need to make a decision whether or not to purchase from you. So it's really big right there. And again, you can have amazing creative, but if your product page is horrendous, guess what?

You're not going to get that. Um, and that's going to be very, um, hard. So again, product landing page.

Great. We're, we're structuring that foundation. So great product, great landing page.

Now let's move forward. Creative. This is next biggest thing.

This is generally what's going to stop the scroll. People argue this all the time. Um, it's either headline on the ad itself or Facebook, or it's the first sentence or to creative for me, personally, I'm leveraging more to the creative.

That's what stops the scroll for me. And then I look at the body copy. Then I look like the headline at the bottom of the ad.

So for me, creative is everything. Now for creative right there, the biggest thing is the three second intro, and the thumbnail, those are the two things that grab attention. And those are like, that's literally right there is like 80% of the performance, because if you can grab attention, then it's the next job of the storyline of that video to hold that attention and keep people interested to be able to take action on your product.

So we've seen it before where we just swap the intro out on a few different videos, create a few different intros and had the same video of just a few different intros and seen clear night to day difference in the three second intro, you know, to thumbnail in terms of performance and stuff. So that's another huge thing right there. We've gone in an account before that was getting like a $60 cost per acquisition.

We literally just like the only thing we did in the account was take one of their best performing creatives, which was $6 acquisition. And we literally cut the video in half, remove the first half of the video. Cause it was useless.

It was just bleh. And then we basically use the second half of the video, toss it in the ads manager and went down to about 20 to $25 cost per acquisition. That is insane.

Um, we literally almost cut down their acquisition by 60 to 70% in their business, which is huge. Imagine becoming 60 to 70% more profitable in your business by simply swapping the intro on a creative. That's it.

So that's really big right there. That's, and for me personally with YouTube, my titles and my thumbnails are the biggest factors in performance for, you know, essentially each video, I can create an amazing video, but if I do a terrible thumbnail, terrible title, then the video does very poor and performance. This is what grabs your attention.

And then the video keeps you interested. So that's very big right there. So before you start worrying about like the, you know, call to the action at the end, start worrying about your intro, then test a bunch of different intros with your main video.

And then whatever one works best, then you can start testing the middle of the video. Then you can start testing in the video, um, for graphics. If you don't want to image ad, um, you know, we're a big fan of video ads and image ads.

If you don't want to image ad, this is going to be like the little onscreen text as well. That plays a big role. And then also plays of what your actual picture is.

So like, for example, if it's, you know, this iPhone right here, I could do this iPhone on a white background. Um, and then I can also test this white, this iPhone in its professional use in this office right here, me holding it. I can take a picture of like a model holding it.

So like that's to be a big thing right there as well. So those two key things right there is really big for image ads. Um, and then video ads, different intros, different thumbnails for the video, those hold really high up there and then start worrying about the middle and the end of the video.

So that's super, super big right there. Um, cause again, if you have great creative, great landing page, great product, you're golden. But if you have really great ad copy and a terrible creative, you're going to still struggle.

I mean, you still probably do some conversions, but you're going to struggle because ad copy we've noticed lately ad copy has been the biggest difference for people for a higher return on ads been in the backend. So the creative does a lot of the work to get people to click and stuff. Um, but ad copy is also, we've seen starting to see like as more of like, it's getting less and less.

Like I'm not gonna lie. It's getting less and less important, but still it's very important. If that makes sense.

Um, it's important, but not important. It's, it's, it's weird. Okay.

Cause we've seen ads with really amazing creative and we just start tossing some random ad copy on it still holds the same performance as you know, some of the ones with more thoughtful out of ad copy. So if you get anything right, then you really need to get that creative, right? As that's going to hold a lot higher performance now ad copy again.

So ad copy, there's a few different things you got to control here. So first off it's the angle, the angle plays a big fact. So there's a lot of different angles of which you could promote something.

You know, this iPhone right here, one angle could be about how long the battery life is in this new 12 plus another angle could be, um, unlimited texts and message on this iPhone 12. Another angle could be, um, you know, the it's waterproof and these different angles attract different types of people in the market. And when you track these different types of people in the market, each other, a certain level of performance, and that's a big thing right there.

So just a general concept right there. If the ad copy of the different angles, that's a big one right there. Keep coming up with new angles and keep testing.

New angles is very important. Again, if you want to know how to test creative and test odd copy ad copy in the most efficient way, then check out my YouTube video where it's like $24,000 in seven days using a single budget, a single CBO or simplified account structure. And I show you how to test creative.

I show you how to test ad copy. It's very simple to do. It's very hard to create, but it's very simple to test efficiently in the ads manager, through these particular things.

Now ad copy again, angles, the number one, then it's the first line, the very first line you see on a Facebook ad that becomes the next second important thing that you have to really worry about. Then the headline below the ad, then the body copy. So like, for example, the body copies everything after hit and see more everything below the, the, you know, the, I guess you could say the, I forgot what the scroll essentially.

So that's really important right there to understand. So now you understand like, Hey, if the whole ad copy working, let's try a different angle. Okay, cool.

The angles working. Let's see if we can boost it up a little bit more by changing the first line, maybe some headline body copy, yada, yada, yada, all that fun stuff. So if you have really great ad copy, but it's shitty creative and great landing page, great product, you're still not really going to grab that, get that return on ad spend.

This is your year. Um, usually the people that have that, that like, Hey, we're breaking even a little bit better than break even. And I take a look at their ad account and they're creative in their copy.

It just sucks. It's just blah. And usually when we swap that out and change that, um, we see performance shoot up higher.

So that's a big thing right there to really spend more time on. Now, lastly, here is the beloved ad account structure. This is, Oh, should we do on ABO or CBO bid cap versus lowest costs, yada, yada, yada.

So there's a lot of people on this channel. I see the comments all the time. They're questioning these different performances of how to improve performance.

Then we do a consulting call together, or we do a strategy call together. And we take a look at our account and like the last six months, they have an updated creative copy, their landing pages, blah, the product is good, but they're not promoting in the most efficient way. And then it's just like, Oh, but ABO is going to be my dream or CBO is going to make everything all my pain go away.

So this is also a reason why I do not like promoting these crazy, um, case studies because people think that it's because the ad account structure and trust me, I don't, don't blame you at all because I had the same level of thoughts, um, about a year and a half ago when I was getting into all of this, I was just like, Oh, I just need a perfect ad account structure, perfect app ad account structure. That's all I need. That's all I need.

And everyone was like, dude, you just need to test creative. You need to have some copy and test landing page. You need to test product.

I'm like, no, no, no, no. Add account structure, add account structure. And then I finally came to realization after multiple tests myself of what drove performance.

And at the end of the day, it's creative ad copy landing page and product. Those are the core components of a really great, um, you know, business and be able to scale and all that fun stuff. So ad account structure comes last.

Now, again, just because you're commenting AB or CBO does not put you in the basket of all this part. Like I shouldn't be commenting that because there is a place in time to ask about that. Um, if you're already doing all this amazingly and you're asking about AB or CBO cool, that is great.

Like there's nothing wrong with that. You know, kind of confused people. Like I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

Just don't be asking that when you have none of this in place right here. Cause, but if you have all this in place and you're asking about that, that's perfectly fine. So just to make sure that you're aware of that.

Um, if you're testing creative weekly, you're testing copy weekly, you're really looking at your landing page and figuring out the most optimal way into optimizing everything. Um, you're constantly evolving your product and then you're asking about AB or CBO great. Like totally that's, we can have that conversation, but you need to make sure you have all this done because again, you're, you're, you're focusing on the low profitable action.

That's going to magically make these high profitable actions. Just go away. If you know, if you can fix ad account structure, like that's not realistic at all.

That's wishful thinking essentially. So ad account structure though, that is something though you do need to touch on because I've seen quite a lot of people with terrible ad account structures. Um, and we've seen improvements in ROAS up to 30 to 50% by fixing their ad account structure.

But again, it's not the catalyst. If you've been doing a one X last year on your, on your ad spend, and I just say all you do a CBO instead of ABO, you're not going to jump to a magical grid three to four X. You probably jumped like a one and a half X or a 1.25 X.

You might even go down because that's the reality. Ad account structure is just another technique of how to use the tool. And you have to understand that Facebook ads is a tool and there's a lot of different techniques of how to use it.

There's no strategy on Facebook ads. There's strategy around performance marketing. And that's what I show you guys and educate you guys on this channel is performance marketing.

And I try to show you the strategies and performance marketing. And then the techniques, there's a variety of different techniques to use tool, which is Facebook ads. So this is pretty much the hierarchy right here.

And I really hope you guys have taken some level of value from this, um, to basically kind of, Hey, wait, whoa, Nick, I never even thought about that before. Or, you know, nay, I've been struggling to figure out where to spend my time at, maybe what to prioritize. Maybe you get a lot of stuff on your plate and you need to make those priorities.

And then this is like the biggest thing right here. You know, maybe you're questioning your mind. Do I need to put a new creative account or do I need to test a CBO camper campaign or ABO campaign?

Well, it's more like it's going to give you better performance. If you spend time on that creative campaign, um, and not really worry about that AB or CBO. And then after we get that new creative in, it's starting to do really well.

Then let's, Hey, let's, let's put around that AB or CBO. So there's, there's a thought process around that as well. So it's very key to understand.

Well guys, it's about that time today. I really hope you all enjoyed this video. Um, I posted this on Facebook a few days ago.
