We will save it. Video on the video.based care team. It's in the video episode of Freakhead.

Have more fun in hyperarner.ì—¼ers are a lotmented.When you Ovete, all righty guys uploading video right now just finished it up and stuff and totally check this out first homemade pizza should be pretty good i think this whole youtube channel is just going to be about cooking because it's literally the only good entertainment i can bring right now currently finishing up a work block right now i want to show you guys something pretty cool for at least my agency owners and stuff who watch this video currently right now i am testing two types of intro messages for reaching out on linkedin i do all of my agency outreach on linkedin and that's just because the type of niche i'm going after i'm going after fashion brand clothing brand owners and it's very hard to find these types of people on facebook and other types of like social media platforms so right now in my process i'm currently testing two different intro messages let me show you guys some cool so i'm not going to go completely into everything but right here i have a google document open and it's just my two messages i'm not going to show it to you guys because i don't want anyone stealing it right now but come on guys it's easy create two types of intro messages and you test them and but the sheet i have is pretty cool that i created to actually track those numbers so i just created a simple google sheets document uh we got message a right there and then also i got message b right there and every day i send them out i log them and then as i get those messages back i mark it as a response and me and max are both on that max is my sales rep for the agency um and then basically just fsj message b and then they're all tied in right there and then just over time i log it every time one cent and as well as the response rate etc you as an agency owner or if you don't want any type of sales you need to understand and know your numbers and you cannot do that without actually physically tracking it you can't just have an estimate in your head hey i think about two percent of people reply back to my intro message or thirty percent people reply back to my intro message you need to understand your numbers so that way you can actually test different variables um both my intro messages are completely different so that way i know hey am i maximizing my time with the best calibrated intro message and what i'll do is also i'll test different variables of different um different follow-up messages etc in terms of all that as well so i'm gonna keep coming there and working on these few things the sales process and finishing up i just need to actually go through my recent linkedin connections and scout any potential hot prospects i guess you could say and from there work on a few other things inside the agency all righty guys i didn't really know how i want to finish up this video to be honest i didn't really record much yesterday i wanted to i guess title this video something related to how i'm holding up with this quarantine right now it's officially been a whole kind of week now since being in this quarantine how have i been doing how my mental health is because that's all very critical i know your mental health your mindset is critical in terms of longer term success and stuff and i think for me with some quarantine thing it really hasn't had any major effects yet yes i miss my french yes i miss going out to be able to a restaurant go to have beer downtown i think the biggest thing for me is i've been able to keep myself busy on a day-to-day basis with things that i love doing so for me i start running i've never been a runner but i enjoy exercise in general so just going for a run in the morning boxing after focusing on my online business and stuff reading books i enjoy talking to my girlfriend on the phone actually going to hang out with my girlfriend here and there cooking is something that i love food in general and cooking something i've always wanted to get better at so i think i've just been filling up my day-to-day activities uh full of stuff i love to do now something i am i guess you could say struggling with is motivation and stuff i think this whole work at home now has been a twist to my current regimen and i know like working out in terms of like weight lifting you know i go by one in the morning but afternoon i do like my weight lifting i know my motivation has been little very low on that and actually my work blocks my first i can i can nail out my first four-hour work block with no issues at all and i think my second one later through the day actually kind of dive sticks and nose dive down so i know next week that's all things that i'm gonna be taking an account for to really kind of like optimize my schedule as much as possible because i know that greater longer term success how optimized my schedule is now how well it's put together how well stick to it and stuff so i think that's something that has been taking effect for me where a lot of people right now are stuck at they're just watching netflix they're just watching youtube they're not finding things to be productive uh with their time and that's really where this quarantine is hitting up negatively and impacting them and in fact any advice to you guys is start to craft and put together a schedule for your day-to-day even though you're at home and stuff if you do not have a schedule a schedule is going to keep you moving it's going to keep you completing things throughout the day it's going to properly stimulate your mindset uh your brain uh your brain needs to have some type of mental stimulation to get you through the day and the activities you choose need to be things that's going to actually put a little bit of challenge to you uh something that you can kind of focus on for a period of time and something that gives you a sense of accomplishment once finished so for me it's working out for me it's reading a book for me it's working on my business online for you it could be you could still do probably some workouts at home you can easily read a book actually read books that elevate your life so let's say i don't know beginning of this year i read a bunch of relationship books just to become a better partner boom there you go um read books that's going to affect your life whether it's maybe getting better with your money maybe it's getting better mental mindset everyone at home right now maybe you're going to school you should be able to double down on your school activities become a better student become smarter etc if you are not going to school at all maybe you just work a regular job and you're looking to advance your career right now could be a great time to kind of rethink your career career in the future maybe create like a linkedin uh start establishing connections and stuff that can further help you along your career maybe you're not happy with what you're doing right now right now would be a great time to maybe research some online businesses etc that you can do i really appreciate you guys watching make sure you drop a like comment and subscribe if you haven't uh my goal is to post
