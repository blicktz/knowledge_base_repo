yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio today i have exciting new video for you guys where i'm actually going to give you some tips on how to write killer ad copy for e-commerce that has helped me generate over four million dollars in the last 12 months for e-commerce brands we've worked with so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday let's dive into it guys so you have to understand there's three components to every single ad first off is the body copy that's the main copy you see on an ad you have your creative which is your video your carousel your gif whatever type of you know visual thing you're using to sell people on your product and then you have your headline and the way it works is your creative grabs attention first then your headline and then your body copy that's the process of which people see an ad and the way their eyes go they go creative headline ad because the creative grabs their attention the headlines the next quickest thing is the next biggest thing in bold and stuff and it's that it's the easiest thing to read really quick before they dig deeper into the body copy so your job as a marketer is to get the creative to get people to read the headline and the headline is to get the people to read the body copy so the creative really needs to be you know like you know stand out really grab their attention i could do a whole multitude of videos on creative but let's just assume your creative is perfect it visually grabs the right people's attention it visually it communicates the right idea to people then your headline your headline itself needs to really grab and make people curious enough in order to read the body copy so say for example my creative is me just talking about ios 14 and the impacts of it and then my headline will be insider secrets to beating ios 14 and winning with facebook ads so you know when you see this video you see the headline and then you're like holy shit i want to read more and they read the body copy so your next job is to communicate to people whatever you're trying to sell so insider secrets to beating ios 14 and winning with facebook ads so i could go dive deeper into some of the pain points people are experiencing with ios 14 and tying into exactly what they're experiencing now and then my awesome solution that's going to generate all these awesome benefits that relate to them and then my reason to act now hey we have a hundred spots left for this free community and there's already over a thousand people on the waiting list so make sure you grab a spot now before we close everything off so that's kind of like the process of which people go through an ad and some of the different key points to focus on now let's take a step back we need to really understand our consumer first so if you don't understand your consumer then all the ad copy in the world will not fix your issue you need to understand your issue and best way to do that is a lot of this and a lot of on your computer doing research and it's what a lot of people neglect 20 of my time is spent in the ads manager the other 80 of my time is spent on researching creative copy consumer so i can better understand my consumer and better understand what drives them so what you need to do is create a google sheet or literally you can just do it on your your notebook right there you want to create a few different columns number one is pain points what are the pain points people are experiencing right now what are they're in pain with so relating back to that ad about ios 14.5 a few pain points could be are you tired of not seeing or you know not even let's pull that back for a second pain points right now with ios 14 what are we experiencing what's the pain i'm in what's hurting me so for me lack of tracking results being down okay cool look just the quality over quantity if you can only list a pain point or two that's perfectly okay so pain point i noticed a decrease in results i've also experienced a lot of tracking issues with facebook ads and shopify so two things that i'm in pain with right now and you can have a pain point priority hierarchy as well so which one's giving me the most pain me per sec care less about the the tracking but the results are down and that's what's really hurting me in pain and that's what you need to understand and you can do this by going through groups reddit forms youtube videos just reviews different things around your product competitor products competitor marketing looking at their ads what pain points they focus on and what pain points you think are resonating with your ideal audience so look through all of these things it should be an hour to two hour research session right here maybe four hour research session right here between everything i'm gonna cover in this video so really dig deep into those pain points because if you don't understand what they're experiencing now if i was like completely different pain point that's unrelevant to facebook ads so want to boost your landing page conversion rate if i was 14.5 and it's still gonna be kind of related to it but you know if you're if you're not really digging deep to those core pain points then it's gonna be irrelevant to people of your pain points and your advertising and stuff and people are gonna skim past your stuff simple as that so you need to write in all their pain points now you need to understand what's their desires what do they desire slash want so for me i want results to be improved i want to see really good results i want to be able to scale my campaigns again the i was 14 thing is just holding back maybe it's a limiting belief in my head hey and then also to a desire of you know just being really awesome and showing my clients all these awesome results and stuff so those are some wants and desires right there that we can leverage inside of our advertising so now we know what they're experiencing what they envision as like their goal their goal their want their desire they envision is happy once they get there in their mind and sometimes this can be a little difficult if you if it's a product that they don't know they want yet but you can tie it into things that they already want and then it makes it super easy as well so you got their pain points you got their desires and wants and again these are just columns on notebook google sheet simple as that now the next thing is you need to look at the benefits of your product and this is something right here that again a lot of research of your competitor products benefits of what they've the customer says they've achieved after going through competitor products maybe even prior on your website prior reviews and stuff so say for example i know i thought i thought this was really cool um fitness coach i follow you know he launched a new program and stuff and he marketed a program as the perfect program for those who want to look hot for the beach this summer and he used terminology he used like words people use like i want to look hot for the beach i want to look good for other people stuff like that and that's how he tailored his marketing and his benefits and stuff and he sold out extremely quick for his package because he leveraged the key benefits that the consumer wants and that he knows he can deliver with his program his program could have also been marketed as hey who wants to eat 2 000 calories a day or a thousand calories a day do 30 minutes of cardio every day and 45 minute weight sessions every day and lose fat like what that sounds miserable but instead he flipped it and he focused on the benefits of that people will achieve with this program and he tied into the benefits that people are actively looking for and the wants and the desires that they will get so what are the benefits of your product and then what are the benefits to the consumer focus on the benefits to the consumer not the benefits that you believe focus on the benefits they're looking for and how your product achieves those benefits and or creates those benefits so for example with apple and samsung samsung released the two gigabyte ipod or two gigabyte mp3 player and ipod or apple released a thousand songs in your pocket what are you know the benefits to the consumer with a two gigabytes mp3 player like it's it's easy like i don't like the average person will not know what two gigabytes is they won't know how much storage that is whereas apple thousand songs in your pocket really easy benefit really easy and it benefits the consumer it's not benefiting apple it's benefiting consumer so everything you focus on when writing these down is about the consumer keep them in mind the ad copy and there's too many brands that make the mistake of it's all about them we're offering 50 off our product is the best product our blah blah blah blah no you need to focus the ad copy on you or focus that copy on them it needs to be about the consumer every step of the way are you tired of dealing with ios 14.5 do you stay up all night struggling with it well we have the perfect product for you our product helps you overcome these challenges xyz it delivers these benefits that benefit you xyz etc and that's that's what you really need to focus on so you get your pain points you got your desires and wants and goals and stuff like that like i said that's all one column so pain points one column and pain points can also be problems they're facing roadblocks they're facing uh there's different multitudes of ways you can focus on it then you have pain points and then you have the second column which is goals desires wants if all i can do this to get this you know what's what's what's the what did they vision of success for them then you have the benefits of your product that really benefit the consumer and then you have features features you know it's just your typical stuff what makes your product so great this is just not really thinking this is more straightforward so two gigabytes mp3 player like that's when you can go very blah and there is times where features need to be illustrated so for example i'm a huge car enthusiast i love cars for me i'm always looking at horsepower torque 060 but the average consumer that just needs a good vehicle to drive from point a to point b can care less about that you know the first thing i look for is is that whereas other consumers don't they look for the experience so there is times when you do need to use features and you need to test that with your audience as well and that's why we list them now the last one is reviews what are people saying about your product or some of the questions people have about your product or people what's the feedback good and bad and you want to release all that down so you can analyze it and stuff so create a column for that and then also create another column as well for offer different types of offers you can offer to your audience and actually you can create a another column as well is personas so the different personas of people that you can target so say for example with facebook ads there's a few different personas with facebook ads there's the people just starting out and they need a product that shows them step by step tutorials in the ads manager then you have the people that that's that's you know that's spending some money with facebook ads but just need to clean up their ad account structure and need a little bit more strategy so they need a little bit both of theory type videos like this and strategy videos like this and a little bit more of like hands-on stuff then you have the people that knows everything with the ads manager and needs more ad psychology more creative psychology different ways they can they can improve costs and stuff like that um then you ever did those are higher level masterminds and each persona has different pain points benefits and desires at each each one of those and so you need to write down those personas as well um you can even create a different google sheet for each one of these personas so one google sheet of pain points benefits and desires can be around the persona of people just starting with facebook ads the second one can be for people that are inner you know middle persons and then the third one can be higher level people so those those three different groups of people like facebook ads and stuff now how to actually structure all this so again this is how to write killer e-commerce copy so you have all that put together then your next thing right there is actually how to structure this so the the format we follow is very simple you have pain points benefits reviews and an offer that's literally the body copy and those four blocks and you can interchange those four in multitude different ways so your first block can be pain points benefits reviews offer then your next block can be reviews pain points benefits offer then your third piece of ad copy can be offer reviews pain points benefits so there's those four blocks you can flip them around do different things with it and test different variations of ad copy with those four blocks right there now how to actually structure it well once you get all this listed on paper you can start kind of plugging and playing things together and that's when you have all that research and you take a pen and paper out and write down three to four pages of ad copy create three to four different pages of a whole bunch of different pieces of ad copy and your first two pages throw them away your third and fourth page that's going to be your best pieces of ad copy because you've you've really dug deeper into perfecting this ad copy your first two pages can be kind of like chicken scratch and your third and four pages where you're gonna really see that ad copy really appeal so again that's the easy process of how we do it and how we can generate some really good ad copy that's helped multitude brands and combine over the last 12 months we've generated over four million dollars with facebook ads and stuff and that's like our process for writing ad copy and everything so and like i said it's it's doing a lot of audience research looking at other brands looking what's working for other brands at these different stages and stuff and then holding in those four principles right there those four blocks of pain points desires benefits and an offer a good offer for those people and you know just flipping those around in a multitude of different ways jumbling them up around stuff like that when you create a bunch of pieces of ad copy and then testing those inside the ads manager so that's essentially how we do it and i hope you guys can you know i know this is a lot of just kind of talking and
