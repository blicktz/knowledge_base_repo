You guys have asked for it and you guys have loved it so, so, so much. So guess what, guys? I'm going to turn it into a series.

So every time I do a video where it's like reacting to Facebook ads, reviewing Facebook ads with you guys live on this channel, you guys love it so much. It's so much support and love for it. So guess what?

I'm just going to turn it into a series. So serious name will be officially up here. Drop a comment below if that's what you think it should be called.

And it's just going to be serious now. That's never going to end. So that being said, if you're questioning why am I credible to be, you know, kind of teaching guys about Facebook ads, reviewing Facebook ads and stuff like that, I've done over $50 million in online revenue through Facebook ads for clients.

I run a Facebook ads agency, also coach and mentor students. So you can find out the links below on, you know, whether you want to work with me or you want to be, you know, kind of mentored by me in that case right there. So as we're getting started, hit that like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

That being said, let's dive into the video. So I'm actually going to set a timer just because like, I literally have to go get my dog from daycare and like, they get really mad if I'm late. So I'm going to set a timer for 20 minutes and this is going to be the catch.

We got 20 minutes to review as many Facebook ads as possible. So here's the timer. Timer's up.

And I got a quite a few different ads for you guys to review. Okay. And I'm going to be using Foreplay for this.

Just an absolute amazing tool that we use to share ads between my team. Anytime I do an audit for a potential ad account, I also, you know, pull some ads for them to kind of like recreate in that case right there. So I'm going to provide to you different ads for you guys today.

So let me stop talking. Let's just start diving into it. So let's be the first ad right here.

This is called the venture challenge. Okay. And I try to just pull some random shit.

So I really wouldn't know too much about it. So this is your sign to never stop dating your spouse. Okay.

What is going on here? Okay. Keep the spark alive.

Okay. Taking pictures. So I have a book right there.

Okay. I have no clue what I was just sold on. I'll tell you that right now.

I have no clue what that is. All right. Sign to never stop dating your spouse.

Okay. I saw some type of scratching shit. So I saw some scratching shit.

They went through an adventure in that case. Saying keep the spark alive. And then...

Okay. Dates that involve art or creativity. It looks like they scratched it off.

Then they show the picture they took together. They wrote a little note. Really cute.

Really cool. So I guess basically every page... Um...

Let's see. I'm very curious here. Okay.

So... All right. So interesting.

So you scratch off. Then it gives you a date idea. It's time for you to have the picnic basket you've always dreamed of.

Okay. So some type of like picnic basket. So I guess it's a book.

You scratch off. Gives you a date idea. And you go do the date.

Okay. Cool. I like that.

But... Look how long it took me to figure all that shit out. Okay.

That's just the key thing there. Look how long it took me to figure this shit out. From one ad.

Now. Due to five stages of market awareness. I don't know what stage of market awareness is intended to do.

You know. This is more kind of like a product aware ad. I guess you could say right there.

Where it's just like... Or you know. Even a solution aware ad.

Where it's just kind of like. You know. Reinforcing the fact.

It's only 14 seconds long. And it probably makes about 30 seconds long. It gave me just a little bit more time.

To basically kind of articulate the value. In that case right there. As far as the imagery and the visuals.

I think they did a very good job. I think it's just too fast paced. Okay.

This is where I would maybe extend some of these scenes out. And we add one or two key points. About what this product is.

What it does. And that would have been. You know.

Really cool. Also. I really love this.

I wish I found this book earlier. With the stars. I would just add it.

Maybe just like a little like name below. You know. Sarah S.

And then like. You know. Verified customer.

In that case right there. So. Overall.

Pretty cool ad. Definitely does a really good job with that. But just.

Yeah. Like I said. Just could have been a little bit longer.

Okay. Now. Next one.

Is. Moda Vinci art. All right.

I pulled this ad specifically. Because. I have a lot of people.

Who have wall art. On this particular. That watch this particular YouTube channel.

And. I find that. With wall art.

It does not need to be clever. But. It needs to show off the art.

Like it's doing right here. And then the second thing you'll notice. Is that.

They're not doing this in a little trailer park. For example. They're doing it in.

Looks like Dubai. Honestly. They're doing it in very nice locations.

So. If you have wall art. Show it off in a luxurious way.

Like this. Assuming that's who you want to go after. You know.

If you want to target people. With like a. Kind of like a ranch.

Kind of like the outdoors. Ranch style. Then you want to put a very nice ranch.

In that perspective. Right there. Because then people are associating your product.

With a high quality thing. And when they go to your website. They have a little bit more like.

Hey. Just a high quality product. I'm purchasing.

Okay. That's a little bit more desire for the product. You can see right here.

I did the same thing. With this one. It's showing this girl.

Which looks like in Dubai. The girl's. You know.

Very cute. In that case right there. It's also showing the piece of wall art.

It looks very high quality. In that case. I'm going to have a better brand perception now.

Due to the environment. And the people that are associating themselves. With that particular product.

Okay. Here's another one. This one's actually from.

Iconic right here. So again. I'll pull these specifically for you guys.

Who have wall art. Because I know I have a lot of people with wall art. Watch this YouTube channel.

And like. Questioning the type of ads. To create.

Okay. Here's another one. You can see right here.

It's showing the girl. Pulling it out. The box.

All right. Let's look at a few things first. Let's look at the environment.

You know. This looks like a fairly. Good.

House. Or apartment. Or whatever this is.

Nothing looks like a sliding door right there. Okay. So maybe a condo.

Okay. It doesn't look ragged. It doesn't look run down.

That's very important. When you want to set a specific prestige. For your business.

Okay. You see right here. These are all very nice luxurious places.

That you're putting. Okay. It's nothing ragged.

It's nothing run down. Okay. That's going to impact people's perception.

Of your product. When they see it in an ad right here. Okay.

So. Very good. I like it a lot.

And if you're like. Well Nick. I don't sell.

Well. I don't sell motivational wall art. I sell neon signs.

Or I sell custom metal signs. It's the same shit. Okay.

You're just replacing this particular product. With your product. That's all you're doing right there.

Okay. So. Three different options.

I would. If you're watching this video. I would go recreate all three of these videos.

People pulling out the box like this. Finding someone of attractive nature. Putting him.

Taking nice high quality photos like this. And just simple. Just hanging it up.

And you know. Front of you. And holding it up like that.

So people can see how realistic the product looks. In that case right there. Okay.

If you're just simply running that PNG shit. Just kind of on a fake wall. It looks terrible.

Brings down the value of your brand a lot as well. All right. Next one.

Let's look at this right here. Okay. This is just a DoorDash.

This is people trying to. This is trying to get people. To sign up for DoorDash's platform.

Where you basically become a DoorDash. Okay. This helps me pay for my bills.

Ah. Okay. So it's showing a particular desire right now.

This might be people who just don't have enough cash. At the end of the month. To pay specific bills.

So it's calling out a very realistic kind of problem. They're experiencing right now. You know.

Calling out specific benefit. In that case right there. And then it's also showcasing cash.

All right. People who want cash right now. And seeing this helped me pay my bills.

And seeing the cash in the photo. They're more interested to click. And yeah.

Pretty straightforward ad. Again. I'm only showcasing y'all the creatives.

I'm not even going into the copy or anything like that. But I'm sure it'll be more copy too. That's attached to that.

To you know. Basically go into there as well. Now.

Next one is five reasons why. This is the best side hustle. So again.

This is going into that same thing. DoorDash as well. So five reasons.

This is the best side hustle. So now it's kind of going after people who are actively looking at different side hustles. And we're trying to position ours as the best side hustle.

Okay. You know. So this is a solution aware style ad right here.

And this is assuming people have already looked at other solutions for side hustles. Now we're trying to position ours as the best side hustle for them to look at. All right.

Number one. Make good money dashing. You're showing they're actually showing cash right here.

Me and you both know at the end of the day. You're not going to get that cash like that. You can get that through a direct deposit or something like that.

But it helps increase desire by showing that money which really people want in that case. I choose my own hours. Very strong benefit of a side hustle.

Okay. Work as much or as little as I want. Showcasing her enjoying her life.

Doing both. Takes a few minutes to sign up. Showcasing that sign up process in that sense right there.

Get paid. Simple as that. So this is kind of funny right here.

I get paid right away. And then right here it's showing I make good money. And it's clearly not you know like it's you're not getting cash.

You're getting it directly to your account. But you're still showcasing that cash right there of what people really want in that case right there. So very good at very straightforward.

There's nothing I would change about this at all. I think it's very straightforward. Very well put together with the scenery and everything like that.

And yeah solid ad from even the character choice right here. Depending on where you live. I know I use DoorDash three times a day at least.

And you know typically it's younger people between 20 and 30 years old. I'd probably say more about 20 to 23. That's currently like DoorDashers and stuff like that that come to my door.

So they even chose a pretty good you know character as well as well to portray a DoorDasher in that case right there. So very good with that. All right.

How are we going Tom? We got 10 minutes left. Sweet.

We're doing good. We're doing good. All right.

I got a pretty spicy ad for you guys from Cuts. Okay. So I think it's a pretty fairly good one.

Yeah. Let's let's dive into it. Okay.

First things first. We're showing a guy and a girl and a girl's in a bikini. This ad is selling to guys.

And I mean what guys not going to want to stop on this ad right here in the scroll stopper. Okay. You can see right here for literally just one second.

We're showing a guy walking with a girl who's very attractive in a bikini. All that good stuff. If you're a guy you're likely going to stop and scroll.

Okay. All right. Now I'm showing the guy get out of bed.

Let me just kind of let this play. Okay. Put the shirts on.

Showing off variety. Big key thing right there. Showing off variety.

So it's not just that one shirt. Look good. Feel good.

Showcasing him living his best life with his girl. A lot of good stuff right here. Okay.

A lot of good things. Let's take a look at a deeper look at this. All right.

Obviously scroll stop. Boom. Okay.

Then we have the guy getting out of bed. He's putting on his cuts clothing. Oh get completely different shirt.

Okay. Same cut shirt. Just different color.

Why? If you have a clothing brand with a lot of different colors. We want to showcase as many colors as possible in one ad.

So that way we don't have to showcase a different color for every ad. Okay. Straight to the benefits.

This is a very benefit aware ad which is solution aware ad. Okay. Forfeited apparel.

Okay. Signature preparatory fabric. Okay.

Showcasing kind of like the unique technology we have in ours. Okay. All right.

And then let's take a look at this real quick. Showcasing guy opening a laptop. He's working from home.

Okay. We're kind of going after more of the tech bros in this sense right here. People who run online businesses like me.

People like you who run Shopify stores and your own online businesses. Okay. We're showcasing their core identity.

Okay. We're also showing him chilling with his girl. Okay.

Girl looks good. What type of people who wear cuts. What type of people they track in their life.

That's something we're looking at here. Okay. Again.

We're already swapping through more shirts. He has a black shirt right here. He has a white shirt now.

Another white shirt. Okay. Now it's look good and feel good.

He's relaxing his cuts clothing. He's living his best life. He's also chilling with his girl.

Okay. What type of girl does he have? Looks good.

Why do they showcase all this? Because in people who wear cuts or people who want to wear cuts, when they put that shirt on, we want to articulate the type of life they can live by wearing that clothing, for example. Okay.

So what type of clothing is represented by your stuff? Okay. So if your ads showcase your clothing in very just dingy, like bad areas and stuff like that, it's going to lose its value.

We're showcasing more value by living this. You know, this doesn't seem like a poor lifestyle at all. It seems like a little higher, wealthier lifestyle in that case right there.

Okay. Showcasing that. It's also showing him and his girl, you know, so likely going after more married men.

It's also showing an older guy. Older guys are typically more have a higher chance of being married in that case right there. Okay.

So they're articulating a lot of good things here in this sense. All right. Now we're showing this guy.

Um, I honestly feel like you probably could have just ended it after this right here. And then they just other little mix up right here. That is just, I don't know.

I just feel like this was just thrown in. All right. Let's just throw this in randomly.

Like it just, it feels like a whole different ad limits the time off or get 15% off. Okay. Cool.

Where? All right. Cool.

Solid ad though. I like it a lot. It's using, it's painting the picture of the type of life, their audience, their customers want to live.

And it's also painting the life in terms of, you know, what you can get when you wear cuts. Okay. Even though if your stuff like, like, you know, that's part of the identity in that case right there.

All right. Now here we got another one and we got five minutes left. So let's go in and dig into this one.

I thought my girlfriend was obsessed with my smell. Boom. Until she told me your old deodorant smells like butt crack.

Okay. So from unaware to prom aware. Boom.

Ah. So making people problem aware that their deodorant sucks. Now we're making people solution aware of the type of deodorant they need.

So I want the best for my pits. That's when I saw Dr. Squatch.

Okay. Cool. So now they're product aware.

Okay. Cool. So when from unaware, unaware, how do we make them unaware?

We talk about their girl. Why? Because if it's a guy, they'll likely care about their girl or girls care about in terms of, um, you know, their, their, you know, basically like their personality, their identity in that case.

Cool. I like it. I dig it.

I'm just gonna kind of skip forward because we only have a couple minutes left and I do want to showcase, um, more ads here. So here's an ad right here for a golf something first things first. Why do they showcase the golfer swinging?

Because if you studied anything golf and watch a lot of golf content, anytime someone swings a golf club, like people are always like watching and judging their shit. Okay. Um, this one right here.

Okay. So we're showcasing golf. Then we're showcasing, you know, the product.

So it's kind of just more of a solution aware ad. Boom. Showing off the, you know, the unique mechanism and benefits of it.

Cool. Yeah. Just very straightforward.

Nothing crazy. Honestly, I just thought it was very sharp, straight to the point. It articulated how the product works and articulate the benefits of it in very clear and easy way.

And, um, I digged it. Very good at, very good at, very simple as well. All right.

You can actually break this down actually a little bit more since we have enough time. All right. My boyfriend calls this his get lucky Dio.

Ooh, unaware ad. Well, no, I would say it's benefit driven ad. Yeah.

I would say it's, I would say it's a benefit driven ad. So solution aware ad just going straight for the solution. Okay.

Okay. So. Okay.

A lot of stuff going on and I can't wait to break this down. Okay. So first things first benefits.

I would say there's some benefits to this. Okay. All right.

This hook also girls smelling and reacting to it. Why is the girl smelling and reacting to it? Because we're going after guys.

All right. And we're trying to showcase that girls love this. So my boyfriend's kind of smelling kind of off lately.

So I took a pull myself and this is the one I chose. So basically how a girl found a deodorant for, you know, his, her boyfriend and something here you can see is the terminology she says, as soon as he puts it on, I couldn't get my hands cooking my hands right off of him. He smells so good.

It's basically saying she couldn't keep her hands to herself once, you know, she uses particular, he uses particular deodorant. Okay. Why is that important right there?

Because just think about it from a guy's perspective. All right. He puts this new deodorant on and all of a sudden his girlfriend just cannot get her hands off of him.

Like he's, she's like, what's the benefit of him smelling good? Then that's the benefit. Okay.

So the benefit of the benefits, how they came to that. If you're trying to figure out how they got that. Okay.

Cool. Going into some of the other benefits of it, just to kind of keep it, you know, realistically what's the different benefits of it. And also kind of went through some of the unique mechanism of it.

So solid up. I liked it. Dr.

Squatch does a lot of these ads where it showcase like girls reacting to things that guys wear, which is, that's how they're pushing all their products. All right. And finally, the last ad for today, we have about two minutes left so we can review this.

Another cuts ad. Is it kind of? Yeah.

I think it's cuts. And it's showcasing right now the, basically the polo for every occasion. And what's cool about this is that it's showing that how this.

Oh, okay. So it's showing three different polos. I first thought it was showing one polo for all three of these things.

Okay. So it's basically just showcasing their collection of different polos. Very solution aware style ad.

Just make people aware of, hey, you can wear this for, you know, work. Wear this for course or prestige. Okay.

I don't really say this is a bad ad, but it's very visual. But there's really no benefits here. Besides they have shown that they have multiple different shirts.

Really no benefits here though. So I feel like they probably lacked on the benefits side for this particular ad. But I do really love this in terms of how they articulate it, having a different product for each one.

So very good job on cuts for that right there as well. So. But cool guys.

That's pretty much it. And we're right under 20 seconds. So thank y'all so much for watching.
