I spent over a million dollars a month on Facebook ads for my clients and this is exactly how we scale Facebook ads exactly how we either increase or decrease that budget based off performance inside of Meta so just want to show you I'll take a look real quick this is an account that so over the last seven days about 148 thousand dollars in sales 46k in profit it's also leveraging triple well right here and then we spent about forty thousand dollars on Meta about ninety six hundred dollars on Google now to be fair we don't touch Google and we don't touch tick tock they have other agencies that are this particular client that's running those things now let's kind of go over this account what are we looking at to scale so number one thing for scaling Facebook ads you need a north star a north star is your live or die by this is not something that's like you know something we're talking about before my mentors the other day there's a preference which is something that you kind of wishy-washy on and then you have boundaries like a boundary something that you will not cross at all like look just use an extreme scenario here like murder for example like no one's doing that you know at least at least I know that's a clear boundary for whereas a preference might be like some days I like coffee some days like Red Bull do I do a Red Bull every day no I do coffee every day no but there's some days I'm wishy-washy in those days so you have a boundary first you need a set of what NCPA you want to scale at NCPA is the cost to acquire a new customer now I only focus on NCPA when I'm scaling because I want to leverage Facebook ads to acquire new customers for my brand I don't want to use Facebook ads to get existing customers to purchase existing customers to purchase that's where my email and SMS is for but I only want to focus on new customers because the more new customers I acquire the bigger the business can scale and the bigger the business can grow you know like for example like my inner circle when I spend money on Facebook ads to acquire students from my inner circle my inner circle is a thousand dollars a month and you know I'd say we probably only acquire anywhere between 10 to 12 new students a month but we have like 50 60 other students a month that are just on that auto draft and stuff like that when I see in stripe oh we did five thousand dollars in sales today I need to bump up my budget for Facebook ads but then I look it's five students that just got auto drafted that day for their membership Facebook had no contribution to that so you only want to focus on new customers because new customers it's what Facebook's bringing to the table whereas existing customers they're going to purchase either way so I just want to be very clear on that first you need your narf star so first I set my narf star this particular account I think it's a $22 in CPA we're scaling at I'm currently not running ads for this account that's actually one of my team members that's running ads for this particular account but I think it's $22 that we're actually uh we're focusing on right now it's either 20 or $22 so we'll use $22 as an example for this particular video here so as long as this is at $22 exactly or below we can spend more money on Facebook ads as far as us like actually spending more money on Facebook ads it's very very simple it's us just coming in this account you can just select it like this edit campaign budget and you can either do increase daily budget by 20% if we're hitting our targets or it's decreased daily budget if we're not hitting our targets and then we just decrease it by 20% so we're only going 20% up or 20% down no problem at all with using surfing no problem at all with all these other ways this is just the way I've had the most consistent success with I've been doing this for three years now this way and all the other ways we're just like short-term things that just never lasted from a consistent standpoint so we only use 20% up or 20% down the only time I'll surf and if you don't know what surfing is it's where like I'm doubling budget two or three times a day the only times I surf is like during Black Friday where we only have a short period of time to spend a lot of money or like maybe for example there's a particular thing going on like an event that we're doing and we only have like two or three days to spend a lot of money that's the time I'll surf but 99% of the time of the year I'm just 20% up or 20% down now all I simply do is just come in triple L and look at yesterday and um okay cool my NCPA target is 21 or 22 dollars let's give it a second to load we're at a 21 dollar NCPA yesterday I'll go in and increase budget by 20 percent now this is where there's also some other factors so I generally only do one campaign per account but this particular client is in a couple different countries so I have one campaign per country this one's just slightly different we only have two campaign we only have two countries in this one because it's US and Canada and same thing here for Australia New Zealand so because there's multiple campaigns we also have to kind of know from a little bit we have to know a little bit more now this is where attribution tools come really in play so if I click on meta I can actually look at yesterday and in an inside of yesterday I can more specifically see the level of which each of these campaigns performed and again I'm still looking at NCPA now I don't hold I like to look at overall NCPA for a reason overall is like the true 100% accurate where like even these attribution tools are still not fully accurate to the point where I can fully trust them so I just want to kind of collectively see here okay hey this one $34 NCPA it was also the highest spending campaign this one had a 37 which is like way higher than my highest spending campaign oh actually to be fair no that's not the highest spending highest spending one's $32 right here this one actually spent the same amount but at a significantly higher NCPA and this one also had a higher NCPA but it had way lower spend I'm only gonna bump budget by 20% on the US and Canada campaign the euro and Australian campaign honestly I'm just gonna leave I'm not gonna touch because the performance is still not like technically hot relative again keyword here relative to my other campaign so I'll just come in here US and Canada bump by 20% and that's it and I'm done for today that's it it's all I'm gonna do very very simple and quick now what about decreasing budget so the big thing with decreasing budget is I'll do last 24 hours to increase budget but for decreasing budget I typically allow three to four days at a much higher NCPA before I go ahead and fix that let me just go back so let's just say if I can find real quick a day where we had a much higher NCPA so December 10th for example December 10th we had a $23 NCPA so December 11th which was yesterday I wouldn't go ahead and just decrease now because we had a $23 NCPA that day I'll typically allow three to four days at a high NCPA before I start decreasing spin why because I've just found out that I'm not not not just found out but like I've just found over time that when we if we have a day of hitting a bad performance just don't touch anything literally do not fucking touch anything for a couple days two or three days it'll just autocorrect itself so when you actually go and start touching and doing all these things in the account it'll actually make performance worse and then you start like trying to catch a falling knife you do all these actions and it's just destroying everything so for me I'll just go ahead and literally just give it three or four days don't touch anything and it'll just autocorrect itself and I found that's just a much better route and I've had significantly higher success with that now from a client perspective it can kind of look bad because I'm just not doing anything and not being proactive but honestly it just had such a higher success rate that I'm just 100% confident in that particular action right there now that's it that's all I do so you hit your in CPA you scale up by 20% or you give it a few days and you scale down and then same thing if I have to scale down because it's not doing performance it's not performing hot then I'll just give it a few days and then that's it now another thing I want to talk about here is I want to talk about a hard deck so let's actually go to another account so this is actually another client account right here and this account fresh launch fresh from scratch we didn't do anything else so there's only one campaign so far in this account and we set a hard deck of like $75 a day on Facebook meaning that we're gonna spend that $75 regardless if we have god-awful performance or not and all of August we had $100 cost per purchase our target cost per purchase was $30 yes we're losing like $70 every single day that or like $40 every day that we run this but again that's our hard deck a hard deck is something you set that you do not scale below regardless of performance so at every different level we'll have a different hard deck we have a client right now at a $500 a day hard deck they need a $30 cost per purchase to scale and they're currently at I think a $33 or $34 cost per purchase but they also have cash in the bank they have reserves all that good stuff this is a brand new account meaning they were zero spin prior to us coming on board and just to show you that like here's like the first of August like zero money was spent this account now what we did was is all we did was just literally kept working the system so if you look at all the way from September 1st through the 19th you know it from $100 cost per purchase and all we do is just keep testing new ads and trying to find a new winning ad for this account and I have videos on the channel on how to test like new Facebook ad creatives so how to test Facebook ads in 2025 is my most updated guide currently right now on this and I'll show you how to test ads creatives like good stuff now watch what happens on the 20th through the rest of the month we hit a $31 cost per purchase why because we found a creative that took overall spend and what we do is we just do one like flexible ad per again how to test Facebook ads 2025 that video will show you all this so I kept spending and I kept focusing on prioritizing and finding those new creatives to where I could then start spending more and then we look at October we really start to scale in October and we spent $19,000 on a $33 cost per purchase but if we go back to August we literally spent $19,000 we spent 10 times more in October because we kept spending every day we kept our hard deck we finally found a creative that allows to hit our $30 cost per purchase and then we just started scaling 20 20 20 20 so that's what happens so you set that hard deck you never scale below you focus on finals winning creative so if you don't if you're not hitting that in CPA of which you're trying to hit right now then just keep testing don't scale below your hard deck and then from there you'll find your new winning creatives and you can scale back up and then like there's other things you can focus on in terms of like creatives you can also look at landing pages offer testing and stuff like that those are some high level things you can do and there'll be other videos for that but for the most part 90 of people just focus on better creatives and that will impact everything again how to test Facebook ads in 2025 that'll go over step by step of how to do all that from a high level perspective from we're doing a public structure it all that good
