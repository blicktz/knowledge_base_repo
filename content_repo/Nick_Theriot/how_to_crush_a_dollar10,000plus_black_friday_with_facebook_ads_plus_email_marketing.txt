yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriault here and today I have exciting new video for you guys on how to absolutely crush and dominate your Black Friday for a little bit of email marketing Facebook ads and overall strategic kind of implementation so let's hop into it all right guys so the strategy we like to use it it works really good we'll see anywhere from a 5 to 10x return on investment for our clients but there's a lot of key components inside Black Friday that we need to understand because if you don't do any one of these properly you will see loss on profits we need to stop talking about just Black Friday because it's actually a few days it's Black Friday through Cyber Monday so we run that it's Black Friday this Saturday to Sunday and and Cyber Monday and we'll push the same offer throughout the whole weekend you've seen that running that sell longer people are still likely to take action because that whole like weekend is like Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend and people are more inclined to purchase that whole period of time whereas if we just run ads for 24 hours on Black Friday we just we miss out on a ton of money so we highly recommend running ads starting Black Friday morning all the way up into Cyber Monday night the next thing is understanding you have a great offer so you need to work on what to offer for Black Friday through Cyber Monday a lot of brands will offer something weak and will see a poor like return on their investment for like Black Friday through Cyber Monday so you need to make sure you craft something that people really want and what I mean by this is you want to go ahead and let's say for example you've been offering 10 to 20% off discount codes all year and you've seen some amazing like sales with those you want to do something that you haven't done already but you know also works so if you've been offering 10 to 20% off the whole year for multiple different sales then what you want to do is you want to offer a 30% off site-wide and again if whatever works has been working for your brand do that but just intensifies it because if you don't want to try something completely new that you don't know if it works for your brand and then you'll see again a poor return on sales because it's like oh it doesn't work well with your brand so it's not a time for testing something completely new but also doubling down on what works and maybe just intensifying whatever works and bringing it to that next level now another thing about offers is you do not want to do discount codes you do not want to do anything complicated the best one to do is a site-wide automatically apply percentage off that's it that's hands down the best one it's easy to communicate to the consumer because they'll see like the regular price and slashed with like you know another price it's just it's super easy for this consumer to take action on whereas if you run a discount code it's really hard for people to remember those discount codes especially if they're getting hammered by multiple different brands it's just it makes the checkout fast process faster there's no confusion etc site-wide percentage off is the best thing to run for pretty much 99 of the e-commerce brands that's watching this video now that you have your offer you have kind of like the the game plan of how long you'll run the sale the next thing is okay how do we build up the hype for black friday so what you want to do is you want to look at black friday through cyber monday weekend as a party and imagine it being like a coachella just huge huge festival that tons and tons of people want to come to uh you need to actually build a pipe for that specific music festival and you're not just going to like on a thursday say hey tomorrow's coachella you know you're going to build a pipe months before same thing with black friday um you want to start literally after you watch this video you can start applying the strategy and building up the hype for black friday and what you want to do is you want to start building up a list so that's the first thing so you're going to build a list you create a landing page and either click funnels or lead pages whatever and on that landing page you literally just want to say opt into vip lists um and then you want to have some type of reason why they need to opt in so you have exclusive list of people that you can opt into to be for black friday uh you could run something super simple as like up to 30 percent in savings site wide uh be the first to hear about our amazing deals on black friday you know be the first to access our exclusive black friday deals up to 30 percent off for our vip list so that way you're giving reasons why people need to opt in on that list and then what you want to do is you want to sync that list to your uh ecrm your email marketing software uh create another list inside there call it black friday vip list you know 2020 have all those leads be sent over to that list and then what you want to do is you want to start that list building um you use like facebook ads uh promote that that page that lead page with facebook ads organic posts and your emails that you're already sitting on now and you want to capture leads and get a ton of people sent over to that list now again you want to go after your warm audiences your previous purchases people that's already aware of your brand that's already on your email marketing list so that way you're you're moving all those people that are more likely to take action on black friday from those other lists to a very very very warm list that tons of people are coming to from your brand um that's opting on that list specifically for just black friday for the facebook ad side um i recommend starting anywhere from 10 to a thousand dollars a day um you know ten dollars a day to a thousand dollars a day building up that list uh work with a variety of different budgets you know so we we work with different levels in terms of that of like how much should we spend on that lead generation uh campaign and again we target all of our warm audiences our 180 day um website visitors 180 day previous purchases our 365 instagram engagement 365 facebook engagement we target our warm audiences we don't really go after cold audiences i will test it but if we're not getting a good cost per lead we turn it off immediately but we're shooting from anywhere from a 50 cent to a dollar cost per lead and the things that are going to affect that is the creatives you're using the offer you're offering and and your ad copy as well of how you're promoting this those are three different variations that's going to affect our cost per lead we'll test ad copy create a first before we switch our new offer for black friday and then what you want to do is you start generating these leads as soon as you watch this video as soon as you watch this video go set this up and you want to start capturing those leads immediately as the more time and more leads you capture uh the better black friday you'll have so this is your way of inviting people to the party but now once you actually invite people to the party you want to make sure you kind of feed out some content to that list um that email list throughout you know from now to black friday to hype people up for black friday so think about if you're throwing the biggest party you're released videos and stuff of people you know the djs the food entertainment that's going to be allowed to line up the same thing for black friday you want to start pushing out some information about some of the sales that'll be happening some of the new products that'll be returning some of the specials you'll have that they can't miss uh talk about all the products that'll be out for you know for sale for black friday specifically for black friday exclusive deals all that stuff hype people up throughout this period of time uh send out an email set list and get people ready for black friday now on probably the monday or tuesday before black friday you want to make sure you have all of your creatives ready for black friday you will actually need probably the week before is get all that ready and then monday tuesday you want to make sure you have it scheduled inside the ads manager yes ads for black friday scheduled inside the ads manager on that monday latest tuesday before black friday reason why is we have tons of ads manager issues from like the tuesday night all the way up to black friday and if you don't have your ad scheduled prior you're going to miss out on black friday because then you'll you might run some ad review issues stuff like that uh the type of ads you want to create for black friday is you want to do about a 50 50 split between your warm audiences and cold audiences usually on black friday day it's be more of like a 90 to 10 90 to warm and then 10 to cold and then you're going to flip that as the weekend goes by and the monday goes by first of all run out of your warm audiences and secondly you want to start targeting people that are just in the buying mood in general so the audiences will target for black friday starting off with warm audiences is your 365 instagram engagement 365 facebook engagement 180 day website visitors and 180 day purchases we'll also create another audience of everyone that's opted into that email list so that way you're targeting people with emails and you're also targeting people with ads on that specific list to maximize getting in front of them and like i said we'll spend about 90 of that budget on black friday itself um you know specifically going through those warm audiences letting people know about the sell and everything and then we'll transition throughout the weekend to about a 50 50 split of warm audiences and cold audiences letting people know about black friday deals going on now in terms of the creatives you want to use simple creatives that's easy to see easy to understand um and immediately communicates to people that hey it's black friday our black friday sells live come click and come to the website because all we're doing is getting people to the website at this point we're not really trying to go and sell people on the brand as they're already aware of the brand they're already aware because they're warm audiences we're just simply capturing people's attention and getting them onto the website um again simple and compelling creative so go look at some of the best creatives you used in the past and maybe just do black friday variations of those maybe create a few flat 2d images that just say black friday sells live um just get creative with it look at some prior rands of they ran for black friday um go after these type of creatives right here and again simple easily communicates to the buyer that hey our black friday sell is live so if you do all of this properly you get the proper offer you build up the hype build up your email list and everything uh you'll have a really really really good black friday through cyber monday weekend and it's very powerful again a few of the brands we've worked with um we've probably spent about thousand dollars a day black friday saturday sunday monday so it's been probably four thousand dollars um and we made them back around anywhere from you know 28 to 30 thousand dollars in revenue during that period of time now obviously my e-com agency has grown a lot since then as back then we're probably dealing with clients so anywhere from 10 to 30 thousand dollars a month in revenue uh this year i'm working with multiple six figure among clients so this year it's going to be a completely different game level and i should have some amazing case studies for you guys to show y'all um how the strategy works but we've used the same strategy last year we're using the same strategy again this year just a little bit more polished and i already kind of talked to you guys about a few of those key points um in this video so that being said guys i hope y'all enjoyed this video i hope you guys crush black friday and squeeze as much profit as you can and you're absolutely going to dominate again there's a lot of different factors here so your offer uh your ad creatives and stuff so you got to make sure you nail all of them down
