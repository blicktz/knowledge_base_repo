yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have a new video for you guys we're gonna discuss the single most important thing that I'm currently doing to prepare for iOS 14. this won't be maybe the things you're thinking of and it's gonna be the one of the biggest differences you can do in your advertising campaigns in preparation for iOS 14. so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button below and if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one okay guys so iOS 14 is still something that I've touched already on this channel for a little bit and haven't really made a video on it and honestly it's still something in this industry right now as we know it that is you know we don't really know much about it there's a lot of different skepticism about these different things that's going to come up due to it but not experiencing it's hard to predict completely of exactly how it's going to affect us you know how many people will opt out of us tracking them versus not that's a big thing right there I look at it as GDPR where it wasn't that many people compared to what you know everyone was thinking of so what can you do to prepare obviously you can you know verify your domain you know you can go ahead and set up your server-side pixel tracking you can experiment with some software like high rows where they do some really really advanced tracking that they claim can actually go ahead and like get past it but out of all that what else can you do you know there's the other tactic where you can just literally look at your total Shopify revenue and you can look at your total ad spend for the day and see which days you're profitable versus unprofitable but it still kind of throws out some issues and stuff with you know like terms of tracking wise you know you don't want to spend a ton Facebook ads right now when you're getting a ton of organic sales without even having to spend money on ad spend so what is the king of all something that won't completely fix it but something is going to make your brand stand out it's still going to make your Facebook ads perform really well it's something you should already be doing right now and it's something that I know a lot of you guys aren't doing properly and that is creatives you know your ads itself creatives that is going to be the biggest thing when it comes down to this iOS 14 it's something that my team and my agency is doubling down on when it comes down to iOS 14 and here is why for number one is the you know the video view so with Facebook you can go ahead and track video views by percentages whether that's you know 25 percent 50 75 95 plus you know in percentages so that's number one because what we do is we can keep people on the platform so that way for example we're running a top of funnel video ad and we go ahead and you know we push people through it we can retarget people who watch percentages of the video and someone who's likely to watch 95 percent of a video is more inclined to take an action with this later on versus say 25 percent so it's keeping people on the platform and we can also build video sequences in which you know you go ahead you have video one video one and then we push video two out then video three by going ahead and targeting say you know for video two we're targeting video one 50 for example so everyone who's watched 50 or more of that video one we're targeting a video two then everyone who's watched 50 or more of video two we're targeting with video number three so these two videos right here video two video three will be retargeting ads and they're already be targeting each other and then the next thing is the psychology of which you know the content you put in those video so we want to pre-frame people in order to you know better understand your product your service in v1 v2 we're gonna you handle objections and stuff our video two actually will do something more along lines of different reasons why you need our product so video one it's pre-framing people with the product and stuff you know we're introducing to them video two we're starting to really hit on those desires they may have to get them more engaged with the product and in video number three we're going ahead and we're really leveraging objection handling so where we're gonna dig deeper into what's preventing these people from purchasing right now in the market so we're gonna hit those objections and stuff so that way we have this retargeting sequence of videos and we're gonna run conversion purchases and all that stuff you know we're still gonna run that we're not gonna run video views because we don't want trash traffic we're still gonna be pushing this but we're gonna really double down on you know those those creative sequences right there and then we're gonna double down on the whole production of creatives so one of the biggest things with creatives and a lot of the ad accounts audit on a day-to-day basis is the creatives are not that good and I'll be honest with you you know we need to really double down on the creative production so for example I'm just working with an ad account today and a lot of the creatives in that account are good but the product is really hard to see so you know that's like if I put my sharpie right here in this video and you know you're scrolling through YouTube and you expect to get the sharpie to poke out of you while you're looking at the thumbnails or as I put all the way up to the camera you know it's right there in your face it's easier to see it grabs your attention a little bit more so if I'm selling a sharpie but I want the product right here or right here so first thing is just having the product more visible in the creative itself second thing is more eye-catching and appealing creatives so you know another thing I did with this particular ad account today is go ahead and dig deeper into how can we really make these creatives pop so a lot of the creatives in there were dark colors and this is a fun product it's a fun uplifting product and a lot of the creatives in that account were dark gloomy you know they had a few that were sunny but it wasn't really that poppy so how can we make the creatives pop more and the way I did that was just add some colorful backgrounds behind it now again this won't be for every product in terms of your creatives you know in terms of your product nature your product and stuff if you're going for a dark gloomy gym vibe for your particular product then that won't really work so for this particular product yes it's fun a beat and everything what we did is we leveraged you know some really good poppy creatives and stuff in the background which worked really well for us so double down the creative production really focusing on your consumer psychology you know how can we approach the sale in different angles of which so let me show you that real quick let's just say you know you have your product let's just say energy drink energy drink so what type of creatives can we create around this a lot of people would probably you know especially the people at our audits they're at account and stuff not trying to call everyone out but they're adding would probably be just you know it gives you more energy so that's probably what a lot of people are gonna do gives you more energy here's an energy drink gives you more energy but with creative production to really take to the next step next level is to really first identify your core audiences so for an energy drink we can market this to gamers we can market this to people going and work out to the gym we can market this to you know entrepreneurs who want to perform better and we can create creatives around that specific niche calling out those pain points or really promoting out those specific benefits so for example here's an energy drink we can do an ad angle for gamers we can do an ad angle for entrepreneurs and then we can do gym people and then we can even go further into this so this is where you're really getting really really dig deeper into the creatives creates the audience so a lot of people you go on facebook you know you do your targeting and stuff and then you launch your creatives whereas with the creative creates the audience we're building the creative that's going to attract our ideal audience so we can go a lot more broader targeting and that's how facebook's really pushing more and more too so with the gamers you know we can do gaming in the ad we can do you know maybe some top celebrities top influencers in the gaming industry influencers we can show a gamer tired low performing score hating his day all that stuff and then how can we channel that to our product which is going to give us more energy so that is the key with you know the creative creates the audience versus the audience creating the creative i know that that doesn't really properly make sense so going back to the top what's really going to separate your business and what's really going to help your business in ios 14 is something you should already be doing right now and that's doubling down on creative production and doubling down on you know like i said before in a video or two ago is grabbing that attention creating desire and a reason to take action now doubling down on these key concepts with paid advertising is going to allow you to better perform in ios 14 it won't be as simple anymore it's just simply taking a product energy drink gives you more energy blasting it out and facebook's going to find you know the quick little low-hanging fruit that's going to give you those sales and stuff now you have to go deeper into consumer research you have to go deeper into identifying customer personas going deeper into what they really want some of the people they look up to and stuff how can we leverage that really dig deeper into actually creating content photos and videos with your product that really acknowledges all of this and you know really grabs their attention you know really hitting on their desires they want and a reason to actually take action now so why do they purchase now versus why you know let me just wait a month so that's all key things you have to do with ios 14 because again something you should already be doing now it's what allows us to do some crazy numbers inside of our agency but a lot of people are not focusing on this right now so when i was 14 it is really going to suffer their results i was 14 for me me personally i'm looking at it as a benefit forest because it's going to raise the barrier of entry for facebook ads whereas before you could simply just be any joe blow put a credit card on facebook and start pushing advertising where now it's going to raise up the barrier for entry which will allow people who are a little bit more experienced in the marketing industry to perform better lower cpms because there's less advertisers in the network and it's going to be fun i'm going to enjoy it it's definitely not going to be as good in the past but having adaptability is key to looking at the market looking where it's at right now how can we adapt to it in terms of what do we need to do to better perform versus just sitting there and post it on facebook i wish facebook was you know like this again back in you know 2014 whatever whenever you got into it now if you're a paid advertiser and you're spending over a thousand
