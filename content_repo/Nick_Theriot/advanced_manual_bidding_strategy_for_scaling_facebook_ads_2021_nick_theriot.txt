yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i'll be going over bid cap and it's something that i've been getting a lot of requests for so let's thank prodspec rs for recommending this video and a lot of other people that's pretty asked questions and stuff regarding bid cap strategy and stuff on this channel so today i'll be going over my specific strategy on how to do bid cap and my technique of it i don't really do it often so it's actually surprised a lot of you guys but when i need to scale aggressively and really quick and have to spin due to budget and stuff company wants to spin a lot and have to do it really quickly this is the route i'm going to take before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday just like this one so let's get started okay so if you need to spend some money very quickly very fast so this is only when you need to if you don't need to and you're not just letting your emotions get to you because there's a lot of people that get two or three purchases on one campaign at ten dollars a day and when they do that what will happen is they're like let's scale and they'll drop a ton of budget into it and they're going to blow a lot of money and not see the results and that's our whole nother video of why that happens now for the people that have huge budgets that have to spend it and let's say you're working with a client wants to spend 80k a month 100k a month and you have 20 extra thousand dollars to spend for this month and you have to spend it yes there are some clients that you work with that that have a budget they have to spend every month so when you need to spend money quickly or to test something very quickly very effectively this is where bid cap comes in play to where you can bid against the auction and also to it helps some people stabilize an ad account when they have um you know when they're using manual or auto bids it kind of throws away our eyes up and down a lot but with manual bids you can kind of stabilize the ad account by hey if it's not hitting this level or we can't hit enter a bid at a hundred dollars per bid then we're just not gonna enter it at all we're gonna spend a little less that day on days we can we're gonna spend more so with that being said let's jump into that account and i'm gonna show you exactly how we set up a bid cap campaign at least for how we do it and as a whole so when you get inside your ad account and stuff right here we have this particular ad to our campaign itself that we want to branch out and build up on so we have this one particular ad set right here that is doing substantially better than all the other ones at 3.33 ROAS my break even is 2x so we're hitting our ideal kpis but how can we further expand on it how can we increase you know the testing of it or how can we further scale it and we need to spend money quick on this particular product so what we can do literally right here we're gonna select our ad set and i'm gonna literally hit duplicate and i'm going to a new campaign because again this is our testing abo campaign right here so i know specifically this ad set works and it's just a single ad set so you need to make sure one you have a right audience that you can work with so we have a winning audience it's an abo i'm literally just going to name this ts so terror solutions because i add my abbreviations to everything i'll give it a random three letter just convention so that way when i'm recognizing particular campaigns and stuff like that what will happen is you know if i say hey on the top funnel campaign that's at one where it's not gonna say tfd one and that that would be no it's part of campaign tfd and that's at number one or tfd 55 and that's campaign tfd that's at 55 so i give a random three letters for every single campaign and then it's a tofu scaling and one to two percent purchases and it'll be website conversions cbo so we're gonna make this a cbo and we hit duplicate now once you get inside of here is where it gets fun so we're gonna go back up here and we're gonna do campaign budget optimization now we're going to put a very big budget on this very very very very big trust me we're gonna do 10 ad sets so first off you need to know your average cost per purchase so our average cost per purchase is 20 for this account 20 bucks so we're gonna do that times 10 that's 200 and we're gonna do that times 10 that's two thousand dollars so let me explain we're gonna have 10 ad sets in this particular campaign at 200 a day but because we're using cbo what we want to do is is we want to put a total of all the ad sets been the cbo level instead of the ad set level that's what we're gonna do with two thousand dollar a day budget and then now we're gonna use right here to campaign budget strategy we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna select bid cap so that way we can control our bid in each auction now one is that all done we're gonna go to our ad sex now we need to set our bid cap specifically for this we're gonna go right down right here bid control so it already set a pre-determined one i'm still put that one dollar for right now and i'm hit publish so we're literally bidding a dollar to enter an auction with a two thousand dollar cbo budget behind it so let's hit publish now the reason why i want to use cbo specifically instead of abo because i could do 10 ad sets at 200 a day abo that's how i used to do it but the problem with that it becomes harder to not necessarily scale but it becomes harder to scale with you know 10 ads at the 200 a day whereas cbo is just working better when i increase budget at the cbo level versus the abo level so let's go inside here now now we're gonna do some more stuff to this so i'm just gonna leave that like that for right now what i want to do is go right here i'm just gonna put one dollar bc for a bit cap publish again just update the naming of it now i want to duplicate this and we want to keep it in here and we're going to duplicate this nine times so we're gonna create nine copies of this specific ad set and to be inside of our original campaign which is exactly what we want and then i'm just gonna publish so what we're doing right here is we're creating 10 ad sets inside of a two thousand dollar cbo average cost per purchase is twenty dollars in fact actually i think it's a little bit more for this account but just for example do your average cost per purchase at tofu uh your top of funnel cold audience and you're gonna wreck you you want to do each ad set at 10 times your average cost per purchase and that's good if you're doing abo that's what you're gonna do but for this example i like to use cbo so then i need to do a cbo with the cumulative total of all of these budgets so if i have 10 ads that's in there at 200 a day becomes two thousand dollars per day so again this is not this is for people who want to spend remember this is not for people who i'm spending 10 bucks a day and i want to scale up to 100 bucks a day this is for people who want to spend they're spending 500 to a thousand dollars a day and want to spend two thousand three thousand four thousand dollars a day in the next few days okay so now you have all these 10 ads that's live and stuff we're going to do is go right here to edit we're going to go to name and what we're going to do right here is change the bid cap for all of these so we're going to enter the auction in at 1x what you're going to do is your first one you're going to enter in your your auction at 1x your average cost per purchase the second one you're going to do 2x your average cost per purchase then the third one's going to be 3x so on so let me just go ahead and fix this up so again this will be 60 this will be 3x this will be 4x this will be 5x 6x 7x again 7x time purchase 8 9 to publish so all i did was change the names and you're going to see all i did was change names and you're going to see exactly why i did that right now so we obviously didn't change the bid cap but we just need to keep those naming conventions in the proper order so that way we kind of know exactly where we're going but now we need to go to formats right here so now that we're under performance right here we can actually go ahead and change up our bid cap right here so you can see right here now it becomes super simple just to go in right here and type in 20 bucks and just go through all of them may take some time that's okay but again that's what you got to do to make sure we can go through it properly so we'll do 190 then 140 dollars so basically what we're doing right here is we're entering in the auction for those who don't understand what bid cap is right now with facebook when you just do a normal campaign without bid cap is what you're doing is you're entering the competition in at auto so facebook will bid whatever so some competitions it might bid really high some competitions might be bid really low some might bid right in the middle but with bid cap you're entering the competition in at a set price so you would think at entering the competition at 200 you're just gonna blow budget and you're gonna waste your money but in fact quite the opposite can happen what happens is when you're winning the auction at 200 you're gonna probably be top tier because as that timeline you know the first ad you see when you open up your phone that one is the highest bid at auction place now the next one is the second one the second ad you see on the timeline then the third and the fourth and as that timeline goes lower as someone's on their phone scrolling through facebook the competition gets less and less so in auto your ads can be showed up a lot in the bottom of the feed and what's gonna happen is is a lot of people swipe over them and you'll get a lower quality traffic where if you can hit them with a really high bid cap in hitting those top auctions what's gonna happen is the actual opposite you'll reach less people because you have such a big budget uh you're you're bidding so much on one impression but what happens is you reach a very higher quality audience and you get a lot more sales through it if especially if you have a very strong audience offer all that good stuff that's working really well and allows you to scale very quickly and you hit a whole new pocket of people essentially so now you're probably wondering nick we have a big campaign spent we got all these bids and stuff that's it look if you would go to run this right now you'd blow two thousand dollars in a day and you'd probably be very upset we need to be able to manage this and we don't want to look like you know the typical stock people on like wolf of wall street and stuff and like you know sitting here all day staring at this and turning stuff off we need to have some rules in place to better manage this or you might not be a happy camper at the end of the day especially if you blow a big budget very quickly like this so what you want to do is you want to select your assets and stuff then go to create a new rule and if you use reveal bot or any other outside rule management stuff with facebook you're more than welcome to use that but i'm just use the facebook inside one i normally use reveal bot but i want to use the facebook ads one just because of making it simplistic and for everyone to be able to value this now the first one is we need to put a rule in place to cut off ad sets if they spend too much especially very quickly so the first one i like to do is take your average cost per add to cart at tofu so let's just say for example it's ten dollars if we spend more than 30 bucks triple your average cost per add to cart with zero add to carts um and zero purchases we want to turn it off so here we go we're gonna go right here um this will be our safeguard call this whatever you want ten rule set turn off ad sets cost per result we want to do spin is greater than 30 bucks that's triple our cost per add to cart reason why we don't add to cart if we spend 30 bucks and we don't get a single add to cart and are typically if we spend 10 bucks and get an add to cart then likely it's not working we're reaching a bad portion of traffic so that way it's okay we spend 30 bucks add to carts are less than one and purchases less than one because what happens if the facebook just doesn't track cards properly then we'll have an issue and then we want to do just do it today only time range when apply to it we want to make sure we check this continuously count the fault email it's only if you want to it's where you get like updates and stuff and yeah so that'd be our safeguard right there so we spend over 30 bucks which again is your we take your average cost per add to cart multiply that by three and if you spend 30 bucks and get less than one add to cart so aka you didn't get any add to carts and you get no purchases let's turn that campaign off now let's go ahead and create another rule because we're not done yet next rule will be some type of like hard stop so let's do cost per result uh so we're going to do is go right here to website conversion pixel or not mount spent is greater than and we want to do 2x your average cost per purchase so let's say for example you normally you typically spend about 50 bucks or let's say uh your current cost per purchase is 40 bucks you spend more than 40 bucks with zero cost per purchases then let's turn it off okay so now we're going to do is put a hard stop in place where let's say for example you know we spend two extra average cost per purchase and get zero purchases we want to turn that off so we're going to do right here is go right here we're going to go to mount spent greater in let's say our average cost per purchase is 20 bucks and this is day one you got to figure it out like your day-to-day average cost per purchase because if you look at the last seven days your cost purchase will be a little higher due to attribution uh so let's say if it's typically about 20 dollars if we look the last seven days our average cost per purchase on tofu let's do about 25 about 1.5 times 20 that'd be 30 yeah so let's do about 60 bucks so if we spend greater than 60 bucks because over time uh due to the late attribution your your cost per purchase actually dropped down so we want to make sure you're day one so it's been about 60 bucks so we spend 60 bucks on a particular ad set and we get zero purchases then we want to turn that off so website conversions purchases is smaller than one ad okay and you can also better name some of these rules and stuff now the last one the last one is we're going to do another rule and we'll call this trim the fat 10 ad sets cost per results now what we're going to do is what happens if we do get some purchase and stuff but the row ass sucks so we'll do is spent um you could do 3x your average cost per purchase so we said about 25 bucks so we'll say about 75 dollars because again it's your 3x your average cost per purchase if we do about an average cost per purchase of you know 16 or 20 it's about 25 you know roughly 75 bucks three times your average cost per purchase and um if we get one sale so let's go right here purchases is greater than one or greater than zero actually because then it'll be two plus so now it's one so we spent 75 bucks our purchases for facebook pixel is greater than one but our robust website purchase for us is smaller than and then our break even is 2.0 so we strive for a 2.0 or higher on tofu so i'm just gonna put 2.0 as well because anything smaller than 2.0 we're gonna turn this off again time range today continuously there we go and now lastly there's one more rule what happens to the delayed attribution so let's say for example some of these assets gets cut off what happens if we turn one off but it has some sales that just take a few hours later and now it's a good row ass we're gonna do is we're gonna do um revival turn on assets and we're gonna do is website ro s is greater than 2.0 time range today so if our website purchase for us today is greater than zero and it's an asset that's turned off and we can also do spent greater than say five dollars so had a little bit of spend to it or just anything greater than five dollars spent and you know we spend that so let's say 60 bucks it turns off but we get like two or three purchases that's just delay takes a few hours uh then we're gonna turn that back on so revival cool and should we actually better refresh this there we go and now that's it that's how we do bid cap and again you want to find a winning audience winning creative when all that's proven and you need to scale aggressively you need to spin aggressively that's when you want to leverage this type of advanced scaling strategy again if you're spending 10 bucks 100 bucks a day you find something winning you do not need to do this you need to be spending a few hundred bucks a day this is not something to rush into keep using auto bed and stuff and then when you get to that point where you can spend a few thousand a day you need to spend it very quickly very effectively this is a great route to test especially if you're having a lot of really hard account fluctuations at large spend this is a great route to go also to make sure you get those rules in place because with those rules in place it's going to be a lot easier to manage to spend so that way you don't have to sit by your computer all day and babysit this campaign to increase the budget on this essentially just increase your your spin on your cbo level 20 per day as long as your overall roas is hitting the ideal kpis or you can even duplicate this campaign at a higher budget and you know shoot for it like that to really scale it and keep growing these particular ad sets so hope you enjoyed this video if you're interested in actually working with my digital agency we are taking on clients right now i have about
