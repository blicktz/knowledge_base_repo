Today, we'll be going over how to effectively test thumbnails for Facebook ads. I've been getting this question a lot lately. How exactly do I test thumbnails?

Do I use auto thumbnails? Do I use Facebook generated thumbnails? You know, how exactly do I test my thumbnails for Facebook video ads?

Today, I'll be going through my exact process for that. And if you're questioning why am I credible to be teaching these types of things, I've done over $50 million in online revenue for my clients at my Facebook ads agency. And you can click the link below to learn more about me running your Facebook ads through my agency.

Also, coaching mentor students as well. And I do have another link below that says, hey, get mentored by Nickterio. Now, that being said, before we get started, hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

And let's dive right into the video. So today, I'm in one of my, you could say, just kind of like low spending, just honestly, just our account that we just kind of spend on. But we're not really hitting any crazy business goals with it.

I call it my YouTube account because it's like the account I can make videos out of and stuff like that. Okay. So yeah, so I'm in my account, everything like that.

We got some new shit that we're launching and everything like that. So what I wanted to do today was to show you guys our thumbnail testing. So obviously, this is a DCT right here I've set up.

We have our other main ad sets and DCTs and stuff like that. So I want to actually go ahead and I just have like, you know, one of them set up so I can show you how we have our thumbnails. Okay.

First things first is that for our thumbnails, okay, we just use the thumbnail from like one to three seconds of the hook at the beginning of the video. So take your video and then find a spot between zero and three seconds in your editing software and just take a screenshot of it. Okay.

That you find engaging. So that way, every time I test a new visual hook, I'm also testing a new thumbnail. Okay.

So I have three videos inside of here, all with a different visual hook. Okay. Now, if I click on edit video and I go to thumbnail right here, you can see right here.

I don't have automatic on app manual and I have one selected. Okay. Now I was just being lazy for filming this particular video, but I would recommend you going in the editing software and finding the perfect spot, then screenshot, then click upload and upload it.

But I was just being lazy and chose a random one right here. I do not do that often. Only if I can't find one in here.

If I can find one in here that I know I want, then I'll just use that. But if I can't, then I'm gonna go to editing my editing software, take a screenshot and upload. Okay.

I was just being lazy for this video and just want to articulate to you guys the basic example here. Okay. So now the visual hook basically dictates whether or not someone clicks on this app.

Okay. And again, the hooks be the first three seconds they see. So if I use the thumbnail for the first three seconds as well, then they get to see it.

And I'm not, I'm click baiting. I'm not like click baiting them where they see one thumbnail click on it. Then they'll see something completely different.

Okay. I'm actually showing them the right thing. So now I kill two birds and one stone.

So now if I want to go ahead and upload more hooks, I also get new thumbnails. That's it. I mean, that's as simple as it gets.

Like, I don't know why, like, this is such a big talk about questions, but you can see the same thing right here. You know, just another, you know, same. Okay.

All we did was test a new hook and boom product. Now, look guys, don't judge me on these creatives. Okay.

This is me literally showing you guys creatives where like we've been having, you know, the same content from this client for three years now. Cause this client just does not care about this business at all. So we just, again, we use it just as our testing account now and just spend low amounts.

So this is us just literally trying literally anything out the sun right now. So, but yeah, so that's pretty much it. It's nothing complex.

We test new thumbnails. When we test new hooks, we use manual. We select the hook that, you know, we want in that case right there.

We take a screenshot, we upload it. And it's simple as that, you know, just to show you the last one really quick. Here you go.

Boom. Now, just something really quick also to notice, because I just noticed my team messed up on this, is that we use the same text hook when we're testing visual hooks. Right here, this is where we're just literally trying anything under the sun right here.

You'll notice it's a different visual hook and a different text hook. And this last one, I even noticed there's a different video at the end. This is not normal at all for our agency.

Typically when we test shit, we do, what we do is we do the same visual hook. Like, say for example, if we're testing one visual hook, we'll have the same text hook and a different visual hook. Okay?

If we're testing the visual hook. If we're testing the text hook, we'll have one visual hook and three different text hooks. And we'll have three different videos all in a different text hook.

So, just also, just a FYI for those people that will be commenting on this. Okay? Yeah.

So, that's it. That's how we test hooks in that case or how we test thumbnails. Very straightforward.

I know this is a fairly short video, but I've been getting this question a lot lately. As far as that, I mean, that's it, guys. I know y'all are probably expecting more, but there's nothing else to be expected in that case.

So, hope it's in for you all questions. Drop it in the comments below if you have any other further questions around this. Thank y'all so much for watching.
