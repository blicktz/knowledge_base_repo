I'm finally facing it all, fearless What is going on guys? Welcome back to the vlog Currently right now leaving the house, kind of 3D We are about to go take some photos with Kennedy and stuff And I also need to stop planting nutrition and pick up some more protein and stuff But later, later today we will be going to check out the new apartment Do an official tour of it, so stay tuned I'm really excited to show you guys what we came up with Let me show you what you guys, I got a vitamin zero water for later I got a one bar right now, these are pretty good I want macros, carb, fat, protein Kind of like a good distribution And also too, I got some mint chocolate chip protein Which I'm so excited for, because I've been looking for one like this for a while And also we got Kennedy and smoothies I'm like sorry about the audio now, because I don't have my Rode mic on But currently right now we are in our downtown area Taking some pictures and stuff I'm just going to get a few for me But I'm helping out mostly Kennedy right now with her job and stuff They do a lot of modeling and stuff for clothes I'm just helping her out, getting a few pictures for her And then we are going to go do the apartment tour right after this I thought this would also be a good time to check out this UV filter So look, it's black This is like over exposed as fuck, but I want to turn it just a little bit Really get those clouds to pop again Yeah, pretty cool Alright guys, we just made it to the first apartment So let's go ahead and give you guys a tour real quick of everything We are going to be viewing two of them today This is the first one, it's the second floor I'm not going to like reveal the name of the apartment complex or anything like that But this is the second floor Then we're also going to do a third floor one we're going to view next Where it's going to have more of a pool view So let's show you the two options Right when you walk in, you got you Dryer, washer And then it has this amazing Pretty much just like open layout This would be bedroom number one This would be like my office space and stuff So, which I mean it's huge You got your window right here Like the main parking lot area and stuff And this would be like just a regular utility closet Come inside, you have the big open countertops All your stainless steel appliances Fridge I mean it's pretty well stocked up in here And then this one also has like a little bit more windows I think than the other one I saw And you have, this is the overview parking lot You can see my car I'm going to show you guys the main bedroom So this is the main bedroom right here Master bathroom Huge So let's show you, put some light on Show you guys that lighting Holy crap, looks good Yeah Yeah This is the master closet Which I think is pretty big Pretty big I'll take it And then, the best part Let me show you guys the balcony We got a big ass balcony That's pretty much it for this one So now the other one is just going to have a pool view Instead of a parking lot view Which I really love it Because it's still facing This one's still facing Like, I don't know It's a weird vibe for it But it's not like a parking lot Where all the other cars park that But it's still like a front entrance view Which is really cool Just made it over here to the second one With the third floor And this one has a little bit better of a view So, exact same layout of everything Just different views So let me show you guys what we got So again, walking in, same thing Like I said, the only thing I didn't know about this one Is that more flights of stairs But honestly, it wasn't bad at all See this nice, nice view Of this little pond, pool And this would be an office area right here too So that's cool So I'll be spending the majority of my time over here Then Come inside over here Again, this is like living room This would be your view And then coming outside You have your balcony view Like that Which is pretty sweet And this whole thing is a corner So And then lastly And then lastly View of the Other This is the master bedroom Bedroom Pretty cool I wanna thank everyone for watching this video I know it was very short I really didn't finish the film too much yesterday It was a lot of just like kind of shock and awe With everything going on And also I didn't really do anything pretty much after Reviewed the apartment And literally played lazy The rest of the day And I did catch up on some work A little bit of work But pretty much just stayed in my bed all day Watching movies Um Yeah, I'm still kind of shocked right now With all this going on I am still waiting on
