yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today we'll be diving into the exact funnel metrics you need to be hitting on a day-to-day basis to ensure you're getting a great return on your ad spend you see a lot of people look at it like this they see their ad and then they see the purchases on the other side of Shopify and they're like hey I'm not hitting the return on once but yet they fail to look at the bigger picture the ad metrics they're hitting on a day-to-day basis the funnel metrics in terms of like product view to add to cart add to cart to checkout checkout to purchase all of these play a huge role in terms of converting your traffic so in this video I'm going to show you guys the exact metrics you need to be hitting and how to diagnose your funnel to see where you stand at in terms of what you need to improve you're gonna get an inside look of your brand like you've never seen before and it's gonna provide you a lot of valuable information of what's improved next in your business I'm gonna be giving you guys a free document today that you can take home where you can actually go through all these metrics it'll tell you what you need to improve if you're not hitting these and it's gonna be super valuable so that being said guys before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button before you forget because I am dropping value bombs every other day in terms of Facebook ads ecommerce and marketing so with that being said let's get started alrighty guys so this is kind of like the typical funnel of which people think when they run some Facebook ads and then they look at the ad the lag indicator which is purchases at the end of the funnel and they literally look at it like this ad purchase ad purchase they don't look at everything in between which we're gonna dive into today and understanding the ratios and the metrics you need to hit in between everything to make sure you're getting a good CVR which is purchase conversion rate which will ultimately result back into ROAS so this is the standard e-com funnel you won't get out found link clicks is this on Facebook's platform but landing page view content view ads cart initiate checkout and purchase is all gonna be standard events tracked with Facebook pixel on your Shopify now outbound link click this is the people who are clicking on an ad so any user who clicks on an ad and gets taken off Facebook's property that's a link click earn outbound link click so it's gonna be the shop now button the URL and the ad maybe if you have another URL anything that's taking people off Facebook onto a different platform website etc now landing page view this is people who view the website but does just like views random pages content view is actually viewing the product add to cart is obviously add to cart initiate checkout starting a checkout and purchase purchase so now that we understand that here is the benchmarks we aim to shoot for so we're using all unique to measure this so when you go inside your Facebook ads manager to pull this data use unique for all of this except purchase users purchases in general so unique outbound link clicks all the way to unique initiate checkouts now unique outbound link clicks we're shooting for a CPC of under $1 so cost per click and a CTR greater than 1% landing page views we're looking from a click to a landing page view rate we're looking for 80% or less I mean are greater are greater if you have lowered and 80% you have some major issues with your website landing page view to content view we're looking for 10% so when you view a product we want 10% or greater people to add to cart so again let's look at this again so for on a website for on a website we just made it to this website clicked off an ad and look at the pixel helper page view that's attributed let's go to shop now and let's go to our let's just look at it again again page view let's look at our product viewing this product oh look what happened a content view showed up there we go view content so I'm viewing a product actually viewing it so we want 10% of people who view a product to add to cart or greater and then add to cart abandoned cart rate so abandoned cart rate is how many people add to cart so on the website one two three four just add to cart just add to cart just add to cart just add to cart just add to cart just add to cart no don't check out I'll leave this website I'm done so I just abandoned cart we want 70% or less people to abandoned cart and abandoned checkout rate is people who obviously check out Check out Dada and abandoned it so I leave the website right now and just banded the website. That's an issue So that's again banded checkout rate now conversion rate is Calculated is the out of people who click on a link click or Your website conversion rate a two percent. So you can raise rate will be different.

I'm looking at Facebook conversion rate so Let's say for example, you're running Google Ads. You're running YouTube ads You're running all kinds of different advertising channels and you're looking specifically at Shopify's analytics and looking at the conversion rate on your website and it's greater than 2% that's what I'm shooting for But let's say for example, you're running this through the Facebook Ads Ads manager in terms of purchases like you're getting all these metrics from Facebook Ads manager and It's less than 2% that's an issue or greater than 2% that's good. So there's two different ways to calculate it So you have to understand that now it's how do I calculate each one of these and that's the free little document?

I'm actually going to give you guys in This video here. We have the funnel metrics We have specifically outbound clicks how to calculate it and then exactly what to do if it's low or if it's too high Depending on which one you're looking at Some you might say if you have a high percent of abandoned carts. It's bad You have a low percentage of people out in the cart.

That's bad, too So but yeah, so you use this tool right here to go through your entire funnel To figure out what issues you're having and again your purchase conversion rate. That's your lag indicator So your lead indicators of ways to improve it is Improving your ads your creatives right here your ad copy and targeting the right audiences Then right here, you know getting more people to your website from Facebook So improving your site speed then from landing page view to you know our view to add to cart So improving your product page your product page is gonna make your biggest impact on top of all of these metrics so like initiate checkout to improve initiate checkout You know you could you know put more trust on the checkout page in terms of like More testimonials on the page no hidden shipping costs or stuff like that Just like make sure it's seem streamlined checkout Rise your product page. That's me your biggest difference for ads cart get more people that's cart and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna get more Purchases you're gonna get more people to complete the process and stuff but just improve your Product page Add testimonials to it.

Make sure people don't even have to think when they're viewing your product everything is answered forum They can purchase confidently without thinking So maybe you need more urgency behind your product in terms of like, you know How many that sold out countdown timer etc all the little things to test and see if it works So that's the biggest thing understand these metrics work on each one and Consistently look at these so that's why I'm developing this thing called the KPI book I've used this already inside of my agency. I've this is the third generation of it So I'm really excited to release this to y'all soon You don't get this but y'all will get this today in this video by simply clicking the link below But the KPI books me release very soon where it gives me a war realistic Every day. Here's the metrics by simply just pulling them in inside of this sheet right here So what happens is I get to learn the metrics um, I get to see what happens on a day-to-day basis and That way I know what's going on I compared to last seven days last week versus the week prior last month versus prior month The change and then I'm have some stuff right here for like the year So this would be a really cool tool because each day you can access it It automatically pulls in the data from your ad account.

So that way you don't have to Keep updating this over and over and over because that'd be a pain in ass with this amount of like funnel and stuff metrics So, um, and as you can see right here So like outbound click to line of page view rate, we're achieving at 83 percent Versus the last seven days were averaged about 89 percent and our benchmark benchmark is 80 percent Um, now this website isn't set up properly in terms of the pixel to where because again It's like one of the only clients ever we've worked with that's not shopify So, um, we don't we don't can't calculate the product view to add to cart rate Um, but we do know the bandit cart rate is 54 percent So 54 percent people are adding to cart and not check or not purchasing This is also as a higher ticket product So our 70 percent we're still within realm or like we're still within KPI so that's good Um, and our band that checkout rate right now is a 28 percent versus or just yesterday data versus the last six seven Or seven days of 26 percent on our purchase conversion rates 5.68 percent based off facebook Um, so yeah now what is the main cause of why our row as has dipped or Has probably dropped down below why we're not seeing a three to four x and that is cpm and Right here 32 dollars for a cpm So let's look at our cpc and our ctr and we're seeing we're having a Lower than one percent ctr and our cpc is four dollars and 55 cents. So our cpc is a lot higher than expected And our link click ctr is very low. So we need to introduce some new creatives Maybe the same creators we've been running were too long We've ran those creatives too long to where we now we need to improve those creatives to um Get a better ctr and better cost per click which is going to lower cpms and is going to improve our row ass So this is a good way of why we need to understand all of this so that way we can make well Calibrated decisions of what we need to do to improve ad performance So I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
