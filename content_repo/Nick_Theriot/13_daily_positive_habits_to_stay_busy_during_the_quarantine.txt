I never like filmed a solid introduction for this video so welcome guys to this quick video I've been going over a few positive habits that I'm currently implementing in my life right now with this quarantine going on that's been occupying my brain and keeping me mentally sane during this period of time so hope you guys enjoy this video. Number zero is make your bed first thing when you wake up and also to set an alarm and even if it's just later in the day just set your alarm eight hours from the time you fall asleep. Morning YouTube just finished up a little 20 minute cardio session this morning or first half of it and today's video I think I want to be on is all about positive habits you can be doing during the quarantine at home so number one is going for a run.

Next thing you can do is learn or practice martial art maybe something about martial art boxing whatever for me it's boxing I love it I pretty much love myself so please don't judge me if I form a shit but yeah do about 10 minutes between these two bags. Next thing you can do is take a cold shower this will be number three. Reason why it's very challenging you're not going to want to do it it's mentally challenging physically challenging it's a challenge but it's a cold shower you're going to live after.

Alright so after reviewing this clip I realized I didn't really give shit of the actual benefits of cold shower quick reason why I do it is boom it's challenging it forces you to get out of your comfort zone if you do it on a day-to-day basis and you do that first thing in the morning it's going to make everything else in the day that's harder easier to do it's going to allow you to boom get it done. Next thing it increases your resistance to stress so it's going to lower your stress levels and it's going to build up your immunity to stress because your body can handle more stress essentially a lot of research on cold showers about that just google it next one it does help out with your immune system it also helps out with recovery a lot of good benefits highly recommend starting cold showers number four but number four is still make sure if you're a guy fix your hair you know put some decent clothes on make sure you take care of your trim of your beard etc girls if you do makeup in the morning do your makeup like still do your normal routine as if you're going outside and going out in public as just making yourself feel better in general by the way you your appearance you're going to have a better day overall a better mindset. Alright so number five is a meditation I do a 23 minute guided meditation by Dr.

Dispenza it's morning meditation I really like it because it's like half of it's like a meditation and focusing another half is still focusing but visualizing your future and your goals and stuff so I really like it meditation is a great way to kind of like it's a mental health it helps with your mental health especially with all this chaos and stuff and news and everything it helps take your mind away from all that and kind of relaxes you and like I said it builds up the habit of focusing so I'm gonna do this meditation now and like I said number five sometimes meditation whether it's a guided meditation maybe it's just 10 minutes of closing your eyes and focusing on something your breath uh to it's a lot of them on YouTube in fact that's where I started out was YouTube meditations and I love them. Alright so this is number six and seven this is a four hour work block with 45 minutes on 15 minute break and that 15 minute break that's number seven and then just read a book so what you're gonna do is 45 minutes on set an alarm set a timer just gauge watch the clock 45 minutes on of working five minutes to get up go use the restroom get your glass of water whatever and then 10 minutes to read your book and then start back over again you get four times for a four hour work block now a few things for this work block if you're a student you may want to do this for all your online classes and stuff if you're currently going to school right now this work block will differ for everyone maybe if you're at home you lost your job don't have a job right now you're just at home this could be the time you use to start experimenting with business ideas or gaining your own financial independence this could just be you researching and developing around things that's of area of interest for you so this could be different for everyone for me this four hour work block is for me to work on my digital agency and again read my book in between so another key tip real quick you want to take that phone of yours put the thing on do not disturb and you want to find you a cabinet and you want to put that in there and leave that there until your four hour work block is over and the reason you want to do this is because it allows you to access a deeper level of focus and also it gives you a reason to stay away from your phone for a few hours because there's so much hectic pan and craziness on social media and stuff this is going to allow you to kind of zone out and really focus on whatever you got to do whatever work you got to do also an essential for me is my bose quiet comforts i've been loving these so much because of the level of noise they block out everything and i can really focus uh during my work block as well as a monochrome 3d for a little bit of energy so i'm go ahead and take care of this work block now and we'll see you in four hours we're on like number eight now of like things you can do at home during quarantine to make time go by and number eight is actually pretty cool and that is cooking we all know that we can always be better in the kitchen maybe there's a few things we don't know how to do yet a few special dishes you've always wanted to make cooking cooking is an excellent one just from the time it takes actually go research on youtube of different recipes etc it's actually going to the store because a lot of people can still go to the store during this quarantine actually go to the store pick up the items to cook that's all stuff that you could probably do maybe once a day try to hold yourself accountable to maybe even every other day to doing one specialty dish you've always wanted to do so right now i'm actually researching a chicken fennacini i want to cook tonight and in the oven i got some nice salmon to be cooked so so number eight cooking learn a few different dishes during this time period and it's gonna make time go by quicker also fun and also get some good ass food all righty guys so number nine is education time spend two hours of your day maybe even an hour if you are like still going to work during this quarantine time but maybe two hours give yourself two hour block to focus on improving your current skill sets or maybe even empowering areas of your life so like right now i'm taking a course by natasha v where it's going over to linkedin how to use linkedin better and get more leads and stuff for your business for you maybe you are a college student maybe you are very interested in fitness and you want to learn more about fitness maybe do just some time on youtube and learn more stuff about fitness working out so like this is the linkedin course i'm currently going through but like just to show you guys like if you just go on youtube um how to start a business boom and you can literally start learning and researching videos how to start a business maybe how to start a online business or a business with no money there's loads of stuff you you can find on youtube all righty guys number 10 is some type of weight resistant training yes we went for our run this morning yes we did our like boxing and stuff our heavy cardio session but now number 10 is doing something like a resistant training and i like to switch i like to separate the two just because a cardio done in the morning because i don't want to do it at all so i just get it done two i like to separate it because i like to feel the body recover from both whatever exercise i start with before i start the next one and then lastly it's good to practice to build up muscles and stuff on your body build up your strength and stuff and again it's if you have all this extra time why not train twice today if you can and i'm not doing anything crazy i'm not doing anything where like i'm maxing out on bench in the morning and max out on squatting in a day where you're gonna risk overtraining so why not take advantage of it and do it if you can so today i am doing a pool day back biceps shrub traps and i should be a pretty good day number 11 now and that is have your relaxed time play some playstation talk with some friends facetime your girlfriend just do have some relaxed time do plan some relaxed time in the day if you are working from home sometimes it's hard to flip that mental switch but you do need your at least hour to some some people two hours a day just to relax recharge your brain you know not be so hard mentally all day so you can have some time to just relax and you're gonna feel much better the next day so i take a little bit of stress off you and yeah i mean for me it's playing my playstation talking to my friends online uh maybe catch up on some youtube videos maybe watching some netflix facetime my girlfriend and yeah that's my relax time all right so this will actually be like the last two this will be 12 and 13. number 12 i'm gonna put it out there is start a vlog maybe start daily posting on social media maybe start posting a vlog on your instagram story to be honest guys these videos are very fun to do and it keeps me busy throughout the day if you don't know where to start out with a vlog just start sharing your knowledge uh everyone has knowledge in the back of their head that's that they know that's more than others so i know a little bit more than most people who follow this channel on business is there people who know way more than business me hell to the yes but i can at least share the knowledge i know to get these other people up to par where i'm at so start sharing knowledge that you you already know even though you don't know at all even though you're not an expert even though you're not a professional just start sharing some of the knowledge you have now and start sharing that on a daily basis it gives you something to do it's fun it's entertaining and um you know like i said it's it's it's awesome to empower other people's lives through the knowledge you learn and gather yourself number 13 is do a daily uh or a nightly journal uh thinking time 30 minutes just notepad paper write down every single thought and just break down thoughts you know what's going on in your head right now i'll write it down you know what are you thankful for right now maybe you be thankful for your health thankful that you know you're doing good right now through this very harsh time um write all that down do some thinking time put thoughts on pen and paper and that helps a lot very mental stimulating as well so hope you guys enjoyed this little video this is a pretty cool video to make i know it probably wasn't like the most professionally edited video i
