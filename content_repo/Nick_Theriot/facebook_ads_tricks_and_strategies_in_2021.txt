yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i'll be talking about what's working in 2021 for facebook ads what is currently working for us and what are we doubling down on so after watching this video you'll be able to really go out there kind of leverage on these things to really improve your results with facebook ads and shopify before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday so the first thing that's working really well for us is literally just big budget cbo's stacked with two ad sets yeah literally two ad sets so we'll create up a cbo campaign conversions optimize for purchase and we'll have two ad sets ad set one is stacked with all of our best performing interests expansion turned off and then all its ad set number two will be all of our best performing lookalikes again expansion turned off so we have ad set one all of our interests adds that to all of our look likes and typically i'm not a fan of stacking at all but lately we've been finding literally just running complete open ad sets huge targets work really well so i'm like okay let's pull it back let's stack all of our best interests and look likes so some days we'll have an interest audience perform really well then some days we'll have a look like audience perform really well so doing this we're basically giving facebook everything that works and breaking them down to two groups because i've seen actually negative performance if we put a look like in an interest together so i'm just stacking them into two separate ad sets and then our creative is our best performing creative again from our creative testing campaign audiences are from our audience testing campaign we're stacking that into cbo we're starting the cbo off at 10x or at our target cpa so if we're seeing like a 15 or 30 cost per acquisition cpa across facebook ads account then we'll do is we'll probably put like a anywhere from 150 to 300 budget so 10 times our cost per acquisition we're currently seeing right now now let it run for about three to seven days cbo's take a little longer to optimize so be wary of that let it run for a little bit longer and that's when we're really starting to see performance increase so give it a few days and then you should be good to go with that now to scale it we're simply doing 20 increases once per day super simple if we're seeing a roas that's like double what our goal is then we may scale it faster by duplicating that cbo and putting a budget 10 times that so let's say for example our target roas is a 2x and we're seeing a 4 or 5x roas on that cbo and we need to scale faster then we'll do is we'll duplicate that cbo out of you know 10x so if the budget's 300 today we'll duplicate at 3 000 today again everyone's risk management to be different so make sure you understand your risk levels and what are you willing to risk before doing that now the next thing that we're seeing that's making the biggest impact in ad accounts is testing literally anywhere from three to ten new creatives every single week so that's not new ad copy that's not new headlines that's literally the creative and testing three to ten every single week that's completely different so what we're doing is we're going ahead and we're finding the initial concepts that work really well for a brand by looking at competitor ads and stuff and looking at bigger brands what's working for them we're pulling together those concepts we're testing those concepts and whatever works the best out of the variety of concepts we we do then we're going to double down on that particular creative type so let's say for example if a unboxing video is working the best from one of our like our user generated unboxing video if that concept works best we're producing three to ten new ones every single week and consistently keep pushing those out keeping a lot of fresh new creative is allowing us to scale a lot faster because we constantly have new creative that catches the attention of more and more people so that's working super well for us and it's gonna be a major role going through 2021 following that concept right there now the next thing is audience testing campaign so we have a creative testing campaign we set up to test creative and we have an audience testing campaign so we're using our three to four best performing creatives and we're testing new interests to look likes whatever you know whatever floats your boat we're testing new interests and look likes every single week we're testing anywhere from three to six every single week so that could be three interests three look-alikes that could be two interests one look-alike whatever just testing new interest looks like every single week and then we're doing is we're copying those so let's say engaged shoppers is working really well we're putting that in our interest ad set that's stacked in our cbo campaign now when you do edit that ad set it does put it back into review and kind of like re-optimizes it so be wary of that but we haven't seen any too much potential impact on that so again just be wary of that be caution that so like if you you know you you have a few winning interests you want to put them in that ad set there's a potential for some performance drop but go ahead add them in if things die out over the next few days and duplicate that ad set and remove those interests and again it's not the most effective way but it has still been working really well for us now the next thing is actually going back to creative we're really starting to create ads that with the focus of converting at tofu so we're trying to shorten the length of the sale cycle because with ios 14.5 we're seeing a lot of people opting out and again it's it's really damaging our retargeting campaigns so if it's damaging our retargeting campaigns we need to do two things we need to convert more traffic at tofu and then secondary we also need to capture more emails we can follow up with later so for example we'll do is we'll put like a 10 percent off or 20 percent off discount code on the website if you opt in to our email newsletter you opt in and now we have a place to target those people because we can you know target people through email for people who haven't purchased in the last say seven days and we can do kind of like an email retargeting sequence with them so convert more traffic with tofu so better creatives better ad copy better headlines and all that and then also to more newsletters and like email capture to where we can do sms blast and we can do more email blast to follow with those people to get them to convert later down the line now the next thing kind of goes back to creatives it's testing more video creatives and more creatives that have higher engagement a lot of likes and comments and stuff because we can do is we can create retargeting audiences based off video views or engagement and we're running both of those and they work very well and what we're doing is is we're um with ios 14.5 it's for people outside of the app so on app tracking still works very well and gets around ios 14.5 so even if someone opts out we can still retarget them if they watch the percentage of a video so doing a lot of video of you retargeting and engagement retargeting on app is working really well for retargeting audiences but you need to be producing some really good video creatives in order to do this so more video creatives in our video creative to our in our creative testing and then more of these retargeting on app audiences um to really utilize the on app retargeting now lastly is testing more offers so one brand we're working with right now um we're literally testing like three or four different offers this month we're doing a father's day sale we're doing a christmas in june sale we're doing a summer flash sale so we're testing a variety of new offers and we're literally like creating new offers every week to kind of create this new momentum every single week which allows us to scale quicker so again so testing a lot of new offers um every month and utilizing your creatives to test these your headlines or copy and all that stuff testing a lot of new offers every single month to really push some massive momentum moving forward so i think long story short creative in 2021 is gonna be the single-handed beast that's going to get us through rs 14.5 and really separate brands and is why we've been so focused on it in the last say two or three months i've literally started building out the vision that's specifically focused on creative for our agency so that way we can have a consistent batch every week and also actually shooting creative ourself is something we've also been looking at too and you know putting the right people in place to do that together at our agency so a lot of big things we've been kind of just changing up in our agency but it's all things that we know is going to crush it in 2021 for our brands we're working with now if you're a shopify
