Like they make her go normal or something? Yo what's going on guys? We are live in Miami, Florida right now.

Just hit the streets to ask the public what they think of your Facebook ad creatives. So let's go ahead and get started. Okay, what's your name?

Celine. Celine? Nick, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you. I'm going to show you, it's just an image ad. I do a lot of Facebook ads, so it's a little sponsored stuff you see.

And all I want to do is get your first thoughts when you see the ad. There's no wrong answers here. Just whatever comes to your mind, let me know.

You ready? Yeah. Okay.

So this is to help your hair get thicker, fuller. It gets to the point. Yeah.

I guess that's what you need when it comes to an advertisement. Okay, thoughts are? It delivered.

It delivered? Yeah. Okay.

Would you click on that ad? If I was looking for this, yes. Yes.

Seeking this item for sure, yeah. If you could do like one thing to improve it, what would you do? I don't know.

I don't know. I really don't know what to say. Well, I appreciate that.

No, of course. Of course. Celine.

Emily. Emily? Yeah.

Nick, nice to meet you. Yeah, El. El, nice to meet you.

I'm going to show you the ad. It's just going to be a photo because we don't have time for video. Whatever's the first thoughts that come to your mind, that's all I want to know.

Y'all ready? Yeah. Okay.

Different. Anyone else? I'm a little confused.

There's a lot going on. Looks like a brush. Looks like a brush?

Okay. It seems like it could be effective though. Yeah.

Would you click on this ad? Probably not, no. Too many colors, I think.

Yeah. Too many colors. I don't like the colors.

White, orange. Now, if I were to say maybe put a girl using it in this photo, would that make you more likely to click on it? Yeah.

Awesome. Well, I appreciate you guys a lot. Nice to meet you.

Kat. Kat, nice to meet you. Are y'all from Miami?

No. No? Where from?

Chicago. He's from Chicago. Oh, really?

Yeah. Okay, I'm going to show you all the picture. Like I said, just give me whatever thoughts come to your mind first.

There's no wrong answers here. Ready? All right.

Why this? Why this? I mean, I get it.

Like they, you know, create something together, but like I don't like it. Would you click on this ad? Probably, yeah.

Because I want to be nosy. You want to be nosy? It definitely brings my attention.

Like what? So you would just click on it because you're nosy or would you click on it because you're actually interested in the product? I would just, yeah.

Nosy? Like I want to see if it's like a scam or a joke or something. Okay.

So you think like some of the ads that ran online are like actual like scams and stuff? Sometimes. Sometimes?

Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Cool. Well look. All right.

Here's the ad. All I'm going to do is get your, like literally whatever comes to your mind first. There's no wrong answers.

Anything like that. So here you go. What do I have to do?

What do you have to do? That's it? Ah, okay.

That's it. Would you click on this ad? Yes.

You would click on it? Yeah. Okay.

Why would you click on it? Because it's strange. It's strange?

Yeah. And you got, you got my attention because there's a person that had to donate. And also it seems like healthy.

Okay. Like good and healthy stuff together. Are you big into like health and fitness and stuff?

Yeah. Awesome. I try to, but yes.

You try to? Yeah. Is there anything you would improve about this?

Uh, perhaps more, because it's two white people. So perhaps. Diversity and stuff?

Diversity, yeah. Okay. But I like it.

Amazing. Well, I appreciate it, Victoria. There are definitely lots of band cameras in Brickle.

Okay. We're here with. Christina.

Christina. She's also one of my inner circle students as well. So she's going to have a little bit more of a bias.

Initial reaction? Weird. Super weird.

Creepy. Okay. Yeah, kind of weird.

I would not click on that ad. You would not click on that ad? I don't think I would.

What would you do to improve it? I would do it like, hire someone who like, does better Photoshop. Okay.

Maybe. I would make maybe like raspberry and donut like animated images instead of like actual donut and actual raspberry. Awesome.

All right. And I'm going to show you the last one real quick. Yeah.

I wouldn't understand what it is. For me, I have such a short attention span that I have to like see right away what product is. Looking at it for like another like two minutes, I still don't understand what it is.

It's like a brush. I appreciate your feedback, Christina. Thank you.

You're very welcome. All right, guys. You got to see it firsthand.

Raw reactions from strangers reacting to your ads. Big thank you to the people who donated the creatives to be able to be shown in this particular video. This was not done by us or anything like that.

It was submitted by you guys on Twitter. So thank you all for sending those over. And I just wanted to really point out the fact of seeing so much raw reactions to these things because these are the exact same mindset that people are on except they are not forced by some random stranger on the street to do a video of them.

They are like less intent to want to look at the video for their other reasons. So just keep that in mind when you saw this because you actually have less of a chance of stopping someone on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that. So really cool.

Very common was what is this? What is this product? What does this mean to me?

That was the biggest thing. And some of them, there was too much thought that had to be seen. And those creatives that have too much thought, that's what stops people from wanting to continue on or like clicking and things like that.

So simpler always scales. Want to see more videos like this? Drop a comment below which you'll like to see next.

Or you want me to fly next too? I'd be happy to go. I'm really tempted to go to LA.

So if you want to see some cool stuff in LA, drop some videos below because I would love to do more like this. Hit that like button. Hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
