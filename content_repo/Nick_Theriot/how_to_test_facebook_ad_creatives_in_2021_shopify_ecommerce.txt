yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriot here and today I have an exciting new video where we're gonna cover exactly how I test new creatives find the winning creatives and drop them into proven campaigns that we can scale with this is a very important process and if you just drop a new creative into a scaling campaign you could literally crush your ROAS because Facebook like drop all the spin on unproven creative that doesn't work and it just makes a mess so that being said before we get started this video hit the like button hit the subscribe button be on the lookout for new videos every other day helping the Shopify become business owner empowering them with paid advertising and marketing and helping them scale in 2021 let's get started folks okay so how to find winning ad creatives so right now we have two routes first off there's cold audiences and remarketing audiences because there's two different ways we do it cold audiences we're gonna test them and validate them first and then we're gonna put them into our scaling campaigns whereas the remarketing audiences we're spending little on those particular campaigns and assets so you can literally just drop in new creatives nothing to worry about now hold audiences when we're spending because we can we keep about 70% of our ad spend our daily ad spend on cold audiences so there's a lot more especially when you're spending nearly 10 20 30 thousand dollars a day and ads men and yes that is a case study coming up soon so current problem when you drop in a creative into a un or when you drop in a unproven creative into a cold audience that you've been running for a while it messes things up because Facebook will start spending on that creative and it's not proven you're not really getting the results you want and it's it's you know it throws things off and you start to see hit row ass inconsistent swing highs and lows you know maybe it's a good row ass then it shoots up which is good that's what we want but maybe it's horrible then row ass kind of shoots down so we just have some issues it's just like throwing a bad apple to a batch of good apples and and then you know eating all those apples and you're like whoa this is a bad apple should have done that so the new way how do we validate creatives before moving to a higher spend campaign that is the question right there and that is why we set up a testing campaign on the side so you have your main creative campaign where your your main scaling campaign and then on the side of it you have a testing campaign and how do you set up a campaign to test creatives well there's two variables there's the audiences and then there's the creatives so what variable we're testing is the creative so we don't want to use a old or we don't want to use a new audience we want to use an ad set that is proven that's worked well from time to time again so you want to look at the lifetime data on the account or maybe even the last 90 days data on your Facebook ads account and find the one to two audiences that are cold audiences that have done consistently from time to time again with multiple different creatives the ones that have been battle tested essentially that hey this audience works we crush it with it then what you want to do is you want to come there and load in those ad sets into a new campaign do website conversions optimize ad sets for purchase and you want to do an abo campaign so where the budget control is at the ad set level and you want to start off those ad sets each at five to twenty dollars a day maybe a little higher if you're trying to test quickly depending on what you're trying to do now that you have those testing or that testing campaign set up it's time to load in the new creatives you want so what you want to do is go ahead inside those campaign so what you want to do is take one of those ad sets go ahead create three new creatives video photo carousel new copy just completely three new ads and you want to do a limit of three ads per ad set and then what you want to do is if you're testing you know if you have two audiences in your creative testing campaign then you want to duplicate those ads into the other audience because that way you're taking those three ads and you're crossing them over two audiences to really make sure that it's not just audience you're testing them against multiple different audiences which works really well and then this way it looks something like this you have your creative testing campaign you have proven audience number one proven audience number two and i just have like the day we add those creatives in so 128 creatives 128 creatives just for some naming conventions and then we have test ad one two and three and then those same ads duplicate it into the other proven audience one two and three so this way we're testing these three ads against two audiences um to see which ones work the best and just do three completely different ads maybe do one ad or you know three different variations of a particular ad go for it and you know all those different ways now proven this one right here this is like our secondary so like say for example the next day we want to create some new ads we'll do the same thing we'll duplicate these two audiences and then we'll do is we'll load in those new creatives because again we're going to add in new creatives and i just made another label 130 creatives so this way again we're consistently testing creatives we're testing in a low budget so that way we can do this multiple times a week and what you want to do is you want to let these creatives run for at least seven days so just let it run that's why we use small budgets enough to where they're feeding out and stuff but small enough to where it's not going to throw everything off and i have to really worry about audience overlap and all those crazy things inside the account we can just let it run for a few days and we can see which creatives work the best now what you want to do is take those creatives that work really well you should be able to clearly identify which creatives work out of you know those few creatives you set up for testing and then you want to copy the post id forum and bring them in by post id so you know preview the ad see facebook post by comments copy the second group of numbers and then paste it into a new ad and use existing post for that new ad so this way you're keeping engagement and stuff and an easier way to you can actually bring them into the campaign now you're actually gonna have less of an effect because you prove these creatives that they work before you put them in your scaling campaign so you'll see a less of a drop in roas once spin starts going to it and it's kind of building up your you know more confidence in you as you scale up because you know you're using creatives that's worked really well in the past so that way you can keep scaling and then you kind of just turn off creatives here and there inside your scaling campaign as they burn out um and you need to like four spin on certain ones so so i hope y'all enjoyed this video hope it was clear straightforward of exactly what you need to do testing creatives is something you need to be doing weekly uh even with my consulting clients like here you know set up this consulting you know even with my consulting clients my hair set up a creative testing campaign they'll test one batch of creatives for a week and never do it again and i'm like what are you doing you need to be testing weekly and you need to be focusing a lot of time on your creative development because this is going to give you the best results with facebook ads you can have pretty bad targeting and like all optimization and stuff but have some amazing creatives and still crush a good row as whereas if you have a horrible stack of creatives even the best targeting best ad structure all that stuff it's not going to get your results you want so hope you all enjoyed this video make sure to hit the like button and hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel if you're a shopify ecom business owner and you're
