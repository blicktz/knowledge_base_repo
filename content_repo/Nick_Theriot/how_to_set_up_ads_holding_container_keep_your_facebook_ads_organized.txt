yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys this is something that's been requested from you for a lot uh for a while now and that is how to set up the ads holding containers so in all of our client accounts across facebook specifically we have this little holding container that we leave off it's just a campaign that we leave off and we store all of our ads inside it to better organize things for um just in general of organizing things and also keeping social proof so that being said let's get started um before we get started make sure that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday friday and that being said let's get started so diving into an ad account so i got an account right here just to show you guys and i have two campaigns set up like our main kind of like scaling campaign pushing stuff into um and then we have our ads holding a tan so um i run purchase conversions for all my accounts specifically for e-commerce so that means i'm optimizing for conversions or like i'm choosing conversions for the campaign and then i'm optimizing for purchases at the um ad set stuff like that level so with that being said let's go further just kind of dive in show you this what this ad's holding container looks like so if we go further into it you can see right here i have pretty much every month we create a new ad set and again we're leaving the ad set off um you can set up as an abo at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if it's ab or cbo due to it never run it's never ever going to run okay just want to make sure you clarify on that so we have a variety of these different set up obviously as each month goes on we'll go ahead and create a new one so let's actually create a new ad set because it's january and i don't have a january one set up yet for this client so go ahead and go inside of here and i'm going to type in jan i'm going to probably miss all that 2022 ads and then um it doesn't really matter if you create an ad or not let me go ahead and create that so yeah so once i get inside of here again just make sure per conversion events purchase none of this matters because again we're not running this campaign um so we go inside of here now let's actually create our ad so we go click edit and then obviously make sure you select your instagram and facebook i'm at this blurred out just due to privacy issues with this client and make sure it's not showing up and we're just going to call this test ad number one i highly recommend you put some level of naming convention still set up and turn this off do a single image and i don't know why i really hate that it's kind of shooting straight to like things like this select your website events um get hubrik watch that out um cool and then add your image you know create your create your ad basically okay this is a cool ad buy now please um yeah cool and then obviously put your website url in cool um and then publish again here would watch all that please i know i'm sorry so now that you actually created your ad inside of your ads holding container what you can do now is um go back to let's go back to campaign level back to ads holding container um i want to make sure that ad set we just create is off because again i never want this to run um but i can leave the ad on because the ad will never run because that ad set is off and then what i have right here is basically this ad we just created you'll see it's still a review what i want to do is literally hit refresh the whole entire page and the reason why i like to do that um is just to make sure everything kind of clears and then i'm going to do next click on it right here and then you preview and i'm going right here to see facebook post with comments oh you're gonna hate me for this you're gonna hate me for this you were um getting pretty vote for diva um so now that that is previewed what's going to happen basically is now as we can get what's called a post id which is right here it's a second string of numbers so i'm just going to kind of have that highlighted um and i'm going to show you what we're going to do so i'm actually going to copy this ad by hitting command c um whatever you for a mac whatever you use for copy and paste for um you know what you call it uh windows you just use that then we go back to campaign level and let's say we're bringing this into a testing campaign or we want to bring this into a scaling campaign what i'm gonna do is go to my scaling campaign and then i'm gonna click on the ad set we want to paste that ad in now i'm just gonna hit ctrl v to paste it in because we already copied it now what's gonna happen is you'll see it's all like back to where usually like it's coming back to this like create an ad type thing right here you can edit everything and stuff like that i don't want that i do not want that at all so what i do is i want to click on add setup i want to click use existing post now i'm gonna go back to our post i'm gonna copy that second string of numbers and then i'm gonna go to enter post id and paste that in and what's gonna essentially happen here is now we are we're like instead of running um when we create that first ad it creates a post on the facebook page and instead of creating a whole new ad when we copy and paste it we're just using the existing post and what's going to happen is is this going to retain social proof and when you retain social proof um and again you can publish that but when you retain that social proof it allows us to build up a lot of likes comments shares on an ad and when we duplicate it we don't have to worry about something happening where we lose that social proof so this is a way we do it for all of our accounts and we notice actually an improvement anywhere from 10 to 20 improvement return on ads been from this because now like if we take an ad and copy and paste it across a few campaigns utilizing the other way it doesn't always carry social proof over facebook claims it does but it does it realistically does not like we notice it all the time breaking this way it does not break and this is really powerful we've done this for about a year and a half now and we absolutely love it so really hope this kind of describes how to run the ads holding container it's very easy um very simple setup and hopefully this helps you so again if you're an e-com business doing at least fifty thousand dollars per month in revenue left off on a call
