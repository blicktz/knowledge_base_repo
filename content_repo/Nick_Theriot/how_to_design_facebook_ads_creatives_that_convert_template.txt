yo what's good on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio today i'm an exciting new video for you guys today we're actually going to dive into what is kind of like a creative template that you guys can use for your stores whether it's e-com lead generation um even like coaching and courses and stuff like that but uh whatever you guys are doing uh you better leverage this simple creative template and i'm actually going to show you guys in a way or articulate it to you guys in a way that'll make it easy for y'all to understand kind of give you guys a standardized process y'all can use for your creatives and everything so that being said before we get started hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday that being said let's dive into it guys so let me show y'all first this right here so this is kind of like your most basic creative storyboard that i i see all the time it's it's quite often been used hundreds of times across ads and stuff like that i've personally analyzed thousands of ads and this is like the most basic one that if you master can be widely profitable for your business so let me show it to you it's very easy it's the hook features social proof call to action in this order essentially your hook grabs them in grabs their attention they want to watch the video now features educate people on the product of how it helps them what's in it for the customer and then social proof essentially the the simple fact of hey other people love this product too so now they're they're they got their attention you channel desire into the product show them social proof and stuff and then boom your call to actions are a reason of why they should purchase it now okay so before we actually go through this i just want to show you all one ad one particular ad right here just to show y'all of how basic this can be and also to just how well it works so this ad does a hook features and that's it it doesn't actually just social proof in the call to action side that's the only thing i changed this particular creative itself so just to show y'all boom comfort that moves it hooks you in it kind of drives some curiosity in that perspective right there what what is this you know what could be going on here you don't really know if it's the clothing you don't know if it's the shoes yet but immediately right here it grabs the attention of the right audience the location you know looks like it's in the city area about to go for a run okay about to go for a run he looks athletic in the sense of you know that kind of builds more contextual sense of the scene comfort that moves okay so this is ad that pertains to something with maybe running fitness yeah and then the camera movement as well keeps you kind of really like not doesn't lock you in but the camera movement right there made it interesting enough to where you want to stop okay now we are clearly articulating the features of the product okay so essentially right here you show the product and use all right half of y'all aren't even showing y'all product and use and complaining about bad results okay show your product and use this just helps increase that believability in the product itself okay comfort that moves all right i'm going to show the product off okay boom cool okay it really got me at my attention now okay i'm hooked in i'm starting to understand and build some contextual sense into this product of what it is i i just just got demonstrated it looks good looks cool all right i'm hooked in now i'm really into this now now clearly articulating the features to the consumer here my favorite way close-ups of the details okay athletic design and showing him you know tying up the the pants um zipping up the pants like this okay and i'm kind of dragging this through showing off more close-ups and details of the um the jacket here okay zipped cuffs it's showing off the specific features and stuff like this and this is increasing the perceived value to the consumer okay it's showing everything off it's showing off all this cool stuff you get by purchasing this pair of pants or and jacket it should all the cool labeling and things like that okay and then again continuing to show and create trust and believability in the product by showing it off and demoing the product this is just simply a demo product demo of the product premium on the go cool and then just further showing it off and then you know it ends um i think this is a longer ad itself but i got served the instagram story version so but that's just a really easy way to hook people in show off the features the only thing they're missing was i i would have added in a towards the end a little black slide that slides over and then it shows like a few customer testimonials and then another slide over to like you know buy yours today we're having a sale or just buy yours today essentially so that's all they're missing in that particular creative right there because then i would have been like oh wow clearly hooked people in educated them on the product showed off the product showed off the features things like that plus 20 000 other customers loved it and you could get yours today so let's go further into this specific creative template that you guys can leverage all you guys can leverage that one particular ad right there could have been shot with an iphone easily could have been shot with an iphone a video or a video editor on upwork or something like that could have edited for you essentially and yeah like a very like 100 bucks and then maybe pay the guy 50 bucks or not pay the guy bring the guy for lunch you know and pay him for his 30 minutes of time or hour of time essentially so let's go into features first so features what you want to do is list all your features of your product okay you know zip up pants cool logo on the side like list all those features right there okay and then what you want to do is you want to turn those into benefits so what what features also act as a benefit and the reason why my mentor he actually kind of basically told me this it's just it's easier because like actually what your benefits are of your product you may have a hard time but features you can list a lot okay so how can we go from features to benefits so that's basically we do right here so go back to the ipod you know years ago particular ad where it's like you know hey i'm apple have a two gigabyte ipod and someone was like no you have 16 000 songs in your pocket so what we basically did was is we took a feature we turned to benefit what does it mean for the customer to purchase this product why does that feature matter to the customer it's very important right there so that's features this aspect right here and again you can you can articulate a few of them to the consumer me personally i like close-up shots and things like that now social proof big one right here there's three types of social proofs that we like to leverage there's your standard testimonial hey i love this product it's so great there's authority figure endorsement so and some of these that look i'm made up in the sense but authority figure endorsement so let's say for example i was browsing a line and i saw a protein and it had i think it was shack shack was holding the protein it was like trusted by shack or or um you know used by shack and essentially what you're doing is you're tying in that authority figure to the product or it's like oh wow that high level person that i respect he also uses this product that i'm looking at so you increase that that authority and that you know social proof aspect and then another way is trusted by 10 000 plus customers or 10 000 plus happy customers choose apple you know whatever um so you're just showing off your customer base in the sense of this how many people choose this so this is another really great way and again these three different ways of social proof i don't recommend you using all three in an ad because it kind of gets over compelling um lately for me less has been more so i like to try to make like some very specific statements and leverage that ad um so like i'll choose one of these and go from there because like some of y'all don't have authority figure endorsements some of y'all are still trying to get off the ground like if you have five customers and four of them are your family members like i wouldn't want to be trusted by five customers now if i had a few thousand customers i would want to show that off now okay cool then i'm left with a testimonial well a testimony could be really easy i could just get one of my friends to pick up the product use it and then be like hey i really love this product here's why and then i'll have a written testimonial or again all of these can be written or a video so the way you'd portray that in a creative aspect is um like for one of our clients it's an app we have just this cool like little background and then we put like the written testimonial on it for another client we had a you know like a ugc face to camera review of the product itself so what we did was is we basically just incorporated that in the ad so it goes like hook features and then that person talking about how great the product is so there's a few different ways you can illustrate that in that perspective right there now what all goes into a creative specifically like what's all the planning and stuff like that you got to look into so first off you need to know who you're talking to who is your ideal persona like what's the persona that we're making this creative for you have to understand that okay that persona from that video we just watched was a male likely in his 20 to 40 year old 20 40 year old males usa who like to work out or into fitness specifically so okay cool um take it a step further that was also 20 to 40 year old males who like to work out but specifically run they didn't lift weights because i was more of a guy that ran versus lifting weights so you can do the exact same thing but for lifting weights the exact same thing for crossfit yada yada yada so get clear who are we making this this creative far okay now what location are locations will this particular product be in use so if we're going more from that running perspective right there of that one particular person you know from that creative beginning okay cool where do guys go run they go around the country they go run in a city if they're in a city city people may have more money in that sense so let's shoot it in the city okay is there any other locations we need to put off well maybe if this this stuff was designed to go from like a run to on a date with a girl and look dressed and professional in that particular gear then you can do like from running to a date and have like you know scenery of like a uh you know a date and everything so next thing actors you need to know who you need like so many people mess this up because they're portraying the wrong people in the creative like we've seen creatives improve in performance just by simply swapping out the person yeah that's it so there's three different types of actors that you may need for your creative so your first thing is your the people um people your ideal character want to be so let's say for example overweight and everything and i want to be a guy with abs and ripped get all the girls all that fun stuff yada yada yada then i want to create you know chad thunder chad or something like that that's ideal character and this dude is ripped talking on ads and portraying that epic lifestyle okay so who does your ideal character want to be okay so that's one type of actor the second type of actor is people who look exactly like your ideal character so let's say i'm overweight on the couch i'm very lazy and stuff like that then and i want to sell a course to these people and who are very lazy then i'm gonna get a guy that's really lazy who makes a lot of money um and this is portraying it is portraying uh portray of how easy it's to make money while he's overweight as well lazy on the couch so it's such a bad example such a bad example but yeah you get the point right there okay so it's just they look exactly like your ideal character and basically the reason why it works and why it's effective is because people want to like hey look i just found this really cool product and i think you can enjoy it too and they're like oh that guy looks just like me if he's enjoying it i can enjoy it too so get that right there now the last one this is one most people do not talk about but i find that works super well people who your ideal character is attracted to okay so two great examples one um i'm gonna do it from a male perspective and a female perspective okay first one um i think it's ridge wallets specifically uh they have one particular creative that i got hit with and actually i saved it and stuff like that and these are wallets for men okay and it literally has the wallet in a girl's back pocket and she's wearing some tight jeans um and she looked good guys i'm sure you're getting to the point now and she's like hey guys and it pulls it out and the camera goes up to her face like the camera's positioned on her her rear side and then she pulls it out and then she starts talking to the camera okay so guys find her attractive they find other parts of her attractive they stop they watch the ad and like oh my god i want that too okay so people who your ideal character is attracted to now from a female perspective i got a great one for you guys for you girls as well watch the channel there's a company called redline steel and their ideal character like their ideal customer persona is a woman 30 plus more on the conservative side religious very like homey things like that okay so think about a woman 30 plus usa fit in that perspective right there more in the rural areas country yada yada yada so redline steel the main person that does all the creatives is a i think it's like 35 40 years old guy who's you know tall kind of built up a little bit and he wears very sudden clothes he also too you know talks in this very charming southern accent and all of his ads um and look he looks good he's a good looking guy and everything so from the female perspective they're seeing that like oh my god like i see the comments are drooling over this guy so his ads are naturally converting way better because he just has the right character that grabs people's attention you know attraction is a very powerful thing so if you can get someone that like really grabs your attention of your ideal audience that quickly like that's a very powerful move right there so i would find honestly like this this one right here one and three are the most powerful ones um people who look exactly like your ideal character i see it convert but i see these two convert better over a period of time okay so just something to look at so once you get your characters down you get your locations down you got who you're targeting this persona for you need us to understand how do you articulate these features of uh to the people essentially how can we articulate to people the features of this product okay so and that first thing we just watched essentially we saw this you know guy running and then showed a close-up of him zipping the pants tying the pants close-ups of the features and everything like that and that's easy that's simple we're also articulating the features of the product how it's really it's comfort that moves by showing a guy running and using the product okay so you just need to ask yourself like that was some very simple things so do not overthink this okay how can we demo the product what things do we need to capture about the product it's all different things you need to look at now the last one is three to four different intros hooks i recommend kind of planning a few different hooks in terms of like headlines before and then also to maybe just three to four different scenes we want for the intro just so that way if they are different from the main video uh we can make sure we film those separately so for that one right there was a guy stretching maybe we could have had another intro where he was already running maybe another intro where he's like hey guys i want to show you this yada yada yada and then maybe another one could be him at home putting the pants on and everything like that then walking out of his house and start running down the road so like that's another one right there so three different intros then lastly that particular ad right there did not have any talking or anything like that but if you do need characters to talk or your your models to talk your actors you do need to provide a script and get that script ready and prepped and stuff like that so honestly that ad right there which is the music most people don't sit down and listen to an ad anymore they just like seeing visuals with text on the screen that right there if you can master that you'll be good you'll be set you don't really need to worry about too much about a script um a lot of times we'll use a script so we're getting some ugc content done and things like that and we'll just give them a few talking points but we don't give them a word for word script they take a very very time consuming and they cost a lot of money if you hire a writer so just something got to think about like that so how do we actually test these creatives so we obviously a lot just went into the actual planning of our creative our hook our features social proof call to action all that good stuff how do we actually start to test these so the reason why i say three to four different intros is because the three the intro is composed of two things there's the scene so and the headline so like again that first text on the screen for that ad we just looked that was comfort that moves okay so we can have that comfort that moves over him stretching over him at home getting ready to go for a run and then him already running okay so that's three different scenes right there one of those will convert a lot better than the others just gonna take that now now the headline that's the comfort that moves okay so maybe instead of comfort that moves you know introducing new running pants running pants that work with you running pants that and these are horrible headlines please don't do this um 60 of runners are missing this one thing okay so different headlines over different scenes will also play a different role of grabbing people's attention so you have to understand that so we'll test this is just three different hooks against like we like to look at the video as all like blocks like lego blocks plug them together okay so we'll take this video we'll chop off the first intro the intro which can be anywhere from three seconds to ten seconds long okay and then the other half features social proof call action will leave all the same and we'll test like 10 different intros against it okay and again we'll match these together we'll try three scenes three headlines that creates that basically creates nine different variations right there one scene three headlines scene two three headlines scene three three headlines it's nine different videos that will be rendering all with the same other half and the reason why is because the hook is one of the most powerful parts of the um kind of like the creative essentially grabbing people's attention getting them hooked and make them watch the video essentially this job is to simply educate people we're hooking people in then we want to educate people pay people in the product i find that educating people in the product is not nearly as hard as hooking them and grabbing their attention because you have to really understand what how these people think and operate in that perspective okay so once you actually find your golden formula you know you found your your winning hook maybe you test two or three variations of features and two three variations of social proof and you found your golden formula your golden message essentially now your objective now as you scale and grow the account it's not to go sit there and find new winning hooks and headlines it's to show off more locations you know this guy was running essentially outside maybe show a guy running on a treadmill and going to the gym maybe show another guy does crossfit maybe show a girl that's doing yoga like show off variety in the market that's going to appeal to more people in the market show off different ethnicities as well it's a big one in advertising show off a lot of different ethnicities and people and things like that it's also going to show off you know the culture and anything like that if your business and then just a general theme so i'm just going to show you all one example right here this is like six minutes of the nike uh find your greatness commercial and you'll notice like i'm not going to play this whole thing because running out of time here but you'll notice it's the same messaging over over and over and over it's just in different languages different ethnicities of people in different sports but it's the same thing over and over and over because they found their winning formula in the sense of what that message they want to amplify you know marketing comes down to message amplification what message do we want to amplify to people and how do we appeal to those people in that perspective right there so once you find your golden formula you can apply it to that so this takes a long time but it's like finding greatness okay got kid running now kid playing baseball um and i think it does the same thing it's just definitely the message that amplifies that don't matter who we are it doesn't matter you know our conditions and stuff like that that we all can find our own great unique greatness in that sense right there so it's pretty cool showing a girl boxing now so long story short it just keeps going through this it's showing variety of different people nike finding greatness nike finding greatness nike finding greatness but you see what happens is is that if you watch this kid 10 times right here you obviously wouldn't have that same effect anymore so you show off other people as this campaign's running doing cool stuff because it keeps things interesting and it keeps that fatigue down so just new ways to repaint the face of that particular message so hopefully this video is valuable um i've gotten to really high high level topics in here so hopefully this affects your um your creative wise and you know it just it kind of takes me a second to step back and like hey i don't need to reinvent the wheel every time with the messaging and stuff like that messaging can go on for a few months it's all about um the the creative aspect of keeping that creative fresh in terms of different visuals and stuff like that that helps out the pro-life prolonged life of the campaign which ultimately the days and help out your performance your results and anything like that so if you want to learn how to actually test these creatives once you actually start building them
