to book call for me and my team below if you're interested in that that being said make sure the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday now guys let's dive into the video so my eight million dollar black friday let's go over this really quick i'll show you guys a few things i know this is not like the most amazing proof it's just internal tracking that we use right here we did this across 10 different brands for perspective the top numbers right here is the actual numbers we did bottom numbers right here is the goal revenue in numbers for that month and that perspective right there so you can see that for each one of our clients in that perspective right there so spin or revenue spin roas what the goal was revenue spin roas what the goal was you know revenue spin roas was the goal all of them are the same except this one right here this is spin leads cost per lead and then spin leads and cost per lead interesting thing about this client right here is that we actually had the best cpa of the month because we realized cpl that means nothing at all for this brand and cpa is ultimately what makes the main decision at the end of the day and we had higher cpls but our cpa dropped by like 20 to 30 percent because we were producing better quality leads and we'll give that another video so yeah so we had an absolutely amazing month uh you know this client right here did 3.3 million dollars i've already made a case study on that already um you later see it before this video or after this video 3 million dollars in 30 days so yeah so a really cool month just like every black friday that we've done this is my fourth black friday now we did and every black friday we have some clients that absolutely destroy in terms of hitting crazy numbers and then we have some clients that just destroy in terms of hitting not so great numbers and you can see right here just a few clients like this client right here you know where you know we really we didn't completely hit the goal or this client right here um so there was a few clients that just didn't really see the performance they wanted and you know there's learning lessons from that there so here's also some other screenshots in terms of triple well just give you guys a little bit better um this is from all of our top accounts in our perspective right there uh this is that account that did 3.3 million count the 300 000 0.2 million um 200 000 right here uh some facebook ad screenshots for you guys some ad manager screenshots account that we spent 326 000 on this account that we spent 906 000 so that 3.3 million dollars you can see guys we were literally spending 30k a day a campaign and we were literally just doing one campaign per business objective right there this account right here is our legion account you can see right there we literally spent bulk of our budget in one campaign we actually moved uh we switched over campaigns and that's another story for another day but we had one campaign in the account and we just switched over to a new campaign so but yeah so i want to kind of go over over this and i'm just giving you guys like some lessons we learned some things that went wrong some things that we're going to improve on as a business and just be really real with you guys okay because that's what i love to be with you guys so we did 10 black fridays we did 8.3 million dollars in revenue you know overall with all the accounts put together you know and just also to add this up this legion client right here they did 2.5 million dollars off of that um 397 000 right there so just want to make sure i made that clear so that all came with 2.1 million dollars we spent in november cumulative between all accounts um when average bro as of 3.95 this means nothing right here because we had some accounts that were happy with a 2x we had some accounts that were happy with a 5x so this average rust means nothing because it's not the metric to look at because it's irrelevant because every business is different again some accounts happy with 2x that's all they want some accounts want a 5x every business is built different and because of that looking at an average robust goal like this it doesn't tell the whole story but hey you know there's some of y'all fucks i like to see that so there you go but i just want to show you tell y'all how meaningless it is all right so first thing we want to look at is client goals every client had a different goal this black friday that's one thing we noticed some accounts they wanted to accumulate as many customers as possible on discount so the cool thing about black friday if you have a really good returning customer rate black friday can be discount customers okay what i mean by discount customers is you can acquire a fuckload of customers at a cheaper rate so your cpa might be normally 30 bucks so i'm able to get them for 20 bucks or 10 bucks okay so it's a great time to acquire a lot of customers now some businesses do not need to be profitable on day one customers okay so say for example apple you know they might spend a thousand dollars for me to go purchase a thousand dollar iphone but i have a ten thousand dollar ltv with them so day one they're not profitable but over the next few years i spend nine thousand dollars more of them and all of a sudden they're way more profitable off of me so some businesses can afford to lose money on day one purchases and that's totally okay there's nothing wrong with that business okay and that's actually the smartest way to build a business then there's profit as much as possible from returning customers okay so we had one account for example where you know they kind of came off a bad month in october and you know they just had a really bad product launch just completely failed and they really needed to make as much profit as possible just kind of stash cash in the bank it's not cash in the bank so what we did was we spent very very little on new customer acquisition okay and they did like a 10 to 20 extra roas over bfcm weekend like we literally spent like a thousand bucks and they had like 20 30 thousand dollars in sales okay and we purely relied on customers they've already acquired to purchase from and we just spent money on existing customers klavio sms and a little bit of facebook ads to get existing customers to purchase again from them that's it so there's different objectives based off where your business is at and due to where your business is at that's what's going to make the ultimate call um call of how you're going to approach black friday and then obviously we had a few of our clients that were just happy mix between both hey nick i really want to hit new customer acquisition really hard but i also still want a decent amount of profits at the end of the day because my business ain't built yet to where i can afford to lose money on day one so it just depends it depends on the client situation and we we accustomed to the client situation now i want to go over last minute issues so now that you kind of we kind of went over goals i'll start off with kind of the red first like what went wrong okay we had a few last minute issues that happened as we launched bfcm okay we had one account that obviously we're scaling very aggressively on it where literally they were paying their amex bill like they were consistently paying their amex bill and then also amex was like hey you're spending way too much for canceling your card and due to that it slowed down our progress a lot because then they had to figure out another way to get funding for their ad spend we had another account where literally when we launched our vip day where like early access 24 7 early access their like add to cart wasn't working properly to where literally they had a 50 drop in the conversion rate like they convert normally a three percent they were doing like a 1.5 so they they lost not didn't lose money but they just didn't make the money they wanted in that day one early vip list access we had another account where literally they changed the payment method like i messaged facebook we got everything approved they had approval for 30k a day ad spend limits then they go in their ad account after this has happened and changed the primary payment method and when they changed it facebook limited and back down to 10k a day so and then it took him facebook like three days to raise it after that so that's a few last minute issues we had another account where they decided to launch their other stores in terms of you know i have a few accounts now where we have like three stores under one domain because each store is a different language and currency same products same everything same branding yada yada yada it literally just copy and paste the store with different language and different copy that's it and we have one account that literally launched those new stores the day before bfcm and none of their tracking was put together properly so we blew some money on like you know a few countries that we just didn't have any data back on what was being generated we had another account that literally their checkout broke and didn't realize until cyber monday so they went three days where a bad checkout we thought it was to offer at first and then turns out as their checkout they it was something to do with the um using a different checkout and the linking of another checkout software using um i forget what it's called like those long codes and stuff like that broke on shopify so we're like literally only paypal worked for shopify for the whole weekend so there was a few last minute issues that happened this black friday and not everything went as planned obviously we had some accounts that just didn't perform and due to that like why does accounts didn't perform we just didn't have the content we needed so their ads just didn't perform why well the content they supplied us was shit and like even like we can do a lot with just with the content they give us but if we need a someone doing a very specific action with your product and you give us a picture that's completely irrelevant to that i can't make that happen you know with a video editor like i need you to go film this content and some accounts just purely should not perform even when we had the right content same everything um the offer yada yada yada that product just wasn't hot this year for example and that's completely normal like i said this is our fourth black friday we've had some accounts and every black friday we have some accounts do absolutely amazing some accounts that just do good like there's a lot of accounts that do good right in the middle and then some accounts like there's if accounts can do amazing accounts can go bad it's polar opposites okay and then we had some accounts that did you know not so great okay and that's just reality of what bfc is but hey there was some wins i just want to be completely honest with you guys and transparent you guys what went wrong first and what was bad and then i want to talk about the wins what worked well what was amazing so we've had our third client ever this is our third client now that we've helped hit seven figures in a month that's a three million dollar client that's our third client now that we've helped to help scale to seven figures a month we've had another client that we've helped already scale seven to seven figures a month break another seven figure month which is really amazing and then we've had uh one client that's been chasing 300k a month and we helped them scale from that like we literally start with this brand in 2021 they were doing 15k a month and now they're crushing 300k months which is amazing so that's really good so yeah so it was some really amazing amazing wins in terms of like for the agency on that side right there and wood worked well so what did we notice after running ads all weekend and you know just drop them off and stuff like that broad beat retargeting by far all of our accounts broad targeting beat retargeting so i'm already super super pro broad targeting and do it for all of our accounts but only for bfc i was like hey let's do just one retargeting ad set of like seven or you know a 30 day window okay and broad beat the fuck out of that retargeting ad set every account so we will not be doing any retargeting for any sales events the rest of the year um we already don't do any retargeting at all but the only time i was pro retargeting when i'm doing a sales event and i want to prioritize certain people but hey broad still outbeating that so we will be focusing more on that the creatives that worked the best was a mix of old content with bfcm banners plus new bfcm dedicated creatives what do i mean by this go take your top performing evergreen ads add a black friday cyber monday banner on it with the offer and that's it as well as a few dedicated creatives that were shot specifically for black friday cyber monday okay new completely new content and then lastly copy that worked the best was straight to the point so you're dealing with bfcm you're dealing with a you know a aware market demographic that means you literally don't need to educate the consumer anymore on the problem you solve solution product etc you literally just need to tell people hey bfcm sell save 30 off site wide and the accounts that were very straightforward to direct in the copy perform much better than the ones that were like hey here's all of our product info blah blah oh by the way we're on black friday cyber monday sale so that's what worked well on that perspective right there our vip list strategy crushed on all accounts and if you want to know what that strategy is go look up this video on my channel number one strategy for black friday 2022 i actually presented this as at a mastermind in miami recently this year and i've actually gotten tons of screenshots from that mastermind of people just destroying and dominating this black friday due to that which blows my mind i love being able to create impact like that and helping more people so that's that's my goal help as many stores as possible scale second thing is that all of our accounts that launched black friday before you know like the monday at the latest or at the earliest so the monday before black friday if they launched a black friday event before that they didn't see the performance they wanted before that monday okay so we had a few accounts that launched early and honestly it just didn't see the performance and then they they scaled back up on bfcm weekend so we will for a fact not be running a single black friday campaign early again i already don't recommend it but we had a few accounts that refused to listen to me and guess what they saw not the greatest performance so the earliest possible time that i've seen statistical improvements and performance is the monday before bfcm so black there's friday then the monday before friday that's the earliest possible and you can call it black week that perspective right there next one is doubling budget throughout the weekend of actually managing to spend and everything like that we were doubling budgets two to three times a day depending on performance or scaling back by 20 a couple times a day and we leveraged a google sheet like this so this is just one of the accounts that we were running and basically at 8 a.m we would check everything we look at spend and revenue and we can see okay hey we're not at the target robust we need let's just let things coast or actually let's drop facebook perform by 20 then we look at it again a couple hours later hey we're still not there let's drop by 20 hey you know let's say for example we need a three hey we're still not there let's drop facebook by 20 hey eight o'clock hey we're there but it's eight o'clock at night we're just gonna let it coast boom boom boom now some accounts we were at like a like for example we need a 3x and we're at 4x at 8 a.m so we would just double facebook budget boom from a thousand to two thousand dollars a day 12 p.m hey we're still like a 4x let's double facebook again from two thousand to four thousand 4 p.m hey we're like a 3.7 hey let's just increase by 20 we're at eight o'clock we're at a 3.5 hey let's just increase by 20 then 12 a.m we end the day at spending like two to three times more than we originally planned and we're making the most of everything so that's how we were doing a lot of budget adjustments and look i'm honestly gonna say it was very you know guerrilla warfare out there there was no perfect science it was just a high understanding of how facebook works and being having a set of balls to basically go ahead and say hey look we just got to spend i'm gonna do whatever it takes i'm not worried about oh well if i do more than 20 percent then uh it's gonna break the algorithm i'm not gonna get any sales anymore no f**k that i'm gonna go in there i'm gonna spend as much as possibly as i can with a level of understanding of how facebook works and also a level of just knowing what rules i can break and bfcm all rules are off the counter basically okay so i was just going in there and i wanted to spend as much as possible and i needed to consistently keep an eye on overall performance that i'm shooting for so the client told me a 4x all right cool i'm gonna spend as much as possible as long as we end the day at a 4x or maybe some accounts hey spend as much as possible as long as you're in the day at 3x so this account still ended the day as 3x right here we spent you know 9700 on facebook and honestly i don't even know what the the we had set for that day i think it was like maybe four or no it had to be a little bit more i would say probably like 6,000 7,000 i was set for the day and we spent almost 10 grand so but yeah so that's those budget adjustments other than that what else worked really well for us was leaving evergreen on like we left all of our evergreen campaigns on there was a lot of comments on all my black friday videos well nick do you turn off evergreen campaigns do you turn off you know all the prospecting campaigns before launching the black friday campaigns no i leave that s**t on because there was a couple accounts where the evergreen worked better and the reason for that is because black friday when you're running black friday ads facebook compartmentalizes your black friday ads with all the other black friday ads and cpms can rise significantly so we're like we're paying like 100 200 per seat or like cpms for black friday but our conversion rate was through the roof so sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing but due to leaving the evergreens on it also gave us a secondary layer of defense in our account to where black friday campaigns weren't working well our evergreen campaigns were working well we're pushing the f**k out of those but yeah so that was pretty much it that was our eight million dollar black friday and i really hope you guys enjoyed this video um i hope you guys enjoyed the transparency of like what went right what went wrong what worked well for us um we had a really blank like blast at the time we started preparing september 1st of 2022 that's when we started preparing for black friday okay so next year um there's definitely a few tweaks we'll be making um for the budget adjustments we're gonna do it three times a day instead of four times a day um that's one thing second thing is all these issues you solve could have been prevented by just doing a quick 30 second recheck of the website before launching so like the checkout that was broken like we could have easily fixed that by just going to a sample purchase or the add to cart that was broken we could have just gone to a simple add to cart check before the site was launched so you know and some of this was more on the client side than us but it's again it's easy things that you know we're on a profit share of all of our clients okay because our goal is help you scale to seven figures a month and us take a percentage of that profit and because of that that's why we only work with 10 clients at most okay so because of that it not only affected the clients profits but also affected us making more money in that perspective right there and our goal is to help our clients make as much money as possible because we're incentivized to make them as much money as possible so you know it's little things like this that we're gonna apply to next year and that's also why i'm creating this video because i'm gonna re-watch this video next year and be like all right nick this is what 2022 version of you was thinking and you know you should definitely keep this in count when you're looking at 2023 ad campaigns so um but yeah i hope this guys hope this helped um i'm very curious of your bfcm like wins like i really want to know what you did for bfcm so drop your wins in the comments like fucking blow up the comments with your wins from black friday cyber monday because i would love to hear them you know spread some good some positivity of good numbers and stuff like that drop some wins but also drop some of your failures because you learn from your failures a failure is when you you basically have that failure and you don't learn from it and you make the same mistake over and over that's a failure but a failure can be a blessing in the skies if you take that failure and use it to improve your business improve your system so again these little failures and losers we're gonna apply to our business to make a better business next year so hope those guys help you all out again create all this content completely for free which guys with the intentions of helping you scale your business and if you want
