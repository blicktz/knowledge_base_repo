All right so today we'll be talking about post-purchase upsells. I've had a few questions from students on one-on-ones on what I'm currently doing for post-purchase upsells. So today we kind of kind of dive into post-purchase upsells, a little bit of the psychology and kind of the strategy around post-purchase upsells and then we'll actually go inside of a Shopify account and show you all how I'm setting up post-purchase upsells for clients.

So currently right now for post-purchase upsells what we essentially have right here is a customer will go to the product page they will you know add something to the cart and then they'll go initiate a checkout and then they will get what's called the you know the purse post purchase upsell right so this happens after they check out all right now what essentially a lot of people get wrong is that he essentially go for a quantity post purchase upsell where it would just be like here's five to six more things of the things you already you already bought and we do not want to do quantity right unless you're selling something like energy drinks you're selling something like cases of water you're selling things that like the quantity makes sense some of you guys are selling things that just quantity just does not make sense at all so what I like to go and do for post purchase upsells is first look at the desire we're we're solving for so like for example inside of this this particular client the desire we're you know solving for is for couples who want to reignite their relationship they basically feel bored and we simply want to offer them something that reignites love basically so for here with an upsell we simply want to just offer them a lot of love love basically so for here with an upsell we simply want to just offer them more ways to satisfy that that particular desire right there and that's terrible that's all we want to do we want to offer more ways so they purchase one way now here's another way and then here's another way just extra things that are all different things to satisfy that particular desire right there and what we'll like to do for our upsell strategy is let's say they go and purchase a $30 product then they go to the first what's called upsell upsell I always like to offer a product for 2x product price right here so for here if they purchase a $30 product they're gonna get a $60 upsell now the next one we have was called a downsell and in some cases the downsell will be something where if the upsell is declined but then other cases the downsell will go ahead and be just another product at what I call 50% pp product price so if they purchase a $30 product they get upsold a $60 product and in some cases they'll be go to a downsell for a $15 product if they decline and in some cases they'll still go to the $15 product if they accept the upsell so for example why would they do why would they go upsell then downsell or why would they just go upsell and then straight to complete checkout it really just kind of depends on how you have things set up so like for example in my case someone might buy my ebook right and then I push them to the inner circle which you know you get one-on-one calls with me you get group calls you get a course and you get all of these amazing benefits right so a downsell and this specific case is where I go ahead and let's actually do it like this boom boom yes no so if they if they go yes then cool they just go straight to you straight to you know summary basically right and then for the inner circle if they say no then I could do just do like this let's we can do just course where I basically at this particular stage right here I strip value so I strip value from this and then I basically give them the same thing but less value so this will be you know 1k a month whereas the course would just be like a flat you know 1k right so this will be you know 1k a month you just get the course lifetime access for a thousand dollars now if they say yes your inner circle I could send them to the summary or I could even send them to like a completely another upsell which you know maybe I do instead of like a thousand dollars a month for the inner circle I could increase the value so add a so add more value because hey they just said yes to a thousand dollars a month likely they have money so maybe they said yes to that what I want to look at is how can I increase and help them satisfy that desire with more right so they bought the ebook for ads scaling just say add scale now and set up an ebook what about we work together one-on-one now hey you get me for a thousand dollars a month but maybe you want even more my time here's a 5k month offer for one times 60 minute one-on-one per week right so instead of a thousand dollars a month in inner circle now you also get 5k a month or you also get 5k a month with me one-on-one per week for 60 minutes right and then from here both of these would just end up to the summary so the key thing to understand here with these post purchase upsells is that right after they add to cart they initiate checkout then we go to the post purchase upsell the thing you want to do is you want to offer them more things that will make failure impossible for what they desire that's the big thing you want to look at so if someone desires to you know scale their facebook ads they purchase my ebook here's option number one which is my inner circle get one-on-one group chat course it's a thousand dollars a month it's going to substantially speed up your process for scaling facebook ads um if they decline that then i simply just want to strip value from that first offer to where okay now instead of getting the one-on-one in the group calls you just get the course by itself and that's it now if they say yes to that then give them another upsell because they're credit card happy they're spending happy cool so how can i further help you scale your facebook ads beyond the inner circle well one of the downsides in inner circle is you only get one 30 minute call a month so what if we did one one hour call a week you also give me access to your ad account i just charge you 5k a month for consulting um and now you get like me inside your team your account all that good stuff right there um and then i give them another upsell now there's no real limit like i could offer them another upsell another upsell another upsell after uh but the general rule of thumb is you do uh basically two to three three upsells or downsells total um so you can notice right here that there's option number one option number two and then option number three so there's three total of a mix between downsells and upsells right there um and then basically from there it just sends them to the summary which the summary is just basically their receipt that they get um and then they're done now the whole goal with post-purchase upsells and stuff is helping us solve the bottleneck for aov right so again if we go back to cost per click aov or um cvr and then aov boom boom boom boom you already might be testing a ton of ads right now and you're still not profitable and like you're getting a good cost per click so testing more ads just doesn't make sense maybe you're testing a ton of ads right now and you're getting a good cost per click so testing more ads right now and then you're testing a bunch of landing pages and things like that and you just can't improve it and you're just kind of stuck boom well us going to take another action around these two things it's just not going to improve things um a lot of the times when i hop on calls with y'all no one ever does anything for aov so if aov becomes the thing that you haven't put any action on here's where we want to go in and start um which is the post-purchase upsells um i really like going ahead and doing bundles on on the product page um etc that can be a whole nother call right there so like for me for example for my ebook you know it's a 29 book for this book we were getting a 40 cpa so that means i'm losing 10 every time someone buys my ebook so what did i do i did a ppu a post-purchase upsell and guess what now i'm at like a 5x roass on this because i do a post-purchase upsell and then i also upsell people into inner circle and have an email flow that additionally if they decline the immediate post-purchase upsell i have an email flow that also additionally upsells them to these things so originally i was at a 0.9 now i'm on a 5x just simply due to the fact that i added in some post-purchase upsells and everything that's a lot easier to solve than trying to squeeze oh hey how do i cut this down a little bit more let me go test 50 more landing pages let me go test 50 more creatives my objective here is to solve for the bottlenecks as quick as possible to improve performance so look let's actually dive into the account now and actually go through and actually set this up uh kind of go through everything so um first things first i like after sell by rocket or rocked whatever you want to call it right there um that's the one that i'm currently using right now for clients and um you know we have this one particular client right here that we just set up a post-purchase upsell um unfortunately this post-purchase upsell is not working well we only have a 7% take rate and i want to understand why we only had a 7% uh take rate so essentially what i did we did a survey and everything and this is a digital download for 50 questions asked before marriage and due to that i was like okay hey um if this is before marriage and let's make sure and survey our customers to see where people are at i kid you not over 60 percent of people buying this product that we're selling right now are already married people so this upsell just did not make sense at all because of the fact that hey these are already married people so it had a low take rate so you have to understand that your post-purchase upsells need to continue to help people so what we understood was that um 60 percent of our audience are married people been in a relationship or been married for two plus years and they struggle with communication issues so what we're going to do here now is they're buying this first product we're going to help them better solve and satisfy that particular desire so if i go inside of this account i do notice that we do have another product called the let's let's get naked deck um and this is another product design to help get people couples closer and stuff like that and i noticed that only um 50 of people are purchasing this deck so that means about 50 of orders people are already purchasing it the other 50 of orders people are not purchasing it so i'm gonna go ahead in here and start building a new funnel um i'm just gonna call this people who didn't purchase the let's get naked deck boom i'm gonna start from scratch i'm gonna save and continue inside of here i'm gonna do a product based trigger i'm gonna so first select the product that they did buy which is the pillow talk deck because again that's the main product of striving revenue and stuff um and then i'm going to go ahead and skip this funnel if they purchase this uh let's get naked deck so we're gonna offer this product at a substantially lower price than what it's already marked up as so i don't want to offer someone the same product like this is not a quantity product you don't need five let's get naked decks it just simply doesn't make sense at all so if they purchase the main core products just the pillow called pillow talk deck neck uh deck and then if they purchase the let's get naked deck they won't even see this upsell now if they um if they didn't purchase this they will see this upsell which we're gonna go and set up now so it's pretty simple once you do this and it's kind of all nice and neat mapped out uh so i'm just gonna select the product i'm gonna select a specific product here and i'm just gonna select the let's get naked deck because that's our objective then i'm gonna click on edit offer i'm gonna go right here to the discount section it already has the default kind of like mark down price that we have this far i'm just gonna mark this down i'm i want to get it to like a solid uh save 50 so i'm just gonna come play with numbers here for a second i think it's like 25 so this discount is on top of whatever um you already have it down now i'm gonna click on the mobile view right here just because majority people are on mobile and this looks decent right here but we need to tweak this up a little bit the problem with upsells and downsells is that it has to be with simple products you cannot do complex products because you have one image so your image is going to drastically change things the uh title and all of this is going to drastically change things so you still have to sit there and be and put your marketer and copywriter brain on when doing this so i'm going to go right here to image show advanced image settings i'm going to click on this and i already have an image that i want to use which this one actually right here shows some of the cards so that way people can actually see some of the cards of of what they're going to get the questions asked now from here i'm going to go ahead and do product details and i'm just going to kind of click just before this product and i can type if i want right there um i want to say i can even delete this too as well let me just cut that i can delete this and just rename it whatever i want um i'm just going to leave it like this what i'm going to do right here is actually change uh the name real quick which is 100 questions let's see i'm going to open up this one new tab boom let me see just kind of strip this let me do do do do turn off that italized there we go we go in here just paste that in there we go let's get an active deck 100 question cards that finally give you the both excuse to talk about what you've been thinking about for years boom here we got the cards this looks a little bit better now now from here i can just simply hit save and then ship up close out of that and there we go so we have the first upsell set up now our now what we want to do is what happens when someone declines this upsell or accepts this upsell and then what times what happens if someone declines it now for me i'm going to literally offer the same thing for both of them just because i don't really have like um there's not many products in this store technically you have a couple of these different um what i would say like upsells or like digital downloads and stuff so i'm going to focus on these digital downloads first and we're going to go in here we're going to create offer single product uh specific product i really like their date night challenges i just think that's a really fun one right there for people to use and i'm also going to go right here single product i'm also due to date night challenges again because i don't really care in this case i don't really have a specific upsell or downsell in this case um if i was offering like a big product right here where it had like 10 different things then i would just simply strip it on the downsell right there cool now i'm just click save and next um i can customize the thank page if i want but i'm just going to click save and finish and there we go and i'm going to turn that one on and i'm actually going to turn this one off right here just because i simply don't need that one anymore now i do want to go ahead and do another upsell in this case right here save and continue we're going to do product based triggers this will be for the people that purchase both the pillow talk deck um and the let's get naked deck i'm going to do that one right there um and then i'm just going to click on save and next and i'm going to go ahead single product specific product i'm going to do the love coupons boom um and then if they decline that specific product i'm gonna do the date night challenge oh wait actually i want to change this we're going to do the opposite uh product selection change product specific product we're going to do the date night challenge boom so we know this one already works click save single product specific product i'll do the love coupons specific product um yeah we'll just do love coupons again cool save and next save and finish cool and then this one will just be um rename people who purchased both decks confirm save and next save and finish cool but yeah and that's pretty much how to do it um from here there's other split tests you can do on like these post purchase upsells and stuff um in terms of like you know you can tweak more of the product photos and stuff you can tweak more of these different down cells uh you can also do what's called like a b tests and stuff um inside of here which is also cool um look long story short just you want to make sure that you you go ahead and um um you've put some time and attention on these things like for me every seven days i like to launch a new post purchase upsell or downsell and i like to constantly keep tweaking it right here to improve just basically the efficiency of the business um and focusing on that overall aov lift right there uh to improve performance so hopefully this helped y'all out and if you have any questions just shoot a message to me in the group challenge telegram
