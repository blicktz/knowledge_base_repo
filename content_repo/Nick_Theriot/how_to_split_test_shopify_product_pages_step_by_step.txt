yo what's going on everyone welcome back to the channel today i'll be talking about how to split test shopify product pages and what's the best software to do the best way to go about it i pulled the training from my facebook ads course on exactly how to do this i'm gonna be giving you that training completely for free in today's video so that being said here's exactly the step-by-step process to split test shopify product pages inside of facebook and all those good things right there let's dive into the video okay it's the official tutorial for convert.com i get a lot of questions asked about this nick was the best way to test product pages split test pages and different experiences for consumers to see like hey what works best what is the best route for my product to be sold and there's a couple different routes well number one you can just create a new product page create a new ad inside the facebook ads manager and just see if it gets spin that's one way another way is to create a whole new campaign and force budget to it now downside of both of these ways is that facebook has no reason to spin on an ad that's fresh with no engagement when that same ads already being ran in the account so you know it just it makes no reason why facebook so facebook really won't spend much on the product page the second route is that you can create a new campaign to force spin to it now the problem with this is that creates auction overlap they can bid against each other facebook's going to prioritize still the one that already has spin and like crushing it and two maybe you'll do a lower spin to it but it doesn't allow you to see what works at scale so ultimately anything that deals with the facebook ad account we need to stay away with we do not want to touch the facebook ad account at all so how can we split test product pages from there well one way is on the shopify site is to simply just go ahead and edit the product page see how the next few days go and then you know see if that works better or not that's one way and that's the way i do recommend up until a point where it's like hey let's see if we can be a little bit better and also too maybe you want to try like product page versus a collection page and like where you drive traffic to that's also like something very difficult there because then you can't actually sort of edit domains so there's a lot of different things that to take into account and you know not to bore you guys but this is where convert.com helps with all of this and let me just show you guys what convert.com is it's probably one of the most powerful tools for split testing and yeah it's awesome so it works right into shopify and i'm gonna show you guys everything you need to do to set that up but convert.com is super powerful it's not the most affordable option so i'll tell you guys now as like literally sorting plans at 500 a month but think about like this let's say you're doing a hundred thousand dollars per month and you've doubled your conversion rate also then you're doing 200k a month off 499 a month there's a couple other you know see at least you could say like different price points i can mention but yeah this is super super powerful and i'm gonna show you guys a couple examples here on this tutorial so first things first couple things you guys need to do is number one you need to go set up a convert.com account second thing you need to do is you need to follow this first tutorial like basically i'm just going to leverage convert.com to show you exactly how to set up convert into shopify how they integrate together it's very easy just go to this page right here which is in below first thing you're going to do is create your own api keys and then create a revenue goal this is all stuff that's going to be done inside of convert fairly easy let's just go inside of here and just to show you what that looks like so that way just make sure that you guys understand it so right after you create your account you're going to want to go to account settings and then api keys and then here you're going to pull these you're going to just create a new api key enough of that what you want to do is go back and then you're going to go to projects just create a new project call it whatever and just put your main domain in here that you're going to drive traffic to and then after you create that project you're going to go to goals new goal and you're going to call this goal let's say you want to make sure it's a revenue goal and you want to make sure you call it shopify app revenue make sure manual tracking is on right here and then hit save goal okay i already did this so i'm not going to do it but you're going to do that and then you are going to click on this particular link right here which takes you right here and don't worry you're not going to use anything yet you can watch this three minute video and the streaming videos will show you what you'll be using this how to set it up with shopify so just it's fairly easy so after all of this is done now you can start using the convert tool and here we are inside of it now i'm just going to create a whole new experience i am just going to let's just go ahead and actually i just want to delete this this is paul's but archive experience okay each experience is basically exactly what it is what type of unique experience we want to create for our consumers so let's say for example here's our website we have this collection page right here and then we have this home page and maybe right now we're driving traffic to our home page let's put this home page versus collection page maybe we have an ad right now inside of our account and the home page is just crushing and forest right now or like that ad right there's going to charge you to spend and we're like ah i wish we would have drove it to the collection page well here you go now we can do that so what we're going to do is we're going to go to home page course collection let's put our main thing in and i want to do a split url this is probably going to be the most common because i can just create two product pages and it could go feed very different and i can drive traffic to one domain and it's going to automatically split it for me i don't really know on these others i haven't really tested these others so i'm just letting you though now but there is even things where it's like sections of your page at once you're going to like do like a little bit of css and like custom coding and stuff there's a couple of cool things you can do here but i'm just going to do split url for this tutorial as that's the one i know and the one i'm actually qualified to be teaching you guys on from here so this is our origin url so like this is like the ad url that's just crushing it for us right now and we're like i wish we could change it without losing engagement and all that good stuff so here we go so i'm just a new variation one boom i'm going to take it to the collection now i could do another variation if i want but i don't collect it i'm just going to do this one right here so it's just a true just a b we're not going to do a b c and we're not going to do a b c d okay now from here it pretty much just sets this up real quick it's kind of our flow so we have our home page audiences i'm not really sure what this is i guess you can kind of just basically change up like build audiences kind of based off the people that come to our page and stuff like that i'm just leaving this as is but i'm sure you can maybe do like a split between like i don't know maybe like yeah visitors coming from certain places so maybe we only want people that are coming from let's say like facebook let's see if there's facebook in here boom and that way i can actually put this in here so but i'm not going to worry about that right now just keep it as simple i'm just going to do all visitors and i want to do a 50 50 test that's it now i could do say see if i can edit this maybe if i want to do 100 to where all traffic goes original or maybe i want to do like a 60 40 something like that but i'm just going to do a 50 50. there we go all right we have our original and our variation our goals you know decrease balance rate increase engagement to be honest i just want to shopify app revenue that's all i want to know i just want to know are we making money that's my objective all right now let's just before i go ahead and hit this plus i just want to show you guys right now when we go into here both we go like we go to the home page we go to the home page all right this is the collection page cool now when i hit active on this all of a sudden now our traffic is being split 50 50 of all the traffic going to this domain is going to start going to collections so let's do a new incognito window boom let's see if i can open up a new one and it's 50 50 traffic based off ip address and i swear before i did this tutorial i did this and it actually worked correctly so it is working technically yes but i'm just i'm segmented in that other bucket like people going into the original home page so yeah so that's pretty much all you do if i can reset it reset experience i want to reset this experience because i do want to show you guys that i'm not full of like this actually works but yeah so that's pretty much all you do and then from here it will start going ahead and what i would say it'll start reporting full conversions like your cells and stuff all tested users like told my people that's came into here but yeah so that's pretty much we do this and then once you're done obviously like you don't want to just turn it off because what's going to happen is like then it's like everything's going to be like reset it but if you figure out that hey the variation works 10 times better driving traffic to the collection page then what's going to happen is we just basically can go in here we go summary and we can actually go edit this to like maybe like 100 in fact actually let's do that let's do 100 of traffic we'll go to the variation all right cool that's active so if i go to here it should actually do it let me see what's going on here okay so i figured out what it was there's just a cookies inside of chrome so like for example if i'm still using like the regular browser if i go to like the home page right here close there but if i go to new incognito window and i go here it takes me to the collection page as it should be shown like the tutorial shows and i even did force it all to the variation just to be sure but i can usually come back here and like hey maybe i want to change this back to like 50 for example i can do that let's see all right you get the point yeah that's basically doing i think i just messed this all up and stuff but that's just to show you guys also another key thing right here y'all can do is you go to stat settings you can also change a couple things like like how long you want this to run etc but yeah so just want to show this to you guys so you can use convert.com to test different product pages and stuff like that i will have more kind of like tutorials around this for you guys so this will just give you the general landscape of everything and then from there i'll do some more videos soon for you guys right now i just have to create a Shopify store and yeah so you'll see more about this coming soon but hopefully this helps you guys out so i kind of explain why we use this and why i recommend this versus anything else and hopefully this helps you guys out
