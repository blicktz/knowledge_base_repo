What's going on YouTube Nick here welcome back to The vlog heading right now to get a haircut today's video be different I actually filmed yes today's video kind of like yesterday a little bit So we're gonna have like a little time jump reversed in a little while to go back to yesterday because Yesterday ended up picking up some nice pair of headphones Now I'm gonna go get my haircut After my haircut probably do some work today and yeah Back to my haircut, and I would say she chopped me up pretty damn good. Yeah That's what's up About to crush some work now and Got a lot to work on I want to now start to take you guys back and Where does video starts at really and that is yesterday at Target? So let's jump into that clip now go again Totally irresponsible purchase but yeah major impulse purchase while at Target and That was purchasing a pair of Bose quiet comfort 35s and And yeah, so we're gonna go home now unbox these and Show you guys what's up About to open up the brand new Let me just show you guys what I got okay These are The Bose quiet comfort 35s These are some headphones I've been wanting forever I love my air pods so I feel like these fit in a complete different spectrum Air pods are all about quick ease of use and Be able to go anywhere whereas these these stay on your desk and you only use them when you're say trying to block out sound We're trying to get some of the deep focus work sessions at home Especially in the quarantine right now where you may have more family members at home And you really want to try to you know, it's more noise in the environment these cancel out a lot of noise I first heard about these from Lewis Macher Amy Sangster and Johnny Godfrey Back when I was in infinite prosperity in the all doing forex trading and stuff So it's amazing because I finally got a pair of these I've been one of these for two years now You know finally got a pair So let's bust open this real quick so that pretty much the slides off right there and here we go Pretty simple Very very light It's actually taking a look we get sure this is like your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack whatever This is your Maybe USB I'm not really sure what that is And then here you go here's your headphones As simple as that they are really freaking light that's the very first thing I notice is they're light as hell Wow That feels absolutely amazing it cuffs your ear perfectly Like it doesn't put any pressure on your ear lobes and Very very comfortable up here and there's nothing that touches your side right there and puts that added pressure on it so um Yeah, and just putting them on without even turning them on because assuming the battery is dead.

Let's see if we can turn them on So you actually have to download an app first as well download that Then boom and then you should be Good to go All right guys, so I just got the app download it charge them up for a few minutes now So let's actually see Um, I guess you just turn it Okay, cool So now tell me to try them on Now cool thing about them is when you place them flat down they go down like this So all you do is pick them up and you already have your left and your right on Holy shit Okay, so I think they just turned on like the noise cancelling because they just got a lot quieter Like I can barely hear myself and I'm like really talk louder now. Okay All right, so right now it's on the high noise cancellation, so let me just see if I can open up Spotify They sound super good. I can barely hear myself right now talking and it's probably at like a medium level of listening Let's try something like bass heavy very very clear very clear You get into it.

It's like I can barely hear myself right now talking and the noise cancellation is on high right now Wow, that is crazy Okay, I want to try to put the noise cancellation on off All right, wow that is crazy so like I can hear myself 50% myself right now now I can hear myself about 25% and when all this cancellation is on high Like I can barely I cannot hear myself right now talking I honestly can't give you my full impressions yet But just from the perfect perspective of what I just listened to and how much noise they canceled out It's exactly what I wanted in terms of actually showed you low a sound clip. Let me see if I can just come off They sound really good it's very clear I don't see any Particular level as terms of like your base being too overpowering It sounds really good. So I know some headphones are really bass heavy.

So if you want to really bass heavy headphones I don't think I would really recommend these But they're probably the best base they're way better than like air pods So I'm also coming from an air pods last year. So just try to keep that in mind, too So yeah guys overall I love these a lot just from the initial impressions and I may make a video later on Kind of like a little further review now also a quick update on actual terms of buying these and spending the money would I justify it? I think for your everyday listening Maybe you're a super big music enthusiast.

Yes, maybe if you want some really good noise cancellation headphones If you're traveling a lot yes, or from home Yes, I see these as an investment in my financial success because if I can access deeper levels of focus I get distracted at home. I can maximize my time and stuff while working at home So that's how I see it. These will be investment into my financial success I was gone most months Ben stopped calling to there was no one Family said that they were missing me Try not to let it get to me The sandals moving so quickly And I felt there was something I was missing All right, you guys hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

I know it's kind of quite different Just kind of doing an unboxing video of the bows quiet conference I didn't really vlog too much because I pretty much just stayed home all day work to edit and stuff So there's really nothing exciting to vlog Hopefully this weekend I can catch up on a few things And maybe produce more content for you all for monday or maybe even just simply do maybe Kind of like a sit down and go over a few things. There's a lot of stuff. I want to cover a business facebook guys as well So i'll try to figure out exactly what i'm gonna do But until then you guys stay safe and have a great day.
