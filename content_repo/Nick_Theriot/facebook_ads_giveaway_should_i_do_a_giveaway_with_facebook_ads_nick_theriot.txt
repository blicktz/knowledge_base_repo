yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Therrio and today I have an exciting new video for you guys today I'm gonna be answering the main question I get all the time and that is should I do a giveaway on my Facebook ads or say Instagram and I'm gonna explain that today whether you should do a giveaway or not and some pros and cons to it and some different routes you can go to actually increase the effectiveness if you decided to do a giveaway so that being said before we get started make sure the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday just like this one so let's get started guys okay so the question should I do a giveaway and you know exactly what should you do if you decide to do a giveaway first off if you know to do a giveaway or not really I guess there's two different routes you can go you need to determine first is do you want money from it or do you want followers for it because if you want a bunch of followers and likes and comments and stuff and you don't really care about the quality of people following you say on Instagram then a giveaway cool go for it but you're not really gonna get what you expect you see a lot of people that do giveaways say on like Instagram Facebook and they get a lot of people that follow them like their stuff comments on it and stuff because they want to insert a giveaway but they're coming to your brand with the pre-frame of I want to win something for free so if you're attracting a lot of people that are coming for something for free likely for them to convert later down the line it's gonna be a lot lower so you get a bunch of followers you get some likes and some comments and stuff you get you know a post go viral you you grow your brand through that but you grow your brand with a lower quality audience of people so that's that's the first thing you need to understand but there is a way to do a giveaway and make it more effective if we look at companies like diesel brothers they have shown that giveaways can be super super powerful with growing a business and they've probably done the one of the best jobs at doing a giveaway I've ever seen a brand do specifically to grow their business to multiple millions of dollars in terms of online sales and on top of that they have a tv show etc but they they really show off the effectiveness of doing a giveaway and how to do it properly and this is the same way I recommend all of my clients do it if they decide to do one first off if you want to do a giveaway train your audience to perform an action before they can enter so you know a low action or a low quality action is like a like comment or share that you know that provides a low quality low quality action it's an easy trend easy action for your audience to do to enter into a giveaway very easy but a higher quality action is a little bit of a purchase maybe enter in their email so enter in their email to where you can monetize that list or what we recommend is actually purchasing something so what diesel brothers did for example is they give away a truck you know hundred thousand dollar truck and you're like holy shit they gave away a truck yeah they gave away a truck and for people to enter is every time they made a purchase on the website they got raffle tickets and those raffle tickets were put into the you know the big pot so people were enticed to go purchase more on their website in order to get more tickets so I don't really need to explain this anymore I'm gonna go purchase say a $20 $30 item every month from this business to keep getting points put into the system for my you know increasing the chance of me winning this you know hundred thousand dollar truck so you're training people to perform actions in order to get a reward low low actions you know nothing big and if you do this properly you can actually benefit from a you know giveaway very very well they gave away a hundred thousand dollar truck they probably spent maybe 100 200 grand on on ads you're looking at what 300 grand 400 grand in investment into a giveaway that's probably generated them maybe three to four million dollars in revenue it's going viral and because it went viral what happens is you you track the ton more organic and you also get probably higher robust and stuff on your giveaway etc so how can you do this because I know not all of these people or everyone watching this channel right now is likely to want to give away a truck and you can still do this in different ways you know specifically with a giveaway there's a few different ways we like to do it so number one is a free gift for to purchase so hey we made a hundred of these limited edition shirts that are you know people love them and the first thousand orders thousand customers we're gonna toss a random shirt into each one of those thousand orders so people are enticed to wanting to purchase from your brand because they want to be one of those first 1000 orders to win this limited edition shirts and honestly you can also do it another route too is for the first 100 orders of this drop we're giving away this limited edition shirt so in the first hundred orders we're tossing in a free shirt in the first 100 orders so you're giving away this item and people are like I want to get that item for free that's all they care about they don't care about the cost associated to the shirt they just see a free shirt they can care less about the cost associated with it so this makes it super powerful and you can run a giveaway because you want to win the free shirt or you want to get a free shirt and you're getting people to purchase from you so you're making money back from it now another way to do a giveaway is actually doing a giveaway to your existing customers because what happens is is when you run a giveaway you again you attract a lot of low quality people but what if you do a giveaway to your existing customers and do something in terms of hey refer our business share our business with a few of your friends and that's how you enter you know here's how you refer people share comment like etc so do the typical thing but you're gearing it and you're aiming it to your existing customers so that way your existing customers people that's already purchased from your business has spent a bunch of money with your business is sharing and talking really good about your product and likely even sharing some ugc that you could possibly use for advertising obviously once you request access to use it so that's another way to do it go about it we're going to give away to your existing customers giveaways competitions and stuff and it also in turns it in return it builds up a strong relationship with your business with your existing customers because they they just that you know engaging with your brand in a different way and you know being top of mind and like hey i want to win this competition i want to win this giveaway and further investment and building up that cognitive you know um space in their mind around your business and building up that that continuing relationship and in exchange it's going to build a stronger closer brand image with them and you know build more brand advocates for your business that's another way to run a giveaway run to your existing customers use emails sms and all that to enter and that's how you do it but i think the biggest takeaways from this video is do some type of thing where you know a giveaway where it's a random gift with random purchases so all month long we're giving out random gifts hey this week we're giving out this you know bose headphones right here we're gonna just toss them in one random order this week so if you purchase this week we're giving away a free pair of headphones in one of these packages 300 value maybe you do a giveaway to your existing customers get your existing customers to share good faith and good value and good talking about your brand in exchange for entries into a giveaway and again it's a lot more effective that way because you're using existing customers maybe it's a giveaway of to your existing customers with hey post a picture of an instagram tagging us wearing your product or using our product and we're going to give away one lucky winner a free 500 gift card so you're gonna get a ton of ugc from it because what we're gonna do is we're going to give them a performant action for us in exchange we're gonna give them some money for it and again we're gonna pick one lucky person so we're getting something from it we're making performant action first and you can gauge these actions i i say like comment and share very low making a purchase very high and i would even say like comment share low right here purchase in the middle and then high would be actually like taking a picture taking a video using the product and posting it online because they have to really take some time out there day to do that and then email like give me your email or sms like somewhere between purchase and like share comments so make people perform higher actions to get a better possible reward now the last thing i just want to touch on is if you keep doing giveaways for free you keep attracting the wrong type of customers and stuff like that and this is this is assuming you're still using the original the hey just like share and comment on this post to get some entries if you keep doing that over and over what's gonna happen is you're gonna build a big following of people just wanting to do competitions that's the giveaway and you're gonna actually you're gonna build up a lot of people just here for the giveaway so with that you you definitely don't want to you know go that route and it has been you know beneficial for some smaller businesses to do this route but longer term you know medium to longer term once you start getting some growth and stuff you definitely want to focus on the bigger picture and doing some of these other giveaways where people take a react you know have a react um take an action first before they potentially get an award so hope this video
