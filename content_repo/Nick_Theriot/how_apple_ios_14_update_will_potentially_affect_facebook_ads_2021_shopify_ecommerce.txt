yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have a special new video I'm finally gonna release my response to the iOS 14 update wow 2020 was an absolutely crazy year and the CEO of Apple released a statement at the end of the year that completely shook things up for advertisers in this space so with that being said let's jump into it and before we get started make sure you hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new news around the iOS 14 update I'm gonna try to be as transparent as possible and keep you guys updated on this channel as well as to be geared towards my clients as well for my agency so that being said let's get started so if you're new to the channel again my name is Nick Theriault the CEO and founder of Terra Solutions LLC our e-com growth agency just in 2020 alone we've managed over a million dollars in ad spend across Facebook Google and YouTube so on December 17th of 2020 Tim Cook the CEO of Apple released a statement that completely shook up the industry we believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it's used Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before app tracking transparency in iOS 14 would just require that they ask for your permission first so now if you're on Facebook and you click on add to go to website when you land on that website this is what's going to pop up allow Facebook to track your activity across other companies apps and website acts out not to track or allow which will pretty much put a wall between whether or not a advertiser can track your actions on that website so how will this affect me you're likely here because you're a media buyer you're a business owner you're a marketing manager you're trying to get more information alongside of this iOS 14 so before we can actually dive into showing you how it'll affect you we need to understand how things work so this is Stacy right here Stacy is on Facebook right now and while she's on Facebook she's browsing and she sees a shoe ad an ad for a pair of shoes she clicks on it and she goes to the website for the shoes now when she gets to that website Facebook's gonna send the rover and it's gonna also forward over some information such as like the click ID which is like your unique ID for that specific ad she clicked on and also a little bit information about her and that's in your ad account and all that and forwards it over to the website as well when she gets to the website all that information over like said is transferred over she gets to the website and immediately cookies are sent as was called it's downloaded onto her phone and then also to these cookies houses your pixel which establishes a communication link between Facebook and those cookies which again tracks all the activity on her phone while she's on that particular website so this is how we get analytics and stuff inside the ads manager on Facebook or Google or Pinterest or Snapchat etc on the people who view the website at the cart purchase etc now let's put this in a better example she's on the website she adds something to the cart but she doesn't check out those cookies again sends all that information back to Facebook because we established that communication link so those cookies sends all that information back to Facebook saying hey Stacy view x y and z products she didn't check out but she did add to cart so now an advertiser can go ahead and retarget her with a you know view content at cart campaign excluding initiate checkouts and excluding purchases and we can provide some very highly targeted personalized ads to her timeline now cookies will also eventually become obsolete as 2022 google is predicting that there will be no more cookies in google chrome and behind every website there is a server that hosts the website all the information on the website and the users information so a lot of big tech Facebook Snapchat Google YouTube all those are moving over to a conversions API on the server side where it's still a pixel it's still tracking the information but instead of having cookies Facebook just sends people to a browser and a server in the background that's hosting that website is tracking all that information and they're talking together and then that server sends that because of that communication link we opened up by installing that tag on the server sends it back to Facebook now not to confuse you and all that don't want to go too techy in this I'm trying to keep this as minimal as possible in terms of text to get straight down to the details how does ATT affect this it's a big question so now when someone gets on the website those cookies are installed on their phone they're still going to be installed they're still going to track everything that person does on your website but the problem is when those cookies are installed and they're going to track your information you can get a little prompt up on the website on the app allow to track or do not allow and depending on this response while you're on your phone on your iOS 14 phone again because it's just iOS 14 it's not Android it's not desktop it's just iOS 14 on the phone depending depending on that response it's whether or not those cookies are going to send that data back to Facebook so again those cookies is a communication link if they say do not track those cookies are going to have that information and that's it you'll never be able to get access to it there's no way to like set up any type of background thing and like you know oh we can just set up some type of weird you know system you know to just do it in the background process like that no there's there's nothing you can do like straight up those that communication link will not be able to contact Facebook and you will not get that data and someone makes a purchase that will not be reported at all someone adds cart that will not be reported someone views your product no but not be reported all you'll see is a link click because that's on Facebook side and same thing for server side so Facebook sends you know someone to your website they get that they get that little prompt up saying hey a lot of track they say yeah they can track so server will send that data back to Facebook they say no server will not send that information back to Facebook and this is not just Facebook just to be clear guys this is also YouTube this is Snapchat this is Instagram this is Pinterest this is Google this is TikTok this is everything all of these platforms we use we spend money on Google Analytics all that stuff that that loads information to track you and for everything you do and to be able to remarket to you have some good analytics all that stuff that's all going to become potentially not obsolete but it's gonna be affected by this so now how will this affect me that's why you're here that's why you clicked on this is because you want to understand how this will affect me how this will affect my ad performance and everything so Facebook released this helpful article just after Apple released that statement and let's dive into it so the first things is that we're gonna have less of a retargeting pool so right now this might be your current retargeting pool the amount of people you can retarget right now that you know went to your website took some actions on your website and then in the future you have a lot smaller of a retargeting pool because because there will be less people in it now the next thing is right now the algorithm optimizes based off the people that purchase and the pixel sends that data back to Facebook and the algorithm can optimize on the right type of people this is why broad targeting works really effective but now after this update there's gonna be less effective broad targeting because the pixels gonna have a harder time understanding who your ideal consumer is now the next thing is a conversion events per domain so for example if you run a Shopify e-commerce store you're likely gonna be pretty much fine but if you run your pixel up through a click funnels or some type of sales funnel where you have multiple different events or you run a sales funnel plus you run a Shopify e-commerce store all in that one domain you're gonna have some issues because you can only optimize for eight events and I'll get to you I'll get to you that in one second on top of that there's no more cross domain tracking so for example if you have a domain that's like CA for Canada dot you know terror solutions dot com that's a domain and then USA dot terror solutions dot com that's a domain or if you have you know multiple different stores all using the same pixel obviously those are all different domains so this is really gonna affect the structure of some companies in terms of how they have their different websites set up for different countries and it's also gonna affect the people that are just trying to like you know they have a really kick-ass store they've optimized a lot of great data on it and now they want to use some of that data to get a few other stores going so that's really gonna affect those people there's no more of this where you know users can go to any one of those domains that has that that share that one pixel and then that pixel will track them all there's no more of that then also to eight events per domain and Facebook is going to pick the eight events that work best for your domain that they think work best so again if you have a lot of different events you're gonna have to really tone those down it's only like 80 ones but this is what the standard ones look like for like your typical Shopify store so you shouldn't have any issues if you have these set up right here you're going to be okay in terms of you know having to cut out some events from your sales funnel now reporting limitations this is going to be the biggest one because it's going to be a lot harder to make decisions based off the data Facebook is giving us because there's going to be less data we're going to see lower ROAS inside of the ads manager we're going to see less purchases we're going to see more data discrepancy it's just going to cause for you the media buyer you the business owner you the CEO to make decisions on how much more should we spend you know what campaigns are performing the best how can we double down how can we spend more to maximize conversions right now that's going to be a big issue because we won't have some of that data we're going to see delayed reporting estimating that we could see delayed reporting up to three days and we're also going to start seeing more web conversion events that we reported based on the time the conversion occurs and not the time of the associated ad impression estimated results this is a big one so Facebook wants to kind of work with this and help us out because they're going to understand that they're going to be receiving less data so it's going to be harder for us to make decisions on what to spend and how much more to spend and what to scale up so they want to help us by offering statistical modeling to help out showing results and stuff for ad sets and ad levels statistical modeling is assuming data based off mathematical models next thing there's no support for breakdowns so right now you can break down campaigns by age gender region and placement and right now you can still do that after this update but the problem is we won't be able to see it for the web conversions the view content that's card to check out the booked call etc and then again there's going to be a account attribution window change so right now it's like a up to 28 day clicker view and it's going to be limited now to a seven day click so that basically means that once someone clicks on your ads one of your ads they have up to seven days to make a purchase for it to be attributed to your account if not if they make that purchase outside that seven day window it just that's it it doesn't mean it doesn't attribute to back to Facebook for some of you guys you heavy rely on this because you'll see your seven day if you look at your data right now they last seven days it's gonna be pretty poor then you'll look at your data between the seven a 14 day window and it's a lot higher than it was seven days ago because you have a longer kind of attribution window so this is more common of some of your higher ticket products maybe $150 us plus where it's a little bit more longer of a buying cycle now quick overview of all the issues we're going to run into we're going to see smaller retargeting audiences we're going to see less conversions reported by Facebook so there'll be less data reported inside of Facebook ads itself we're going to see a less optimized algorithm so poor performance harder to go broad we have to really focus on kind of narrowing down those interests and again that's going to be more of a case study we're going to start developing and testing to see what works best now under this new normal also it's going to be a lot harder to make decisions on what's working it's gonna be a lot harder for advertising agencies to report to the ceo or the marketing manager and stuff like that of hey this is how much we spent this is how much revenue we generate it and then they look at the Shopify and it's like way more so they don't know you know what how much more can we spend it's gonna we have to start really digging deeper into that type of things now there's to be no more conversions reported outside of a seven day window and again that's a click and use one domain per pixel and only eight events per domain now the big variable because there is a big variable right here that has been presented how many people will opt in versus opt out because you see if 90% of people opt in and only 10% of people opt out we're only going to see a very small impact very very small but if we have 90% of people opt out only 10% of people opt in to this little tracking att then that's going to be a huge issue and we can't really predict that just yet because we haven't really experienced it yet so we don't really know until we actually start to see the data and it may be different per brand so that's all going to be issues right there but we've had this in the past though we've actually already experienced this type of update i'm hoping this kind of brings some rings and bells if you're in the usa and only ever advertised in the usa and only have usa clientele and maybe canada clientele you might have never seen this before but by now i'm hoping you've probably seen this before this is the general data protection regulation gdpr which is enforced in the eu area the european areas and basically what happens is when you land on someone's website this is what pops up we value privacy preferences and users can basically dictate whether or not they can be tracked or not and this is exactly what att is and there was only a small performance drop in the gdpr update compared to well we don't really know what att is going to do but there's only a small performance drop so does this give us a little bit of insight of what should we expect maybe it's not going to just you know sky falling everything's gonna hit the fan maybe it's just a small bit of adaptation period changing a few things in the business and we're gonna be just fine so what can i do what can i do to secure my foundation of my business secure the foundation of my clients secure the foundation of my results on facebook and still be profitable and still you know move forward with everything number one verify your domain i just recently released a video on this it's super easy to do but it just helps with verifying your domain inside the business manager is an absolute must you have to do this because this basically tells facebook here's the domain i want to use and again you're only allowed one domain per pixel so here's the domain i want to use you verify it and facebook holds it very credible server side integration and tagging uh set it up through conversions api again a lot of people are moving towards this cookies will become eventually obsolete this is also showing a very very very high match rate and is a must do this now before you do anything else do this now verify your domain set up your server side tag because this is things you can do absolutely right now you also too if you do have more than eight conversion events again if you own a shopify store and just use that one shopify store just with that one domain just with that one pixel you don't need to really worry about this but if you have like a click funnels or maybe you have multiple domains because of different language barriers that's where you're going to really need to plan out these eight conversion events you also need to figure out your conversion window on a seven day window a 14 day window and a 28 day window because if you notice that your seven day results are always okay but you see most of your profit between a seven a 14 day window after it updates then you know that's going to be a factor here because you're not going to see that anymore you're not going to see that lift an account row as over time so you need to figure out what percentage drop and what row as you need is a new row as you need hit on a day today to understand what it looks like on a seven day window and a 14 and a 28 day window less dynamic ads so right now I run a lot of like catalog sales ads that are completely personalized based off what people feel on the website or just a regular straight dynamic ad that's you know loading in images loading in text Facebook's have less data now to understand what works so it's gonna be harder to really like optimize and I have a killer case study I'm about to release on this so I'm still gonna release it but again this will probably be an issue because Facebook will update it and optimize in real time causing it for being less effective start doing more list building I literally after every time something big like this happens they always default answers build more of a list we're seeing anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of revenue per month for our clients especially after they've been advertising over a year come from their email list so if you're not building an email us double down on it focus on building up that email list while on the side of taking all these other actions because this is the thing that you're gonna own you're gonna own all this data you're gonna own all those emails years to years to come and then you always will be able to remarket back to those people and you know let's say for example all of your paid advertising got shut off how can you still be able to run your business purely off just your list more influencer marketing influencer marketing works great go to a hyper-targeted niche or hyper-targeted influencer that's specifically to your niche go through all their engagement go through all that make sure using influencers really helps out with bringing your ideal customers specifically your ideal customers to your business more video ads so video ads are highly effective because you can actually retarget people based off the amount of time they watched on a video so as I'm aware as of now this is still compliant with everything and people will not you know getting a little notification saying hey can this person track you when they're watching a video on Facebook because these are purely engagement audiences and these are still compliant with everything it's just everything that happens outside of the app so what you can do right here is you can run a top of funnel ad someone doesn't click on the website you can retarget them through video ad and then you can start building up a sequence of video videos that all retarget each other to walk people through to sell cycle and have a very highly profitable strategy around this works amazing start focusing on overall row as how much you're spending per month how much revenue are you getting back in Shopify those two numbers do not lie the amount you spent and the amount you received in terms of Shopify revenue those numbers do not lie if you spent a hundred thousand dollars last month and you made back three hundred thousand dollars in Shopify slowly keep raising that budget and really figuring out what specific variables are driving that as the best ability you can overview iOS 14 require permission for your companies to track their users less that'll be captured based off the percentage of people who opt out less data algorithm receives equals performance drop less data will be reported back on campaign performance which will make it a lot harder for advertisers business owners to make calibrated decisions on where to spend more money at you need to verify your domain you need to set up server-side conversions API focus on overall robust Shopify revenue divided by total ad spend focus on other strategies that you can add to your brand that don't require on reporting and stuff so influencer marketing community building that's one thing I forgot to add to this build up community build up a list build up more audiences that's free to market to on top of your advertising I'm not saying steer completely away from paid advertising but build up these communities and stuff like that on the side of this so that way you can continue to prosper if any of your paid ad strategies turn off be up to date on trends and news around iOS 14 I'll leave you guys a few resources to learn a little bit more around this first things first is talk
