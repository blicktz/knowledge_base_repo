yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys i'm going to show you how we did 150 000 in revenue by focusing on three core concepts with our ad creatives and i'm actually going to show you the ad creative we use to generate this amount of revenue so before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button if you're new to the channel i post new videos every other day just like this one so with that being said let's get started so jumping into this video like i said i'm gonna show you the creative we actually use which i don't think anyone else has done yet on youtube unless i live in a rock which is most likely because i'm stuck in here just cranking out ads every day but i'm going to show you the creative we use and i really want to do this as an example because i'll talk a lot about creatives on here and i don't want over complicated for people i don't people think you have to like you know be in a science lab and like pouring chemicals together with like a lab coat on to like create these creatives at work but at the same time i don't want you to be a chad and just take any random picture of your product throw it online and think that's going to do amazing so you have to have some strategic side with your creatives and this is exactly i'm going to show you in this video so let's jump into it right here you can see this is just me kind of like you know pulling together a few creatives that we really use to grow this product so this is the six creatives we had you know variety of different ad sets right here we spent about 61 000 and this was all last year we run these ads and we made back 158 000 in revenue so we go inside the uh shopify we literally grossed 147 000 about 2 000 in discounts and returns made about 145 000 in revenue now i did have a few different listings for this particular product so the revenue is actually a lot more in shopify but i just selected this one particular product so but just to show you guys examples that this is all real not just trying to showcase some random stuff it's all real realistic stats and stuff right here for you guys so even doing a little little page refresh so this particular product has around a 1.7 break even roas so it wasn't a crazy profitable product but we did generate about 2400 new customers to our list our email list and everything which we have a really good lifetime value with this with this particular brand right here so we can really focus on the longer term you know a lot of e-commerce marketers they focus on the first sale and you do have to be profitable in the first seller or you know it's beneficial to be profitable in the first sale but also too you really need to understand and focus on the lifetime value of these customers so that way you can afford to spend more really aggressively afford a little bit lower results on the front end but you know you have that confidence you'll make that back tenfold by having that lifetime value set in place and have a really good customer retention program so with all that being said let's get started let's let's dive into the creative that's done so well so as you can see right here um ad copy give your loved ones something to remember it's an infinity heart sign it's a metal sign that is custom cuts people put in their names and stuff and that's actually ground zero right there having a great product people want you have to have a good product like you just cannot stress this enough you can't scale the bad product like you know people come up to me and they've never spent a dime on facebook ads and i want to say and they want to be like hey i want to spend a few thousand dollars promoting this t-shirt right here and we start spending a little bit money and just it's not working because just the t-shirts are designed no one wants and they're like well what's going on you know you suck your ads suck or vice versa my ads suck because i can't sell this t-shirt when reality you know that's why we like to work with brands already running ads and it's already had proven success we come in and just turbo charge it because we understand that if you have a bad product it's just no one wants it you can't polish it up you can't make people buy it you have to have a good product to scale and that was one thing with this particular product why it works so well is because we had a great and unique product people want it now let's look at the creative let's show you guys the creative right here so slideshow video a few pictures that we all tested these pictures to make sure it worked before we launched variety of pictures and that's it it's just it shows the product off it shows product in a few different areas it shows a couple holding it happy it shows it being you know curated like made inside of the little factory so it's showcasing everything it's showcasing everything about this particular product so if all of our credits before we go live we have three things that we must validate before we go live with them so first thing is grabbing attention we grab attention by just having these images flash across their screen different contrasts and stuff some bright some dark and just showing this interesting product this product right here does all the selling for itself you we tried it before we tried running an ad with no ad copy and seeing some good results with it so this product does all the selling for itself because it's a good product it's something that people want you know it's unique it's not something you see every day and people understand about metal cutting custom metal stuff but a lot of times they just can't find someone that can cut stuff out of metal and and ship it to them so between all of that that's what really grabbed the attention personalized metal sign give your loved one something to remember so now give your loved one something to remember is more of the the second part which is creating desire so we've tried this particular product in a multitude of different angles you know we led it with personalize your home you know a great gift for you and your husband and we tried a few different angles but the angle that worked the best for us was leveraging the aspect of hey buy this for your loved one so whether it's your boyfriend girlfriend wife husband you name it we're leveraging the aspects of your buying this for someone you know we even have grandparents buying it for their their daughters and sons and we even have you know like parents buying it for you know vice versa so it makes a really good gift and that's what we found the most success with is having that really good gift aspect of it and we're focusing on the prospect we're not focusing on ourselves we're not saying we sell the best infinity signs we're saying hey give your loved one something to remember so they're not thinking about us they're thinking about hey it's be a great gift for whatever your wife's name is or your husband's name they're thinking about that and they're putting that and they're and it's creating that desire for it i want to make her happy i want to make him happy i want to show a token or appreciation of love and that's where all this stems down to so we can effectively grab attention through ad copy creative all that stuff the product really grabs attention we can effectively create desire by the ad copy and stuff now number three is actually one we failed at for this particular product not gonna lie and we learned from our mistakes and we've applied it to all our future ads for this particular account but that is a reason to act now so a lot of people don't do this they just you know shop now which is cool it works you know you could probably get a 2.53 x ro s but that's the difference between a four to five x ro s is when there's a reason to act now i'm just gonna sit here and wait i mean there's no reason to act now but now if i say hey you know now through midnight this product is 20 off oh shit i need to buy this now you know if i have a really good you know system of excluding people quickly from this particular ad so it gives a lot of people that's just quick you know quick purchases and stuff because it's the first time seeing that they want to purchase immediately to claim that discount so right now we're leveraging a spring sale early spring spell limited capacity you know while the inventory lasts we're increasing that urgency and the reason to act now and that's something that a lot of people miss out on so that way hey i'm just gonna sit here and watch the retargeting ads and eventually i'll buy whereas if you leverage that grab attention create desire for the product and a reason act now you you have a well rounded ad and then you can get into the finer details of how you word it you know the type of creatives you use and stuff but the overall three concepts we use in every single ad and why our ads do so well is because we followed that structure right there grab attention create desire and reason act now now i like to say it we're not really creating desire we're funneling desire that the consumer already has you know our ideal audience loves their partner a lot and they're always looking to do something for them so that's a desire they have always looking for a great gift always looking for something they can do to show their appreciation of love to their partner so what we do is we're funneling that desire into our product by give your loved one something to remember so they have the desire already we're funneling it in so we're not really creating desire i like to call it i know that's what we call it create desire but it's more funneling desire you can't create a desire you know if we're going after someone and they absolutely hate their spouse you know they do not want anything to do with them they don't love them anything like that and we put this ad in front of them it's not going to magically oh i love them all of a sudden no they're like ah screw that and that's okay you're not trying to sell everyone you're trying to sell and get to the batch of people that will buy your product so when i audit these ad accounts and stuff a lot of times i like to look at creatives i look at the ad account structure ad account structure nine times 10 needs to be fixed but you see the thing about the ad account structure is we follow the same structure over and over for all of our ad accounts but the thing that's always changing is creative strategy how we're promoting a product how we're pushing a product because those are the things that drive results i can give you guys my ad templates i can give you guys my you know like the audience is a target i can give you the account and structure and everything and if we go head to head i'll still consistently i'll do you because i know what matters and that's creative grabbing attention creating desire in your product effectively showcasing your product effectively building the desire on your product and reason to buy it now those are the things right there is what drives that accounts those are the things right there that drives results of paid advertising and there's a lot is the thing that 99 of advertisers miss out on so that's why some people can crush it and you can steal their exact audiences and everything and you do it and you you won't do it some people you can literally go copy their product but you don't you miss out the whole key of how they're promoting it and you can take this product you can do yourself and you can promote it as hey get this and put this above your computer it's a great thing to put on your wall above your computer it's like i don't want that right now so go in your ad account right now figuring out how you can fix and leverage some of the stuff you got going on now and leveraging some
