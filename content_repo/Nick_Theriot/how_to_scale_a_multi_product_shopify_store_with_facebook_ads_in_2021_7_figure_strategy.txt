yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I have an exciting new video for you guys we'll be going into how to scale a multi-product store so before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day just like this one so let's get started guys okay so I've been getting a lot of questions on how exactly to scale a multi-product store so I completely understand you have a lot of products on your site and you know with structuring a specific like account structure on your Facebook ads where you do a top of funnel campaign middle of funnel campaign a bottom of funnel campaign and then a past purchases campaign it's very hard to figure out exactly you know do I create a hundred different top of funnel campaigns and a hundred different middle funnel campaigns you know one per product so it's really hard to figure out how exactly to structure your ad account and I completely understand I've been there before and I've really realized through this that I've been too close to the problem and it's hard for me to really widen my perspective so this video is going to do just that it's going to widen your perspective a little bit about having a multi-product store and the best way to scale one so the first thing you get to realize is Facebook ads is all about acquiring customers at good cost and having a system in the back end to nurture those customers to where you're not completely reliant just on Facebook ads so what you want to do is you want to really focus on okay what products are selling best right now with Facebook ads what is my best sellers with Facebook ads specifically so this way you're starting to realize okay hey with these few products we're crushing in a top of funnel and let's just focus on those few products stop forcing and trying to stress out to get these other products that are not selling to sell at top of funnel or middle funnel or bottom of funnel with Facebook ads focus on getting customers in with those few products and you're going to lead with your best sellers so instead of trying to stress really hard hey I need to have all of these products promoted top of funnel okay let's focus on what's working best and let's focus on keeping those products and stocked focusing on creating new angles getting more content with it getting more creatives and stuff like that so that way we can keep it fresh for the algorithms because if you just keep running the same ad over and over you're going to run into ad fatigue and then your whole account's going to start you know coming down so focus on those three four products some people it's one product some people it's two products some people it's 10 products focus on those products and really push them at top of funnel on Facebook ads and keep scaling your business if you're running low on inventory order more products and what's going to do is it's going to really allow you to scale really hard really fast because they're they're hot products they work really well you're going to acquire customers at good cost because you're going to you know you're going off their top of funnel going out there people who've never heard of your brand and you want to focus on just getting customers to your brand acquiring those customers into your brand now once you've done that now it's all about okay what do i do with these customers so i've built up a list of a few thousand customers they've always purchased for me i was profitable the front end but if you just let that with live if you just let that list sit there and do nothing it's when it becomes unprofitable so because that list just sits there you don't do anything to those customers and those customers purchase once you have a lifetime value of just your initial purchase and that's it so now what you want to focus on is your customer retention your customer frequency getting customers to purchase more from you and when you start to focus on that you're going to need products to position in front of these customers these existing customers and where you're going to get those products it's the other products on your store so start positioning those products in front of your existing customers use email lists use loyalty programs use you know bundle and save type things to where if someone comes and purchase this they also you'll get this and save run sales and exclusive offers to your existing customers run facebook ad campaigns you do tiktok campaigns and all that to your existing customers so that way you're getting them to purchase more and your customer frequency if it's something that you've never focused on may go from like a 1.2 all the way to 2 to 3x and then you're going to start focusing on the higher level picture that hey i'm simply using these paid advertising tools to get new people into the brand i care less what they purchase just they're purchasing something we either break even up front or we have a little bit of profit up front but that's totally okay for the first sale you know if you look at a grocery store and a grocery store they offer like you know 100 to 200 dollars in free gas if you sign up for their credit card or their loyalty program like what the hell you know but the cost the grocery store is not looking at that that 50 bucks you spent that day they're looking at the next year of you coming back to that store every single day i know for me i'll spend 50 a week at my grocery store and if they give me 100 of free gas my first sale you know for their for my first buy with them imagine the next 52 weeks the next year's worth of me coming back and spending 50 bucks every day at their store or every week at their store they look they're looking the next few years because they know that as long as they keep a good service i'm not going to switch grocery stores like crazy i'm going to keep coming back i mean my parents been going to the same grocery store the last five six years so imagine that with your brand you know getting customers in at good cost focusing on those few best sellers to really get customers in and that way you can scale really aggressively and if you start running low on products simply just put more product into your store more inventory store not necessarily the product but you know you have three or four best sellers keep that inventory full keep buying more inventory and that way you can scale aggressively and if it's a seasonal thing then you know say if you're running clothing brand and it's a seasonal thing whereas you know you only have these pants in once a year then figure out how to have a year-long season you know you yes you can do your seasonal drops but also have a few products you keep in year-round these are called evergreen products these products excel consistently over and over and allows you to keep acquiring customers and then then focus on increasing customer frequency how to keep getting them in more to purchase more well we have other products you know if you're a seasonal clothing brand you were going to rely purely on this type of structure you'll have a few of your evergreen products that you keep pushing every day you can scale scale scale scale and then you have your drops well every time we drop we hype up the customer list we hype up our email list and stuff and we get people to keep coming back and purchase more clothing brands have some of the highest customer frequencies and if you're a one product shop you know for example laser hair removal or you know you sell gaming chairs where your customers are coming to purchase a gaming chair they're not going to come back and purchase a new gaming chair every season or every month but what you can do is is you can create more products that go around that so for example a gaming chair that's their first purchase then the second purchase is maybe a headrest a better headrest you know maybe your original one doesn't have it and this now you have a cut head rest you can put on maybe instead of a you know a gaming chair or instead of a headrest you can go in and you know have an led kit that you know hooks up to the chair and stuff like that to where you know it's an upsell it's a 200 and that's another thing a customer can come and purchase so a customer can purchase a few hundred dollars more parts and stuff like that upgrade the chair then you know you're scaling aggressively you're doing hundreds of five hundred thousand dollars a month revenue what else can we launch that fits around that gaming chair well we can launch a new line yes but that wasn't really don't want to really supplement you know new customers or existing customers but what about other parts inside of their gaming you know ecosystem so a better desk you know a better mic you know just different things and products and stuff you can circulate around their initial purchase to get them to purchase more so there's a lot of strategy that's involved it's a lot of thinking time that's involved and you really got to think about the customer and what other stuff you can give them because they want to purchase from you they had a great experience which you did really a lot of work to get them to come and purchase from you once they want to purchase from you again and it's 10 times more likely an existing customer will purchase from you versus a new customer a new customer it's not going to purchase from you the same way an existing customer well existing customer is 10 times more likely to purchase from you versus an existing customer and some people have a limiting belief because they work so hard they got this customer you they send their product and stuff and some people have this limiting belief and i think it just comes around of you know if they're they're starting out you know they don't only have a lot of money you know with their shopify stores i'm talking about shopify owner right now they don't only have a lot of money they they work their hard they're they're breaking even them off so they have a scarcity mindset right now and if they have a scarcity mindset they reflect that view on their customers so if they're thinking hey i'm barely affording gas this week they're thinking their customers are going to purchase their product and they're also struggling in that same situation which is not the case and when you're constantly thinking about that it's going to prevent you from increasing your prices it's going to prevent you from adding other options you know at the checkout so they can increase aov it's going to prevent you from hey you know purchase once from that brand you know that i might not i'm likely not gonna have enough money so that way when we drop other products that they're not gonna purchase from them again because they're thinking their customers in that same mindset too and that's not the case customers want to purchase from you again so lead with your best sellers keep those in stock keep focusing on those and how we can really scale those really high influencers facebook ads all that good stuff really push that hard and really focus on those inventory levels and stuff like that and over time you might have more and more best sellers you can add to that list and going back to like the facebook account structure what i'd simply do is have my creative testing campaign my audience testing campaign and they'll have my scaling campaign that's it three campaigns for you know maybe a few hundred products in a store and i just keep adding you know so like for example we have best you know our best creatives going our scaling campaign our best audiences all our best stuff going that scaling campaign and what we do is is we might have three creatives in that scaling campaign and each one may be a different product because those are our three best sellers they're performing really well across the ad account let's just put those together and then we'll let facebook decide you know hey which one gets all the spend so that's a few different ways to where you can really hammer down and scale your e-commerce brand this is something that i i you know it took me almost a year to realize this i'm not gonna lie it took me a while to realize this and i've realized that when you start viewing this from the perspective of we're just acquiring customers with facebook ads that's it that's all we're focusing on and we have retention programs in the back to maximize profit that's how you build a dollar e-commerce brand that's how you're gonna build a brand that completely revolutionizes you know the industry and everything of how you build and all that stuff so hope this video is helpful guys and it knows a lot just sit down and talk and just kind of want to bring you guys some value and stuff some strategy and everything and a little bit more strategy intense because you know while we can focus a lot on the other stuff like audience overlaps and you know better creatives and stuff there's some stuff that we just need to look from a different perspective of higher perspective and that's what this video is for so if you're an e-commerce brand owner and you're spending at least a thousand dollars a day in paid advertising and would like help on scaling further
